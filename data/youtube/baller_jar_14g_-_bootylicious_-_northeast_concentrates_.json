it's just got done prepping for another hash wash damn it getting cold in here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104 grant or 100 Ford's a hundred grams now mixed strain hash frothing some cookies some sweet cream some zukie and what else sweet cream cookie sweet cream zoo keys and orange cookies that's what it is [Music] sorry I had someone from work pop-up I don't look out real quick [Music] all right cool [Music] anyways let's go ahead oh it's so good yeah I need to go ahead and fill up a little bit char with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo my tears my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] oh man the big dads always get my nose my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] about three days away from the harvest yeah we're on day 54 honestly I think I could pull them down tomorrow or the next day I want it probably gonna go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45 and help the wife for the day because that's the way it is [Music] I find on finishing of the loose jars oh that's the one section of illustrator [Music] this is it makes a great Cosby and Kush cake [Music] I don't know what I did mother two minutes [Music] okay a little poison for 30 minutes okay no accident since a wait okay I'll be in by say like 3:45 okay okay [Music] 59 seconds left [Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted positive and he's more paper towels real quick cuz my house got so high I forgot to clean the [ __ ] banger after the last job that's [ __ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with

i'm oh i'm i'm just so happy with this purchase i don't like i said i don't buy their products often and it's not because of the quality it's strictly because of the price and i'm a boy on a budget so it is what it is but when you can get it for the right price hundred percent worth it at all cost every time i get their sand whenever i can usually however this time i did pass up the sand because i bought this that's how much i wanted to try this stuff and as good as it is i'm so glad i got three and a half great jar oh yeah it's not very often i can truly stock up so i'm grateful it's so smooth

"don't you hate it when you can't scrape all the hash out of your little stupid container there's a dab left in here but I can't even scoop it out not with this thing anyways but I'm about to show you a super easy way to get every last bit of hash out of every one of your containers this is gonna save you so many doubts right now on the stream answers to all the questions you've ever had about weed what's up i'm matt welcome back to the strange show this is a channel for adults and patients where i answer all the questions you've ever had about weeds you don't know how many of these little containers like this or maybe even worse the even smaller ones like this that i've thrown away that still have some hash inside of them a long time ago i never knew how to get the last dab or two out of these things and it would drive me crazy until i learned how to make a turn to tell me Tyler showed me this so shout out to Tyler thank you buddy this saved my life all three of these containers are pretty much empty I can't get any more on my stick but after we make our Terp tube we're gonna have a few dabs of these guys so super easy you really don't need a couple things first get all your containers that you have that still have just a little bit of hash in them then we're gonna need a drinking straw a pair of scissors and you probably already have your torch handy but we might not even need this first just cut off a few inches of your straw just make sure the piece you cut off is at least a few inches long now we're gonna take the piece that we cut off we're gonna cut a really steep angle on one side of the straw like this now that we've cut at this really steep angle we're gonna cut the pointy side off right there so it's nice and flat on the front and it looks like a little shovel now we have a very flexible tool to scrape our container with and it's hollow and you're gonna see why that's important in just a second but look how good it scrapes this out I mean it gets every drop there's nothing left in this that looks brand-new now and I can do that to all of these I could go around the house and find any of these I might have and try this and it even works in these little tiny ones because the Turk tube is so flexible that it just bends to any shape you smush it to so if your hash isn't as wet is these are if it's too hard to scrape with your turkey that's when your torch is gonna come in now if you have a hairdryer laying around I'd probably use the hairdryer first but you're probably like me and you're sitting here it's all your dabbing stuff in front of you and I don't have a hairdryer in front of me - dad what so I'm gonna use a torch so just take your torch and just barely wand it over your hash container and just gently heat it up just ever so slightly then it should be a little more runny and wet and pliable and you can do that with your torch or a blow-dryer or whatever you could probably just put in your pocket for now or anything to make it warm now all our containers are clean and our Terk tube is full of past but it's way down in the tube how are we supposed to give to this out this is why it's good for it to be held just take your scissors and cut right up the middle of your straw now you can get your dab tool and to scoop it right out of it and now we got a big bat dam out of an otherwise empty container now that's tight that's the success Terp - yo buddy don't forget to subscribe for good vibes and I got nuggets of knowledge cuz when you watch the stream show it's like going to weed College [Music]", "5VtO5QZKo58":

da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "8t9CY2PyGK0": "all right peace and riot cannabis academy we are here we're doing a little concentrates 101 vapes and dabs i'm excited about this one you got to kind of put those together because in reality what's inside the little cartridge that you get as there's concentrated you can buy them you know i think in half grams grams at dispensaries and things like that is a concentrate yep i mean we've broken one early on in our and we'll get into that there's a lot of times everything from um is the most basic kind you know make sure that you're subscribed and you have notifications on um by doing that you'll get all the kind of cannabis academy updates at least i mean we've gone over almost all the basics now we'll start getting into guests guest speakers stuff on cbd i mean just all kinds of great things on it um i have to take this down just seeing a little thing on the corner of my eye yeah i'm like oh my eyes [ __ ] it's still bothering me like i could like i've been looking forward to getting into this one since we've been doing yeah academy because i i have a big huge debt so what it is is for everyone that doesn't know because we do forget sometimes it because we do this all the time and it's something we medicate on first of all we're not telling anybody to go and do drugs we're not advocating the sale illegally or anything we're talking about something that is recreational and medical legal here and we both have cards anyways prior to the legality so but we're just saying um this is wax crumble shatter dabs i mean really you can go on and on i'm just trying to associate the names that people might have heard how these things are all made the different levels of them that's that's that's weird [ __ ] man that's i go i'm way more into that one i want the one over there and like which one's strong i want that one yeah yeah how much oh that one's only thirteen yeah no no no no no go up go up higher tier diamonds not yeah you're definitely here i you're definitely a top shelf shopper i'll give you that one i like yeah yeah i like to have once you start really nailing in you know we'll get into that here in just a second the the really terpy profiles you enjoy it's really hard to avoid that and so when you want to get to those specifics you end up having to aim at that time and the terps are for like the land i'll give everyone the layman because i mean yeah i tell you what for everything everything i get into detail-wise you can just jump in with the lavender that is the flavor on the back of your tongue and the nasally like piney look there's a hundred different kinds of terpenes and it's any group of hydrocarbons that produce a certain type of flavor and different different terpenes not only deliver different flavors but different smells different effects and and so you it touches the back your nose some of the famous ones for those of you that are like well what's the term i don't even heard of terpenes before you haven't haven't you didn't even know it sometimes it's in the name of the strain you're smoking if it's lemon og it probably has a lot of the limo lean terpene in it which has that sort of lemon and a citrus flavor and smell to it and that's where you get that that terpene versus taste profile um so concentrate's been around forever yep forever so as far back as as um uh 10 000 bc in china they found um a hash keef mixture which was believed that they would take a bunch of sticky sticky wheat i had a 1990s cali they would take a bunch of sticky sticky weed and they would take a bunch of the keef and they would coat their hands and keef and then they would just rub the sticky sticky buds between their hands like this to all the trichomes would stick with the keef and get this layer of this sticky trichomes um the the trichomes are the sticky little parts and i'll get into that again in a minute too but it's the outside of the bud and that's where you're going to get a lot of the thc content and keef is usually what's in the bottom of a multiple stage grinder it's all the dried parts of that that's fallen off and it's the little crystals that have fallen off and the little hairs that have fallen off of the weed and so that keef is technically a concentrate in and of itself said grinder sorry that keep pretending to concentrate in and of itself but still i wrote it down but they would make that also there and so this this this hashish is is the first you know oldest form of the of concentrates it's been around for a while it's not a new thing but using science and technology we've really sort of perfected it and got into different options with it i actually early on in my years of smoking weed ran into concentrates something called hunting oil back in and so and they often call it co2 oil now they used to just take a normal cigarette and just roll it in this oil and then you would just and it was thc oil that's all it was uh basically they were like making butter for edibles instead using an oil like basically co2 oil is used by using co2 and pressure and and you can then squeeze basically out you can as if you're it's a reverse vacuum you know so instead of going into space where there is no air and then something explodes you're basically using pressure to squeeze out and i remember smoking being like what did he give us and he was like it's just it's just cheese he was like no i would never but but it's pure thc oil and if you're not used to that you're [ __ ] up now i was smoking flower that looked like it came over between rocks now there's too many two main kinds of concentrates and that's solvent and and solvent less or non-solvent solvent means you use you use something or usually a liquid but it can be a gas like co2 you use something to separate the the thc from the weed plant if you use something besides water pressure or heat then it's solvent-based if you use propane butane co2 alcohol like rick sampson oil rsoll super famous been around for a long time it's what they give the the little girls with cancer to give them to stop having seizures if they're epileptic you know it's rso oil we've done we have to be honest you can you can dab our soil you know it will puncture it in the face it will absolutely puncture the face now here's how they do rso oil we're not going to break down into how they do each and every one we'll save that for the more in-depth episodes but just to throw it out there how a solvent one works rso oil is a solvent-based um concentrate and this uh well what they do there usually is you'll get a large mason jar and you'll fill it full of weed an ounce or so and then you put alcohol in there and and the most common one is you do something like everclear and then you close the jar on that you give it about an hour or so and you you a little bit of agitation squeeze and strain and then you take this alcohol mixture that'll be a lot darker in color caramel in color that's dumped out it's evaporated and then what's left over is now your rso oil it's hard to judge exact concentrations amounts is it back bro not only is it back it is solely flying directly into mine just messing with you that one one fly that comes around only when we record and only so the rso oil that's an idea that's an example of solving the fly i am sorry i wanted it was mocking that's all right it was looking at my face most of your solvent-based concentrates are going to be between 60 to 80 percent thc now most of your solvent lists the ones that aren't using that process contrary to popular belief are actually usually equal to or stronger than the solvent-based extracts your solvent-less ones are just the heat water pressure those real real basic ones so like um the most common is when you just take like uh just heat and press you take a little weed put it between parchment paper two hot plates squeeze them together you squeeze hard and out comes the the product right which i want to do like immediately yeah getting that breath um so when you're also looking at these concentrates and you're hearing like the percentages because like i said i i want everyone to be safe and i have to break it down for like the moment by the way if you go and you're getting the vape pens um you're not getting the same the delivery of it isn't the same as if you're superheating it through a any kind of torch or nail or anything like that it's a predetermined electronic temperature coil so you're probably getting in the 30 to 50 range of it's stronger than flour that's why i included it in concentrates you're not getting the same don't think if you are pulling on a pen all the time and that's your way of of you're getting a you're getting a preset dope and then a friend gives you a dab rig that that is going to be the same as this because it's not it's not it's danger it's danger if you think that yeah that's the difference because it's like having a pill and being able to lick the pill every time you want to hit that's your vape pen or taking a pill and crushing it down and being able to snort that sucker all at once which would be the same which would be like would you don't condone in any way shape or form drug use or abuse telling you to smoke weed or concentrate or just given information it's a it's an over exaggeration of the the difference of of extremity between the two classes um oh you got it too so the i might have said extremity oh yeah that moment yeah i didn't i stuck with the extreme no it was good but i would have i could have i saved i might even talk about it i'm just very medicated at this moment so there's the different ways of consuming the concentrates you can either put some on your weed bowl if you're gonna have a pipe that's got flour in it a lot of people will take some of the softer ones like i like like a sugar or a crumble and you can put those down because those have a lower taste so good too does it have a lower uh temperature point tastes so good but usually often even then you won't get the full release of the terpenes in there because you're not reaching that appropriate boiling point or reaching point to release that um each one that whether it's solventless um which is just like i said the heat and water which is your bubble hash your hash your keef your rosin that means you're not using anything but the heat water pressure to get those notes now that's i'm like i need i need to have okay that's okay um um but i like this a lot of the more common ones a lot of the more common ones that are able to produce a desired texture or temperature point or the ones you usually see in the dispensaries a lot more often which is your wax your shatter um your butter your diamonds let me ask you you're gonna get those for a layman like maybe a little advanced layman why is shatter the one thing that's just lesser quality what what is that like just the most basic extract or so and i don't know actually it because it goes through less of a refining process it has more overall plant source material still in there taking up space for what would other be pure thc just the basics yeah it's a really it's a not as refined level of concentration be clear if you don't have don't dab shatter either you will get just a start small and no matter what type you're going to try start with the size of a half of a grain of rice that's that's the tip okay if it's r oil not i suggest you start with the size of half of a grain of rice that's the same that's recommended by uh other people you can check with uh potguide.com i'll put a reference there so it's not me saying it i'm referencing that you according to potguide.com half a grain of rice half a grain of rice of any concentrate type if you're charting it if it's your first time trying it you start with a half a grain of rice size yeah it'll get ripped and that way because you're gonna that's a potent amount no matter what type it is if you haven't tried it yeah us it seems like a half a gram right right because i do i'm thinking about i'm like no no i remember i remember starting off when it was just a tip it could be a little bit just on the end of the tool half a grain of rice would last you three different hitting sessions yeah in the very beginning correct because in the very beginning because we used to i the first way i did it was with um collector collector with a metal chip with a metal tip and it was silicone and so you would just kind of touch it to it yeah no half a grain of rice you're going to be ripped good luck yeah so start with that no matter which way you're doing it you know always start small start safe um start with the flour i honestly would say just from experience you do that little amount but i wouldn't start on shatter you can get pretty ripped that stuff's kind of dirty sometimes i would go like a real low end like crumble batter like get a lower i mean really shatter you can get you got to be careful with crumble because sometimes if it's a really soft crumble and it falls apart really easily huge hit you'll like something like a straw yeah or or the nectar collector is working but if you're stupid inhalation little device and you go to hit that thing like all right so this is it looks like a block let me go ahead and just take this little block and you go and do that and then all of a sudden a little chunk breaks off right up the straw and the whole thing's burning on the way out your necks are collected you can get a much smarter either i would say a scoop into a good i recommend an e-nail yeah but if you especially especially if you're a beginner then hit us up find somebody with an email learn how to use an email the reason being because you preset the temperature in a device and then it it won't burn it because you know for a fact it's going to be at that certain degree it's usually a little digital handheld corded i have one cough because you're not usually burning the dab too much and the reason he says that well not don't cough there's two main types when you're doing dabbing or using a rig which is like a a bong or a water tobacco device um if you're using one of those then you usually have the buckets on the end and you preheat them with a torch or using that e-nail which which electronically you know targets a certain temperature the two ways to do it are hot dabs and cold starts hot dabs usually use titanium nails because you can get them extra hot i mastered those without meaning to master because you just started that way i used to just not knowing everything and just dump everything in get it hot drop it put a spoon or something over the hole and try to survive longer take a second hit before it cools down bubble and lay on the ground like why do people like this like and then be higher than [ __ ] for the next while and then eat a bunch and take a nap and then wake up and do it again yes and i was like this isn't that great but it's so rough on your lungs instead you start by putting the material into the nail or the bucket on the end and then you preheat it slowly from the bottom until you start to reach that desired temperature and then you can hit it just as it starts to reach that temperature and so you're getting it right as it falls in the perfect green zone that has lasers to really to tell temperatures on his bangers i have a terp laser yeah you know how i tell my temperature okay i'll show you a couple different a couple different temperature devices yeah the laser gives you like it's like a rangefinder in golf except for heat here's that one this one right here oh that goes right in the camera i wonder if that [ __ ] with him he has more too i like this one do we have to put up an epileptic warning now at the beginning for the lights and the lasers i did it like 30 times did you i think you had i have used it you absolutely have to put a warning i don't know you have to put it yeah yes think about the other people that watch our stuff for the medication information and then some of them to treat seizures and you're like shining lasers and lights i'm just saying it looks super cool it did look very cool hurt my eyes so for all of you they got to see the warning at the beginning you're welcome uh he's an [ __ ] and that's why peace and right so the other option besides the gun epileptic warnings did you show that uh it's got a i don't know it's it's all lit up there i guess it's too bright it's a laser beam i can't but it shows a digital readout of the temperature you know of of your hand or whatever it is you're shooting uh 93 degrees apparently from here it says it's not supposed to be used on human skin because it's not accurate enough um and that's why but it goes into the plus or minus 10 degrees but you're using this to read in the hundreds and you know 560 640 320. so that's that one the other one here when it plugs in the wall this and plugs into different types of ends or bangers or nails whatever i'm using in that device and this is the email temperature controller this one this one specifically has a timer that will run up and down and then you can preset the temperature and it'll hold that exact temperature for this one particularly up to 90 minutes it'll also increase your medication budget twofold because it's on all the time and you're like oh well done i might as well just put a little bit more in there oh but oh yeah but on the reverse of that i don't think it does i don't think it does much because you waste nothing none at all you get every little bit oh no when it's both of us around you you get that almost every little bit at the exact temperature but i think we're trying to one-up each other all because you can just be like hey let me get a little a little bit more in there yeah yeah no it was it's fun though it's definitely worth the investment it's um so we definitely enjoy having all the support that we've had with the cannabis academy it's important to we always you know safely imbibe because now in the places especially that it's rec legal yeah a lot of people don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing i do want to also add just as a side bonus vaping or dabbing the dabbing vapors versus consuming flour smoke you know uh if you were to smoke a blunt say versus hitting a vape pen the the chemical makeup of of the vapor versus smoke the vapor sticks to your clothing less it it's so that the stink isn't sticky versus when you're smoking out of a bowl smoking flour and sometimes that scent will linger with you um and so you have a fleeting smell it's a very fleeting you'll walk something like cotton candy yeah what who's who had weed candy right now who had chocolate but it's gone and then it's gone yeah well sometimes you'll catch like if especially if you if you can show up right afterwards but no that's so much smelly like and the difference is that it's not a sticky um vapor so it doesn't stick to your clothes and then carry with you like the smoke from you know just no and this is just like a my side for beginners those vapes are just a different beast i don't really think they affect just be careful when judging tolerance just based off hitting those vapes i don't trust a lot of their potencies that you don't know these are hundreds of cartridges made i'm just saying i've smoked just like joints and bowls with people that rip vapes all the time and they get torched because flowers are a little different high or they are always on the vape and they think they do an edible no edibles different than everything don't ever forget that and like the concentrates outside of a vape honestly don't i just think of all the people we've gotten we have absolutely wrecked 20 at least people buy them attempting long-term smokers a lot of them too yeah not we don't ever do it maliciously but people come over we do a lot just don't i consume my normal amounts unless you're with someone that knows what's going on yeah i'm i am a seasoned concentrate user and if you have questions on it i mean if you like concentrates or the vapes obviously hit like and comment on what your strain is through the vape because i like those tasty ones like some of them that actually taste like like sugar cookies and yeah those are so good and that's gone and then we'll get into the specifics of you just sit there how do they make cookies how do they make diamonds birthdays how do they get a white cookie right here batter resin rosin um you know what's live versus not live because you'll see that sometimes it's your adverse lives you know so live is when the the weed itself is actually fresh frozen so it preserves the trichome you can hear that at some point too and one of the bud tenders trichomes are the little white kind of bulbous hair there's actually three different kinds of but think of them as as size small medium large but essentially trichome is greek for the word hair it's the little hairy um collections of thc that hang off the the plant you usually can't see them with the naked eye very much unless the plant is really potent otherwise you zoom in with a camera or something and look at them in a larger picture and some really cool stuff some really cool pictures i love the artwork you'll see out of those trichomes because it just kind of looks like a a whole different alien world when you're zoomed in on those things um they're great but so the the live process stuff is the live process is thought to preserve those trichomes a little bit better and so when you're actually turning it into the the end product you know the better off they start when they go in the more potent it's going to be on when it comes out oh whereas where you're just doing like rosin it still helps making the live rosin which is remember rosin is the one where we're just using heat and pressure to squeeze it together so if you start with the cold frozen wheat that you cured by by freeze for you know freeze drying it then you put that in between the hot plates and squeeze it out then then what you're working with is more potent than the solvent ones which broke it down a little bit to extract it whereas this one didn't get broke down you've preserved it the whole way through the process and so you're gonna get as potent as you can get based off of the flower you started with so if your plant is really potent then a live rosin will get you the most potent concentrate you can get out of processing that down into different forms like a wax which is using it to you know using a co2 or butane to separate it out and then turn that into a material i remember again some stuff years ago years ago the guy was making in his garage wax and it would be on like he drove me off into it probably on the [ __ ] whatever got me high and i would just i would just it would be wax paper you just pull it [ __ ] open and just be the stringiest well before it was garbage he was making it with like his feet or something look before there was but it was [ __ ] stony i'm glad you said that that's to bring up the fact that before they had little glass jars they were super convenient or little silicone jars some people prefer the silicone because you can hit right out of them you don't have to worry about is this glass or just dense plastic plastic one out there like oh this glass or plastic you don't want you don't want it oh no it is oh when you're here yeah i've taken a definite so chemical yeah i usually i usually real good about using glass jars and once i get a good glass jar just kind of scoop everything into that one um instead of using a plastic i don't get out of plastic you know the higher end stuff always comes into them higher stuff comes in a nice splash jars usually a ceramic jar something something nice we're bougie i'm a pain i want you to ever he has one that lights up yeah i do i have some that light up that's not i'm serious local local arizona dispensaries here yeah they have and i like their containers because they have a slightly magnifying lid on the top and then a little led light clicks on the bottom so you get a real good look in the container at the material without having to crack the lid and get a good peek at it you just okay that's looking pretty good i got about that much left you know and i like it that way and so i usually i reuse those often and just you know by the time i wipe them out i just throw another gram of something else in there um but yeah as far as store they didn't always have those so the original the original way to store your concentrate was the wax paper the parchment paper you know it's like a dirty diaper if it gets if it gets warm it'll stick both sides you know um so the benefit for that or the the way they'll say to really manage that is throw it in your little fridge i recommend highly keeping any and all concentrates you get of any form in the fridge the enemy of all concentrates is heat light and air and laying it on keep it sealed keep it dark and keep it cool and so you'll see a lot of mini fridges you can buy that are meant for like dorms that you know they fit six to ten cans of soda perfect mine so tell you it'll fit one case of beer you just well they're perfect little small fridges you know that would fit four or five of these but they're great for stacking your little containers in i have over here like a three-quarter sized actual full fridge that i can just keep like rows and of stuff in but that's because i dab a lot um that's a factual thing it is and with my with my little babies growing over here i plan to expand on my total amount of personal use i'm excited me too we always appreciate everybody jumping into the cannabis academy stuff um man there's so much to take in on all of the two if you have questions on any of the concentrate concentrate stuff definitely you can comment it hit like look forward to our concentrates 102 when we'll get more in depth to each one and beard 710 up on instagram really if you have a question or you know anything in regards to any weed content or the nooch 710 both of us i i have some depth if you want more layman's terms i'm the guy to hit up then if you want like well then you just do that you want to hear more about hydrocarbons then i'm the guy yeah i'm not um i mean no i'm not saying hydrocarbons at any point in conversation right now yeah right now yeah make sure to we'll keep the um cannabis academy stuff coming up uh when you're subscribing you have the notifications on you'll get that in your uh little annoying red thing and then and uh give us some ideas on what else because we're gonna start moving on to more advanced ones and if you think we missed some basics let us know put it in the comments we've had we've had a couple of people put them in there so if you think we missed something drop a line thank you he's been staring at me the whole time the whole time do you want anything you guys should say goodbye say goodbye to the fly everyone say goodbye", "bxYzc9srLsQ": "yo what's good youtube it's cosmos and this morning i was wrong that's right i was wrong about crc bro i really was i i've been telling you guys and this was my personal thought was that crc was only for budget material now this homie proved me wrong all right look at how crc this is you can tell this is very heavily crc well not very heavily but it's been cr seed right look at how terpy this look how trippy this is right now i know you can't smell it but this smells like a jar of limes in the best way possible there's no added terps to this crc or anything like that this is just good material ran with less media so look at this mimosa right here bro look at this look at this that's beautiful look at the layer of terps on that i wish you guys could smell this get some smell-o-vision up in here because god damn bro the terps on this mimosa just reach out and just grab your nostrils and pull them right in dude oh so gassy and so nice and now the crazy thing is with crc gas turps are normally the least preserved terps if you run a gassy string sorry i accidentally stopped the recording through a heavy crc you will get no gas turps back now this homie he proved me [ __ ] wrong bro he's like dude you can run crc and have the chirps and have it be really really flavorful you just have to run less crc so instead of using a whole column which is what crc is color remediation column maybe you just pack a little disk of crc maybe use less crc i think that right now what it comes down to is that for budget products you have to use a lot of crc to make a very bland product but for a little bit higher end you could maybe run tiny little bit of crc and make some fire product like this [ __ ] right here super super fire honestly let's take some dabs of it so i guess here's where i'm at you guys i wanted to record a video and just kind of just kind of say i was wrong bro it's something that's hard to admit sometimes that you're wrong but um i was wrong about crc i was man i was i personally was like i was like all right crc i said this in the last video about crc i said crc in my opinion is only good for budget product nobody should be selling crc for above 15 and g out the door and i still feel that way about budget product i really still feel that way about a a really really budget material ran as crc it should be sold for around 10 to 15 g out the door but this homie who made these opened my eyes to the fact that crc doesn't just have to be budget and to the fact that if you use just a tiny bit of crc it can actually do a good job at creating an overall nicely balanced product and i think that uh i just kind of wanted to get that information out there to let people know that well crc while it can be super poopy budget stuff that you know just very baseline budget um it can also be [ __ ] awesome so let's take a couple dabs of this shenanigans and let's get going from there today we're listening to some billy marcia fava he [ __ ] kills it i'll leave the link to his spotify down below i asked him on instagram if i could play some of his songs during a sesh on youtube and he said yeah for sure man go for it so uh yeah super stoked to be playing his music check him out if you haven't seen or heard of billy's music i would definitely recommend it it's [ __ ] awesome he kills it um let's start with this girl scout cookies right here this is burner's cut of cookies so it has that um kind of like that lime um that lime note to it really really really tasty on this i want to say um not as much terps you can tell you know it's kind of wet with the terps there but not quite as much chirps as that mimosa will actually move around with the jar as i kind of moved the jar that was very very turkey without further ado let's take a little dab skinny of this uh cookies here and then we'll take a dab of the mimosa first dabs of the day about to go live on my twitch right after these dabs here excuse me okay we're good cheers yo so tasty that cookies is definitely more mellow on the gassy tarp but it still comes through you get a little bit of gas a little bit of lime the smoothness is divine oh yeah i'm riding now yum yum yum okay that was a good one yo first of the day too right there okay so if you guys are kind of just catching this on youtube randomly and you guys are like who the [ __ ] is this cosmos guy or whatever you don't know my spiel and my deal well my name is cosmos i smoke hello weed you know i take dabs mostly um and recently i've been blazing down every single day on my twitch i'll leave a link down below it's twitch.tv 420 cosmos but yeah we've been really curating the community over there i've probably been streaming almost every day for the past year and just been going really hard with my schedule these past few months especially i also started a podcast on my twitch every monday wednesday friday from 2 to 3 p.m pacific standard time where i chill and chat with other content creators that smoke down artists and companies that are in the cannabis industry and we just talk about you know whatever they do and uh weed and just chill yo it's awesome it is awesome so definitely follow it up on the twitch if you guys don't yet um my instagram as well cosmos 420 twitter cosmos underscore 420 [Music] yeah all the shenanigans you know oh the shenanigans just wanted to give it a little plug there and then we'll get this next dab going what time is it right now 23 after bro okay i go live every morning on weekdays at 10 30 a.m pacific standard time so we got to get the second dab heated like now now now because i have breakfast too i didn't eat breakfast yet okay so what i'm gonna do i'll probably start my stream and eat breakfast during the first dab of the stream um or just kind of while i'm getting it started up just a quick break [Music] all right let's get it y'all yo so if you guys are diving down along with this video i would love to hear what you guys are dabbing down on in the comments as well as your thoughts about crc man because i know i had some pretty um i had some pretty uh quite thoughtful thoughts about it you know and i previously didn't like crc and i was like well maybe it could be okay and i was like yeah it could be okay and now i'm on the boat of like well [ __ ] it can be [ __ ] fire too dawg like you got some fire [ __ ] crc just with the right amount of media um and all that shenanigans so it's crazy it's crazy with that i'm going right here oh [ __ ] that was a good song i shouldn't have skipped that whatever too late it's too late [Music] [Music] one second mikko let me take this dab then i'll get you some water let's take a nice glob for the second dab here nice little boy oh it almost just fell off the dagger that's a giant dab we're gonna no we're not even gonna put a little back we're just gonna full send holy [ __ ] cheers everyone [Music] oh no [Music] oh boy actually i don't have ground way bigger than i thought holy [ __ ] y'all oh i'm gonna start up the twitch stream let's go catch you soon everyone holy [ __ ] that was probably like a half gram oh peace out y'all", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to

saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all

determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm

flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow that flavor is intense now that i haven't dabbed it in a while in a while holy [ __ ] it is intense um hitter hitter hitter hitter hitter goodness q-tip foreign all right fire all right here we go we're gonna collect the rest uh i don't have a tool i can even stick that far down into the jar to reach the bottom that's being 100 you guys want to get the girls so all right all right all right all

parchment paper it's like not sticky either is that's a trip whoa almost dropped the camera into the [ __ ] departure i forgot i wrapped the email coil back there well i gotta stand up for this

play with this one a little bit for animals oh yeah good color on that edibles is is so sorry i grabbed the tripod leg on it accidentally a little bit there paper towel snagged it out all right if you put in multiple guesses this is your only chance to go back and delete your other guesses and leave only your one answer i don't want there to be any confusion when people go back to look to see who won so everybody go ahead put in your final answer delete all your other answers that you may have put in when i'm done taking this dab we're gonna see who won", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "YiN_hpgTbmc": "what is up youtube it's your boy it's your scottish government for 204 coming at you with a quick video man uh before we get into when this video is 21 plus 18 plus it's a cannabis video you know i'm a medical marijuana patient of new jersey so but yeah we're gonna get into this you know fast and easy it's gonna be a pretty quick video we're gonna i'm gonna show you guys what i bought take a dab and then in the video after that give my little review on the wax and stuff and then in the video i'm gonna then go to sleep because i'm [ __ ] tired low-key and by the way i've been dabbing this for a while super terpy fire but anyway it's called durb and terpes uh e85 jet fuel x uh jeffy x biscotti one ounce jar ounce of concentrates but yeah it's definitely crc but i don't mind it it's really some fire bro to be honest with you the taste fire the effects of fire it lasts a long time so i did the spoon test because you know i like this first off i looked this brand up on reddit or you know whatever the urban terpes i looked it up it's obviously a black market brand and you know a lot of people were just [ __ ] talking about it but people who had it before said it was fire so i was like whatever bro i'm gonna just [ __ ] buy it do the spoon test if that shit's fake i'm gonna get my [ __ ] money back you know i'm saying so basically the spoon test is where you drop some concentrate on the spoon you heat up the spoon from under it a little bit until it turns to a puddle then you put your finger in there the wax and you take your finger out and you let it cool down for like two three seconds and then you try to like peel it off and if you could just peel it all off or your finger like candle wax then that's just fake but if you can or it's pine resin probably but if you can't it just smushes around then it's real wax and i did that and it [ __ ] smushed around like a [ __ ] i could not get that [ __ ] off so that was a good sign but yeah i've been smoking it honestly i've been getting high as [ __ ] so you know this [ __ ] is fire like i'm not nobody it's just like any other wax i bought it's fire yeah this is my first day smoking d9 like dabbing d9 in a while because you know i bought this ounce and i was like [ __ ] i'm about to buy this ounce and [ __ ] i bought the ounce i took like you know a couple dabs of it i've been dabbing here and there but yeah that's just definitely fire i plan on making some edibles with it tomorrow so you guys will probably have a video coming with me making edibles uh i'm trying to get this but the consistency is good it's kind of like the wax wax i've actually reviewed on this channel that like white looking crc obviously wax it was fire obviously some of the best wax i've had on my channel and uh it's kind of like it gives you like that it's like more like sugar wax than live resin i'd say hey let's see if we can get a close-up real quick on this try to get this one scoop a close-up let's get a focus man you know i'm it's most like 90 short crc which i'm fine with that honestly i'm not really worried about it being crc a lot of people don't like crc i'm not really worried about that as long as it's [ __ ] real wax you know that's all i really cared about yeah definitely [ __ ] the smell is [ __ ] insane all that [ __ ] though bro i'll give you a little look at the jar if there's anything in it by the way it's from this piece of paper because i i had to scale it out so i put it all on this [ __ ] piece of paper and that parchment paper i used to press a nug so it has so much [ __ ] plant matter on it and i got all the plant market matter on the [ __ ] [ __ ] so i was like damn ain't that unfortunate we're gonna dab that right there that's a [ __ ] glob take a little tiny bit out of there but yeah it's some fire though i ain't gonna lie to you bro it's definitely some fire i'm waiting to [ __ ] to uh make these edibles you know so let me show you guys what that means by the way 30 quick little uh you know still a little bit of wax on the side too dirty as banger i know kill me look at that is i don't know why it does that that's from the reclaim that i smoked out of this one time left to stay in forever you know so def oh my god almost [ __ ] broke it definitely gotta get a new banger soon bro but wow look at that that looks [ __ ] phenomenal i'm not even gonna lie to you got a zipper this let me know what you guys are thinking man

fire by the way crc if you guys don't know crc is just it's color remediation column column whatever it's called and it basically it's just something that people use on their wax to change some [ __ ] not like you know some [ __ ] that doesn't look too fire to some fire looking [ __ ] basically it's what people use to change the color but it can be dangerous if they don't like filter it right or something but like for the most part it's not dangerous a lot of dispensaries sell crc and pa you can [ __ ] look it up damn that [ __ ] takes fire though i know some of you [ __ ] out there smoke crc

fifty dollars for [ __ ] they were four dollars for a half gram like eight dollars for a grand bro and it was flavor x and it was the old packaging when they was like really selling carts and [ __ ]

i don't give a [ __ ] you know because i don't i saw the video shout out to the customer 420 till i'm a fan of them but bro i saw a video of this [ __ ] throwing out crc wax i was saying it was garbage whole time if you go back to his old videos bro literally 80 percent of the city smoking is [ __ ] crc like bro what i couldn't believe it when i saw that video i went back to his old videos and literally literally everything he was smoking was [ __ ] crc you can look at it look at his old videos just look at the quality of the wax i mean some of it was straight up shatter and [ __ ] son actually you know straight up pressed rosin shatter and [ __ ] like that that wasn't all seriously but the live resident [ __ ] that he showed [ __ ] like that bro he had crc look you gotta look at it man i mean not every single video let's see i see but i said a couple little [ __ ] but that's what everybody bro uh and i'm not this is no dis to everybody i mean i'm smoking crc right now but there's a lot of [ __ ] i see smoking crc strange show or strange central i mean i've seen him smoke crc a couple times in his videos wrong g dab crc uh dab crabs in michigan or what's their names reclaim you know i'm not i'm not i don't have nothing against people with special needs but his name is reclaim [ __ ] that [ __ ] i seen a lot of [ __ ] smoke crc bro but you know it's it's in the wax community man it's there ain't getting rid of it [ __ ] like to make the product look a little bit better than it looks which is whatever as long as they filter that [ __ ] right what do they think boys", "n-DwD9o8T8E": "[Music] right and then you got ballers then it says 28 grammar [Music] [Music] as [Music] [Music] [Music] scrumptious creme cheese fuego only yo that's trippy these are all eight you", "vlO1jMDzCKg": "yeah it's gonna be a long video all right today we have six courts inserts here all loaded up with different strains some are live resin some are rosin I got one giant diamond here and I even got some sugar wax here and I think that's what I'm gonna start out with this is some Blood Diamond from Agra kind this [ __ ] looks nuts and honestly it has the consistency of like a sponge has an amazing terpene profile it tastes straight-up like grapefruit it feels like it's like a charcuterie board of dads I'm about to have a very good time here I'm sure not everyone knows what quartz inserts are and how they're used but I have an entire youtube video where I break it down super in-depth so if you want to learn more about quartz inserts you can go into the description of this video and watch that first but from here on out in the video I'm going to assume that you know what quartz inserts are and how they're used it's gonna bang your nice and hot alright now that our banger is going down let's get a quick little close up if we can bounce away boys this might overflow not gonna lie one piece breast oh he's so good my god [Music] Piper hush sorry you guys got my dog with me she's away from all the deaths not bad I got a little doggie gate set up here that's oh my god man this should taste so good I'm not kidding my girlfriend even like hates the smell of weed and she smoked this [ __ ] and she was like damn you should get more of that that [ __ ] smells good that definitely raised the temperature in here holy [ __ ] those nice big shout out the cop products for making these courts inserts that fit their bangers perfectly not to mention the tweezers they make so handling them when they're super hot is really like a stress free hassle all right that was a nice way to start the session I like legit sweating a little bit yep that's what what's nice about that inserts is honestly there's not a lot of residue that gets on the banger you even want to overflows it's so much less than one actually gets an insert so it really does provide your banger from getting that like Chaz dusty look to it all right that was nice but next I'm gonna dab some rosin this strain is strong wah but number two from olio this one really impressed me even from olio it smells and tastes amazing the look on it's great honestly even when it smells it's almost [ __ ] clear let me show you all right I have number two get it nice and close time a little bit the smaller Deb but I still think it's a beige decent size with a desert no wait till it really starts to smoke up in here and then I go for it this one's a little hot oh my god Oh oh my god it's like one hit left boom Wow that [ __ ] is nice definitely burnt up though with that on that one oh my god there is nobody left in there even even when it was that hot it tasted [ __ ] good man these inserts really make the dabs last longer I sort of got I mean this time I went a little hot but even if you get a nice low time they [ __ ] Rock here alright threw down four to go [ __ ] alright next I'm dabbing on some good goog live president from Moxie I really like this drain it's a sativa hybrid but honestly it's just a straight sativa in my opinion it gets me so [ __ ] high in that like cracked-out sativa way or you're super chatty and like just want to go out and go do something like this is definitely a constraint for on-the-go I'm not gonna do a close-up on this one [ __ ] it let's see the whole function of the Ring all right let's drop it already Melton Oh Lord dude I'm already so [ __ ] big this is gonna be a long video yep it's gonna be a long video oh my god [ __ ] give me that little nose tickle oh my god I gotta hear at the chit still going Jesus Christ this is what I was talking about [ __ ] oh my god all right tap it out there I swear it man that is a straight sativa it's not considered one but like that rosin that killed me and that one's brought me back to life halfway there only three left alright next I'm gonna dive is a little scary it is like a straight THC a rock but it's actually just like lab rats and diamonds without the live presentation it it's one giant rock so this should be interesting this [ __ ] has no flavor obviously because there's no turfs but it just has this like weird chemi taste like I'm honestly just not a fan I'm kind of dreading this stab out of all of them because this is a giant [ __ ] rock of it but wish me luck this I do want to go in a little bit hopped out because since it's just straight THC a really all it needs is heat to get the full effect alright let's watch this [ __ ] melt so weird has just no flavor [Applause] a little bit left it holy [ __ ] alright it's done it's [ __ ] done oh my god dude I'm not even gonna lie there's so much replaying in here you know what that means cheers [ __ ] [ __ ] me oh this is all hot [ __ ] no bueno just has no flavor so weird the highs crazy on this stuff but it's just so weird now there's no Terps I need the Turks terms all right give me some turps next to reindeer the strong Nana I'd add this a bunch on my last video has like a super great banana terpene profile I love anything that tastes like banana I don't know why it's hard to come by and it always is just like such a nice experience when I get it and this is live rosin by the way so definitely gonna have a good Turkey in profile all right as well doing a close-up let me know if you guys are enjoying these little close-up insert drops actually really enjoy the inserts so I'll keep doing videos like this if you like it so let me know swinging a little hot on that gotta take a little breather there [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] me oh my god dude Robin just hit you different really does who love it great experience I'd love rosin rosin for life all right last but not least I'm going to do some only old life present my eyes are feeling heavy so I'm glad those videos under this drain is guava breath ever get what the number is let's go with guava breath to the number really never matters to me when people are like Oh what watermelon skittles is is the 16 or the 48 I don't care to that exact i honestly should but my memory is just not strong enough for that I'm like I know I like that strain or I like the sound of it I'm grown with it like it's talking me to remember what number is better make sure you ask look like you definitely enjoy the video if you made it this far I appreciate every single one of you guys watching let's do the snap I'm doing a low temp I don't care if you judgment boom get in there we're ready [ __ ] dodge like that holy [ __ ] [Music] oh dude I'm so lit goddamn alright that's it we're done it was really just an average life present nothing crazy but I honestly didn't need anything crazier than this sesh I'm already [ __ ] lit this was a lot of fun I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did don't forget to click like

probably so today I'm just smoking this backward it did really I'm just answering one of my most asked questions as a STONER so of course they always ask me how many grams you smoking today how much you smoking today that's one of the most questions most wait what I'm sorry guys listen I'm high right now so listen that's one of the most questions that I get asked sorry I can't talk I don't know why but look so that's one of them and another one is oh how high is your tolerance you know what I'm saying but the main one that I always get is bud or oil basically they're asking me would you rather choose bud or would you rather choose some of this oil right here now I wanted to make a youtube video or we - video where our our post is whatever the case is I just wanted to make a video for y'all so for the people that want to ask me they can get my answer right here so I don't always have to answer you guys a hundred times you know saying but listen this is my answer bud or oil my explanation he all is this I love oil because of the way it smells you know I'm saying I could heat up a a rig real quick quartz cows or something boom take a nice dab with some rosin or some live resin you know I'm saying [ __ ] tastes good [ __ ] gives you a different high you get a body high from oil just like edibles edibles and oil gives you body high this bud it gives you a head change you know what I'm saying so like I was saying yeah I can take a nice dab with some oil flavor nice train all right or I can roll up a backward or join or soar swisher whatever load of bong up you know the same your choice is smoking however you do it I can do that I love the way we looks but all I love to look at it I love the smell of it bro sometimes I hate breaking it down because it looks so good the note is so beautiful you know sound I don't really like breaking it down but you got to smoke it you know saying so but this is my answer to y'all bro I'm gonna pick a bud people asked me if you had to choose between a pound it'd be like this if I had to choose between a pound of Bud between a pound of oil I'm gonna take the pound of Bud you're saying I'm saying or whatever the case is whatever is equivalent to the pound of whatever you know I'm saying oil wise I'm gonna pick bud and this is the reason why first of all I got bud you can make oil out of bud you see this bud right here this bud right here I could turn this bud into oil you see what I'm saying this oil is by the [ __ ] rosin right y'all see it so gelato all right you see the gelato I cannot turn this rasa in this oil into bud I cannot make a butt out of this there's no way you're not going to get plant material out of this you see what I'm saying so say I said I was sitting on some oil right I'm sitting on oil and I'm like bug you know I'm taking dabs all day all day I take dams and a month looking like this I'm on my head man I've been getting I'll be getting my body hollowed and getting our body an hour all day no I want a head Shane you feel me I want to smoke some bud but you don't have nobody to smoke you see what I'm saying because you chose oil now say you're like me and you choose bud but I got a pound of this bud right here bro a pound of it I smoked [ __ ] an ounce of it [ __ ] another ounce another [ __ ] else I smoked a pack whatever I smoke three joints of it I'll smoke blunts of it right next thing you know I'm like [ __ ] dude I want to take a nice dab real quick I don't want to smoke no blunts or no joints I want to take it on ballroom I want to take a DAB what are you doing you just have bud you could turn your bud you can simply grab a hair strainer get it hot press the bud and turn that into oil you see I'm saying so then I can take a DAB Oh some oil with bud I can take a DAB with bud if you're saying you can't you can't smoke a blunt with oil you say I'm saying so my answer to bud or oil is gonna be bud all day because I could get oil from bud and you can't get bud from oil you out of the year you already know what it is teacher dabs in the build the out of a matter of fact I'm about the smoke dresses badly with y'all I know is it the question let you know hey if you have some more questions for me y'all want me to answer some more questions on here for y'all all you got to do is comment down below you know I'm saying and ask me some questions just

you feel me I'm off with a move I wash it in out of it let's take the damn dog well I hold on let me get a DAB ready to take it out first of all all right so this has a little bit of rosin on there so it's gonna be like a combo dab cuz it had some rosin on there still no I'm saying so boom let's get some more pie let's get a little bit bigger just cuz it looks like a little baby dab you're gonna take baby dabs for the for cameraman you only do that off camera you only take baby dabs off camera nobody's watching Pro you don't saying what people are watching you take Big Daddy dabs like dad gangway style all right look mmm we keep this up real quick real fast that's our tase you though just make sure it's not clogged earlier I took a dab dude it was clogged get a freakin [ __ ] just take this damn view little clothes for y'all some of that boom extracts for Boston homie but you already know what it is like I said you asked me butter oil my pick bud you already know why so you already know what it is stay lit stay blessed I'm dying stay motivated the oddity we out", "WheOc80F8Wo": "so let's start on the left we're gonna make diamonds out of your on the right right now is we are reducing there are extract or BHO extract we like to put it inside of we got this bucket you seen the last picture it's got a little bit of warm water it is not hot water it's just warm water we're gonna reduce it down to for the diamonds we want it to become the consistency of a boat syrup before we're gonna cap it and put it somewhere warm and pretty much forget about it for a few weeks and then for adds or shatter if you don't know how to make shatter we're gonna reduce that down to about syrup then pour it into our back oven onto our patch of parchment paper and then we're gonna let it bubble away and then pull it back on it full30 an inch of warm water and on hot water just warm water in there gonna take a little while through these it's what we want - I'll be 20 minutes half an hour there like that probably have to change the water a couple times keep it warm as the extract is really cold the process to walk you through it oh yeah we can make diamond can make diamond - all right you can see how much we reduced it down your way up here before it was quite a bit lighter we still got some bubbles just good because to make time as you need pressure also need a supersaturated solution which is this butane and THC and yeah time just go wait time so we're gonna we're gonna do is when it's a little cap on this we're gonna stick it up on our clone seedling rack because it's got a it's a warm base which will help with the pressure build up because as the gas or as the liquid turns into gas it builds up enough pressure in here and helps the process take place good no it's not quite at syrup consistency yet which is okay we can just let the pressure build up give it a little burp we do that over a period of a couple days until we get it tell it's like a little run here than syrup and then we're just gonna leave the cap on it and we're not gonna touch it again till we get diamonds you can see now that I burped it there's bubbles from the gases escaping from the supersaturated solution back into gas which pressurizes this back back up again okay so it reduced a little bit more this one here we weren't working with see how runny that is I mean it's still just like water make snake water this is the death Bubba here and see it doesn't splash like that when you shake it it's thicker hard to tell you definitely a sticky substance yeah shake it doesn't splash up the sides a whole lot that's how we like it see the little bubbles coming up pressure up we're gonna leave it at that we're just gonna set it and set it forget it turn it off in the back corner here and we'll come check it in a couple weeks and we've got diamonds in the bottom there it kind of look like little air bubbles when they first start forming but their crystals will show you once we get to that point you [Music] [Music]", "a_Y8loBehR4": "[Music] [Music] guys welcome the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we are back for another concentrate review today we are checking out some rosin from 7-10 lives 710 labs they reformed their Colorado company and now they came out to California here we go got a shovel a because it's hard to get on the Denver yeah we actually took the close-ups for this stuff yesterday when we left it in the fridge it was a little cakey but still have a little bit still have a little bit of you know greasiness to it gooeyness left it out overnight after you know basically destroying it [Music] Turkey I'm not usually a huge rosin pin mm-hmm I was just gonna say is it flavorful for rosin or is it flavorful for just an extract in general honestly it's flavorful just for extract in general I guess we should talk about what it is we're smoking we are smoking on some z-cube today now Z cubed is apparently a I guess there's a little bit of a debate on it it's either a three-way crowd like basically skittles back crosses itself a couple times or it's skittles across with OG then cross the skills again either way some skittles taste the rainbow type [ __ ] it is very flavorful and ethylene packs a little bit of a punch it's a little sativa T definitely made me feel a little more like alert who's this barking this is by a dying breed seeds yeah originally third-gen fam [ __ ] i mean i think they probably won 40 50 cups buy this [ __ ] at this one how much every cup this is placed at some point or another multiple times the thing about the skittles is it doesn't look that good when you look at the flowers of it it has about zero bag PB on it does not look good in flower form but goddamn does it taste good I mean I can still taste it on my palate it definitely gave me that opening vibe you know what I'm saying one of those strings that has a super-high terpene content and a relatively low THC content right everybody gets so hung up on the THC numbers and they forget that like without the terpenes and the cannabinoids the THC does out basically nothing for it it all acts together people it all packed together so you know as a result this is one of those strings in my opinion now we're talking about the skittles this is our first time smoking thank you but just the regular old skittles not really my favorite strange smoke if you're talking about flour no not at all but it does make some good concentrates it is a very short flowering plant which on the production side is great you know seven weeks right seven weeks our times so and that's that's amazing I mean eight weeks she's fully done yeah right right so I would love to throw that in my garden strictly for concentrates because you know the flowers trash yeah it is one of those streams though that you know can kind of surprise you as far as when you look at you like oh this right this you look sweet this is some [ __ ] meds but when you smoke it it's one of those sleepers that kind of does pack more of a pleasant you would think right right especially you know it's not the strongest when you talk about dabs but it's right up there with some of the most flavorful [ __ ] the lemon geez a lot of those like orange lemon Terps that just like come through really well on oil for some reason this kind of falls in that same class of church yeah I mean honestly the flour it smokes really good and like a joint or a backward - like I'm not gonna lie but it just doesn't look good you know I'm saying but that concentrates great alright I'm gonna go in and see what to do with the taste you see were to do it with the taste it is hard to get on the batter though that's the one downfall got it the one downfall hard to get on the diver that's the most rosin though we forgot to keep it in the fridge and then you know boom it just waxed out you know I've got the little pocket on it's not a pocket purge because it's not a little but they you know it kicked up in the pocket and that was that now you gotta use shovel to break cover on this stuff I'm gonna discover super blonde yeah how's it taste [ __ ] yeah that was a dabba doo honestly though on the flavor I wasn't very scary to me really no here's the thing about rosin for me especially bubble hash for us and I'm like 95% sure this is Posche rosin is a lot of the stuff you see that looks like this now right yes you know it always kind of just tastes like bubble hash and I don't mean that in a bad way you guys know obviously we used to do it's one of the full-mouth Friday videos like we will have good water to Michael but I like good bubble hash more than I like good rosin that tastes like bubble hash you can bubble there's only those few strings that are really good for you know making bubble hash like sours and all the really greasy strains like that that really make like a bubble hash that actually tastes as true as possible to the natural product one good thing there's GDP in it no there's great babe I got you guys so I wish there was GDP a really original skittles right is wasn't like a grapefruit and a great finish great free really it's a grapefruit and a great page supposedly River and great buddy it should have an eagle everybody knows great babe it's got some peanuts the effect of the shooters pigment it's definitely more of like a head for head as far as the body feeling goes yeah it's pretty much immediate too we had already taken a few dabs or some oil today and feeling it a little bit but this stuff I do Efes is hitting me harder this stuff grab me hot I'm not gonna lie like I think you can tell the baby packaging I'm just gonna say what you think about this packaging this packaging pretty sweet it's pretty slick I do like it I'm not gonna hate on looks like it's got all the regulatory standards on there open up the top here and these flaps right here have a couple little sayings on it this one says oh jeez make better oh gee that's cool I like that and then this one says preserve your Terps keep refrigerated yeah that's one over here to quality drives every decision we make from the garden to the lab to the jar that holds your cash happy beautiful that's beautiful beautiful words from 7-10 labs I'm diggin it packaging 907 as far as overall concentrator I think we shall give this ready yeah I mean this is really good Rosen its fire like I said I just haven't we're not about the rosin yet that gets me to fully commit right you know we're not rousing people we're just gonna wear em I'd rather say that rosin is not the first thing I picked out of the lineup to smoke to some of y'all that might be the first thing you picked out and that's fine by me I'll pick some here BHS it's almost like it's sort of like you know if you looked at it on a spectrum it's like that spot right in between bubble hush you know full mouth and boy right you know right it's just he has never really been a friend to the extracting process when it goes like keeping your terpenes intact and everything and yeah I think the best rosin that I've smoked are at least the turbo is another smoke doesn't in Flour mm-hmm every time I smoked some rosin that's made from bubble like this it kind of just always tastes like a slightly different version of just right so back to the rating I think what your regular right yeah that's great okay overall concentrate rating I think I'm gonna probably have to give the effect on this like a fart like a heat you know I'm not too loaded up but I definitely did get a head change as far as smell targeted in a Tazewell and looks looks our popular tonight because it's really really really Blanc got great looks so I'm gonna go eat 58.5 for Rossum I'm gonna go higher on the effect right now the effect of this is like a nine or ten for me well like from one day yeah I'm taking one dab of that the heck change is really nice cool so I'm gonna go with the night on that smell it was pretty good I'll probably go with a seven their appearance I'm gonna give them a plus one for the packaging so I'm gonna go probably eight so somewhere flavor that's why where I go lower probably six and a half seven something like that yeah so overall I'd say probably a seven or an eight whatever that method is some probably seven or eight eight five I'm being generous today I like it it's a great concentrate 7/10 labs skittles cubed thanks for watching I'm Danny I'm Shane these [Music] you", "A24Y3JyHLAQ": "this video is made of a user's request today I'm showing you how to winterize frozen in a small batch here I have almost a gram of rosin about a point 8 I made just before this video I'm placing into a beaker and adding 10 ml of Everclear I'm adding the alcohol to the rosin so that I can inter eyes it apply like bleep and mix until all of the rosin is dissolved into the alcohol [Music] here importing the rajma and alcohol into a graduated cylinder this is just for the purpose of the video [Music] I meant place it into the freezer and my cool for about 14 hours [Music] after freezing you can see that the wax fats and lipids have separated and sunk to the bottom [Music] here I'm using two syringes to pull out the fats and waxes as well as the alcohol separately this is also just for the purposes of this video to show you the difference [Music] it does help however to pull them out separately as it makes it easier to filter the cleaner portion compared to the waxy portion [Music] here I'm pushing them through a point to two microns syringe filter the syringe filter tracks the facts and waxes and removes them from the alcohol [Music] [Music] in the end I've caused it in alcohol and it's been winterized and I'm removed of any of its fats and waxes alright once you've done filtering you know how fully winterized rosin you can go ahead and use this for edibles or you can further refine it by boiling away the S&L and using it for bait pens or lowell devs my half plate has a built in magnetic stirrer it's a magnet that spins around and spins a magnetic stir bar this automates the steering process and speeds up the overall evaporation it may take some time for all the alcohol to evaporate keep checking back on it every so often so that you don't burn your rosin I don't recommend consuming concentrate that may have ethanol and then often if you are going to do this regularly you are better off getting it back through the final purge process [Music] after you've reduced most of the alcohol up I'd like to put another beaker on top to prevent any ball tools such as terpenes from escaping that having already in this final process removing the last of the ethanol now you can't truly remove all of it without a vacuum so I went to do this for as long as possible kind of medium to high heat right now it's heated at around 95 degrees Celsius I like to let it sit like this for a couple hours from four I feel it's safe to smoke and the ethanol has escaped [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "J_0_qwXlhEM": "[Music] [Music] ah yeah guys what a big Dan over here coming back got you yeah and now we're doing a quick little video because I get a million questions asked about this subject pretty much every day I get at least 10 to 20 comments or emails asking about this subject and the subject is how to make THCA from shatter or wax or pho all yeah so uh there you have it you got some saucy turkey diamonds the diamonds are around anywhere between 96% eighty to ninety nine point six percent THC a and you can see the nice derpy a little bit of Terp sauce layer in there with the Terp sauce will contain random cannabinoids from CB g CB d CB and stuff like that and then all your Terps whether it be in lemon een pining and the rest of a mercy and all that stuff but um yeah this video is in explaining what diamonds are it's explaining how I make my methods of making THC TAC a or diamonds or sauce turf sauce or turf diamonds or whatever you want to call it you can see that the crystallization is fairly big with the strain and yeah you can see the diamonds themselves are nice and clear and the sauce layer is nice and golden okay so let me break it down alright so first step is you got to make your you got to make a BHO pack the columns pack the tubes wait uh this is exactly how I do it I do fresh plant right off the plant right into the two pound columns on a closed loop fold you axis then I go from best value of x mmm I use only try ice I don't use liquid nitrogen right into that I just packed the column the jacket on the column with dried ice I packed the tubes full with my material which is a fresh off the plant you could do it with dried buds whatever you want but I just the best herb profile will come from live plants or fresh frozen something like that and then I do my run just like anyone else I'll blast through the column and then I'll pull the ball valve and then once I pulled a ball valve I will it'll dumped into the dewaxing chamber and then I'll let that sit for a little while let it be wax I'll pull that ball valve and let that dump into the collection pot I will then heat the collection pop however you heat your collection pot I just use a hot water bath and then while that's heating and evaporating back into the solvent tank getting yourself in potty or BHO I will then look through the sight glass and I'll leave a good amount of butane left in it now that's up to you how much you ran in and all that so I'll make sure it's nice and soupy so I could just dump it right out now when it's nice and soupy I release the pressure and then pop the cap and then dump it into a jar just like the bigger the bigger versions and these balls right here the big quart jars I will then cap the jar I'll put it in a cooler that the cooler Pole has some dry ice in it so it stays nice and cold and then BAM I'll leave that there and I'll pop the jars maybe once or twice a day burping them and after about five days you'll see diamond stone form at which point I will not use dry ice anymore and I'll keep it pretty much every room temperature and then I'll perform a two three four times a day I check them randomly and I'll burp the jars just you probably don't have to do that but I just do it to make sure the pressure isn't building up so much that's going to pop the capsule off or break the jars for anything so I check on them from time to time open them up and check on my own see how they're growing after a week you'll see bigger diamonds after two weeks for the biggest diamonds something similar to this now it is all strain dependent some strains have much bigger Terp Terp layer and then some strains have smaller diamonds more turf some strains have bigger diamonds less Terps yada yada so that's all up to the strains but that's how it's done I don't you know pentane wash the solvent I use for extraction is just n butane from best value back switch is 99.9% pure butane medical grade extraction grade comes in the green tank you can buy all that stuff right up best value packs they got a good prices good material and I never did me wrong but out yeah that's how it's done so uh I know I did a video with the robot voice trying to explain this and I feel that video was uh sufficient and I think it gave all the same thing I just said broke it down much quicker and you didn't have me up in there saying and all this shift so for everybody that just wanted a little revamp of the process that's how it's done that's exactly what I did to make these that's what I do to make all all my Terp sauce or diamonds or whatever you want to call it that's how I make it I hope this helps anybody out and if you liked the video smash the like button subscribe if you haven't already and throw some comments and you could shoot me an email visit the website whatever you want to do and I'll get at me I'm down I'm always here to help and uh yeah there you go beautiful diamond so you can see they're all nice and clear swimmin oh yeah okay guys I hope that helped enough big Dan over now peace out [Music] [Music]", "a6BMDjoAf_0": "[Music] Peggy's going on YouTube it's your boy sub eg backhanded with another banger video for the eyes man for today's video guys as you guys can see by that little intro man I got a bunch of goodies right here man and I

good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic

to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "lbxe9wjChMA": "welcome back to the canvas packaging show episode 3 in this 12 part series also known as a saga we're talking about concentrates today quick reminder to subscribe to the channel we're going to be doing a lot of eco-friendly packaging in 2019 we're going to show you guys through the canvas packaging so so please subscribe and without further adieu unless Danis I need to add let's get right into the cannabis excuse me concentrate packaging Kalia has an announcement to make sure they've all going to show us the products first and then this was created by Heather the Saudi a favorite thing I've done for the concentrates in the entire you know for the last year Wego she calls her own packaging Fuego Johnson a good sky by the way shot up the sky shot at the skies Str jar it fits through the card Co dry it can hang it's very cost-effective it shone like the spot UV if you can can you see that on there this thing's getting a lot of compliments all right next up show it like unwrapping it on the actual show you don't have to unwrap that actually it's just it's just the bow just about yeah holding backs to put your jar in all your warnings on there it's a Massachusetts product all right keep this moving League that's the same concept just another is a flap here that you can put some branding on or a message of some sort I love that idea of how do you put a message in there that tells the story so it's like just that person holds your package and you can hit them with some kind of call to action whether it's going to your Instagram or you want to show them your tagline of what you're about so how do you tell your story through packaging is something to really think about not just a box it's a way to tell your story and it's a proven fact that I'm doing the unboxing process we talked about that a lot when you have more flaps you have more openings it's more exciting and it leads to a much lower case of buyer's remorse certainly just from having a fun experience in opening the box opening the package it's like you're opening a gift it's a true unboxing process we do a lot of the stuff in our ecommerce division and it's all about unboxing opening it up and really being pleased with what you see on the inside and half of the fun is you see on YouTube all over the place unboxing experience half of the fun is the unboxing process repeat customers that's what's gonna have people come to you again as a repeat customer versus as more dispensaries pop up down the street why would I go to you know location a versus B it's because I have that experience through their packaging and it resonates for sure alright we interrupt this program Talia please show your Christmas cookies to everyone a lot o you're interested in buying cookies for Scalia please so let's go to the chatter envelopes upgraded this has an insert in it two items from our fashion side of our business that we think could be adaptable this would be like super high but I was thinking this for shatter Irving this for a concentrate but that for shattering there's a hinge box with raw materials has an inlay and this is a flock interior which is like a by the sweater this obviously has a bracelet insert inside okay inside this box is a wood lacquer hinge box which again this was for a ring but we can make an insert for your jars really nice pause would I don't know if it shows up on camera but a gorgeous gorgeous almost like a mirror finish polished would non contempo sample don't have to be a different size but just I really like the opening and the magnetic closure and the material to the materials are a huge thing that plain to the brand overall so it's not just the design on the box with the material selection and I see a lot of people in the industry just choosing standard 18 point board with four color process for color print and the textures are great way to tell the story of what you're about where you premium will then use a premium texture are you eco-friendly are you natural then use a natural craft field so keep materials in mind this is a similar example it has a magnet in it this is the box for makeup it has a mirror inside but it has that nice snap closure type of box that you will not throw out like Dan was talking about knowing the experience and knowing what her customers going to do after he makes the purchase or she makes the purchase sometimes you want to just have a package that's going to contain and after you've thrown away other times if you really want to make it whether it's giftable or you just want to add to the experience you've designed packaging that's not going to be thrown away that's going to be kept with the life cycle of the product or even after that so an item like that with a mirror on it could be put on the desk has your brand on it forever and again the customer connects with it you know for years and years and years to come I see that was like a five milliliter concentrate jar would look really nice than that that that concept okay what do you anyone say about this all right so this is just sort of a aspirational or concept that we haven't really tested but we're thinking a concept issue to have shatter inside of there I want to see if you guys think that would be viable this is the concept that we did for the fashion industry we had a floating ring box and I think a lot of people like to see shatter they like to see how clear it is right how transparent it is I'm thinking that could be a really really cool option to display these Nick what do you think that was actually your idea about the your set you're telling me about like the transparent nature like to see you know the purity of it how transparent is honestly I think that's a great idea I think that would be really unique and different okay I guess this episode is over because our helpers just run out the door and she's back alright anyone have anything else to add in the concentrates you guys things you're seeing in the market that would be worth sharing with the audience or do we kind of hit everything and everything about the boxes we have a customer that were conceptualising packaging for now that wants to make sure that whoever is using her packaging moving forward can fit it in their pocket or if you're using it for a pre-roll or concentrate that they can take one of the tubular ones and actually turn it into carry your joint to a concert or going somewhere else where they are just having it a nice box to fits easily in their pocket like chapstick with so I think that that's really important for people to try and not keep in mind too when they're designing their packaging is the smaller the better and you know people can use it more than once that's really going to be the best-case scenario mm-hmm oh great I think especially with the primary packaging so like I think a lot of this stuff people could have a box they're gonna keep that primary package on then like fit it in their pocket I think that you hear that a lot that's definitely a common thing what is it going to be like for the person who's carrying the product how do you have that seamlessly integrated to their lives the cookie was great and a little rude eating on camera I could see someone writing the comments this guy's eating on camera but I'm sorry to you whoever's gonna call me out on that", "dh3aYJDw91M": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this wax tastes like [ __ ] watermelon and this is versa I've had this brand plenty of times on this channel already but watermelon I believe is one of their newest strains that was released at my local dispensary so I had to pick it up you know I've gotten the lemon oh geez the rainbow flames all that stuff like multiple times so as you can see I already opened it and you know that's how I know it tastes like watermelon but funny thing about that I actually bought it last night but the lighting in my room wasn't good so I was forced to just smoke it and doing a video in the morning the next day so I hope you guys can understand you still won't get to see all of it it's all all its glory and I will be using that utility in fine I know it's [ __ ] [ __ ] but I mean we're gonna have to make it work but juicy right here 73 percent THC not bad hopefully you guys can see it it's at the right and watermelon no Singlish is opening packaging very very nice another thing I'd like to mention is that this is different from the other eras that I've seen or have tried in terms of the consistency of blacks I mean look at it it's basically a sugar which is good because sugar it's harder to get on your lid you know you see it it's not gonna just if I did this it's not gonna slide down slowly like sauce would you know was very good smells really good I mean if I had to describe it as smell just like some raw garden stuff but it tastes different than how it smells which is crazy yeah like if there is actually a hint of like a watermelon or it might just be like a like a placebo you know that you know it's called watermelon that you kind of taste watermelon I'm not too sure but if you guys have tried this please let me know just give you a little soom in Gnome see the color is really good it's not too dark there's something about you know dark wax is just very unappealing but that doesn't mean that it can't be good Billy because I believe was it bright labs they had very dark dark oil but that [ __ ] was fire once they wanted to be I'm speck of fat hit for you my fault [Music] boys but that new Mac Miller album is [ __ ] dope recipes - Mac rest in peace - juice rest in peace 2x rest in peace - Pete there's some peace to [ __ ] everyone that's that

reason I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "YXpfchNKqm0": "hi I was doing some plant extractions so I thought I would share my process here you can see the ground up plant in question normally a chemist will do setup like this this is footage stolen from nurdrage if you don't know him go check him out anyway the key feature here is the soxhlet extractor it is a device that you can load up with stuff and it will automatically cycle the fresh solvents through it it is basically automatic self siphoning device if you like me don't have such logic structure or any glassware basically you can use method that I am using here so this is just basic filter paper that I modified to allow vapor to pass through it of course it has to be compatible with your solvent on top of that you can place random container that you will fill with cold water ideally this should be glass container but in the past I have used even polypropylene plastic cups also here is some kindergarten science in case you wonder how you can make effectively holes in this filter paper you can see that I intentionally offset the first hole from the bottom this offset basically depends on how much material you have now let's put in just a little bit of a solvent I'm using 50 milliliters of ethanol put your stuff that you want to extract into this filter paper do this outside your extraction container because you can contaminate liquid then a few your cooling container with water and be sure to keep outside dry now you can turn on your heat source and just wait actually you should periodically check the temperature of your cooling water one little problem this setup have is that the filter paper likes to suck in the solvent and carry stuff with it this is not a big deal unless you work with extremely small quantities in which case you shouldn't use this setup anyway you should continue with extraction until you see that the solvent that comes out of the filter paper is basically clear I guess depending what solvent and what you are extracting here you can see plant material after extraction and you can see that is quite off-colored and at this point I tested the extracted plant material and I can confirm that the chemical was not there and here's the extract it should be pale yellow oily resin material but you can see that it has quite greenish tint to it this is due to presence of chlorophyll in this part I will try to extract the chlorophyll from the extract itself unfortunately only way I can destroy chlorophyll presence is by UV fluorescence which would not be so terrible but unfortunately my only resource is this PCB exposure unit I built sometime ago this is about 120 watt light source and the radiation from this Fink is overwhelming when you turn this thing gone basically whole world looks like it's dead and I will have to make some adjustments to the scene so you can see what I can see and now we are cooking there may be much better solutions to separate chlorophyll but I know only about one solvents that can do this and that is propane or butane or mixture of two now this will be a little bit crazy but actually propane mixed with ethanol is not quite that volatile but it's still pretty much flammable so be aware of that at least I mean it should be unless you are five years old anyway so you can see that there is quite clear separation of two fractions since that chlorophyll content is not that different though also in the visible light this is really nice but the question is how do we separate this seriously what did you think if you have one you can use separatory funnel just never never plug it up even though it should handle this pressure there wouldn't be much much higher than one atmosphere of pressure I mean do you see any problem here I repeated this extraction about six or eight times now on the left side you can see the butane fraction and on the right side you can see the ethanol fraction the ethanol one is quite muddy it seems like it has some water content in it to be fair I also fill tributon fraction through some filter paper so but still it wasn't muddy it seemed to be contaminated by some solid pieces now both fractions are right and you can see quite clearly the color difference now let's look at this under UV light [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you can see this reddish fluorescence that is quite specific to chlorophyll this is the beauty infraction even though you can see some orange a green fluorescent blobs there on the other hand in the ethanol fraction you can see that the whole material is this orange green fluorescent pink although even here you can see some quite a reddish spots that could indicate some presence of chlorophyll so the separation is quite good but not 100%", "2lFEfBj2-mg": "our next category med cure concentrate now this is kind of interesting every year concentrates gets a little different last

actually launching it in all retail locations please tell us some something exciting and that what does your means to you yeah so I mean I kid again 14 months into this project I could talk for about this project off its jar actually says it's the high quality stuff just a regular piece garden high-quality we renovated into our Baba jar or flower most tests over 30 percent THC it's got to check

today I'm gonna be giving you guys a little bit of info on the 710 labs list so makes you guys we're coming if he knew hit that subscribe button for your boy and make sure you dab what's the deal boys y'all already know what's happening man I'm coming back with another quick video me give you a little bit of information about what's going on here so as you guys can see I got my delivery from the list this right here came from 7-10 labs personally they hand-delivered me this package full of bomb ass extracts and whatever else I ordered that you guys are must take a look up right now what is the list how do you get on the list where is the list man it sucked because actually the list is currently only available in California now the list was made for only friends family and true OGS of the 710 community you can go to 710 labs.com and find out how you can apply for the list sometimes it's open sometimes it's closed with 710 labs actually does is put some of their best production of every month to the side for people who are on the list if you're on that list then you pretty much get dibs before any dispensary in California that's supposed to get their supply for the month or whatever so once you get on that list you have first dibs on all the stuff that 710 labs made for that month on a certain day of every month 710 labs is gonna email you a link and the password you use that password to sign in on the website that they sing you and then there goes the whole list of everything for that month you have to be careful because whatever you pick and you purchase you cannot change you have to spend the minimum of $300 and the maximum is whatever your tolerances for recreational use the max that can deliver is 8 grams of concentrates so you can only get 8 grams of rosin or you know dabs or whatever if you're a medical user that you can actually get up to 50 grams and the same goes for the flower if your recreational user that you can only pick up one ounce of flower twenty eight point five grams and if you're a medical users you can actually pick up eight ounces of flour so that's pretty fired they actually delivering a lot of cities up in Northern California and here in Southern Californians they deliver in a couple cities as well so that's gonna do the basics of the list let's get right into the package as you can see they delivered it in this nice sick ass bag labeled 7/10 Labs has 710 labs on both sides and you can actually take the bag apart if you would like to or you can just keep it together and you know rock it like a little duffel bag and on the side right here has the perfect note that this got a 710 labs booklet and you actually got this handwritten note so it's gonna be a handwritten note with your name on it big old paragraph talking about yeah you get it what's the dilly it's very dope you told me I'll [ __ ] with that how they just write you a note and [ __ ] with your order that's pretty sick that's like a lot of love so as you can see you got two zippers right here we're just gonna zip them fangs openness in this inside you might want to check all the compartments cuz you know how smokers get man they end up putting joints all in the cutting [ __ ] but uh yes so here you got ice packs this is gonna be a 710 labs ice pack which is pretty [ __ ] sick yes and then you have all your rosin or whatever that's you ordered you have your whole order in here if you got flour that I'm pretty sure the flour being here to anchor no flour on this order and sometimes they give you goodies and [ __ ] so sometimes you might have like a pair of socks or a t-shirt or whatever they're giving out for the month you might have something special you might have some couple of joints like you never know so just check the whole compartment and as you can see man I put in a pretty nice order because the prices are ridiculous I mean wholesale you're paying forty-five fifty dollars for a gram I mean you can't get this quality anywhere for this price usually I go half with my homie he'll get like two hundred dollars worth of things I got like $100 worth of things argue like 150 he'll get 150 or whatever the cases and then you film it'll be easier on both of us and get some high quality [ __ ] for the good price and we can still be on the list because if you actually don't order if you start like skipping your orders and like not ordering anything because the minimum is too high or whatever or whatever your case is like you're on vacation or whatever the cases if you keep missing out on making the orders and they're gonna cancel you from the list so you guys got to keep placing the orders I mean they do it at a very good time I would say it's pretty convenient like monthly it's not like every week or every two weeks you gotta put in $300 so um it's really like right around the time you got a smoke if you just save all your money and then make the order then that order should last you for like the whole month or until next time you have to order you'll probably even have some [ __ ] left over so I think it's really convenient especially if you have a buddy that's really interested in these products or whatever just interested in high quality [ __ ] and I want some new [ __ ] they can put it in the order they got all type of [ __ ] as you can see from [ __ ] dabs rosin bunting BHO they got joints they got dad pins like they got the high quality spires if they got the high [ __ ] bomb-diggity flour they got everything but um I only got Rosalyn because right now they didn't have anything on the list that spiked flour and they have any flour on the list all they had was rosin and dabs and joints but uh yeah maybe next time I'll get some flour this is what I picked up man I picked up some Munson number 58 I picked up some [ __ ] called the loot it's gonna be a Percy live rosin another Percy live Rosalind called greasemonkey number 15 times bootylicious number 1 I picked up a regular live rosin another month's in 58 some of these are gonna be doubles because where they're like 45 bucks each so it was like why not I got the live rosin and sour tangi times bootylicious whoo that was like another what $45 one sour tangi bootylicious again I'm telling you the Lemonheads number four so you get a good make sure you get a chain you get to change it up and [ __ ] and then you get to you know pay a really good price so the booklet man you got a couple of Snickers I believe up in here oh they give you your receipt as well and then they just show you how to smoke this [ __ ] the right way so you got the weed instructions you got all the rosin and dad and live Persis and different types of [ __ ] that they make these got the instructions behind them and stuff so I really respect that they put a lot of love and hard work into the [ __ ] versus people who just give you a box of weed or whatever like yes that's what that is like they actually care what they're doing with their [ __ ] so that's pretty tight you know I'm pretty happy I made the list so that's pretty much it man you film you got your [ __ ] you got on the list you got your [ __ ] you pay cash and then that's it they come they pull up they text you they're like yo you want us to come at this time or this time and you blow yeah come at this time they'd like alright then and actually come right on time too and they keep this [ __ ] in good condition though it's cold it's frozen it's ready to go in the freezer or in the fridge or whatever it's ready to get smoked I really [ __ ] with that so man that delivery service is a [ __ ] one anybody on the list make sure you hop on that damn list boy I know y'all enjoying that [ __ ] because this shouldve sick as hell you got the bag you got the ice packs there's nothing I can really say man but if you guys mention his video I appreciate y'all for watching guys we're coming if you knew hey that subscribe button for ya boy it makes you get to an incident excellency [Music]", "_cBnbmY67EU": "[Music] alright you might have seen the intro already but I wanted to open this because I'm actually outside Blake's house and the lighting in his room isn't the best and he's always playing music so I figure I just opened this right now and the only reason I want to do this right now is begin not at home is because I actually want them to try it as well you know I want to share with them I want them to know what they think of it you know I'm saying so I wanted to do the opening right now and then I will do the review at home by myself later on so if you do see me like you know in a car and then a mouse that's what happened guys we're just gonna be looking at it okay so this was bought at phenols I believe it was $28 and it's white Tahoe cookies and it's live resin butter know what threw me off was filled is usually a lot more expensive but then when they said butter I was like oh you know I'm saying because when it comes to the type of concentrate that actually costs a lot of money because butter is part of like the easiest concentrate to make other than probably rosin you know rosin very simple but you do need expensive gear and stuff the butter is generally pretty easy you know I'm saying so that's why it was only like 25 dollars a gram I noticed that the THC percentage is pretty low but like I said it doesn't really matter about just THC you know there's other things involved and it's live resin so it should be some terpenes up in there to kick it up a notch so let's just open this I don't want to just kind of keep the box nice and Christine for the what I'd a bit or a later I might just rip it cuz [ __ ] it gets a box right care about a box but yeah why Tahoe cookies has been I've talked about it on this channel before oh wow very very nice I've tried some of the fields stuff before as well I have never tried their cartridge though what the hell what off the bat I really like the packaging this is very very easy sheet look at this [ __ ] you could [ __ ] have this on like a shoe design you know and be dope that's pretty [ __ ] dope dice oh wow it looks like wow I'm actually pretty surprised I wasn't expecting this I haven't empty said butter I thought it'd be like a crumble ish but it's like a light color which I really enjoy okay 20 I'm gonna say $28 maybe 27 I don't know around there but Wow okay excu a look at it first let me get the thumbnail get the thumbnails always yeah alright guys back at my house I am going to continue the review of this field extract white Tahoe cookies no I'm saying if I already opened the box and all that before I went to play Xcel's but now that we're at home we're gonna finish this review off drop the bat low very very nice packaging I did not keep the dab tool that it came with I gave it to Blake but this slip is pretty good like yeah they were actually impressed like I gave money a hit and then he was like I'm about to go there right now even though he just went to the club like two hours we'll hope that honestly says a lot filled extracts usually is a pretty expensive to you know very very creamy creamy looking we're just gonna take a hit since they're gaming right now I'm probably just gonna mute them for now I'm saying but that was RJ and Ben on the game you know saying so we're gonna take a hit of this and then we're just gonna tell you a little bit more about the product itself I'm saying not bad I'm like oh I feel the extracts usually they have that sauce that kind of looks like a sugar wax sugar sauce see wax you know I'm saying you know boys [Music] [Music] very very clean taste very smooth - for a hit that I just took like that size I usually would be coughing but very very pleasant not to like chirpy but you can definitely taste like a slight hint of like like some cookies you know some very earthy pungent I don't know how else to describe it but it's a very familiar taste and not bad like first price and I've always wanted to do like a field extracts video or another one after that because I kind of did like it it was just too pricey but yes another thing I like to mention is I mentioned this on most of my videos but the price that I get it it's not the price that you're gonna get out depending on where you are so please be aware of that I don't want to steer you in the wrong way you know just because I get it for 29 doesn't that mean you'll get it for you know what hopefully you do get it for 29 and yeah other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video just another product video hope you guys can understand this is pretty good stuff I'm not gonna lie other than that have a great day [Music]", "_E4-qQ48Nis": "just pay alive hit means coffee shop Oh

have kind of flash or fire sales as they call them so we're gonna look through a few more deals here on the phone I already have a few ideas from weed Maps so we're gonna maybe go to a few places today once we decide but right now we're headed to get some cash and the dispensaries we are leaving the bank now we pulled out $80 we found a few good deals from a few dispensaries we're gonna go

have good stuff we're gonna move on but hopefully we can get a few really bang grams for about 80 bucks here okay we are at our first stop for today one of my favorite dispensaries we are at high hopes cannabis with a cause I just started shopping here recently and I haven't been disappointed they have excellent products they always have great prices and the staff here is really friendly so we're gonna go in here and see if we can get some excellent stuff for today okay we are just leaving high hopes now it seems as though the prices are so good today that they've been cleared out so we were able to pick up a couple of different grams that concentrate as well as a pre-roll joint so we've got a gram of blackberry head band sugar and a gram of Agent Orange live sugar and we got a pre-roll joint of that lemon diesel we're gonna enjoy later so excellent prices but the selection was a little light because they must have just got raided oh man the views are sick the trees are covered in frost there's plenty of plenty of cool things to see in Colorado Springs we are outside of our second dispensary shop for today as you can see the views here are insane worse not that Apothecary farms powered by apothecary extracts one of my favorite dispensaries you can get apothecary extracts all over Colorado but they have a few of their own dispensary locations where you can pick up directly so here we are at apothecary farms in the springs looking for some more concentrates what of you over here we are just leaving apothecary Farms had to stop for a moment to check out that gorgeous view it was too good to pass up but we picked up a couple more grams from apothecary we got a gram of axilla wax and we also got a gram of their jam band lime batter which I've been hearing a lot of great things about and they were recommending it there too so we definitely picked up a couple of good ones here and I'm excited to try these right so we've spent all the money we've pulled out for dabs today we got four different grams as well as a pre-roll joint we didn't spend everything we had we've got a little leftover so I'm gonna do a little bit of foresight here a foreshadowing and then we're gonna get some munchies for later I found some coupons in the mail today so we are just going to get our munchies now and we are going to enjoy the dabs later foam pepper on the tomato black olives cucumber and the spinach oh I see this business and what also I'll just go with a little bit of that yeah we'll go at the now thank you good eat just like these chips later bad there's one thing you never expect to see him it's a trenchcoat you never expected so I realized my car is super dirty so we've pulled into a car wash here it's getting clean now my card is getting a pound and it's gonna be a while so we're gonna get up oh yeah and we are on our way home to enjoy our spoils for today more amazing views Colorado Springs is beautiful okay so we just got back home and went to two different dispensaries today high hopes and apothecary farms we got two grams of concentrate from each and we also got a pre-roll joint from my host so let's see we got a few different concentrates different grams here and a pre-roll joint we're all joint one gram of the lemon bezel good stuff nice price on this usually pick these up we got the gram of blackberry headband sugar blackberry headband sugar this is the one that is not a live and let's take a look oh this one looks very nice blackberry had been sugar wax very good stuff this one is from high hopes let's take a look at the other one this is their Agent Orange live sugar so we got a gram of the Agent Orange live this one's a little bit more expensive looks like that one got a little bit mixed up in the bag there I had it sitting upright but maybe it was upside down and that one smells very good check that out check that out this one is really saucy this one has a very very strong smell to it okay and then we also got two other grams from apothecary right and I know we got to two different two kinds here here's the axilla wax this one is 73% th if I can get a difference I'll never focus focus anyway seventy three point nine percent THC this one looks great excellent concentrate in there and one last one we got was the jam band live better and this one is very popular the employees were raving about of this one is eighty two point nine percent THC this one is a really good really good strands got a very good smell right when I open it it smelled amazing so let's take a look here oh yeah this live better okay so let's invite my girlfriend in here near there to do some Deb here is one more look at our spoils for today we got the BlackBerry headband sugar we got some gaygent orange lime sugar we got that pre-roll joint of lemon diesel from high homes we got that axle wax and we also got some jam band live batter so we've got a couple of emails plugged in here into our high five vape and we are ready to death alright we are finally back home we got the emails fired up and we're going to try a few of these out here what do you got there jam band you got that jam band from apothecary and I've got some Agent Orange live sugar from high hopes that's a really tasty the jam ban that's the last one okay we got our last couple of dabs lined up here I've got some of that axilla wax what do you have the BlackBerry headband sugar let's see how these ones taste oh that one's smooth and sweet like that so everything passed the test we got some great concentrates today and we got a couple of live options we spent a little more on the live better in the live sugar but the taste is very good we spent I think just under $80 for four grams that concentrates in the pre-roll joint so I think was around 76 for everything not a bad price for today I hope you enjoyed hanging out with us today and please if you like the content go ahead and subscribe to our YouTube channel

shed this is iced out images coming at you with another product review this one is once again I haven't got the kid to respond to me yet about the discipline came from them so just like my last product review that I did yesterday I'm going to put that in the description below so this is Tropicana cookies is the name that I was told on the top the person just wrote traffic honor and I know I pronounced that weird but I'm from England so that's just the way it comes out of my mouth smells so [ __ ] good live better so pick this up 45 of G so I got this and then I got the mother's milk which is in the other video if you don't mind going to watch that one if you enjoy these videos just [ __ ] cold out today house how blonde leaves whoa [ __ ] freezing so I'm still in my work gear but so 45 of G got the mother's milk and got this mother's milk previous video blah blah blah blah blah so this one I don't have my other phone with me much kids on it right now but the the stuff that I can remember that I looked up is that it is peppery citrus hoppy flavor it is cross between Girl Scout cookie and tan G so I've had to Angie before and I've had Girl Scout cookie I've liked both so we're just gonna jump right into this we're gonna be rocking it off of my sci-fi glass piece so anyone new to this channel sci-fi glass shout out to these guys I like a lot of their [ __ ] so far like off-the-wall and cool-looking start heating up the Bangor and get this damn and after work did that I busted my ass in the freezing weather kind of dead you know well hopefully everyone else had a fantastic and warm day I froze my dick off pretty much any time they took my hand and my gloves off and my hands were exposed to the air from the moment I pumped up a tire this morning time I got to work time I got home just cold it's going to be like 17 degrees tonight here in Michigan maybe even less I forget it might be 10 degrees I don't remember get my days mixed up a little bit yeah what's that hopefully you guys had a great day sad I just worked came home my girls about to leave for work so I'm gonna take this and then go inside and spend the rest of set time with my son I'm supposed to pick up my mother car today it didn't start been sitting for months so we're certain it's gonna be the battery we tried to jump it that didn't work we changed the battery out that ended up not working come to find out that on Lexuses there's like if you do something a certain way the security system won't let the car start or recognize that the key fobs inside the car I don't know it's pushed the start though this shit's all new to me it'll be the newest car is over owned 2010 which happens to be almost 10 years old the last war I had was a 92 Toyota for sale before that was a 99 stable 99 contour prior to that the newest car I owned was a 2002 or what if there was a 2002 that I got in O five it was a Saturn SC 2 coupe and I loved it that car so from my other video I'm gonna let this cool down just a little bit longer than I did last night because that [ __ ] must have still been too hot because it's just instant and I was baked but you know I didn't I didn't taste as much of the chirps and stuff as I wanted especially coming from something like this quality ooh Oh fat daddy tasty damn there's that peppery / hoppy taste the citrusy part is almost like bitter you know like it hits hard yeah very tasty well as I said I'll find out what this bow these are from and I'll put it in the description below in case anyone wants to try to get their hands on it I understand it was 45 a gram from the kid I get it from I'm not sure what deals they're running for you know it says five g's on it so so I know the guy picked up 10 grams of live batter five in this one five in the other I got a gram of each very very tasty strong strong high and pretty sure this is a hybrid I don't know I'll put it in the description below I'll copy the ship from Leafly and just I will put it right in there and any other information that I need to put in so yeah strongly recommend it Tropicana cookies if you can get your hands on it it's probably pretty good in just normal wax but if you can afford to spend the extra money and get the you know the live batter I'd recommend it the quality is better taste is better and the potency definitely seems higher just seems like a better product all the way around compared to say a lot of these you know FPR ones that I've been getting from healing tree Wellness Center that's not talking [ __ ] about healing tree Wellness Center that's just saying that the quality of this is better than that and the proofs didn't pudding you know that's like a dark almost goldish color almost like a like an amber type color almost and this [ __ ] like crystal white almost not quite egg yellow but man that smell I wish you guys could smell this [ __ ] you guys wouldn't be like a throw me add a beam right now and uh you know for some of you some of you live close enough to where we could arrange [ __ ] like that you know stop in at the shed and come being a video just chitchat [ __ ] [ __ ] take a DAB and we can you know have like guest

this is going to be another wax review and I'm gonna be honest with you I actually tried to do this yesterday by his left the lens zoom din so you basically just see like no none of my eyes just my nose down and I don't know it was a good video - off speaking on some [ __ ] [ __ ] since topics and stuff but before I start this video it is December 8th and I'd like to say rest in peace the juice world I wasn't the biggest fan of him by like some of his music and 21 is still very young to go especially with like seizures and [ __ ] so yeah man rest in peace other than that we're gonna start this review video if you couldn't tell from the title it is peanut butter breath and it is from Ursa and I like to mention that the only reason I picked this up is because I have a friend Stevie who's very much into this strange so I've basically got it to make him jealous and to also let him know that there is the selection there that if he chooses to go and get it if he knows I believe there was $24.00 out the door for a gram and it's running at about 74 percent THC I also like to mention that RJ is also his voice is coming through the TV so you might hear like an echo of me or him and also we're gonna be blogging today in SF so it should be a good one and RJ's gonna be vlogging it with this new camera so it's gonna be dope other than that let's start with this video Oh before we start and you just get some tea no I'm going yeah opening this show you what it looks like yeah very very good stuff and you know I've already tried this next scenario in the video but once you open this you can smell it like some waxes you can't really like once you open it doesn't smell like it's like a like a jar of wheat what's your opening you smell it's crazy [Music] let's say anything to the peoples RJ not today we're not uploading it today it's happening today we're filming it today well doesn't mean I'm uploading it today what the hell that mean I have to come home early start editing once I get home which I'm not trying to do right here good stuff and I will be hitting it out of the utili 5 I know some of you expressed some distaste for me always using the utility you got to realize this is the only thing I could hit it out and if I am not using what you like then just click off the video because like there's other we tubers that smoke out of rigs and bonds and stuff you know and if I don't have that kind of content for you don't click it and if it upsets you don't watch you know people seem to get upset when they watch my videos but there's an option to always not watch you know a Smith like I don't know it's up to you and for the most of you guys you don't really care what I'm smoking up you just care about the video in general and what what's being said in it you know I'm saying and you know if I don't have those type of videos for you I mean there's plenty of other we tubers you know when you hit hockey no just mean yourself so he's gonna play a song and mute himself I'm still gonna be continuing on on this review the tastes very similar to that of the og types of raw garden I'm very very much loving the consistency of the wax very proportionate amount of diamonds to sauce which makes it all the more pleasant you know sometimes raw guards and be having like a fat diamond in there and just like some sauce but this is more like evenly proportioned you can tell right here you got some toss toss you got some sauce mixed in with some of that diamonds you just call it boss now huh da sauce but yeah hopefully it's been a alright video so far and uh you know I I'd hate to start it on it on it down no you know like juice world passing away but uh man that sucks rest in peace man let me take it out hit another get fully charged pen for today so and I got two batteries for my camera now so like I have more but like I'm only gonna bring two that's enough so we're definitely gonna have a lot of footage for you guys and honestly the most exciting part is probably using Randy's new camera I want to see what it looks like you know I'm glad I want to say that for those of you who are interested in what camera he is actually using it as a cam it Canon m50 and it was cost a pretty penny I'll tell you that Cheers mother and that the taste is there very very good I would recommend it very very very similar price to that wall garden so if you're tired of raw garden and you want to try another brand check out Ursa definitely another good substitute if raw garden isn't there or any other brands of wax that you haven't sure that you like it but it isn't there try it it's not bad other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music] [Music] you", "G3silqyFQCE": "hi guys my name is Rachel and I'm a budtender here at Saint suspensory in Tucson I'm here to talk about some new products that we're carrying in our dispensary phicorp concentrates there's a bunch of different concentrates that they offer this is my preference the diamonds they are very high potency around 99 percent THC core also offers a bunch of other different concentrates such as sugar sauce that's Delta 8 THC and that has its own unique benefits compared to Delta 9 and just watching only getting other concentrates they also have sugar wax butter they have a honeycomb and accountable as well I really highly recommend these core concentrates you can reach out to any of us with any questions or concerns you have about them", "UfFOHfZCKkE": "what up this is chip from the real dirt podcast man today we get to talk about one of my favorite subjects of all time that is solventless extracts that's right water-based extracts today i'm talking with my good buddy chris from solely solventless out of denver and man he's been really like pushing the bounds of uh um extraction water extraction rosin extraction in the colorado area so if you're around if you're around denver or come to denver definitely uh check it all out man hey guys and if you haven't joined already please join us at therealdirtpodcast.com subscribe on itunes and hey man check out our new youtube channel you know we're just working on it but uh should be all of our episodes loaded up there real soon and uh i believe that is the real dirt podcast on youtube so thanks again for joining us today and as always sit back and fire the largest joint you can and enjoy this episode of the real dirt and this is chip from the real dirt good morning hello one and all another episode of the real dirt podcast this is 2021 and today we're gonna talk about extracts concentrates how they're kind of made and what they are the first time i ever heard of a concentrate of course it was it was called hash and we didn't quite know what it was and this guy kevin price i believe he was he he was like hey i got some hash she you know and we looked at it and we were like man this looks like rabbit [ __ ] are you sure this is hash and to this day i'm pretty sure he sold me rabbit [ __ ] as hash and we didn't know any better so we smoked it but it's come a long ways and as soon as i got real extract which was jamaican hash oil back in way long time ago i realized the potential of extracting the trichome and extracting the molecule from cannabis and have really been fascinated with it since then in all its forms from traditional hand rolled hash to sheaved and pressed hash to bubble hash to sub critical co2 butane propane solventless like i'm really fascinated and interested in it all and today we have chris from solely solvent list chris a good friend of mine say hey chris how you guys doing out there thanks for having me chip you know chris is an unsung hero he has some of the finest extracts on the market they're boutique and rare to find and if you ever see them absolutely scoop them up they may be a little bit more expensive than the ones sitting next to it but you know what it is absolutely worth it hitting it chris i appreciate all those nice words there chip yeah man just paying attention to detail man and you know really having a love and appreciation for this plant and all that's all its power that it entails you know so you know we're small small batch but uh you know we're just starting out if you do happen to catch us on the show like chip is saying yeah man you definitely gotta give us a shot you won't be disappointed we like to take our time like i said that attention to detail is important when it comes to solving this extracts there's a few things you definitely have to uh pay attention to as far as the input or the material you're using to get that output that we all desire are what you know the customers are desiring these days one of the biggest things about xtract is the quality material in gets exceptional quality out and many people just use the trash you know to make it and and you can't absolutely do that but to me you guys can best gear possible you use the best buds possible that's right my friend yeah a lot of credit goes to the action you know the cultivators first the flower has to be top-notch the flower's banging and it's on point and usually you know the hash on the other end comes out what you would like as far as like you know quality numbers you know that can all vary from a few different things different genetics and yield different numbers in those areas you know it's it's all interesting it's all you know experimental it's just great to learn and you know every day you know whether it's something that really throws down a lot of hash you know and you know it's in the family of the gmos or the cakes or something like that or something that doesn't really throw down as much it's more you know on the terp side i mean that's all important you know it depends on what you're looking for what are you starting off the day with man you you you smoke weed in the minute at the beginning of the day are you one of those people i mean probably like three or four times at the beginning of the day three or four times at the beginning uh i mean what did i have this morning i had a little bit of the uh some some live rosin made by myself it was some uh i call it the gumbo mix or you know my term that's right because chris is from actually from louisiana yeah you're right you're right um he's also our resident go-to of anything southern cooking food as well he holds the gumbo and shrimp and grits title at cultivate colorado currently right nobody compared yeah i mean i i i take that pretty probably anybody wants to step up at all i'll take it you know but oh man when we made shrimp and when you made shrimp and grits down here in oak okc my crew here never had it and literally the other day they were like man that time you guys made shrimp and grits he actually said chip you made tripping crap right uh i didn't take credit i mean it was a team effort man come on we watched you do it extracting hash is just like cooking you can be a cook or you can be a chef right you got all the right ingredients you got all your temperatures together you prepare everything properly you prep everything properly then wow you got something then right yeah 100 yeah like uh you know a lot of people you know may not go along with the the mix material washes but i particularly like those because as you were saying with i like cooking and flavor profiles and things like that you know you take two different you know hatches and mix those together you never know what you're gonna get man like you can be in a mood this day take a hit of that you know the same hash you know that you hit two days ago and get different flavor profiles because you might be in a different mood or something you know it just really depends like today a mix of tropicana banana and monkey berries and i really like that that's my gumbo mix for this morning chocolate chip did pretty well those did about i think that was at four percent together so not bad numbers so you're mixing these you're mixing these flavors in the bag yes i like to actually mix material together and wash it together in the bag you can do it separate if you like and then mix the resin at the end and press it like that if you want you know that's a preference thing man everybody got their own way to do it yeah way i like to do it you know so it works out well for me i don't have any issues with it taste fire love the taste so we've been babbling a little bit here i realized like there's a lot of people that listen to these podcasts or we'll see this podcast that don't really understand what hash or extract or rosin or resin or solvent list or bubble or co2 or any of this stuff is man let's just let me get your opinion of it let's let's let's start at the beginning let's have like a 101 basic extract course from chris i would tell you this i honestly um you know definitely knowledgeable in the extracts but as far as an extract connoisseur or someone who is going to go to a store and buy an extract over flour that was not me three or four years ago i would say the hydrocarbon extractions or co2 whatever you want to call it those extractions you know just we're not really that interested in them as far as like dabbing them but definitely using them for edibles and things like that which they would come up really well in edibles so you know never really you know downplayed it or anything like that but starting just like let's let me let me pause you right there and ask you and let's make some ex explain to people what's going on so most of the extract you see on the shelf at a dispensary say in colorado or california it's some mostly some sort of wax or goo or oil or shatter and most of that is made with butane or protein propane some type of hydrocarbon mixture right right right right they're literally just combining all of the the plant material they're mixing it with the hydrocarbon and then they're separating out the plant material the hydrocarbon they're recollecting the solvent the hydrocarbon yep and what's left is the extract right right right right and that's what mostly is on the shelf so when you're when you have a pen what's what's in most pens chris you get a mix of a few things these days i've seen uh you know you get your distillate pins mixed with terps i would say uh you get your sauce pins i've seen you know lately you're starting to see some live rosin pins kind of new on the market but mostly mostly just through it and terps i would say which you know distillate would be you know just your pure thc no flavor profile and then able being able to take different tariff profiles and then add that to the distillate you know um it was some sort of solvent these those are all mostly solvent yes correct yes right right but but you mentioned rosin tell me what the difference is between solvent lists and and the the non-solvents oh well you know as you mentioned uh earlier with the uh actual process of collecting the trichomes using hydrocarbon uh with a non-solvent uh extraction or a solvent extraction as you want to call it you're actually going to be using water as the solvent or as the carrier or the lubricant whatever you want to call it but like super cold water so you want to use a combination of ice and water to actually collect those trichomes opposed to the hydrocarbon so a healthier way or a healthier method i would say as far as like uh approaching the extraction process but uh you know each process equally has benefits for whatever end product or whatever way you want to do with it but i just if you're asking me water and ice seems pretty safe and clean to me so using that path to actually strike trichomes uh you know solving this just you know really stuck with me when that started coming around i think nicotine probably is the guy to give respect to that starting that term from what i understand you know and he's been around for a minute pushing out some great product just learning and discovering that really got me really interested in that and these days you're starting to see it they're starting to be rising carter just popping up you know rising and batter live jam you know uh sauce and diamonds even like people starting to even make diamonds and solvents which is crazy because that's like mechanical separation and things like that it costs more for a reason though you have to put more raw material you have to take more care in the solventless extract than just a hydrocarbon extract the material 100 matters you can do it from trim and things like that well taken care of trim will deal some great results but decide it'll actually use you know your prized buds you know and something that a cultivator or you know cultivar that does really well you know you're gonna you gotta wash it you gotta collect it run it through the bags you know then take it from the bags goes to the freeze dryer you know that's in there for 24 hours comes out of the freeze dryer then you have to see that then you have to you know collect it again into your screen bags and then now you have to press it so you know you press it then you collect it and then now it has to cure whether you want to you know heat cure it cold care room temp cure whatever it may be there's all these different ways you can approach it there's no wrong or right way in my opinion it's all great technique yeah it's all technique and preference you know some people swear by full spectrum you know or like some people swear that oh it's got to be the 9120 or only 90 you know and that's like man that's cool you know that's great that's your preference you can like that but like you know it's it's it's all out there man it's everybody likes something a little bit different and it's great that you have the options with verizon you can do that also when you you use different material you get different results and it's really hard on the commercial market to have the same exact material over and over and over and over again and and so that's the importance of like what we're talking about you got to watch it see what's going on because what might collect what even one strain grown by one guy might collect differently than the same strain grown by someone else right and you you've you've seen this over and over again like wow man those crystals are really small those crystals are really fat like this is nothing but glands this is nothing but stocks you know yeah man i've seen two two different growers two same exact stream like almost one and a half percent difference you know which is crazy you know like that's a decent amount of difference you know but still great outcomes on that on that particular stream but uh yeah you're right uh environment that's actually grown in um you know maybe i'm starting to notice has a play in into that too and maybe appearance of the actual riser you know whether it's going to be a little bit lighter things like that whether those whether that person maybe pulled that product a little bit early harvested a little bit early things like that and you know kind of go into it too you kind of never really know so like having a good relationship with your suppliers where you're getting your material from really helps you know and like consistently consistently knowing that you know you're dealing with these guys it's going to be this every time you know you know that it's going to put out you know these guys grow it perfectly and boom you know everyone does good yeah well it takes a different mentality well slightly different mentality to grow for for high quality extracts i mean many people grow for extract but they're just literally trying to grow biomass they're just trying to grow like weight man the highest quality stuff though it comes from when you really take care just like you would ganja right all the way to the end and you finish it the same way and you know you dry it and store it and package it all the same way like you know maybe i mean you don't have to trim it necessarily right but like you definitely have to like you know there's a little bit of processing going on yeah you definitely like to prep it i mean you know you know you don't want to put any you know leaves that doesn't have any any sugar in there you definitely don't want that sure in there you know so you got to prep it a little bit but definitely as far as like taking care of it and growing it with the utmost attention attention to detail you know as far as like i know you don't have to do your ipm's but you have to minimize those things like that you know that really like carries over into your end product you know later in your flower cycle when you come up with an issue you know that's love matters you know so you got to be on it from the beginning man and take care of the growing environment you know many people are familiar with with this term bubble hash or water hash but let's talk about why what this solvent list how it's different from from just like a crude extract with water yeah so with bubble hash you know in the cycle route to get rosin you pretty much get bubble hash first but like you said most people are used to seeing you know the bubble hatch in the form of you know looks like sand i guess almost keith rather people familiar with the grinders you know and you have to keep catchers but like typically you know whenever you're washing the material and collecting it in the bubble bags you know before the whole freeze dryer thing at this point you take it out of the bubble bags you gotta pretty much dry it at the perfect condition to get it to not mold or anything to be able to go from like you know you know the bubble hash process like that that we're all use that's a pretty intricate process too to get that right to get that correct for freeze dryers like i mean i guarantee you i would have failed plenty of times you know what i'm saying i mean i i mean i maybe tried it a few times when i first moved here from louisiana trying to do some bubble hatch before rosin was even a thing you know and you know it came out well but that whole drawing process is tricky and lucky out here it's dry the standardized you know so it was pretty you know relatively easy to learning curve is you know easy out here with that lack of humidity but i don't know if that would happen in louisiana i end up with some moldy hash man you know a few times i'm sure yeah yeah you got to control your dry environment yeah but you know now but now with with free drives it's a different story yes free drive is definitely a different story pull it out of the bag wet press it out water out a little bit put it in the freeze dryer yeah right yeah and even with you know i mean still with freezer i mean you know you're using freeze dryers i mean people don't tell me you could press it in horizon a lot of people keep it as melt too you know you you know you separate use your bags and use that 90 bag get some full melt people really love that nice full melt these days it seems like you know different strains are going to give you different meltability of the heads but like usually that that 90 through 119 seems to be that that one that people love for that good bubble hash melt you know super clean heads you know barely any specs of anything you know but you know it's got to be clean that's got to be taken care of properly to get to that point you know and using the freezer man just freeze-dried bubble like can be incredible oh yeah right a few times i've had it it's been ridiculously good right but it's to get that high quality dabbable bubble at that point like it's really really strain specific that you hardly get any yield you know out of your your your batch when you do it that way right compared to kind of like what you're doing and you're making you're extracting as much quality material out of the the leaf as you can with water you're taking it freeze drying it right and then what happens well from that point once it comes from the freeze dryer we take it and we put it between these nice plates by these low temp plates i like to use those plates but they're great heated plates low temp heat and pressure um the bubble hatch goes into filter bag and then between the two plates and that presses out the rosin so you go from the bubble hash and then those two plates creates almost like a you know like an environment of where pretty much that that protective layer on the resin heads or you know that the bubble hash bursts from the heat and the pressure and it oozes out all that good oil rosin and you collect it into the jar or into your banger or whatever i've seen people do some crazy stuff on instagram but so basically it goes to a jar we're using water yeah and then we're freeze-drying it and then we're using a press with some heat on it that's right right and this is this is all just water and heat right natural man that's it water heat a little bit of pressure you know and boom you got some rosin you have some beautiful extract that you can then take from that state and cure it how you'd like or you can keep it in a fresh press state you know take it into cartridges take it into edibles which oh man make some beautiful edibles tastes so good i love that that you know some people complain about that weed taste or whatever i like a nice rosin taste and an edible in my opinion that tastes good me too yeah i prefer all the edibles with more basic extracts uh keef water rosin oh yeah right i i prefer those as extracts for sure hey all of you uh uh edible companies out there man don't just use distillate make some with keef make some with rosie yeah your clientele will love it too i'm sure they'll start learning you know when to experiment with different inputs is you know the education of all this stuff will definitely keep growing with more states becoming legal here you know as we keep seeing it almost weekly and it seems like i see another state is passing some you know medical cannabis or recreational loss which is great man so you know hawaii yesterday alabama tennessee like people in texas new york new jersey like it's going everywhere right it's happening man it's happening and that's great you know and you know that people people are going to want they're going to want to learn about it you know that's how it is man you know the thing about private market cannabis and that industry is is we always try to squeeze as many dollars as many cents out of a square foot or out of a plant as possible because you know it was gray market or it was totally illegal and and now that we have these legal markets it allows to us to do research and experiment with with cannabis on a different scale and you know even though like solventless you know might be twice as much on the shelf it might be 65 80 a gram on the shelf you know the the the manufacturer still is he's not really like making a ton of money at that price it's literally you know he's making less money that way than he would if he was doing butane or propane or co2 right he's making less money that way than he would if he was actually probably selling the buds for flour too right like it it really gives is solventless extract it really defines to some degree a different segment of cannabis production right because it's not just like this like the biggest bang for the buck right get the most money out of the square foot it's like hey i want to make this product and this is how we make it and then the market bears the price 200 100 yeah it's definitely a it's a it's a special product that like you're saying it's there's multiple steps to it man you know so so complex i mean it should be worth 120 a gram i mean i was just out in california and that's what it was about yeah it's 120 a gram there though because all the taxes that go on yeah and that's and that's what i was yeah it was attacked right right but yeah it's uh i don't like to say it's not for everybody but like you know if you want to get into it man it's definitely something that like it takes a little bit of you know diving into you know there's a few steps to it a few things that you definitely gotta you know you gotta pay attention to detail that's what this is man you know it's more like a food or a laboratory-like environment all right not to say not i mean that's what you know other extraction techniques as well not to say that's not how you would treat it with that one but like you know just particularly with the solvents man like like you said you grow all your flour you could take this flour and sell it as flour or you would take it and you know throw it in this water with this ice swishing around and hopefully some trichomes come out i mean you know that sounds crazy yeah crazy it does you know the research and you know the groundwork that a lot of people have done you know in the past few years i would say have definitely like built that confidence and i would say you know definitely curious minds like me for sure because it was definitely tough for me to dive into it too i remember thinking about this more than a few years back i'm like man that's crazy just take the flower and throw it in there and like like really okay but now you learn and you get educated and you're like okay now it makes sense you know now okay cool i'm definitely gonna go take my flower and throw it in there and do that you know because this browsing thing just tastes really good makes my edibles taste really good too so sorry i just had to break for a second you guys over at the uh i just do yeah right yes yeah i know you gotta have security up in the studio man all kinds of [ __ ] roll up here i mean tupac learned it the most i know dude that's right that's right i just was watching a couple episodes on hip hop evolution about that sad story man sad story sad story sad story yeah you know greatness often is is snuffed out too early man that that's you know i lost a couple friends this year uh danny smallwood and rob cox and man like you know it's always sad when uh flame goes out too quick man yeah that's right yeah man my condolences i'm sorry to hear that man hey both those guys danny and rob loved extract love bubble rob love bubble i was making it with both of those guys in literally 2002 and nice we we got super high you know on more than one occasion on a a handmade bubble that we just made with literally pantyhose and silk screen and man you're taking it back man you're taking it back [Laughter] right but it can it you know you don't have to have all the equipment you can do it at home you can do simple extractions at home and people should try if you're a home grower definitely try to do that go to the store go to the dispensary buy some see what theirs is like and then try to mimic it right yeah 100 there's a lot of information out there on the web these days uh you can follow an array of guys on instagram too um that are really interested it seems like in letting people know how to do this i gather a lot of information just from perusing instagram man following people that i look up to that i know we're doing big things out here in the industry and you know if you're familiar with colorado's or rosin scene you know who i'm talking about but you can find some information out there don't be scared of it man you can get the equipment relatively easy and it's relatively easy to use and you know learning curve with anything i mean don't expect you know just get it and then all of a sudden you know you got what you but it takes a little bit but you curiosity man you got to want to do it you know you got to be about it that's all i'm going to say you know like yeah you know if like if you like extractions and you like smoking extractions and you have access to flour and you know you have opportunity to do it you're in a state that allows you to do it i say do it absolutely i believe that state can be a state of well-being 100 so uh yeah get out there grow some weed man make some extract of it roll some joints with it yeah pass it along to your friends and your family and then grow some more do it yeah keep it going man keep it down great chat with you man likewise man i really appreciate you having me it's uh you know really an honor being on this show and i you know sharing the information that i possess here which you know take it for what you want but uh yeah man you know what i love about you man is next year you're gonna be on a totally different plane with this we should do another one next year and see where you're coming out with it you just learned so much you're like a sponge man i'll come out there i'll i'll come see you in okc next year we'll do it out there oh yeah hey absolutely we'll we'll uh yeah man we'll make some we meant to make some this year but it didn't work out just yeah that's what that makes yeah we'll get it going man no worries come you know do some fishing as well oh well i don't know man you tear it up a little bit too much [Laughter] i need my fish in my pond you're catching them all come on man i look forward to it chris man i miss you guys likewise man it was good chatting with you this morning thanks again this is uh chris with solely solvent list how can how can people look you up chris oh you can find us on instagram uh we're a solely dot solving lesson that's s-o-u-l-y dot solventless pretty easy to find yeah man so we not solving this um check us out we got some you know good things happening here very soon and uh yeah be on the lookout for us thanks again chris man appreciate it thank you and have a good one too oh man i tell you after that episode i want to sit back and uh vape up some some good solventless extractor maybe even go back and get myself some bubble hash and sprinkle some on a nice large joint you know i think i might have ruined myself that extract years ago by making uh trainwreck keefe joints and and train wreck bubble hash joints i probably lost a couple years smoking dust and i hope you guys learned a lot about extracts and solventless extracts today you know they're they're they're not dangerous they're safe it's just water um not that like hydrocarbon products are dangerous either but but many people have an aversion to them but hey you shouldn't if you're interested in you know uh solventless extracts or bubble hash man you should try something if you can make it at home you can buy a lot of the materials online you can always check us out at cultivate colorado.com cultivateokc.com hey if you haven't already subscribed to our podcast please do that's the real dirt podcast with chip baker and check out our youtube channel man we're going to put all of our episodes on there from the past we're going to have all our new episodes on there so you'll be able to listen to all 70 80 90 episodes on youtube at your will so thanks a lot for joining us again today yeah man the next time you're out there in the world the next time you're at a dispensary ask the dispensary about solventless extracts ask them their opinion um ask them to show you some this has been chip with real dirt thanks again", "tq185XBggYE": "what's up you guys this style on us today a [ __ ] beautiful day Suns going down it's nighttime already but it was still a beautiful [ __ ] day was warm sunny broke my bike I'm cruising around and stuff I should take a video seems like that but let's get to it guys I got a couple of new things you've probably seen on Donny clams channel cuz we all we had a sesh not too long ago it was here at my house and a couple of these pieces you already seen most likely but you haven't seen this one yet because this one's a brand new not even under clams channel I got this like a day after we had that [ __ ] sesh the ship in a bottle guys check it out I got my email on there ready and hot to ship in a bottle it's pretty [ __ ] sick it's a little girly it has like dolphins and mermaids and [ __ ] on it but it was up for oxygen on Instagram and I'm just to get bounced up so I had to hurry up and Scooby and I got my notes written down on my Xfinity bill guys because I couldn't remember which which was which from this class I forgot so ship in a bottle comes shipping a bottle with Illuminati sales which is badass from Mickelson studios I got this on Instagram remember some studios pretty [ __ ] sick badass so we're gonna have to miss first because my email is

little warm in here so probably to get the dab sweat just to let you guys know what else is there oh yeah so I got this straight tube right here from Bebo Baggins we didn't have this meeting mind Arnie sesh but I'm gonna try and get to hittin that today ten mill down stone and comes with a bowl tend to a bowl and it comes with cut that directional program pretty [ __ ] safe and what else I got this straight to my robbers and straight tube so I got the disease were pending to match the straight tube and I don't think I've ever shown this in a video this is my traveling too that I care my stuff like filthy my nails gross but sometimes are on the go you can't you get so turned over a ring flip on this [ __ ] scary guys I would go for a hot one but I'm too scared so not today and last but definitely not least I got my [ __ ] Bulldog right here just like my dog key here is nailed walking around sometimes this is who is this I didn't write this one down because I remember it's a Swaney glass guys go check him out he makes a lot of different bulldogs and he's pretty [ __ ] sick check them out this is a matching car cap pull on the dog right there on the back and dependi got the mean eyes guys I mean eyes look how do you mean after this after this day that's when I look like well yeah I also got some Kindle push still the Cuban dress if I turn it sideways but I'm scared to show you let's keep this in the fridge but I don't give a [ __ ] guys a lot of these guys I still have left over from my session with Donnie because the day after that I went on tolerance break so right after that [ __ ] heavy access that we had I quit smoking for like a good 10 days I was gonna go all the way to 420 but I gave in I guess you could say like on the tenth day something like that I smoked that that I was trying huh let's get to it guys bust out the [ __ ] bust out the happy daddy size detail and that [ __ ] is amazing and I got this because it's gonna kill me the dad's not so let's see I've adapted a at all so I'm gonna be [ __ ] coffin like what's his name I do don't [ __ ] Instagram Matias or Mattias his name is the white no way dude coughing I can't problem yeah it's been a while since I had a fully clear piece and it's pretty [ __ ] refreshing eleve not a clear thesis so here we go guys Cheers oh yeah first half of the day disconnect the cord that's just to keep it safe you don't want to kick your email when they pull your old piece with you because that's happened before so never keep it you know connected and once you're [ __ ] ready to use it I'll tell you that right now let that cool down who will not be hot guys I don't even notice I got band-aids on my finger thumb when I quit smoking I was trying out a new hobby trying out a wood carving whittling and stuff so I was doing that for the water still him so if I ever get confident enough to show you something that I made all busted out on you guys I'm [ __ ] hot from that one man that we've got a pretty hot still no let's see I will go the bebo Baggins 110 million so I guess I use the matching carve cap I guess as you can see I'm all shiny sweated Abdo like I said I love the clear you see that [ __ ] fill up and then you watch you just need to watch yourself empty it that's what and I got this Bebo Baggins as a traveller piece I haven't took it nowhere but I got another traveler piece but while I was waiting for it in the mail I picked up this local leave and that's why I carry this when I land so I'm supposed to carry that woman but I got to be here and bought this one so this should be my new traveler piece because if I break it I won't be I said if I break the mat robbed not that this isn't a top-quality piece because it is it's just more and if I break it I won't be you know how will be a sad that's that's the main reason why I got to travel around with it well yeah I don't think that showed my [ __ ] my Ewok handbook dispenser pretty sick it's an Ewok but I can get a teddy bear and a hoodie so you guys can watch along but this is a teddy bear and I [ __ ] hated mmm I got that from a glass P AV I believe on Instagram that's pretty sick that auctions all time let's hope it's not you man along that quick Cheers [Applause] was a little hot not too hot damn hoo-hah for sure I was Harlow harsh Kaizen but I won't recover don't worry I'll be fine damn that may be extra hot [ __ ] man what to do now I'm sweating guys check that out oh you could get me a [ __ ] dad tower it's about that season guys doubt towel season or something [ __ ] just being hot I'm big dude so I'm always sweating it [ __ ] so it's about time to bust out the custom towels my name on him and [ __ ] so Bryce he knows pretty soon I knew it right now the [ __ ] there's something in my line of sight that you guys haven't seen before my show cheese pretty [ __ ] sick it's [ __ ] stoner lungs backwards so you can see what that says stoner loans right there and never guess why [ __ ] got this my little brother made me this in welding class in high school it's pretty [ __ ] sick it just chunks the metal screwed together and he sent me a snap of him getting this etched on I put some type of machine they have at their school and in the video in the video of the snap he showed me there's a cop there's a cop right there while he's doing it and I was like oh [ __ ] did you get in trouble and he said no the cop was helping him with the software of the the of the laser the laser machine that put my name that put my name on there he was showing my do it or whatever so I thought that's pretty funny a cop is up so a cop helped my brother make those thongs for me my breasts still can't breathe felt like I ran my mouth the last one was a tad bit too hot I said it before and I'll say it again I'll say I did five more times that game where this video is over all right let's do another one [ __ ] the Bulldog and I was gonna hit off the mat Rob but I don't look for the Bulldog and you can go into here because I'm gonna get the super super tech swings and I don't have a towel near me so I'm in the video after this gap guys okay you know should be pulled down since I'm not hitting is I'm not hitting the metro see how many different chains for these I think I'm going to go to the jewelry store and get like a gold rope chain like part the biggest one they sell which is pretty [ __ ] thin and don't wear one of those gold chain with this because no guys know I like my gold here we go what should we dad on let's see let's go for some of the billionaires or [ __ ] hmm it's funny I bought this sari I bought this like the day after my tolerance break and I wasn't gonna smoke none of it because I was just gonna wait until 4/20 everywhere till my date and what happened oh yeah so I went to my dad's and my dad's like oh no we have to [ __ ] them try it you only spend $1000 on that we have to throw that smoke it right now I was like all right [ __ ] it I'll smother levy and my dad him to dabbed or nothing but he'll you know I don't have to have an equipment he's strictly joined smoker but he had a [ __ ] dry dry pipe so pack a fatass bowl and I went I scooped a bunch of it on there hmm I scooped a bunch of it on there and we smoked that whole [ __ ] bow and he was pretty stone cuz he uh he's on a concentrate smoker he's a straight flower strictly flower smoker but he was hell excited I'm his I got $1,000 [ __ ] yeah and so it's pretty funny this I never seen him that stoned and we smoked for a couple years so what's that one on there [ __ ] Gold these guys fine I started to cool down from that last dad man all right here we go time to get hot again whoo these dads make it hot um should I use this Clark Kent I think i'ma go with the directional guys all the right here she got to look at it but he didn't go with the direction this one this is rebel rebels glass good lookin out rebel good it's right on there so this kind of swinging sweeney blacks he gets his inspiration from his own bulldog and follow me on snapchat you guys not got a bulldog soon so i had to [ __ ] to pick this [ __ ] up man and I got a bulldog tattoo on my leg and it's just it's just badass I love my dog I love this piece it's pretty sick so whenever you hear hear that [ __ ] tapping town walking around on the that's just my dog's a nail about hardwood that's all that is are you hearing [ __ ] breathing on a premie he's asleep right now he's a lazy [ __ ] but I loved him yeah his birthday is April 1st so it's coming up he's about to be 5 he's about to be 5 for 5 year he's my first dog I never had a dog so it's pretty and he's pretty amazing he's such a character that's why he's tattooed on my leg he's my first dog and I'll never forget him he might come walking out here just because I'm talking about him he's funny like that here we go laughs Cheers you know caught them up with a [ __ ] cheers guys I wonder what I'm dealing with throwing over my phone there's a Dave & Buster's ashtray behind it aren't you guys I'm gonna get out here drink some water maybe do a DAB after I recover but I'm out of here see you guys next time please", "OI4eHrhmVjE": "oh you guys want a big Dan over here coming back at you yeah and uh once again we're gonna go over THC diamonds and uh yeah let's get to it so uh a lot a lot a lot of people been asking me all kinds of questions all that stuff I guess some of you guys really don't even know what it is I see a lot of different questions different comments and I just wanted to go over it I've got a fresh fresh batch right here just put that down get better lighting so basically what you're looking at is high cannabinoid full-spectrum extract or HCF se now there is a high Torpy full-spectrum extract that is very similar but that's basically just the the tur Playa poured off this is just the cannabinoid portion which is our mainly THC a so yeah guys uh a lot of questions on how it's made if you can make it without dewaxing if you can make it without a closed loop system if what exactly is it what's the difference between this and Shatter is that contaminants left all that stuff so I'll try to go over a few questions and answer them the best I can [Applause] first thing there is no contaminants this is fully d waxed at negative 50 degrees using dry ice in the columns now some of you guys might not be familiar with B HOH extractions in general and if that's the case don't don't try making this stuff again if you only have trim or you know like a zip or something like that a flower don't don't waste your time making this stuff you definitely need enough of Fayum material to make diamonds this right here is about a hundred grams and I've been using my six inch by 36 inch column which fits five pounds in the closed-loop system so it's a fairly big common material column so I do run a lot of flowers you know what I mean and I do I do a live run I don't fresh no fresh frozen none of that basically and you can mix trains this is a couple of different strains in here and when I do Fino hunts and I say you can't get a full unit off of a female like a few plants or whatever then you got like 40 different strains growing and you don't just want you know a few zips here a few zips there you just want you know straight units to do what you got to do I'll end up just running it all just like this and making a mixed batch it provides great flavor especially if you mix in like Heitor P strain with a high THC strain you could get some great results just taking a few puffs and so bear with me guys if I if I take a little pause or just taking a few puffs but um yeah so the main thing is is there's no containment it's we're running this do you wax with a two micron lab filter so um and we're running all clean great perfectly indoor flowers no pesticides none of that stuff I don't even now spray foliar sprays at all not even in veg I just don't see a need for foliar sprays but that's a whole nother subject so yeah that that's that process as far that as that goes now can you just make shatter and then turn turn it into this I'm not sure I don't do that maybe you could get like a zip a shadow throw it in a jar spray some butane in it let it sit and it might stop crystal getting some crystals in there and reform and seems like a possibility I think the science behind it will work but um that's not how we do it and to get you know to get better results like this with a nice gold interrupts and a clarity on your diamonds you're gonna need a high end flowers and fresh is best it contains more chirps and also the the trichome heads ain't all [ __ ] up and smushed and shakin around and beat up so those fresh heads definitely uh definitely cause good diamonds to form you know what I mean so if you got all your nice fresh heads everything's nice then you're gonna end up with a nice product like this now as far as making this without dewaxing I'm sure it's possible I think if you leave the lipids and the waxes in there I think the diamonds form more jaggedy and I think the lipids and stuff will stick to the diamond so you won't get such a pure product and your diamonds will contain those waxes will end up sticking to them and stuff like that so it is what it is as far as open blasting right into a jar I'm sure it couldn't be done again I don't see why not you know you're doing the same method just way too deep waxing and close up system it's just like a little bit better so I'm sure you know people at home still doing that old tech with glass tubes or whatever they're doing I'm sure it could be done that way as well but again guys if you're only running little runs and you just you know got a blast like a zip into a small jar you know you might get a little crystal formation but at the end of the day you know who wants to waste two weeks just to get like a gram or something like that so I don't see that very uh you know very uh worth doing but um anyways yeah so basic method you know you take your take your collection pop dump it into a jar leave some butane in there make sure it's soupy make sure it has enough of butane and then basically you could do it in room temp dried ice whatever you want just say your jar over there and don't [ __ ] with it and after five days you'll start seeing a little bit of crystals growing at the bottom and then after 14 days you'll have the biggest diamonds that your product will produce which all is strain dependant it's all up to the strain around how high the THC is and stuff like that now again the crystals that you see are THCA and the source that you see is uh cannabinoids and turkeys so the sauce will contain CBD CBG cbn ta CB and a bunch of other cannabinoids as well as your terpenes like lemonade mersin piney and stuff like that so I hope this helps explain I know there's a lot of questions about it and I know you guys are you know there's not a lot of people sharing sharing the info but basically the Diamonds just formed wit time it doesn't really have anything to do a pressure or anything like that as far as residual solvents you can't take this in vac it again when it's done like you could take these and just pop it in the back at that point you're just pretty much backing off terpenes after 14 days and at room temperature and there is uh under 100 ppm s of residual solvents left now in most states is a 5000 ppm limit so again 100 ppm s is like nothing and your shatter your wax probably has more butane trapped in it then this stuff does some people like to say the bigger diamonds do trap more butane I find that it's not the case and that's through different testing from different labs stuff like that anything that goes out has to be tested has to pass especially in the recreational market so yeah as far as residual solvents yeah there's no I'm confident to say there's no residual solvents that will not pass a test I'm not the only one making this stuff there's plenty of people out here doing it um I'm just basically the only one showing you how it's done and not been in top secret I feel like it's not a big deal again I made the first diamonds myself by accident by storing runs when you're doing lots of runs sometimes you don't have room in your back chamber so you'll dump it in a jar and you'll see you jaws out in a cooler or somewhere in the fridge or wherever you keep them and you'll you know you'll keep those in fact those another day and then when you're doing multiple runs you might have 16 20 jars stashed up and some may sit for a week or so and then uh yeah after a week I started noticing that it's not separate and looking a little weird and then now when I dumped it out to vac it I noticed that there was a big tarp layer really liquidy and then I noticed that there was big chunks of crystals and I was like Gil what what the [ __ ] is that and after further examining it I noticed that those are straight Tac egg diamonds and um yeah basically that's how that's how a lot of us figured it out that's how I myself figured it out by accident and um ya know again you can take all these diamonds out and wash that with pentane or something like that and then purge that off and just have have your have your Terps in a different layer and your diamonds in a different layer but this is a full spectrum extract so it hasn't been separated I didn't make diamonds and then added Terps back in or anything like that this is just full spectrum from the plants so you get every single thing that's in the actual flower that you wanted that makes for a more pleasurable smoking experience and I think that's right now I think this is the most superior extract on the market and it speaks for itself so yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video smash the like button if it helps you out if you like it subscribe share comment holler at your boy and any questions just when I'm in the comments visit the store he mailed me do whatever you got to do and I'm always here to help so I hope that explains everything guys big Dan over and out peace out fellas [Music] [Music]", "c9p8j4tiK0Q": "[Music] hey everyone eric here from peer pressure it has been a while since we've gotten a chance to do solventless review really excited to sit down with pyramid today and review their pineapple chunk live rosin pax pod it is great as a quick disclaimer as a part of our protocols we check everyone's temperature and do contact tracing so this interview was conducted without masks just wanted to explain that we're trying to keep everything above board so it's nice and safe for these interviews all right watch on thanks for joining us today i had the pleasure of reviewing pyramids pineapple chunk hybrid solventless rosin pod these pods are 100 hash rosin which makes the flavor profile and effect vastly superior to other ones out there that i've gotten to try the pineapple chunk is a really nice hybrid very middle of the road effect wise and you would expect it to be pretty fruity but in this case we found that it was really hashy when i was smoking it it really reminded me of some old-school bubble hash that we used to put on bolt hoppers so one of the coolest things about these pyramid pods is that they're actually taking advantage of paxpod's smartpod technology which means that when you connect it with the app on your phone it's going to tell you all kinds of cool things about the strain but that it's also got pre-loaded temperature settings right onto it so if you take a small rip it's going to run at a very low temperature preserving your terpenes or if you really want to go for it it can also ramp the temperature up so you can blow a huge cloud overall this technology is really really cool so the color is really nice the effect is not going to put you to sleep it's not going to get you up and excited it's a nice mid-time day high that you can kind of just ride out wherever you're going and like i said before the pineapple notes are pretty minimal what you're really getting in this card or at least what i found was a lovely hashy kind of sweet flavor that came through and just boosted my day it's a nice break from whatever's going on in your day at that moment and it's really easy to consume with these packs of vaporizers eric here with peer pressure really excited to have pyramid on the show we're going to do some intros and then start talking about hash canvas processing everything and then we'll start talking about these products so let's start off with jake tell us a little bit about yourself hey eric thanks for having us today um yeah my name is jake berry i started pyramid with my business partner coley walsh about six years ago now um i moved out here originally from texas after graduating from college and i um started off as a button in the industry um that was my first gig here and i quickly realized that you know what i really want to move into the extraction side of things and we i really saw a niche there that i feel i felt like we could kind of build a brand around now um at that point vape pens were really just getting started and it quickly became one of my favorite ways to smoke as a blood tender and i just saw the growth happening and you know coley was actually my boss at the dispensary and you know talking to him i was like hey why don't we why don't we look into this why don't we why don't we do this you know i feel like i can find the funding for us to do this and get this up and going yeah and um so we did we started looking around for different licenses and back then i mean it was nightmarish to find a new thing um you know to get into the industry was very difficult and [Music] just googling and going through different municipalities web pages i found the city of we ridge it was the second city i called um and asked them about it and it turns out they were having a lottery within 30 days so um it had just been announced and like happenstance it happened to stumble upon it started applying for and doing the application i had never done something like this in my life um and kind of had to quickly figure things out at that point cole and i were both still working at the dispensary while trying to do all this on our days off finished the app got it in and happened to win the lottery and here you are and here we are now that's incredible uh and matt tell us a little bit about yourself uh what got you in the industry and what do you do at pyramid i'm matt cease i'm the lab manager at pyramid i've been there for about a year and a half now i got my start out in the garage my cousin was growing and he just needed somebody to do some extractions unfortunately butane none of that was like an option so it was all just bubble hash and rosin started with a hair straightener and five gallon bubble bags and it's just grown from there wow cool so in your role as the lab manager at pyramid what kinds of extraction and processes do you oversee now supercritical co2 okay all the ethanol post extraction the winterization distillation we run white film and also overseeing all the solvents cool okay and you guys are mainly focused on bubble hash and rosin you guys do any sift we don't do any sift unfortunately we tried to do sift in the beginning but all of our product just kind of came out dark okay so not the way you guys wanted the route we wanted to go okay cool so jake you started as a bud tender now you're running your own company with coley does it look like being the ceo of pyramid put us in your shoes running a cannabis company what does that look like um you know i think a lot of people think it's this super glamorous job and you know it's actually a lot of work um you know i would say both of us um you know we're five years in now and we're both probably averaging 60 to 70 hours a week typically um you know i wake up at 6 00 a.m i am at work no later than 8 30 and i stay till you know six seven sometimes and so it's a very busy um job and uh but it's super rewarding and that's the great part like i go to work every day and i love my job and so i feel like i hit the lottery like the hours don't matter you know it's super enjoyable um but it's just it's also just exciting like everything like my feeling and my favorite part personally is launching these new products you know getting into uh the solventless side of the thing like of the industry was something very interesting for for me to do in launch this is just my favorite like parts of being the ceo is saying you know giving the company a vision and saying look this is where i see us going this is something that i think we want to do and launch you know and not everything works out you know you can definitely have those you know stinkers happen but um the rising line is going well you know it was something that we really wanted to get into and it's going great and similarly to us going into michigan yeah you know so no that's awesome and you know for a follow-up to that you know what are some of the pieces of advice that you would give to someone who wants to be a cannabis business owner you know what what would you offer to someone who's either trying to get into it or is at the very beginning stage you know now you're five years deep you know um don't get intimidated it's a very very intimidating um experience you know i was 23 when i got into the so you're very young yeah i'm 29 now um and it's very intimidating especially if you don't have a lot of that you know experience and background but just be confident and and continue to stay humble throughout the process because you're going to get hit honestly like along the way so just kind of like keep persevering and working hard and you know don't focus on the little things you know there's a lot bigger fish to fry in the day and like if you get caught up on every everything along the way you know it's you're never going to get there so just focus on what on your goal and and keep working towards it and eventually it'll happen well it sounds like you've built a good team around you you know are there any aspects of team building or like you know bringing on the right lab manager to do the work is there anything that's worth mentioning there definitely um the industry is an interesting place to work in um you know there's a lot of bosses out there that you know might not connect with their employees i think um and so it kind of goes back to that being humble part that i was mentioning yeah you know start this and and work hard towards it but build that relationship with the people you work with you know i'm no i'm nobody in this in the grand scheme of things you know like i i'm more showing up to work every day and working and you know i want to hire people that want to come to work every day that are happy and excited and can feel like that they can connect with me more you know they see me working every day yeah so hopefully that inspires them to also come here and work and show up and so hiring the right people is super key yeah but keep that family mentality um and that's something that i learned from my parents you know and like my culture of just keeping that cohesive bond between everybody and so you know i try to say hello to everybody whenever i come to work every day and um and um i would say people should do that you know if they're looking to start something yeah so word of the y's for everyone who's listening uh pay attention to your company culture obviously that can make all the difference honestly it'll make it break you your company culture is so so important um you know like our christmas parties are like my favorite thing to do every single year it's like we play good yeah we play um white elephant and it's just fun it's it's a good time to let loose everybody to just kind of poke from each other and that's the other thing don't take yourself too seriously i really don't take myself too seriously i mean look at my you know joke around with people you know have those experiences and and be be relatable once you think you're better than anybody else you're gonna very easily no longer be able to succeed especially in this industry yeah so no that that's great advice matt you know to shift gears a little bit tell me about what a day in the life looks like of you the lab manager managing all these different processes all these extraction methods and then you know solvent lists at the end of the day being perhaps your top shelf product you know what what is what does a day look like for you it is extremely busy i'll start off by saying that that's true everything has to be done very very particularly like very peculiar with everything that's done cleanliness i mean just that alone takes up a huge part of the day a lot of people don't focus a lot on that but anything that your product touches it gets on your product it's in the end product people are smoking it it's just not good for anybody but the lab starts off you know you turn the lights on you fire up all the machines and it's just making sure that nothing's broken first so like a lot a lot of our equipment's running overnight with a super critical co2 extraction you know matt is constantly like reloading the equipment setting it up for running it and then he has to set up a run for overnight so you know in order to kind of reach our goals and and keep up with the production of all of our sales you know he's got to be on point all day long you know a lot of people think that it's just kind of come to work and get high and hang out and no and that's like ass buster yeah yeah it's unbelievable yeah that's not the industry you know and so um if that's what you think is happening here you know that that's not the case you know everybody who works for a pyramid works incredibly hard and um you know and and we try to keep that environment going for them so we get in the lab turn on the lights make sure everything's still functioning properly and following that it's redoing the process that you did the day before all of it's the most labor-intensive job i think i've ever had i really i have a hard time even describing like where i start and where i end but it's always changing too it's like and there's always a new fire there's a new problem every single day that you have to solve it's like being a detective a mechanic and then a scientist you're definitely not a scientist right away you're not a chemist you come in and it's okay what's broken all right let me pull out the wrenches let me pull out the tools let's fix this machine and then as you're fixing that machine chances are something somewhere else is just not going perfectly so you bounce around the lab constantly it's like a ping pong ball and then introducing solvent list to our line actually kind of let me slow down a lot the process is much more much more connected i would say like actually getting to wash you know you're in touch with everything in tune with everything and then when you get to the rosin press it takes finesse throughout the press isn't something you go up to and go and pull the handle and get beautiful rosin it's actually a lot of finesse a lot a lot of finesse well that's really interesting and you know talking about connecting with the plant connecting with solvent lists you know why did you guys bring solvent lists on in the first place and i i'd love to get both of your perspectives on this i mean i'm sure you were advocating for it as someone who started off doing ice water hash absolutely no it was mainly the quality you can't you can't reach the uh the terpene profile on anything else in my opinion than you can with live rosin it tastes so true to the plant and it brings me back to kind of like the original days when i first started smoking weed it has that real true wheat taste when i smoke some concentrates they almost all taste the same to me a little bit like vho co2 extractions there's slight differences but each strain has the same particular taste to them with live rosin i've noticed it brings out way more of the flavors that you don't originally notice yeah and i would have to agree with him completely there you know i remember when i first started smoking you know a long time time ago now um it was so exciting to like experience the next the next bag the next pickup you know and um and just try something new and fill a different experience yeah and i i i kind of agree with what matt's saying is concentrates you can definitely notice the self differences but i think a lot of it's harder for people to with certain things that you just with rosin especially with live rosin um it's extremely pronounced exactly essentially and i'm immediately pronounced um and you know everything every wash is different and you know and kind of going back to original question you know yeah you know matt was pushing for something you know and coley and i at the same time we're looking for kind of that we wanted that high-end option as part of our portfolio of different things that we offer and um with our relationship with pax and just like our vape experiences we felt like we could really kind of bring something new um and you know we wanted that that option so it was kind of a mixture of you know matt's experience with bubble hash prior to and saying you know this is something that's becoming a thing me kind of realizing that it's on the come up as well and uh saying you know what let's produce this new high-end product um for our consumers so that's awesome and you know when you're thinking about making a solvent-less product as the lab manager what are you trying to look at is it you know intense strain selection are you guys sourcing specific things from your own garden you know walk me through a little bit how you select the strains that you do that you decide to wash and process mostly it's trial and error unfortunately we do small test washes on things if we need to find out what the yields will be and stuff like that from our grow you know we had some really good things like cherry cake wedding cake uh we've been running this pineapple chunk that we were just playing here today was something that that yielded on the really low side unfortunately but the quality of it is just so good that yeah you can't had to go for it you have to yeah and uh yeah and and i guess you know i i do a lot of the sourcing in the material okay you know um and we've attended some of y'all's classes actually and um and and heard advice from you all you know you guys are the experts honestly at the end of the day you guys have been doing this for a long time and that kind of moves our strength selection um to a certain degree and but finding those relationships of those quality growers is difficult you know and so we have a very small grow um and uh our product typically that comes out of there washes really well i think a lot of that's attributed to the growing style and the lights that we use we use three fifteen watt leds we've got flour under them and the turkey profile comes you know at the end of flowers really really good and so um yeah the yields are very low but transferring that flower into rosin um it tends to come through exceptionally without it rises brings the quality up that much higher yeah that's why i personally believe i mean i noticed it on our other extraction methods as well is that um the lights matter so much um you know from outdoor to greenhouse to you know uh hbs lights to um lec's um there's such a unique difference that you kind of noticed from being in the industry for so long um and but otherwise yeah you know i mean we can only provide a little bit amount of what we produce so we've got to go to outside sources and find and make those relationships with different grow facilities that can provide us that high quality material so and when you get some high quality material that jake has said you know hey man we're getting the strain in you know let's go for it how do you guys decide which solidless products you're going to turn it into for example you know we've got pax pods with us we've got some grams of some live rosin you know do you make a determination beforehand of where you want that material to go we just started doing the grams so it's not even we haven't released it to the market yet all right everyone exclusive coming out in the next couple weeks realistically so we're actually going to start running and pressing a lot more than we have been um to release these these grams okay so it's been pods first and now we're getting into grams yes sir cool and how what what does that look like are you guys thinking about pretty much just doing live rosin uh what what does that release look like it'll just just be live rosin um the big thing is we haven't really gotten to do too much testing on making sauces or batters and what we're going to do yet whether it's going to be just a crumble uh it's going to come fresh off the press so we still have to work out some kinks there i'm guessing it probably some r d that went into getting these pens right um yeah absolutely yeah that was a huge struggle i mean figuring all that out and pins are not easy like yeah hey no we can be honest about that and you know i think everyone who's tuned in and watching now you know we're not here to tell everyone that making a rosin pen is something that you can just pick up and do on day one so for the rosin pens specifically what were some of the hurdles that you guys went through to now come out with what is an award-winning product getting everything off the press and out of the bags like washing is super easy doing the rosin press was super easy getting the actual oil into the carts and the pods and getting them to flow correctly and hit correctly was by far the most part like the most difficult part that we had and that's just the viscosity getting you know getting the viscosity i mean as you know when your first comes off the press most of it's still thca so it's going to crystallize it's going to butter up and in order to flow in a cart you need it to be liquid so it has to be de-carbed back into thc and when you're doing that there's just there's a lot of problems that can arise so it took you guys definitely some trial and error uh some missteps but now we're at a point where you guys have a product that it looks like you're super proud of absolutely yeah you know and i i think you know some of the to expound on what matt was saying is the terpene retention you know what do people want out of rosin they want it to taste it's amazing the best product they've ever had closest to the plant yeah getting that right on that post process after the press is so integral to like what we do to make a quality product and i mean that took him long long time to figure it out uh just to keep that terpene retention and then beyond that yeah filling is is a whole different thing this isn't like this you know i can't crank the heat up and pump it in a cart yeah and have it flow well you know and so um there's still trial and error in that you know it's like you gotta it takes a while to really dial it in and um we feel like we've gotten into a pretty good spot right now obviously we release the product but there's always ways we can improve upon our process so i'd love to hear from you matt you know you said that this was one of the first pens that you guys made and it won an award tell us a little bit about the trophy we've got on the table here and what the story is behind that one yeah so this was a face-off og it was actually our very first wash in our new wash machine it was our very first time on the rosin press first time trying to de-carve things into a cart so there was there was a lot of lost face-off og grams yeah i apologize to them but um yeah it's it you know it's a really difficult process but we're here today you know we got everything dialed in yeah that's that's a cool story yeah considering it's our first watch we're i mean we were surprised when it came through you know it was it was something where we were i mean i i think i was pushing that we were in the middle of developing this product and release and we wanted to get it in before um this competition and you know i was you know on the back of matt saying get this going let's go let's go let's let's be let's enter this you know hopefully we'll something good will come out of it and it happened to and it happened to be his first wash which is ridiculous in itself but super happy no that's awesome to see you guys hitting a home run like that tell me a little bit about your relationship with pax you know we've got some products here you guys are putting your rosin pens in pax pods uh walk me through that sure um so we've been a pax partner for i think going on two years now two and a half years um and we launched with obviously our other products and pax you know provides the hardware provides the battery you know the actual pod system but you know everything that's inside of that you're smoking is is directly from us or any of the other partners that are on the platform um we there was no rosin on that platform at all and that's where we really saw like a good way to to get in and you know we wanted to launch this so this is actually the first rosin pod packs anything um in in the market in colorado no just in nature nationwide yeah this is the first rosin pax pod that you can consume very cool um and so we saw that kind of that lane that we wanted to get into that we kind of went along with our goal of you know having a really high end product that we could sell and we figured pairing it with like our packs you know distributorship was a really good move and so that's kind of how we got there um but yeah you know these things aren't the same either you know like a 510 cart is much different than a pack spot and we have different feeling techniques for each of those options um and so there's a lot of r d on that back end too that like our production manager aaron really had to play around with to figure out how to make these work well you know you don't want someone to get a product to try it and not work and so figuring that out was was difficult yeah so you and aaron were working hard to bring these products here today all right so we've got pineapple chunk rosin on deck both in live rosin pax pod form as well as grams uh how did this strain fall into your hands it starts off in house with our grow and then i hand select the nugs that we're going to use to wash we hand wash i don't advise anybody to use a drill in a paddle it's just just don't do it it's not worth it it's going to waste your time following that we throw them in a two and a half well actually we from there we select which trichomes are going to be the best to press you don't want to just i mean you can mix all of your all of your bubble hash selections together but you're not going to get the greatest quality that you could by selecting which trichomes are better which in this case was the 90 to 120 micron range following that selection they go in the freeze dryer we freeze dry them yeah and then we load them up in two and a half by nine pure pressure bags set them on the peer pressure pike's peak version yeah and we press it around 180 185 degrees i like to press until the oil will start to darken up or pretty much you can tell by as you're adding pressure you'll see possibly the oil darkening up a little bit i like to stop right around that point yeah and that's a lot of trial and error though i mean yeah it varies honestly not even from strange terrain each press will vary like i said it's a lot of finesse when you're working the press it's not something you just pull the handle and you get your perfect oil but so there's some trial and error there you know as far as the grow since you know we talk so much about growing and how important that obviously is for all forms of extraction but especially solventless tell me a little bit about your grow and you know how you guys got a product this good yeah so um all the genetics we've gotten have been from growers around uh colorado um we fl we we grow in a deep water culture system so we use a current culture system um and then we fly under 351 lec's we really feel like the end product while you might not get as big of yields like you know bigger buds we definitely get a higher quality product like in our wash specifically or in our extracts because we don't really sell any weight um all of it goes right into our process um so we either process it into our you know distillates or we process it into our co2 oil or now a lot of it's going right to fresh frozen so um you know the harvest is very very important really knowing what you're doing there is it is key to making the wash go well um you want to harvest right away you know a lot of people think that oh it's okay to you know buck these buds and let them sit here while i finish this harvest no you want to go very very quickly and go um on a plant my plant basis almost um you know you really don't want them to be sitting around for any more than 20 30 minutes so wow so it's a quick d fan um you know all right in the stock and then you buck the buds very quickly um everything we cure is in turkey bags typically and that's kind of what we do for our fresh resin as well so you know pluck buck bag and throw it in the freezer immediately it's very important um to not get too much water cotton content because it definitely will affect the wash on the back end oh so you guys have it nailed down that was almost like a little limerick i i like that so we've got pineapple chunk with us what are some strains that you guys like to smoke start with you matt i've got a weird palette personally one of my favorites right now is mandarin dreams i absolutely love that strange i mean it just sounds nice i also love bananas anything with banana in it is always a go-to for me and then cheese bio cheese any kind of cheese uk cheese i love cheese cheese okay cheesy terms i can't get enough cheese that's awesome what about you uh you know i'm big on the cheese game too um cheese quake is like one of my favorite strains ever um i haven't seen her around in a long time um i don't know how little washes we haven't gotten a chance to watch something like that but i also really like a lot of sub cool genetics personally um so like space queen is amazing crossed with anything jelly bean nine pound hammer jelly beans my favorites hands down yeah and um that's one strain that i really want to wash um and so that'll be coming in the pipeline too awesome so that's kind of yeah that's my favorite strain we're gonna do it at some point okay okay that's right i think you get a decision in there you know i would also love to learn you know before we right before we get into the review here you know let's wrap this up with tell me a little bit about what does pyramid stand for like what are your guys's philosophies um you know it's a very difficult question especially put into words um you know when coley and i started out we you know we were just trying to to get get things going and you know it was really hard to to kind of figure out what we wanted to stand for as a company and you know i think the biggest thing that kind of we look for and and that we want like our message to be is we just want to be a good place to work you know i feel like a lot of people are very unsatisfied in their life and and we want people to enjoy coming to work with us you know not for us but with us on this and so you know beyond that um you know personally like i really like um kind of able to you know expand upon my heritage and and show that you know minorities can be successful in this space um and uh and so i think that's something that we really have going for us there is um anybody can can get into this you know it doesn't have to be one person the other so you know we really are interested in in working with communities of color yeah um and you know that's kind of one of the big things we're doing in michigan specifically we're working in a um kind of a lower income area and bring jobs bring jobs to those areas you know bring business back into these areas that have you know over time have have gotten the shorten the stick here um and so you know i i wouldn't say we have a you know i'm not the marketing guy who's gonna tell you this is our philosophy this is our mantra sure i think it's more of just like inside of us yeah this is kind of who we are as people and we want this to come through on our business side as well so yeah that i mean that's a great explanation jake walk me through what do we have on the table here uh and what are we gonna review so today we are going to review our um pineapple chunk live rosin pods um we don't have a rate today so we'll kind of just let you guys look at bigger hams um and then we're also going to kind of show you guys the newest tech coming out of packs that a lot of people have not experienced or seen yet cool um and so i'll kind of review through that real quick okay yeah please show me break it out um all right so you know pax right now um just released this product it is the pax era pro they've added a lot of really cool tech into this product that is is very new uh i love the packaging to start off with yeah and then honestly the feel of it is is it's it's really premium you know i think pax really wants to be that apple of um of uh vaporizers and i think magnetic lid yeah all right they've put uh they've put some thought into this okay and even there you know yeah shows yeah very well thought out packaging um i really like the new finish on the actual product um and they've done a lot of different things with it now so you actually get some color options which didn't exist before okay um so we've got silver we've got a red a jade and a traditional black i like the silver a lot nice um very clean yep so they've added usbc um charging to so they've kind of upgraded the charging it's fast charged so um throw it in your car you know or you take it out to a hike and it's not ready it's gonna be ready weight is almost nothing which is very cool very cool um and some of the features they've added to it are really nice um they have the traditional child proof usage on here you know you connect it to your phone yeah and it's going to be child proof so your kid can't can't mess with it which i think is a really awesome feature for a lot of people totally um and then some of the what i really like though is that so if you look at all of our pods you really wouldn't really notice it let's crack one of these up real quick please i was hoping we might um okay so yeah so this is our packaging so we really wanted to go with a more um hash head feel to it yeah if you you know we want it to be we really like our packaging to look fun yeah and that's kind of the direction we're going with a lot of things and so we wanted to kind of give you that rosin feel to it that that fresh press and that's kind of how we came up with this yeah with the director this it's very different for us um and so inside the child proof packaging you'll find a a pot obviously pull it out check it out all right and now you are saying child proof often i want to make sure just pop this baby right in there oh it's vibrating and lighting up so no it knows yeah that's another cool feature is the haptic feedback um so you know you plug it into your new era pro and it will vibrate you know like hey this is this is so is this primed and ready to go is there anything else i need to do here uh no go for it okay cool these are very childhood yeah good you guys you guys got your packaging down and you know as a marketing person i'm i'm very appreciative of aesthetics and uh this this got some to spare so you can definitely take a hit um there's three different settings that we load on these pods so these pods are actually smart pods now so tell me what does that mean smart pod okay so in-house so we what we do is you know we fill the pod and then we tag them okay so whenever you buy a new pod it'll have this red band around it when you pull it into your air pro and you have your app on your phone it'll literally show you like this is a pyramid pod so it'll have our logo okay we'll get the description of the strain it'll tell you the potencies so you know that's one thing that i hate about you know our 510 carts is like you forget what you're smoking a lot of the time so you know we have it engraved on the pod but also when you plug it in it's going to give you description of the strain um and then beyond that um we have an expert temp that we set it to and then you also have a load temp automatically set in a high temp so if you really want that high vapor production with you don't care too much about the turbine preservation yeah you can bump it'll bump up automatically or you can set to like our typical temperature so where am i at right now um you know i think you're probably right in the middle okay realistically because voltage obviously very important part of getting a good grip with a solventless pen specifically and usually lower voltage lower temperature you know if i'm going to spend the money to really get a premium vape i'm not just trying to cook all my terps well i think that's a huge benefit to the pax platform is that you know if you're you know if you're that hashtag and you're looking for that really high quality product using a 510 card is usually not gonna get you there um unless you're using a very expensive battery to get there yeah where this really allows you to dial in your high um and dial in the experience you want to get you know we can take it really low and you're going to get that really good flavor almost like a dry vape yeah um but you're not going to get that that that big cloud so typically i like to pump it up a little bit okay um to get that experience right away well i've sat and heard so much about this strain let's [Music] hmm that's really good i mean it it's interesting because with a vape sometimes you never kind of know what you're gonna get and there's a lot of information there's a lot of education and you know especially with the vape crisis that was you know in full swing last year like having a real nice solvent-less vape like this i i really like the experience especially the rosin experience um out of this i mean it's really hard to replicate a true dab in vape form i think that's what what people criticize vape a lot for yeah people want the convenience especially the purists the purest yeah you know they kind of hate on vape a lot and we're really trying to get these p get those individuals who want that high quality product yeah onto a vaporizing platform and that's what our raw our live rosin pods do especially on the pax platform yeah you know just kind of taking this experience in you know it's it's fruity but it's also got something else behind it like it's very smooth and sometimes some of the really high terpene fruit strains that they're not quite as smooth as what i'm getting in this and you know kind of as it's starting to settle in a little bit and i know you know i didn't blow some monster cloud for everyone on the camera but just you know really enjoying you know having a fine vape it you know for me when i consume it it's not always just about flexing on our video it's about really just having an experience with the products itself um yeah it's great i mean honestly this is the closest you're gonna get to a dab in a vape form um no [ __ ] um i don't know if they can say that but no [ __ ] it's um we could square on our youtube channel this is for adults uh and um it's really good and i i this is pretty much all i smoke now honestly on our platform is our rosin line yeah um just because i think the flavor profile is unmatched among vaporizers and um it's always interesting to try something new yeah so well if i could describe you know after taking a couple hits some real small ones some bigger ones i mean it's fruity i get a little taste of pineapple in there there's almost something in there that is a little more savory and i'm having a hard time putting my finger on it but there's there it it's a strain that's got some depth and i like that um and as far as like the actual experience goes of using this it's it's very seamless um i'm a big fan pineapple trunk great choice on this one you guys uh i just want to smoke this all day this is a tough one well i'm glad you like it you know um we'll definitely get you some samples of some other strains to enjoy and um yeah i'm really glad you're experiencing having a good experience this is a great product thank you guys so much for coming in uh you know the review today obviously the sullivan's pax pod but for those of you out there who also really just want to take a dab and that's the experience you want to have we've also got grams here as well and you guys are going to be doing limited drops of those starting soon is that right yeah yeah that's a plan

i have to say i'm a big fan of the pineapple chunk it's not super fruity but it's a little sweet it's a little savory it has this quality to it that's a little hard to put my finger on but it's a strain that just has these hash overtones mixed with that pineapple that fruit and that's a stray that's a type that i really like uh just that hashy flavor on the exhale it's a good smoke it's a smooth smooth rip the pax is sweet i hadn't seen that pen before all in all great product and they're 50 in colorado so i believe perhaps the least expensive true 100 solvent-less vape on the market

solvent les review and I've got Josh the owner of coach masters here to talk all about it and how you can even win your own Awards and what judges look for alright let's check it out today we're really excited to bring you an award-winning live rosin from cush masters in Boulder Colorado this punch-drunk is a nice combination of Bermuda punch and Mac otherwise known as miracle alien cookies - phenomenal strains that they blended together in the lab to make an entirely better creation it took home first place at the Brewster's 7/10 showdown this year and when you open the jar you can immediately tell why it caught the judges attention fruit all kinds of terpenes that are really evocative of a fruit market in South America come at you it's almost hard to tell which ones you're smelling because it's a mixture of pineapple paya maybe even watermelon looking at the consistency it's this gorgeous shiny butter mixed with sugar and you can tell that the terpenes have even started to separate ever so slightly at room temperature this strain isn't the highest in potency testing at around 74 percent THC but that's okay because it more than makes up for it and the smell and the aromas and the flavors that come along with it which we would argue are more important in most cases anyway hey everyone welcome back to solvent let's review this is Eric today we've got a really special episode got Josh from cush masters and some award-winning live rosin just to come first place at the rooster show down in the category so super excited Josh thanks for coming on the show yeah thanks for having me it's a awesome here yeah I tell me a little bit about cush masters so cush masters was a bridge anole founded in 2015 we did contract processing for you know quite a few different people in the industry and all within Colorado and then we expanded our brand outreach around 2017 and you know we're focused on connoisseur extracts and making sure that people are outputting the best quality inputs and outputs for you know come overall concentrates because it's a huge new part of and wave of the industry so we wanted to make sure that people were properly educated as they Deb as they consume as well as make sure it's some good stuff nice so you guys have been at this a little while how long have you guys been making browsing for we've been making rosin since about 2015 yeah so just so everyone knows Josh is also one of the co-owners here at pure pressure and one of the people responsible for really seeing big-time value in solvent lists a long time ago when people were making it with hair straighteners and really josh was the one that came up with the idea of how do I come up with a better press so that I can make this more viable so yeah I mean coach masters was born and you know we found and definitely a necessary need in the market for a high quality you know versatile rosin press you know what we were using just wasn't cutting it and we wanted to make sure that we could put out the best concentrates you know the same way that you know starting material creates quality extracts you know it also comes down to the machinery and the repeatability of that machinery and so you know went out and you know built the press and you know peer pressure is what it is today which is a huge blessing and it's great you know it's amazing to see everybody utilizing that technology and you know it's only getting better yeah so tell everyone a little bit about what goes into making award-winning rosin so the strain we've got today is punch-drunk which is a cross between Mac and Bermuda punch and what is Mac stand for Mac is just a strain that was bred and is it miracle alien cookies is that what we're calling cookies yeah well yeah so tell everyone a little bit more about the strain and kind of what went into this yeah so I mean both strains you know we're grown separately as their own strain and what we ended up doing they each have their own unique profile so you know each their own terpene profile their own you know necessarily bud structure features that type of stuff and trichome head structures which all take into account when you're utilizing and going in for water extraction okay because that was the first process of getting this final product right here mmm that we're about to consume here shortly so that was obviously ice water hash washed pressed when you guys were doing this is this a cross between one strain that's the punch-drunk or is it two strains have been blended together purposefully it was two strains that were blended together you know purposefully okay I'm within the Brent within the lab itself okay so they were grown separately uh-huh and then we decided the two profiles uh would create an amazing you know over what we hoped would be an amazing you know extract you know sometimes they're hit and miss you know sometimes it's harder to sell concentrate when it's a blend like that so you really have to be careful on how you mix these terpene profiles and you know don't make a flavor or something like that that somebody won't enjoy sure okay so there's there's there's some risk involved that's when you're taking a blended we're these strains wash together yes okay so you put it all together washed it and then pressed it because I've definitely heard of some companies and places where they'll wash one or the other and then they'll actually mix the heads after they've been dried but you is there a reason that you prefer that method because it's all you know one cohesive product within the bubble hash itself okay you know when you end up working with bubble hash and depending if you're in a cold room or not you know you end up getting you know those greasy patties bubble hashed a little bit harder to work with so when you have those two flavor profiles within that bud form and it's also where you're gonna have your highest terpene within those genetics itself so you know that's gonna come out in your flavors and stuff you know some are gonna be more dominant than others which is also why you got to be very careful on which ones you mix together got it so for example probably some of the gas your OGS are gonna really overpower certain blends for example exactly okay you know like even on the fruity side as well you know you're gonna end up with certain like tangerines and stuff like that to just overpower everything within extracts so your clementines and your tangerine they're gonna take over that you're making absolutely so another question I know that probably a lot of people watching are really interested in hearing about is when you're picking strains to wash well ones that are really gonna dump and be worth the time and energy to do it can you tell ahead of time like how do you know what's gonna work do you test it like what's your process there yeah I mean that's one of the you know common ash questions I think within the industry and it's you know a very challenging part of deciding on what material to choose from mm-hmm is working with the right growers I'm working with people who are open to feedback and not stuck in their ways I'll start in the garden right yes yeah definitely start in the garden you have to have a good product to work with okay and so really developing those relationships and making sure not only are they handling the products properly while they're growing it so they're not damaging the heads but also well they're packaging it up for delivery to you you know take for an example you know you just cropped all your buds and you're going into freeze them well you have a bunch of bagged stacked on top of each other that aren't necessarily frozen yet so you're gonna wait think about what that's doing to a trichome head you know it's just extremely delicate very delicate right you touch a trichome head usually you know it will explode all right yeah cool so super super interesting stuff when it comes down to actually making something that wins an award like this I mean what goes into that what are the judges looking for and in your experience having entered a couple cups and competitions and having won awards across a couple categories yeah what advice can you give for other people out there who are trying to win their own hardware here yeah I mean I think knowing your competition is really important looking at past competition sure results are also very important looking at those profiles of those strains that have won past Awards within those categories within that award so knowing what the judge is won mm-hmm and you know some competitions allow you to enter more than one per category yeah and so what that allows you to do you know normally if we enter a you know let's just say the 7 10 showdown for example which is the one that we won right here um we were allowed to enter up to 3 into whatever category we wanted we entered one into you know some of the stuff and then we entered 2 into some of the categories as well okay what are some other categories you guys are working with um just tool it around which we took first home first place home as well nice you know we did pens ok those live rosin fans of those live resin pen who live resin panel yeah and then some disposable live resin pens you know just both types of hardware okay and then we also entered wax shatter and crystalline which is diamonds so it sounds like it's probably not a bad idea to enter as many categories as your lab is able to if possible absolutely I mean your material and your products also got to be there um you know you don't want to enter something you don't think you have a valid chance of winning you know because they are very costly as well to you know be entering multiple things into multiple categories which is why we normally stay to one entry but if it's a category that you never know what the judges could be looking for or it's a newer category let's say for example rosin you know you can go with like you know like you're saying earlier the more oh gee you know dominant you know and that judge panel might be you know more of a G type of flavor profiles or the more that fruity type of profile so it gives you kind of wide range to fall within the category of the judges as well gotcha so you guys entered more than one into the Robin category is that we're saying yes we entered two into the rosin category for this strain specifically since this is what we're reviewing today the punch-drunk but if you could guess what why do you think that this one one what about this strain you know before we sample it here in a second like what's special about punch-drunk you know ever since it came out of the machine I mean even all you just knew it it was a beautiful color the clarity the smell in aroma that we are achieving off of that rosin even as its sat in the jars changing consistencies we you know just everybody in the lab kind of gradually went to it it was kind of like a natural thing and like you know we have our solvent list room which is you know separated but you know obviously with high terpenes and rosin extraction and stuff like that you can you know smell them through the doors sometimes yeah and so people are coming in and solving this room the day that we were doing this extraction and you know obviously things like that get picked up by the techniques or the texts that are working that day right when we were talking about entering this competition it was a no-brainer for us this is the one that we thought would do it but we also entered more of an OG dominant profile as well so this one's definitely on the fruitier side yeah given given the name and cross that you're describing together okay cool so let's take a look at this obviously in the video you guys are already gonna check out some sweet macros also really like this package design school got some gold foil on it yeah that's nice thank you can I can tell why people are picking that up on the shelf yeah so here's our little glass jar I'm gonna take a little sniff here so yeah it's really strong yeah like surprisingly strong when you open it I've been to you know labs all over the place done a lot of this and and this one it's just I mean it'll stink up this entire room yeah absolutely no question you're like I'm really trying to dial in it's got you know definitely the tropical fruit I mean some people if I was gonna guess it be some kind of like banana II papaya sort of smell it's hard to nestle made this one so unique you know like knowing kids put their direct finger on it it hits so many different peoples you know wants in a concentrate which was really exciting to see and it was just off to smell alone which can also give you indications yeah of what ward winning concentrates and stuff that you know could be good as other products as well so extremely stable consistency this has been sitting out today for a little while at room temperature most of the time a lot of these strains are gonna be kept in a freezer or fridge during the day and then this however you can just tell that this is really buttery its sugared up just a tiny tiny bit it's almost glistening here in the jar I mean it kind of feels like somebody brought some giant fruit bowl into the room here that we're just smelling on set natural terpenes sweat even at room temperature you know that those terpenes start to rise and separate from the actual rosin itself you know and like I was saying earlier you know the jar itself was you know so potent within the lab that every chunk up the whole place it just stinks up the entire room I mean I can't even imagine we got a graham right here you know we're talking how much were you guys pressing at a time I mean we were pressing around 80 to 120 grams at a time so before we try it because I'm really fixing to I mean I don't know how much longer I can talk about this before we give this a shot but consistency is one of the biggest things when it comes to winning awards is what you've said in the past and what we've heard from some of our other brand allies and some of our other customers can you speak to the consistency aspect especially of rosin specifically and how that matters yeah so consistency in your final product is probably one of the most important things you know especially being a lab or somebody who isn't selling it directly to that customer being on the wholesale side of that equation you know what that does is it allows you to you know no matter who's grabbing that gram within the dispensary um you know it's that gonna end up staying that consistency so making sure that you know you manipulate your material in a way before it hits the shelves so that it stays that consistency whether you're going for shatter or wax or butter or sugar or you know micro diamonds you know some Jam tech like all of those different things and consistencies those are all done within the lab so making sure that as you give it to your packagers that you have a consistent product that you're selling as a consistent product it's nice and stable yeah it's ready to go it's not changing on it so that the judges and someone who is you know buying this off the shelf is you know they're they're getting what they're seeing on the Instagram absolutely you know and that's probably one of the most important things you know for me is being able to provide the industry a consistent product awesome so cush masters is located in Boulder Colorado proud to have them here in the state so we smoke out of a couple different things on one of our previous episodes with Roz and Ryan sometimes we've got a nail we've had episodes where we're putting honey on toast today we've got a puff coke what's setting are we gonna what what do you recommend I call it low for me anything that you're smoking I like to go at a lower temperature so half frozen in general nice low temp always yeah cuz you're gonna be able to get those terpene profiles better and you know if you burn terpenes too and you have too high of a terpene rich product you can actually you know full heart right harsh yeah so you know I really like to enjoy these high quality yeah it's almost like a fine wine right we're not having our dabs medium well today okay we're we're gonna do this proper so all right let's give it a shot you want to load me up absolutely cool [Music] that's strong what are the what are the potency results on this one um so this one we got the box right here so yeah take a peek Matt just like as I'm sitting here it that that fruit that I was smelling in the jar just kind of working its way back might not like toward the back of my tongue you know sometimes certain concentrates they have like a little bit of an after flavor but man with these premium hash robins but I mean super clean and you can tell you know no throat irritation whatsoever there I mean granted I'm not someone who's taken the world's biggest abs but that's one of the biggest things for me is just it's clean I'm not coughing my brains out right now you know I can actually sit here and really let this soak in and I can enjoy it and it's just like I mean that is just really tasty stuff I mean it feels like I'm down in Central America at a fruit stand trying to pick out what pineapple or banana or you know pie I'd like to have and that's the stuff you have to hit and those profiles that you really need to you know what it's like what sounds good to you you know and it's almost like that uh technicians you know responsibilities as materials coming in to identify identify and try and work through those rows in order to achieve those high yields those flavor profile combinations all of those things to create phenomenal concentrates yeah because sometimes you know and why sometimes we do do mixes is because for run size totals for lab optimization you know sometimes you know one girl only grew you know let's say 4,000 grams of this strain and so you know we have a eight thousand twelve thousand gram capacity per run frame we go bring them together if they fit together and they mesh to go there you know why not and you know stay at full optimization yeah so I mean the the sum of parts greater than the individuals here big-time especially for this one good stuff yeah I mean the profile there is just comes together so smooth and so elegantly and like the actual almost like fruit like flavor that it gives it's like you know almost like smoothie yeah so now that we've been sitting here for a minute and I'm starting to like really feel it this is a review after all this one's really nice I'm finding that it's really relaxing it's got a pretty calming quality you know it's gonna be a it's almost like a little bit of a head huh definitely definitely a little behind the eyes in this particular one I don't get that with a lot of strains yeah but it's not overwhelming you know I wear some head high as can be you know and like it's kind of just like step back in the couch you know beat still you know not I'm here I feel lucid exactly but I'm also a lot more relaxed and I was a couple minutes ago and you know that's what we really try and hit within you know concentrates because it is such a representation of the plant and what its capabilities are yeah and you know people out there gonna experience it different ways but I can see why the judges were really pumped up about this one it is it is pretty clear once you get a chance to try it absolutely absolutely you can find us you know pretty much you can go to coach masters calm we have a map on there you know few of our local stores you know throughout the Denver metro area you know

to bud gasm over here for bringing us all together my name is Nick Atia of essential extracts I'm joined by Phil Salazar of soil grown solvent list we got some other family over here give thanks to everyone who's shown up and come out shown support and is here to talk to about the history of rosin we wanted to provide a little education and throw it back to some of the people that have been involved since day one that have got us to where we're at today so Phillip did you want to say a little something about yourself before we get started I'm just here to talk about the history of rosin I'm super excited about it I like where it's gone where it started and where we're pushing towards so I'm just stoked to talk about it I don't well I'm gonna break into it I love giving credit where credit's due and I'm extremely blessed to have been here from basically day one from when this term was coined basically so a lot of this started before Instagram and before Facebook we had a lot of underground forums and the forums were where a lot of us growers and hash makers gained a lot of our knowledge so there was this gentleman named confession compassion Co mph a s o n I believe yes h o n but I also you know his his name is out there freely his name is chadwick Bastardo and i really like to give credit to this gentleman because back in the day there were a few forums that that I was on along with this gentleman compassion and he was really the one who started using this term the term rosin has actually been around for centuries it's been around for a long time in the adhesive and in that world the adhesive world just for a gummy substance you know sermons to like violins yeah rosin that term has been around for a long time it really was brought into the cannabis industry when confession started utilizing a stainless steel bowl with the stainless steel spoon heating up that bowl heating up that spoon and literally mechanically pressing his bubble hash into that bowl and stirring it around and he started noticing this ring of oil on the outside of that bubble hash and he was like huh that's interesting there's this separation and so he started pulling that ring of oil with his dab or tool off of there and back then it was knife hits and he started taking that oil off and taking knife hits and noticing that there was a lot less residue and back then the term full melt clear dome FM CD was a very popular term for when we got bubble hash or water hash so good and so clean that it would bubble up and make these clear domes and basically burn to very little if not no residue it wasn't until Chadwick compassion actually started playing with this technology of utilizing hot stainless steel instruments and mechanically separating the oils from the waxes that he took this knife hit saw these clear domes and saw zero residue and I really want to say that that's where rosin started but at that time there was no way to make that technology commercialized or scalable you know a lot of people in this industry talked about how is it scalable how do you scale this technology and that's where a lot of things are going and so you know back then it was the hash makers treat rosin started spreading that term you know this is back I want to say 2005 maybe 2007 2007 I'm really bad with the actual date but this is pre dabbing you know so back then it was the hash maker that got to keep that ring of oil for themselves you know rosin really wasn't able to get out to the masses until people like this gentleman came along and I want to talk and I want him to talk to you guys about what really pushed rosin to be scalable initially what was the term that you came up with and what were you doing well I think I called it like solving this hash sha sha something like that but the way it started I was just really really into making hash and you know all my melts and stuff and smoking it and then like it got to a point where I ran solo on what I had I didn't have any more of my harvest and I got solo on my melts I was like literally trying to smoke like four star three-and-a-half star like low-quality melt hash so and I have to give thanks to you because I remember seeing a tip on your page back then where I would take Milo my like my low-grade melts and put them between parchment I'd use a hair straightener just to thin it out and it actually helped I was able to get a better dab off low quality hash and you know I got tired of that and so I'm trying to remember like exactly but fast-forwarding you know past like flattening my hash out and like just dabbing it like that getting to the point where I'm running out of my dabs so something went off in my head I remember just thinking like back okay okay going back again okay I remember I messed up doing that I pressed it too hard not in the hair straightener and I see it would be real shiny on the outside and dry in the middle and I wouldn't think anything of it I'd fold it up do it again phone I used to do that like I'd fold it up like three times so it'd be nice and like homogenized a nice good melt off of a low-quality hash you know what I mean the best you'd get off of it so light bulb goes off in my head I'm thinking back I remember that shininess I remember the dry so I didn't have a hair straightener laying there this is the longest story possible of it but didn't have a hair straightener laying there so I actually took a chunk of hash between a piece of parchment shoved it up against the email with my finger and I'd try not to burn myself or burn the paper on the side of the coil and sure enough I pulled it off and there was oil like I was hoping that would happen very little not enough to dab so I kept doing it doing it doing it took me like five ten minutes to get one dab hit it and sure enough my father-in-law family was there nothing it melted to nothing and it we were just amazed so from there it would that's where it started that's where the Hat I would say that's where the rosin for me started you know it started by a mistake that came back to me later on as an idea and I took it from there you know and so I was I was pressing hash so it all started with hash for me no screen screen wasn't any part of it at all so I was making low quality rosin still could still small contaminants in it for the most part it melted to nothing and so I ran out of all my hash and we got to a point you know we're just smoking bud so Bing light bulb and I took a bud and I did the same oh and actually when I was pressing the hash my wife had come out and she brought me a hair straightener cuz I had been using her hair curler and so she swapped that out for me so boom I get back to the out of the hash now I'm at the weed I pressed a but I think it's like 400 degrees super freakin hot so I pressed it on the parchment and crazy amount of oil came out of it like three of us got a dab off of like a little half gram bud so we were just amazed and they just went non-stop from there like nights of just pressing out eighths taking like five six hours just to press out an eighth on a hair straightener and that's where it took off and really I think that's where are all of our light bulbs turned on because we're like that's where it's scalable this guy is pressing flowers you know because before we you know us hash makers we didn't want to press the best-quality hash you know we've we got amazing quality hash and we wanted to keep it as that you know we might have started playing with a hair straightener to press it so that we could dab it but we weren't anywhere in the mindset of actually removing that waxy cuticle until I feel like flour rosin came about in that term I really want to give credit to Phil over here because I think that's what changed game for a lot of people especially on the mast level because kids all over the world had flour it was a lot harder for them to come by amazing water hash but they had flour and they had a hair straightener and that's what change game at that time is when I really believe we're pushing towards you know safe extraction you know everybody wanted to make oil we're all dabbers you know and when at a time when when solvent list was scarce and when you'd get hash and it wouldn't melt it's just a disappointment it was hard to come by six star five star even good hash to even know what it was so I lost my thought that hash split right before [Music] but yeah going back to it you know we came from somewhere and I'm just gonna give you guys a little recap right now we came from somewhere where we were watching forums of this guy named compassion taking bubble hash and pushing it on some stainless steel bowl to then playing with hair straighteners to then pressing flour itself into flour rosin and now look look where we've come you know there's been so many different advances in technology since then this man helped put out one of the very first rosin presses on the market there's been so many other rosin presses since and the technology just keeps changing and evolving and you know it's it's I think it's thanks to the education that we started the open forum education style that can fashion was pushing it on originally that we've continued that trend of really pushing education to our peers to our community and it just continues to evolve into something that I had never even imagined I grew up making bubble hash in my uncle's barn in a hot barn and now we're actually separating THC their THC a you know on a scientific level really we're seeing 99.9% THC a without the use of any chemical solvent so it's really really really come a long way pickup everyone that's involved in that movement we can talk about you know where it's going now so are you guys familiar with some of the new consistencies that we're seeing out there how many show hands out there in the crowd how many of you guys have tried rosin just rosin alright so when we first started making rosin was really when the consistency of earwax was popular in the BHO world so I'm gonna bring it back to like 2008/2009 and Pho had really just hit the market pho was called earwax back then so as us hash makers started to make water hash on a more controlled level a higher level we wanted to mimic what was happening in the BHO world so this is pre rosin but we started making hash on a higher level where the hash was coming out gold rather than brown and it was coming out smelling really like the flour that it was come from because we were controlling the variables of the water the temperature of the water our environment that we were making the hash in and that starting material we started really really paying attention to the starting material rather than using stuff at uncle's farm that had been sitting on the side of the road that he didn't want on his property because that was more weight on his property that's what we were making bubble hash out of initially up in Mendocino Humboldt County we started making bubble hash out of close trim and not just the close term mixed with all the fan leaf and everything else they were throwing away then we started making water hash out of fresh frozen material you know I think 2008-2009 was when I first did my first wash with fresh frozen material and at this point we're making water hash with whole plant fresh frozen material later on we're gonna talk about some of the amazing magicians in the crowd over here that can make fire with dry trim it's been sitting around but right now you know the pinnacle of water hash is using whole plant fresh frozen I'm jumping around a little bit here but throw it back to that 2008-2009 generation when earwax was popular we start learning a little bit more and then chatter becomes extremely popular 2009 Colorado California 2010 and Shatter is the consistency so we started wanting to recreate that consistency of shatter so we started heating up our hair straighteners a little bit hotter you know pressing in between parchment paper just our water hash at a higher temperature to create more stability more of a clear see-through shatter consistency and I think that's another one of the variables that pushed us as hash makers to find out what rosin was we wanted more stability we're trying to create these consist we were seeing in the BHO world but we weren't seeing as much stability if you just press hash at you know 200 250 degrees you're gonna see it turn into shatter but eventually you're gonna see it start to degrade turn darker butter up some of those issues and it wasn't until rosin came along and rosin the actual art of rosin is removing the rest of that waxy cuticle if you look at cannabis cannabis you know is a plant that has a lot of these shiny trichomes on the outside the crystals if you will all plants have different structures of these crystals and as hash makers and specifically rosin makers we're learning about this structure even more with every strain that we run some strains have that longer stalk with a very small head with a thick waxy cuticle and they may not run as well in water hash they may not press as well in rosin you start seeing some strains that have a thick stalk in a really bulbous head with a thin waxy cuticle and you're seeing them run better in water hash you're seeing the waxy cuticle effect the rosin less and you're seeing higher yields higher potencies and so you know moving forward we started seeing these different consistencies like shatter like the ear wax and then as we move we started seeing this sauce consistency in the butane world where we were seeing a layer of terpenes on the outside and it's pushed us rosin makers to continue this movement and to continue trying to create a higher echelon for our industry by pushing education and I think we've taught each other at this point that we can now separate THC a via different temperatures and different pressures to pull those terpenes and pull those the THC a separate that and now as we see these saucy and jammy consistencies in the BHO world we've been playing with pressure just like butane hash oil is utilizing these columns basically to pull pressure and then keep the butane and the trichomes under pressure creating separation we're now seeing the same thing in the solvent list world some are calling it rosin jam some are calling it solvent list sauce but we're seeing these consistencies now via ultimately means and rosin so rosin history just continues as we see different consistencies as we see I feel like as we see now hydrocarbon guys starting to separate delta-9 and CBG and THC v that's all with pressure and columns and temperature and so I think as we continue that might be some of what we see in the future as far as what rosin can really do you don't need a column you don't need heavy chemicals you don't need to possibly bro up blow up your neighbor's house we're seeing all of these different consistencies via solving this means thanks to rosin through the use of heat pressure and force right on I think that really kind of concludes it do we have any questions from the audience or anything else anybody think that rosin is going in another direction anybody disagree what what we talked about as far as the history of rosin it's a trip how far we've come really this started what 10 12 years ago and now it's on the commercial market heavy I just actually came from cookies in Maywood and there was a ton of different rosin brands on the shelf and it was amazing to see it started 10 years ago but I'd say realistically it took off about five years ago when when the masses started to learn and do it themselves at home and the more Minds that are able to focus and work on it and share the knowledge that they find that's why I think that's why we've quickly evolved this technique you know compared to has been around forever and it's taken so long to get to where it is but you know with the butane extraction and with everybody hands-on trying to do you know learn two new techniques and do the next best thing with solvent lists or with rosin I think that's where we're breaking through and and I think you're right we're gonna find you know all these different components we're going to be able to separate you know we're already at the point where we're separating THC and fats and terpenes so I think we're there it's pretty crazy to see some of the hydrocarbon companies switching over to solving this you know that's that's where I feel like that's when we made it you know like this education really did something we got the guys that have been known for making butane making solvent list now that's one of the cool things you know as of January 1st 2019 a lot of the new regulations came into California and it was very difficult to just set up a closed-loop system get the fire department out there go through all those regulations people are able to get to the end goal of a concentrate and a nice healthy alternative right one regulations hit and some of the first companies to come to shelf were rosin companies or solving those companies because it was a little bit easier to get manufacturing going licensing for type six via type seven was a little bit easier to push through she didn't have to deal with the fire burn nearly as much still do but a lot of factors have really really changed game I feel like when we started putting solvent list products or water hash products on the shelves in Colorado back in 2009 we were maybe 1 to 3% of the concentrate market was water hash and at this point I think we're definitely pushing 20% of the concentrates especially in places like California and Colorado so big up ourselves appreciate all the support and keep pushing education for real that's what puts the products on the shelves that are healthy that's what puts the quality on the shelves and that's what helps the consumer understand what's good well I mean the perfect example is the diamonds you know we kind of touched on it but I'll back it up a little bit just in case anybody didn't catch that one but in the hydrocarbon world right when we learned about roz in a year or two into learning really about commercializing and scaling up the creation of rosin we started seeing the butane guys make diamonds and we're like oh we got to learn we got to step up our game over here we're on shadow right now you know we're starting to make this butter and these lighter consistencies but diamonds oh how do we make this in the lab how do we compete and really you know it was all in playing with different temperatures different pressures different separations I feel like the first diamonds were not actually grown we're now seeing on the solvent side of things growing diamonds with pressure but the first diamonds to come to the industry were actually mechanically separated amorphous solids morphus solid crystalline yeah and you know I was gonna bring it up a little earlier I might have touched on the gentleman but I have too big up a man named Jeff or the cannabis Reverend this revenue because of church Jeff church cannabis Reverend was one of the first gentlemen to bring in the actual micron screen to separate the oils from the waxes or what we later found out to be a lot of that THC a you know so that bag not only contained a lot of the waxes but it also contained a lot of the THC a so eventually we learned that pressing at higher temperatures would completely remove the rest of the the terpenes and actually are a lot of the rest of the cannabinoids and at those higher temperatures we were just retaining THC a right and eventually we learned that that white powdery substance was the THC a that we are seeing some of these hydrocarbon companies put out we started testing some of those that white powdery substance and hitting anywhere from 94 to 99% THC a in our regulated licensed labs in Colorado and then we were like whoa how do we turn this white powder into what looks like the diamonds more heat and pressure so we brought the temperature right back up to around 250 degrees people do it at different temperatures but basically to melt that white powder back down into a solid form and then you can mold that that form into whatever shape you want I think when we first started doing it we were just making very very thick slabs so we started with the white powder we heated it up into these thicker slabs and we were smashing it in the lab and in our parchment paper and it was basically just making all different shapes and sizes of crystal and we started getting that tested and even with that slight temperature up crease upwards at 250 degrees we were not seeing any THC a turn into THC which was interesting and our labs were telling us that it was pure 99.9 percent THC in fact some of the labs that we were using not to put anybody on blast some of the labs that we were using for giving us test results back at one one hundred and eight point four percent THC a so we had to step back and say okay we can't put this on the shelf that doesn't make any sense you can't have over a hundred percent what's happening here and we contacted the lab they're like well we've never seen anything that high you know what's going on and we started looking at the standards and you know this is gonna be an ongoing issue in newly regulated environments but one of the standards came from res Tech and there's another standard that's put out with another company there's a few more companies that are putting out cannabis standards now but res Tech Stander's range from like ninety seven to ninety eight point nine percent their THC a standard and when we turned in our THC a sample is higher than that so we bumped the scale and I feel like they have to create some new standards at this point but we started leveling it out the lab started learning and we were mechanically separating THC a so to get back to the original question mimicking these hydrocarbon guys you know it started with the earwax we created solvent less wax now the rosin has really really given us the advantage to recreate different consistencies we're seeing in the hydrocarbon world we saw diamonds become instantly popular with butane extraction and propane extraction few other methods to create diamonds and we had to find a way so we utilized heat pressure and mechanical separation how much a did you throw away before you figured out that's the craziest thing yeah well luckily we were actually using a lot of it in other products topicals edibles and other things of that nature because we were seeing the test results in our coconut oil and other things but we just didn't put two and two together it's crazy to think back on it but yeah we definitely threw a lot away we definitely use some for purposes that we shouldn't have been using it for you know in mechanical separation I always like to talk about allocations and this is maybe something we can take a little break on but allocations are extremely important and that was one of those allocations we were throwing away something that had a lot of value another allocation I talked about is when we're especially when we're talking about butane versus solvent list I used the strain blue dream for the perfect example you get a full indoor operation of blue dream you bring it into your lab and you've got the hydrocarbon guys next door butane extract guys and they're yielding 18 to 24 percent on this blue dream you bring that same exact blue dream into the water hash lab we might be yielding three to five percent on that blue dream and originally I just started this discussion about the trichomes structure whether it has a thick waxy cuticle or a longer trichome stalk but blue dream is one of those ones that has a long stalk a very small head and a thick waxy cuticle it does not yield well in water hash and this is just an example you may find the very specific cut that does do well in water hash but for general purposes aloft in times the blue dream that we see is just not good for allocating towards water hash it's great for hydro carbon and so the same thing goes with allocations on the back end we found that that white powdery substance that we were taking away in our bags and keeping the clean clear beautiful gold rosin you know we were throwing that away as Phil mentioned and we've now learned to allocate that and utilize that THCA that we're thrown away any other questions we got lit up here so I don't all right so we're used to you know the full spectrum like 45min 160th you guys to play with like the 1/16 plus for separation because you know I I found some light goods you know find some good heads in the ones bigger heads who beat our dicks have you guys tried explored that so you're saying you know do we basically isolate the 160-180 micron and you know press that out and see the quality of that rosin and do stuff like that or separate or keep it like yeah I mean personally yeah I've actually just recently I mean it was some indoor but it was isolated 180 micron from an OG which is to me not a common thing to find for ice water hash a 180 you and it was incredible it actually put out about 91% return on the rosin so it was the most most impressive 180 I've ever seen when he talked about that return on the rosies talking about the actual trichome head being pressed into rosin and when you're talking about a 91% return that means there's barely any waxy cuticle it means you're barely losing anything you start with 5 grams and you're yielding about four point two four point five or four point six grams now I'm horrible with mass start with the gram and you know you're getting 0.9 one bag there you go but but yeah I mean for the most part a lot of strains I do I like the 180 I like the 150 I think it really depends on your methods you know gentle agitation depending on strains and knowing what you're working with the environment you're working in and controlling all your variables I think the 180 and the 150 are really good because for the most part I usually isolate everything depending on what I'm doing but I find in the end a lot of things end up just making it into the same batch because what I'll do is I'll isolate and then you know I'll press everything out and I'll separate everything by quality you know so not quality just by color but call you by terpene profile always have to dab it taste I noticed the 40 the 40 micron is usually not my favorite I like to keep that little separate because I don't know if it's more fats and lipids that are in it that's giving it a certain taste but I mean it's still great oil but to me I think keeping the 40 separated is better than keeping the 180 and the 150 separated because to me the 180 and the 150 have a high terpene profile to me those have like my favorite terms you know like if you never catch 150 or 180 those are just man lucky and to really you know summarize that it's so strained dependent you know I was actually speaking of your og cush that you'll did amazing in your 180 bag we ran some lemon cush Himalayan lemon cush it was a strain that was brought back by a soldier friend of ours that we ran in Colorado for a long time this one round that one of my growers grew wielded over two ounces of full melt in the 220 bag okay so anything's possible and to go back on what Phil said I really like to emphasize that we actually do the same thing we separate all of the microns I run a couple 220 bags we actually run a couple there and in the washing machine just to make sure we've gotten all that plant material I then run a 185 a 160 a 120 you know sometimes the hundred the 90 that you know sometimes to run a strain that we've never ran before I'll put all my bags in there I'll try and separate as many as I can because each strain each grower each medium is gonna be a little different even from one row you know you might be running the same strain in a grow house but have LEDs in one row have your HPS and another you're gonna see differences even there's differences from the top of your plant to the bottom of the plant as far as the trichome formation the amount of oils in them the size of the trichome head so we really like to especially when we're running a strain that we haven't run before is run all of those different micron sizes you can combine them in the end I can't combine them you know if you've started with only three three microns you can't separate them sorry beforehand so we like to start out with as many bags as we can see where the heads are lying and then eventually on that next run when you're running that same material from that same garden you can remove some bags you don't have to use all those bags and I think right there I think what that is in my opinion is every strain has a different head and tell you know so it's like the heads the cream and the tail is gonna be your butt end it might be it's lower quality you know but for the most part when you see the head and tail together like a full-spectrum hash oil something it's a good product but when you actually pull that tail end out of like let's just say for instance a headband we're running and that you know you can run seven eight spins you know 30-minute spins and you're still pulling and you know five spins in it was just quality but you can see it's getting darker more contaminants but then you get to the rosin and you're pressing everything out and everything's just coming out gold regardless of the hash you know and and you know it's all about the yield so you got a hundred grams of high-quality and 10 grams of just some darker oil other strains you know you'll notice regardless of the yield you might got the same yield off that strain as far as hash but it comes to pressing you know you have more wax membrane to those heads so therefore you're getting more more tail in with that head so you know you're get looking at like let's just say you get 80 grams and 30 grams of tail in because that's the darker oil yeah and that's that's more when you're looking for like when people are separating their Roslin's you know having like you know their their heads - and then just the edible grade for me I kind of I'm more of a full spec guy I kind of like to keep everything together as long I like to keep the tail end out and I think that's an important part of extraction is the head and tell regardless of what we're doing rosin ice water extraction ahead and tell it's all about knowing when to poll and what to keep separated a mature grower as anybody here ever explored with ultrasonic cleaning for washing hash like definitely actually we've yeah the question is has anybody utilized ultrasonic cleaning with hash or ultrasonic technology and we've used on actually a number of scales and people companies that I know right now are utilizing that technology in a number of ways as well I'll touch on a few things we had a company come in to our facility we were one of the first licensed facility blessed to be one of the first licensed facility in the world in Colorado and so a lot of companies from the cold brew industry from the wine industry beer industry started contacting us because we were able to do license protected R&D and an ultrasonic agitation company or cavitation company similar technology contacted us from the cold brew industry and brought in machinery into our facility and we started playing around with it unfortunately cannabis is a lot different than coffee and hops etc and we just kept having clogging issues with that machine but I saw value in it so what we did use utilize that cavitation or that ultrasonic technology not to separate the heads from the material like we initially wanted to and I still do think that there's value there and I think that there is viability and I think that you could do that but instead we ended up because it costs so much money for the machinery and to keep making these diodes bigger and these passageways bigger because the cannabis had to flow but we wanted to get an exact temperature there were a lot of variables that cost a lot millions of dollars really in R&D that this cavitation company didn't want to just keep shelling out but we ended up finding out that on a very high level turning up that cavitation device that ultrasonic device we're able to actually fully homogenize the oil into the solution so for edible products for topical products there's a lot of value in ultrasonic agitation and cavitation I still do think there's value in separating the oil via this technology if you guys aren't familiar basically ultrasonic agitation is a wave that is so intense that it can actually separate oil from wall they've used it in actually separating rivers and things of that nature on a larger scale ie cavitation but we saw this value because we started turning it up and actually breaking the trichome heads in water which would be our solution and now we have oil and water in one solution we started going back to okay how do they get oil out of water and you know we started playing with some of the technology that they're using in the oceans to get you know spills out of the oceans these polymer tubes basically that run on the bottom of the ocean that are pulling the oil out of the ocean and we played with that but we weren't seeing the yields we wanted to see I still do think that there's a lot to do there and there is a future for it so keep playing that's what it's all about I didn't get to it I didn't get there yet myself but I think one of y'all could share share share with everyone put it up on the forums throw it up on Instagram tag these guys they'll put it out there that's what it's about man that's what it's about we found each other somehow we found compassion both both of us found compassion so keep spreading knowledge for real and stick around today because I think we definitely have some more discussions a little roundtable with a few more hash makers in the building but we're gonna take a little split break I think right about now", "ezRzBxPQpbI": "when you know that this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after

fridge guys this is meant to keep your Terps your hash cool if you need to keep it at a certain temperature it's adjustable and I mean really it's just the first very very high quality to fridge that's been on the market most of them have always been plastic and there's never really been one made specifically for our dabbing community so temperature from 46 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit that's awesome very very low temperatures humidity monitor allows the user to remain maintained or H levels as needed lockable with provided keys for added security okay alright so if you're in a place where I don't know say you got 15 other dudes living with you or sneaky sibling that you don't want touching your terp so you can lock them up in this [ __ ] right here how [ __ ] cool is that just keep going down USB 3 USB ports to charge small devices glass touch panel for easy user control I mean just all of this sounds it sounds like you're getting one of the highest quality products ever smoked glass shelves with six slots for adjustability temperature glass door with UV protected coating Jesus flip it around to the back and we can get a view of I know it says Brooke right there but this definitely looks like the back so let's go ahead we're gonna open up this box and see what we've got going on in here first thing I'm seeing as we get into this box is USB ports which is just not something you would expect just like you got the user manual right here and some keys okay so there's two keys we can walk it up with very very nice now this is a pretty large unit I mean I'm assuming it's about a foot and a half two feet tall let me get it out real quick Oh fingerprint there we go very hard date let's say it weighs about little under 10 pounds it's not insanely heavy the quality of the outside material right here that I'm touching is just very nice this doesn't it doesn't feel like plastic I don't exactly know what this is let's take a closer look just wow that is so sleek these are just little this is just a touchscreen right here guys look at that no actual buttons just touch panel buttons if we look off to the side maybe get some zoom in on it there we go you can see the screen where it is gonna be but if as you're looking at it head on it is very hard to see very very sleek lock down here at the bottom the door opens very smoothly very easily my old turb cooler had a latch on it and it was fantastic until that latch broke and then it was kind of just pointless as we move on up to the top you can see those three USB slots up there which is just [ __ ] phenomenal so you need to charge a puff go your dad pin something it's right there on top of your turf cooler I mean assuming this is gonna be right in the middle of your session area that's gonna be really cool to have three charge points now before we get to the inside I'm gonna flip around looks like we've got some cooling vents over here big old fan in the back there you go you can see that big I mean that's a big fan and then you got your power slot right there really hefty power cable that is another benefit I'm saying I do like a thick power cable all right let's bust in here and see what we got going on all right so as we open the door to the inside Wow Wow look at that oh my god these are beautiful these are absolutely beautiful so these are just pieces of glass so you can see through them you can see the lower level of turps if you guys look down through here you could see what I mean like you could see through the shelves that is [ __ ] cool and what do we have going on down here looks like goes in there I don't know what that's for maybe to catch water humidity trap I don't know so there's three shelves these are all very nice glass shelves and you're given you're given quite a bit of room to work with here guys like what's that let's go ahead and take three ounce jars I have set over here and pop them right in here three ounce jars nicely educated in there it looks like you could fit maybe another three you probably fit in nine ounce jars on each trace there is a [ __ ] load of room for your Terps let's go ahead and plug it in and see what it looks like when it's got power running through it I really really want to see what this looks like is this design so sleek first things first though I think we should rip this bowl again cheers everyone [Music] this thing is so [ __ ] stick I don't black background exhale my smoke on ooh that wedding cake is good all right so it looks like I need a knife let's try the dad tool spinning method Jam a dab tool in the zip tie and spin it till it snaps go exactly how I planned but that [ __ ] works all right guys let's plug her in and see what we're working with here oh nice little beep on startup i'ma come around front here so right off the bat I'm definitely hearing sounds from it I don't know if you guys can hear that little light coming just sounds like a refrigeration unit we're set to 25 okay there we go that's very responsive very very responsive oh my god it has a light for your Terps what okay all right I'm [ __ ] sold got a blue light looking down on the Terps there how sick is that Wow okay that's just 10 out of 10 right there I must set my set my temperature to I don't know like 55 I have no idea what what's a good storable temperature for Terps all I know is that this thing is tits I'm gonna pop my hand in here let's see if we've got actually any refrigeration going on immediately oh yeah oh yeah but back there it's really cool to aren't ready so I'm assuming given us an hour and it's gonna be an actual little refrigerator this is 10 out of 10 a great [ __ ] product here guys I know they're gonna be expensive I know it's not gonna be everybody's cup of tea but for just that one more little piece of dabbing utensil Lola dabbing just add to your station ten out of ten this thing's sick that light so [ __ ] nice let's try the lock out here see if we can keep people out of our Terps so you got two keys become with it standard-looking guys that's it I mean you that's a really you'd have to break the lid off to get in there that that's not opening up that's a lot of pressure I'm putting on that probably actually shouldn't be putting that much pressure on it but we're here review products we're not here to [ __ ] pussyfoot around boom I was wondering about this little metal piece down here was for that so it walks in there what a cool [ __ ] product guys this is just this is so sick slide-out tray for your chirps I couldn't be [ __ ] more ecstatic about this

and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping on here rollercoaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "PX3c1o3bvW8": "yo yo yo what's good you guys welcome to a live stream we're gonna go ahead and do uh the rest of the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it

gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you think he needed them pills bro he didn't excite him no more he couldn't do it all right here's my poll thongs or booty shorts drop it in the chat right now that's all i want to know thongs or booty shorts this is going to tell me everything i need to know about every last one of you from here on out i'm deciding your face as a friend or a foe choose wisely how [ __ ] would you guess cheers man cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear this is too here you", "tNKG6YoPU5Q": "the only always good YouTube welcome to another live stream just hanging out taking some dabs tonight and the children really got too much [ __ ] going on waiting on a few parts to come in over the next couple of days so that I can go ahead and finish putting together the irrigation for this veg setup and once that comes in then I'll go ahead and put together the irrigation and get some seeds popped and start to show on the road those of you that saw my Instagram I posted the start of a DIY project to make some mini humidifiers one for each tier in here they're gonna be perfect for you closet growers or if you have a bed rack similar to mine small space you don't want to put a big bulky humidifier in there and like we talked about before there's not a lot of options for just straight power on power off humidifiers that are a small and portable as what I have in mind so anyways we'll get into that later tonight I cleaned up the old sexy gin tree rig I got the broken pieces of the grabbes Labs drop down out of here so all good and this still fits snug in there with no issues even though the you know tiny little bits of the bottom broke off no big deal so got the banger all cleaned up opaque bottom this is the deep dish third email from 710 coils so cake bottom if you guys need a discount code SB and v-love will get you 20 per 12 percent off of $40 or more so before we get fired up tonight though actually gonna go ahead and empty this because like my dad's to taste fresh super fresh so I got a little reclaimed jar here and all I do is take a little heat to it tip it over yeah I don't want to burn it I just want enough heat to facilitate a little bit of flow all it takes once it starts to flow in you can remove the heat just off grip on down it stops flowing you add a little bit more heat and keep the flow going that's it boys ask me how I do that my reclaim or whatever would I do with it this is it looking like dab some of y'all will probably take this reclaim came out very nice very clear it's not ugly and dirty it's more like distillate than reclaim this deep dish really makes it so that you're not sucking down a bunch of nasty reclaim into the neck of the banger you only get like vapor so I'm getting what I'm getting out of this is like [ __ ] almost like true distillate not the black nasty [ __ ] that's left at the body of your banger that people suck up from hitting it too hard and then that's it and then it's nice and ugly looking for a second and voila now this just now seeing you guys popping up in the comics what's going on guys and he switch over to live chat so I'm not getting trolled yeah I'm glad I did not break that [ __ ] I was thinking about oh I've got cuts on his hand okay rinses alcohol off oh Jesus [ __ ] that hurt I just did that inside - ah big well [ __ ] like cut right here like a paper cut from earlier she's five and I ain't gonna switch huh got my ass Kavi slipping right now bueno I don't need it to be alcohol doubt and all that I could if I was being super super picky but now that's good like that and we got a bunch of you claim in here and we'll keep collecting it until it's almost full and then I'll deep carb it and all and people say you don't have to deke our brief claim that's not entirely true we claim is not only a 100 percent d card sometimes you still have to hit it for like 10 or 15 minutes walk around a club which is dumb in your mouth stick map and take your tongue out see if I can't go switch see I wanna [ __ ] tell me what where do you see my where do you see my a girl beat at the max when you see man let's see if he burns himself ladies and gentlemen I usually don't so that means now would be a perfect time for it to happen now would be the perfect nope not today [Music] and I did it all safe like that because it's on the coils on right now that could have been bad so get my left [ __ ] hand clean real quick right now [Music] good enough for now all right yes chronic ale from Pizza port baby this is an amber ale it's delicious [Music] got my kuzey from la couleur saying people have made my reservoir chillers or my reservoir covers I'm such an [ __ ] I know you want to see this delicious pour don't you shout out to my man CV pouring it up on IG with an super super craft beers yeah buddy is it all fit in this [ __ ] little cup almost almost there's like a little cut horn cut hair left in here [Music] not my [ __ ] delicious let's go cheers you guys thanks for hanging out tonight you guys up to how was your weekend what did you do what's up Netflix you recommended [ __ ] I don't care about right now this jar shall we get it shall we Wow so I found out this run's changed on me over time so when I'm smoking this about three or four days ago it had a very nice sweet candy taste to it with a slight slight sour taste to it today I hid this [ __ ] not 405 I changed my temp up a little bit it tasted like I just got done eating a whole bag of lunch when I exhaled it blew my [ __ ] mind how much the temperature change and a few days was able to change what happens to the flavor profile [Music] you're already a DAB in oh my god you stop [ __ ] around [Music] [Music] [Music] look at how clean that is [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] the other runs it seemed like they got a little bit more of a intense candy flavor it was more of a just like a sweet taste with a slight candy you know but now it's like just straight bag of candy [Music] [Music] Wego somebody said they were already on their second dad I'll catch up don't worry I always do man what a great year whoa [Music] [Music] good well you guys I guess I'll fill you in on the projects I got going on yeah that's how I am dog I got that but I can't be any heightened ads I like them nice and low temp no I'm saying I can come back and hit it in 30 seconds if I need to yeah dad sneezes getting me to man it just depends on the Turks right all right so this all right we pull up Amazon right quick so the first project is the irrigation in here I got the pump in I showed that last time it's a share flow pump with the filter built in we're not building but there's a pre-filter on it so we're gonna be running this sure flow pump nice and small less than a hundred dollars and it kicks enough psi to run pressure compensating drippers like in my flower room with my big leader pump I could even run that room off of one of these isn't that crazy less than a hundred bucks if that liter pump fails I'm just gonna pick up another one of these and throw it in there it'll do the job so the rest of the connector pieces that I need to put this together are coming tomorrow and it's basically just a bunch of elbows in random fittings did I get into caps I got in caps yeah what I need to get now is more irrigation stuff for the big room so I guess I'll pull out the whiteboard I know I don't need it basically right now on each tray I have one irrigation line that runs down the center of the tray right and at the end of that I have my flush valve slash pressure gauge setup this was at the end of every line right what I'm going to be changing for the flower room now is instead of running the single line down the center of the tray I'm going to run a big u basically or a big circle all the way around the tray right so the line is going to come to the the table or someone drop from the ceiling down to the center of the tray it's going to go to a tee and it's going to basically go out to the sides of the trays elbow run down the length of the tray and it'll have the drippers along the length right for the plants on its respective side and then at the end instead of each line just coming to an end right it'll come back to Center and that's where I'll put this so what all I have to end up doing is I'm going to get across and basically what will happen is with the cross it'll be like this right so at the end of the tre imagine down there is the end of the tre this is the lateral flush valve it's going to be right in the very middle so I think here guys this view you can see this whole thing right imagine this is the end of the tre that's over there this is the end right so it'll sit like this boom right in the middle Wow this pressure gauge and then I'll have this lateral flush valve so that way every time that the system pressurizes it will pressurize all the way around faster more evenly and it just works that better way as a manifold and you have drippers and then i'll still be able to have the function of flushing the entire system out by having this in between and at the the lowest and so everything will flush down here and get fresh newts at the very beginning and it's also air relief so when the system fire is on any air that might have gotten into the system will escape from here too at the end of the line but I have air relief valves in various places in the plumbing in there that is one thing that's going to change that I should definitely show you guys shout out first off Roz rosin ink alright that's the homie Miami mango because I I learned a [ __ ] ton just from following his pages and going through and reading every post reading every comment every [ __ ] response like you have to read the comments you guys are so much gold hidden in the comments woodsheds my dude he does a lot of custom 3d printing stuff for me like my driver coolers science LED of course for my lights glob mob I'm actually wearing their shirt right now more rosin ink and hydro racks that is root riser you guys that is the company that does this vedric anyways nothing with that so here's my system in here all of this is going to stay the same I don't need to do anything in here this is a net afem disk filter that I have pre pump I'm going to throw in an additional filter post pump that'll be probably a leader filter and I'll throw that somewhere in here that way I have that I got this project box and I I just realized when I brought it in here I don't know how all that's gonna fit to be really really real like what I might end up doing is I might end up putting this and this on the outside and then putting everything else inside if I can fit these on there I will but I don't know it's gonna be tight maybe this these two and these two we'll see I might be able to pull it off but it's cool it's got space inside so those will be mounted on the outside and then I still have all this space inside so those will easily be able to fit and I'll be able to fit at least one power strip so we'll get all that taken care of I'm gonna go ahead and clean up some of the plumbing in here I don't really need to do any real design modifications other than I have different style air bleed valves for up there right now you can see I have like the Jane right there the ball ball type air relief valves kind of like the floor flex ones and then I run a hose down here in case they get stuck open it just goes back into the reservoir those suck ass I'm gonna switch those out for the plunger style which I'm gonna have to put into a bushing to fit into that top piece up there so that whole black piece will come out and I'll screw a bushing into the adapter and then I'll put the plunger into the adapter and it's a way better error relief valve I won't have to run hoses back they don't fail I got a reinforced put some more strut up and run all the clean lines and all that once I mount all this troll master [ __ ] in this box I have wire covers that I'm going to put up and shorten all the wires but I got all the [ __ ] new irrigation pretty much ready to go right there and the cubes floors been cleaned everything is pretty much ready to go I'm gonna go ahead and change the orientation of these lights tomorrow so I have like basically three continuous bars running the whole length of the room and those also are going to get their orientation change better spread Schaeffer fans are gonna get moved down about a foot and a half each that way they can put their main airflow underneath the fam instead of above and the canopy it will get all the airflow just you know basic [ __ ] cable maintenance type stuff that I'm gonna get to button up and create you know the control panel and [ __ ] for now and then I'm just waiting on the other four by twelve from American Grill products should be about a week or two now and then I'll go down there and pick that up come back up put it together it takes like 20-30 minutes to put together by myself and then we'll be ready to rock but first the beans are going to be going in here and I'm just waiting probably by Wednesday or Thursday I should have this entire thing done and I'll be able to go ahead and clean and sanitize do some IPM work prep these rooms to make sure that we're not gonna have any issues and then I'll pop beans probably over the weekend I'll germinate and we'll be good to go and then that way the following week I can just pretty much watch him you know do-do-do-do-do-do oh man I gotta catch up to these [ __ ] comments now all the 35 Pablo 31 I'm not a towel you are can of this way holy [ __ ] three grand a month four bills do you think he need all them lights oh yeah I mean all those lights why have the side lights when there's what kind of question is that that's like asking why have a girl suck your dick plan you could have two girls once I can dig in one second your boss oh oh [ __ ] mmm I think I'll take both please the sidelights they give you so much more like direct light to so much more surface area and canopy and it increases your yield significantly with very little wattage it's not hard to get too much light I just agree with you there you can you can you can get too much light real easy especially with LEDs which is why it's so important to measure your par or your ppfd right that's why I got the troll master part of me here which is integrated with those lights so it can automatically dim them down to the specific ppfd that i've said to please that's fun it beefs up the lowers the meds and the uppers and depending on your growing style how much you do foliate how tall you grow your plants etc etc they can really really be beneficial because some of that stuff that you maybe would consider chopping before will actually give you the same size knows is what you're getting up top and really I don't use it to concentrate on the lowers I use it to concentrate on the mid-to hires that way if you're getting in that side light they're not going to stretch as much anyways right and then also you're hitting the majority of the the bulk of the canopy that you want to hit alright than eating the potatoes you don't want to beef up the green beans you want to beef up the meat and potatoes you know I'm saying you know larf just depends on how you how you grow really right and know you don't get too much heat before you get too much light if you're growing with LEDs it's very easy to have light burn before you have heat stress any advice about your little tips during a soil grow so it depends I mean yellow tips could be a bunch of different things top of the plant or bottom of the plan so I'm watching the chat over here I realized we had 45 people in here cheers you guys if you if the tip sir yellow like at the end of the leaf just the end of the leaf if it's a light pale yellow that's usually a sign of a little bit of burn coming on or or it's the whole leaf is like looking pale it could be a deficiency but if your leaf is not like pale then it's most likely that the start of nutrient burn it's at the top of a very young plant then it's most likely a nitrogen deficiency that's starting as your plant is requiring more than it's getting older sounds like you're getting an immobile nutrient deficiency so I would start increasing well what is your ppm or sure EC you know whatever you're measuring it in right [ __ ] it let's do [ __ ] troubleshooting night we should just start doing that because people ask me questions anyways we might as well have a dedicated night or I come on here pour myself a beer have couple dabs and we'll just go through the questions and I'll just ask one person to help me queue up the questions we'll do it through zoom webinar actually you guys can put it in the Q&A boom our third of the Leafs are yellow then that sounds like it's probably I'd have to see a picture let's just put it that way you could post a picture to the chat right now with the Google photos link if you'd like and I can check it out and I could tell you what I think it is it's really hard to diagnose based off of people's innate descriptions so every light in that room is an LED oh [ __ ] warns in here sup Lauren gabs you know what we're gonna take it down because mr. Warren is it two times [ __ ] SB and he giveaway winner lucky month guess where he's got like a [ __ ] Lucky Charms guy shoved up his ass or something oh [ __ ] kill it [Music] [Music] but I forgot what I was about to pull up on my phone oh nothing I'll take down laptop this runs is wrong so strong straight up so oh you guys are talking about topping I am super excited for this next girl one of the first ways that were the first way I grew was from seed and I had the pleasure of learning how to manifold train and oh [ __ ] man I can bonsai [ __ ] out of my plants you want to talk about [ __ ] vegging for a while I used to veg my indoor plants for minimum three months in deep water culture my plants were [ __ ] monsters but I would just veg him in spirals I would top him I would end up with like an eight headed manifold and I would spiral all the heads if you go back on my youtube videos you could see when I used to run HP s with an LED in the center I had two plants that took up a 4x4 and one of them was a c99 that I just spiraled the [ __ ] that [ __ ] was dope but yeah I'm excited to be popping all these beans because beans give you the the word is escaping me the equal growth on both sides right your nodes are gonna be nice why my brain farting on that simple word what's the word sub DC shoes I appreciate the donation my man hashtag DC shoes everybody gabs up for DC and woman on this one oh yeah you guys see how hard I'm ripping those globs and I'm not getting anything down the neck but pure vapor look at that nice ass reclaim / distillate vapor we're getting down there yes it is delicious you renounce your mad dabber crown to me [Music] you know a lot of the times what makes me have to call mid DAP is the fact that my saliva or mucus starts accumulating mid dab due to all the Turks and that post nasal drip just instantly makes me want to like gag and cough [Music] [Music] fool wiggle bigger [Music] clear my turf caves using all that [ __ ] out of there you do it put a Terps I ain't gonna do it do put Turks I ain't gonna do it so when did I start Spanky Pablo for the compliment on the rig I said gingery recycling the taste profile is like sweet candy runs and depending on you know what temp you hear that what your ramp up is on how he eats up all that [ __ ] yeah that's what's in my Amber glass here this is what I always use first is dark crystal I only use a little bit alight so right now to see if I can get a little mark off network the glitter the drip drip yeah I like all my little opals there's opals everywhere and then I haven't even pulled out the bad weather the dabber I use you made this custom to go with it carp cap diverse little nasty dirty right now but man [Music] Thank You loan yeah so I started growing pretty much at the end of 2014 beginning of 2015 I started growing in a 4x4 tent with the 600 watt HPS deep water culture and 110 gallon tote with two beans from I love growing marijuana calm who strain was gold leaf cross of alka poco gold in something else I think but it was [ __ ] huge I got quite a bit I got like 21 ounces or some [ __ ] it was cool we should see some of the the other pictures from that that I didn't post on Instagram some funny [ __ ] yeah I'm [ __ ] high [ __ ] man that [ __ ] me up so here is my first grow it was bad but in that at all I ended up washing some of it too and then pictures of my first wash it's not so great you guys not so great and I think I just washed popcorn Doug's I'm trying to see where's that uh affordable picture the top cola was [ __ ] like I [ __ ] you not I waited I'm just gonna show you cuz you guys wanna [ __ ] believe me that I thought I waited [ __ ] huge man look at that [ __ ] crazy are the roots on them with a [ __ ] dog I was running GH newts back then one plant just completely triumphs the other two [ __ ] bananas I was doing stupid [ __ ] with the [ __ ] look at that monster bugs on that thing what are all the dots on the the pieces of leaf that were trimmed all the way Oh uh-huh yeah I was I was pretty happy with that for the first girl it was a [ __ ] it was a hairy string uh-huh I thought it was partly because of how I grew it but I reached out to I loved growing marijuana and they said I did good there was definitely some things I could have done a lot [ __ ] better holy [ __ ] but man that was fun and I used to pop seeds and put them straight into neoprene collars and into dwc I know there's probably quite a few of you guys that do it but now I just wait until the taproot got long and just slide it straight into neoprene and go straight into help onyx or DWC that [ __ ] was fun ladies through experiment so [ __ ] much like it ridiculous ridiculous how much I used to experiment but I did it because I knew like if I got all my experimenting over at the beginning then I wouldn't have to worry about it later on I would be profitable you know what I'm saying cuz if you don't fail first and you just have nothing but success you're gonna get ahead of yourself and you're gonna trip on your own feet but if you trip on your own feet enough and you figure out all the [ __ ] kinks and you learn how to think ahead on certain things you figure out what works what doesn't work what scales up well and what doesn't right like aeroponics was amazing for me but I learned after experimenting with trying to run a whole room with it it it doesn't scale up well it just does it um you know it just doesn't scale up period there's no other way to put it I'm especially with the way that I was trying to do it and my limited resources it was strictly like reinvest reinvest reinvest reinvest so that I can constantly add more equipment add more plants add more space you know and I [ __ ] you not it just took about it took till about a year ago for me to get to where I was able to have this amount of space to grow and this is like [ __ ] man I'm like a hermit crab in here it's like a shell on my back it's not very big when we move and I grow like and I build a new facility then I'm gonna have like a couple of rooms you know but this is just I did once oil grow yeah hydros where it's at you guys here's what I'll tell you about soil I used some cool RIT sub cool I used his 2017 super soil recipe I cooked it for about two and a half months and then I did a piss-poor half-assed grow under like some [ __ ] tea vibes or something and that I maybe finished it under C mhm I didn't give it a fair shot at all and the results were actually really [ __ ] good given the fact that I didn't even bother to water it that much you know let alone give it teas or amendments or proper light even you know the terpene profile on it was something I grew gorilla glue number four it was something that I had grown numerous times and various hydroponic setups in the rooms under different lights and nutrients and I was very good at growing it and so I ran that and the Turk profile was completely different hold on I got to plug in his GoPro and it's like okay there we go the Turk profile is completely different it was less on the gas side and more on the chocolatey diesel earthy side it had like a chocolate ty type vibe to it and it was [ __ ] delicious and I could still taste you know the the Turk profile that I get from hydro it was still there but it wasn't the dominating terpene profile wasn't the main thing it was just chocolate II earthy a little bit of gassy just but really chocolaty and sweet and it was it was great um the effects for the high I can't say that I noticed anything you know noticeably different but I hadn't had any hydro to do a side-by-side comparison so um I would run soil again but if I were to do soil I would probably be pretty conflicted on whether I went with a potted system or like just doing beds I think for me if I were to do something in the soil I would dedicate just one room to LEDs and soil and it would be beds I would have to do beds and it would be kind of like a living soil otherwise I don't think there's a point you know it doesn't have to be like oh no till bla bla bla bla bla na man like you know working a little bit but it doesn't have to be you know I don't know see that's where I'm like inflict it on f2 because I'm not a soil guy so I'm not gonna be hardcore about one thing or another i'ma look at it from an analytical perspective and be like hmm how can I eliminate some risk here cuz there's a [ __ ] ton of horrible pests that you can have it's hard to fight them with being sterile so that's out of the option anyways if you're running soil there's no point in being sterile right but then again you can run just microbes and like like what's the [ __ ] mosquito microbe killer that I run whatever that is I forgot what it's called but you could run Mike and Vinnies and nematodes and just specific predatory mites and other insects without it being like a complete no-till living soil you know you could just be very precise with the things that you use to minimize your risk of other bad pests but it's just such a gamble man I am look in my room now and it's like I let it sit after-hours for a whole week without cleaning it and I still didn't even get it bugs in there you know what I'm saying because of how I built the room and I don't run dirty ass soil so I run rock wall and I run I ran my last friend sterile because I wanted to give it a fair shot I will never do it again mark my words all my years in all my different ways of growing I have always ran hydroponics with beneficial bacteria and microbes right and I've done it in various ways I've handed it to the reservoir not top that'd only I've done foliar applications I don't wrenches and dunks then all types of [ __ ] right and I was like all right let me try going sterile [ __ ] that I don't care how white your roots are there is a symbiosis that is happened in the evolution of this plant between these beneficial bacteria that exist in the soil where they evolve that and it creates a terpene expression in the plant that is unavailable if you are sterile hands down if you compare a hydro grower whose recipe is exactly the same - the microbes one go sterile and one goes Bennie's you're gonna have different terpene expressions the room everything can be exactly the same it could be the same exact bro you know what I'm saying I could decide not to apply beneficials to half of my plants next grow and the difference would be apparent and the growth the vigor right the health of the roots and just the overall final product the terpene expression would be different right with the potency be different I've never had anything tested for potency I will going forward but before I have it so now that I'm getting ready to pop seeds I'm probably gonna have a [ __ ] ton of testing done you know but we'll see we will see but Vinnie's absolutely absolutely absolutely will never run without them yet this lady here is yeah and [ __ ] snapped out as different environment will give you different chirps yeah but the environment would have to be vastly different to for that to happen you're talking it would have to be probably a delta of a continuous fiber or more Fahrenheit you know you're talking a room that has proper a/c and ventilation versus a room that doesn't yeah you're probably gonna have some different terpene expressions they're absolutely Stoney's [ __ ] right on the money on that different immuno responses from the plan are going to trigger different terpene responses right I like my best results always came from running this super brew that my mentor taught me I have the recipe say it was the latest recipe he ever gave me before I he told me dude you're like smarter than me now you're better than me now you're doing more research than me now you should just go and find somebody else or start teaching somebody and I was like [ __ ] really you're not gonna teach me anymore your tricks and he was like dude just pick a girl and [ __ ] out now you got it I was like all right I haven't talked to him since then other than an occasional hey man how you been but it's been like probably two or three years so let me see what was up [ __ ] was I gonna pull up that run Scottie super booth thank you I looked back at the [ __ ] thing and you had it all right let me pull up my Google Drive it's a venti recipe it uses multiple things alright I'm gonna give you guys the [ __ ] lowdown recipe right now you choose to use this if you want or not here's the [ __ ] deal the recipe is you're gonna need great white gh subculture M G H subculture B aqua shield or hydro guard GH floor blend and a sugar source you can use molasses or a hydro sweetener or turbinado you're going to put all this into a makeshift bioreactor so basically it's gonna be cool between roughly 60 to 68 degrees super bubbled and stirred or through a water pump right but if you use a water pump that's going to heat it up over time therefore you need to be using a chiller or keep it in an environment where it's still going to maintain a cool enough temperature and it needs to be light proof recommended to use RO water but any non-chlorinated source is okay everything is going to be represented in teaspoons per gallon you're gonna use a quarter teaspoon of great white per gallon you're going to use an eighth of a teaspoon each of gh subculture in and be 1/8 each per gallon and eighth of a teaspoon right then you're gonna use anywhere between 10 to 15 MLS per gallon of your hydro garden or your aqua shield all right that's your bacillus okay it's gonna keep the bad beneficials from growing okay depending on how warm your tea mixture is you're gonna want to use more Irish hydro garde right if it's warmer use more it's cooler you don't have to use as much you're gonna use one ml per gallon of flora blend which is a pre blended tea now this was all created back before Monsanto and blah blah blah and GH was taken over and sold and blah blah blah right so if you have issues with GH then find alternatives to what these are just look them up see what they are and then find alternatives all right but for a sugar source you're going to use a half a teaspoon to a teaspoon it depends on the bricks of your sugar source and the temperature of the brew the warmer it is the less sugar you need but the less time you have before your tea expires alright so real quick quarter teaspoon of great white eighth of teaspoon of G H M eighth of a teaspoon of GHB and then 10 to 15 MLS of hydro garden or aqua shield one ml of flora blend and then 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of your sugar source you're going to mix it all together and put it into your bioreactor or whatever you have to brew it let it brew for 24 hours so that it has time to replicate itself into useful proportions aka colonize doing that will make it last much longer and then depending on the temperature and how well you keep it mixed and hair rated it will last anywhere from 6 to 14 days it should always smell natural like the earth maybe a little bit sweet if it starts to smell nasty like something is rotting or foul it's bad scrub the bucket between fresh batches and you'll also want to scrub and clean the air stone for each fresh batch to the bacteria will colonize and form what looks like dark brown or black spots it's not a bad thing it's just colonized beneficial bacteria unless the smell is bad the instructions for use you can apply to all stages of growth including cloning which I used to do I would add some into my cloning mixture and that's all I would add and with maybe a little bit of cal-mag and my clones would have roots within four to five days I [ __ ] you not so you could apply it seedlings clones veg or bloom you add 8 to 10 ounces every 3 to 5 days and with fresh bedding on what you're growing and I guess right if you get too much of a buildup of beneficial bacteria colonies and your reservoir or on your medium you're using too much and or adding it too often and you shouldn't have to scrub your air stone in your plant reservoir until after the grow if you're adding it to like a DWC reservoir you only need to add a small amount if you have to scrub your air stone you're adding too much it shouldn't colonize in your reservoir like that now the way that I would apply that is I would apply that to rock wool via top feed just 3 to 5 ounces per cube at most probably once - twice a week hand-fed that way none of it is in the irrigation system none of it is in the reservoir the reservoir remain sterile running Athena AG Plains or any other hypochlorous acid and/or a citric acid to keep your irrigation lines clean and your mineral deposits from building up so if you run the proper amount of maintenance which would be maybe like three to five MLS per gallon at most of like a hypochlorous or citric acid I would run the hypo versus a citric right you can still run beneficials in your medium and that hypochlorous acid will not be enough to break down and kill those microbes but because in rock Woollett inert medium and you're pretty much feeding until you get runoff every day you need to make sure that you have colonization on the roots at least so you always feed those microbes right at the top of the crown to maybe one to two times per week is really all you need and those microbes will continue to colonize on the roots and even though the medium is being fed and somewhat flushed as long as you're not over watering you shouldn't be pretty much wiping out the beneficials they should still exist in the medium to an extent and recolonize every time that you reapply but they should never be completely wiped out but you keep it out of your irrigation and out of your reservoir your reservoir doesn't get messy or nastiest a sterile stays clean you know and if you want you can even do like a once a week dose of like - peroxide like medical grid right like maybe one ml per gallon two MLS per gallon once a week once every two weeks it'll help knock down any issues that you might have with a build so why is it that stony you're saying that molasses doesn't feed microbes why is that a big misunderstanding [Music] [Music] [Music] this isn't growing 101 what's wrong dad [Music] you don't like the tea lesson [Music] you were talking to a cat well I think it just depends on how much molasses you use and what type of molasses I think it's important to note that you have to use an unsupportable asses if you're just using regular molasses a lot of times it does contain sulfur right there's different types of molasses and there are certain ones that are specific for brewing teas but you can get so like a Blackstrap so for free molasses is what you want and like I said it's a small amount depending on how much you're using right how big the batch is what the temperature is what would you recommend as a better so brown sugar fish and brown sugar so how is how can how can a food source be too strong I'm not being argumentative at all I'm being inquisitive because you're the organics guy I'm a hydro guy my usage with microbes is very limited in comparison to ours so we need to be clear I'm coming at you in a humble inquisitive way please tell me how oh yeah TAC wavy [Music] [Music] window shopper I got a flash it out of here on me and sulfur I'm just yeah I'm just curious so oh you just heard it then go to molasses and goddammit you was just talking out your ass then [ __ ] outta here with that oh no I'm just repeating somebody told me funny that's funny [ __ ] say dad I'm [ __ ] bidding two times it's only ten [Music] [Music] oh I'm sorry I'm high three [ __ ] high [Music] dude nobody's holidays so you're you're new to the channel I think so stone you like this channel is all about breaking stoner myths and forum [ __ ] right like obviously there's great lessons that have been learned from anecdotal evidence and experience passed down and experienced through multiple growers right but at the same time there's something to be said for verifying that via science and and developing an understanding for it right so that's basically my channel is about breaking through the [ __ ] and finding out the whys how comes what Fuller's all the [ __ ] right and figuring out if there's any scientific actual you know evidence behind it and then you know that way I can research it I can understand it and once I have a firm understanding of it then I feel confident and speaking about it but until then I never speak out of lane you know I always become things that I feel like I've studied from a scientific peer review like scholarly sources me verified study do you know but there's a lot of stuff in cannabis that hasn't had no scholarly peer reviewed you know research studies on and there's not journal articles on a lot of that stuff is only available outside of the US because there's censorship in the US and you can't reach it because it's you know it's blocked off right you have to look to the Netherlands and a lot of places over these that are doing research israel [ __ ] like that nobody saying you're talking out of your ass don't you know don't take it the wrong way let me finish what I'm saying let me finish what I'm saying so what I'm saying is we welcome an open conversation here we welcome multiple points of views we welcome the debate right like I tell people not every disagreement has to be an argument right you can agree to disagree but you can still have an open discourse about it and try to seek some type of understanding or if if all else fails even if you agree to disagree maybe you walk away with something to chew on and then later you experience something that connects the dots for what that person was telling you and then you're able to understand it in a way that makes sense and then you're able to use it to your benefit right so everybody here is very open-minded we're not argumentative we're super chill and low-key positive vibes only we welcome the conversation so don't feel defensive or like nobody's coming at you because that's totally not it everybody here just wants to learn everybody here is eager learn the facts and learn [ __ ] that's gonna hold true not [ __ ] you know what I'm saying we want to be able to verify it that's all so don't feel like nobody's coming at you dog it's not like that this isn't that Channel you want to through some nugs all right you guys are asking me about what the dry and the cure you guys realize the dry and and cures done already right completely done yeah man it's it's hard to pick up the vibes sometimes when people come in here it's all gonna do it what's up magic have ad for micro crocked what do you mean micro crops you mean like having like perpetual like multiple harvest in the room or I'm an owner in the [ __ ] all the time you guys other [ __ ] everyday when somebody comes in here and tells me something I don't know and I'm so happy to learn it I'm so grateful to that person because I do so much research it's like sometimes I feel like I know a lot but then when I speak to other people that grow from you know other areas right not even different methods just other areas and learn about the challenges they face I realized damn there's a lot of different perspectives for their [ __ ] that changes just depending on where you are you know I'm saying indoor-outdoor [ __ ] hydro lor soil it gets even deeper than that right the no-till [ __ ] guys versus the regular soil guys and still put bottles loose in there's so many different avenues man it all depends on what lens you're looking through that's all that matters right I just try and absorb [ __ ] information from every angle I can and bottle that [ __ ] up in my own way and then just use it whatever way I see fit that's that's honestly if you can learn from everybody I see too many people snub their noses up at one way of growing or they'll [ __ ] it and look down on somebody because they have a smaller grow or they grow in a tent man if you can't learn something from everybody then you're a dumbass I'll say that again if you can't learn one thing from everybody then you're a dumbass so if you don't listen to what other people have to say then like here it's shutting off your own sources of information it's stupid people gotta learn how to be more open everybody so [ __ ] defensive in this day and age everybody so quick to be like you're attacking me or oh you're gonna get offended or oh I'm offended it's like and y'all got a desensitize and [ __ ] sinning yourself [Music] but you guys wanted to see what's up with the hardest so let me change my battery real quick I got a fresh one right here what's my person 12% should be enough hell yeah but anyone can [ __ ] it up so that's right so my garage is a little messy right now because of the harvest I got to call it dumpster to come so I could throw away everything so check it I did it dry for about seven days and then took it all down and cut it straight into here so that's some runt that's some run this is from the TfL lighting side the GoPro doesn't okis well but this is 507 we got a bunch in here and then I think all the raging oh this is a raging push side you can see the frost on the bottom of the bag of the ragin cush it's just visibly there more right there you can see all of that [ __ ] look at that that ragin cush puts out some [ __ ] trikes man there any on these [ __ ] TfL a little bit but not as much I'm telling you man the blue spectrum in the rating cush holy [ __ ] it just puts out these [ __ ] trikes I think I need a bigger box it's coming on the 27th until then it's Tetris baby before I start this next girl I swear to god I'm gonna finish the outside of this wall that's okay it's so [ __ ] early one in all the vapors all right okay I'll show you guys the room it's still on reset mode I'm not done yet I already come in here I did I did way earlier I'm excited to run these these are new this grow these are the six by six by four Jumbo's these are their new ones to extended to cases summer run those and these are new drippers last time I ran to gowing per hour because mango tech said those would be the best because they don't fog that's what he runs but they get water channeling so I'm around those oh my god my battery is dying so fast as I stand here and talk hold on maybe all right if it dies I'll be right back all right battery's out a hundred percent what Dad Matt which one oh yeah another piece of the puzzle came today for the bed you set up told you guys the condensate pump would come if you guys want to know what is the best condensate pump in the game the best bang for your buck it will pump probably as high as any home grower needs to go this is it [Music] diversity CP 22 okay this thing is awesome got an alarm indicator it shows running indicator it has an auto shutoff if you want to hook it up to a condensate if this thing fails it'll automatically shut off your AC so that it doesn't flood or your D hue so it doesn't flood it has a built-in fan so that doesn't overheat if it runs constantly it has like a 20 foot head I think which means you can lift it cuny 20 feet up in the air main rain or main only alright so we're gonna have another lesson I see this is the moneymaker right here they're gonna be probably underneath if I feel sick underneath I can always slide the tent up a little bit by moving the casters but it'll fit under the tray oh my god [ __ ] quarter inch away that's okay I could fit it on the side of the town and secure it right here but either way I'll get that set up underneath there now to pump out the old nutrients so all right here's the thing with the Jumbos there's it's not always bigger roots of bigger fruits so crop steering you guys that are familiar with crop steering good if you aren't familiar with it basically all it is is the way that your environment is climate steering you can't cross steering without you can't crop steer without climate steering your environment dictates the demands on your plant and in the way that you feed and water your plant will help tell the plant what type of growth it should do there's vegetative growth and there's general growth generative growth is basically flowering or producing flowers and buds and mass right you can encourage either type of growth based on a your environment that puts the demands on the plant and then be your irrigation usually you want to lower ec smaller volume of feedings more frequently and then when you go into generative growth you want to have higher volume of feedings right so you're going to be feeding a higher shot size basically a bigger shot size you're gonna do it the same frequency almost a lot of people have the misunderstanding here's a golden Nucky this is like the biggest golden nugget I could give you about crop steering when you switch to flowering a lot of people think that you want to go from feeding frequently to infrequently so you would like cut out some feedings it's absolutely not the case you still want to see the exact same frequency because the plants only going to want to more so if anything you're going to add additional feedings right but you're going to stop feeding sooner right the same veg you feed up until the last hour right and then you turn off the lights I mean you turn off your feeding and the lights go off an hour later right that's bench in flower you're gonna want to turn off your irrigation like three to four hours and before your lights go off so that they have a larger dry back overnight right in between irrigation cycles I won't give you the magic numbers but you're only looking for a small dry back overnight you're looking for a larger dry back and flower that's what's going to tell the plant hey you need to be more like a generative growth and you're gonna give it larger volume feedings you know every feeding so it's gonna be like boom I'm gonna grow I'm gonna grow I'm gonna get water only at these feeding so I'm gonna take it in and I'm gonna grow you know that is that is crop steering so when it goes to these cubes they're going to allow for faster dry backs right which basically the plant is gonna it's gonna suck up more it's gonna consume more there's gonna be a constant spike in that EC going up and down as these irrigation events happen and the dry backs occur in between shots so that's going to encourage more of a generative growth and I'm actually probably going to cut down my veg time or by about a week to two weeks and the yield will still stay the same as so long as I still run the right plant count and the right lights you know this next round I'll be running from seed seeds are automatically more vigorous plus I'll be doing an undiluted herb natural soak and then prior to popping them so they're gonna be even more vigorous because of all the special [ __ ] herb natural right usually on average they say seed versus clone if you start a clone versus a seed you imagine the same amount of time and flour in the seed is going to be more vigorous in yield 15 to 20% more in the clone I've never verified that because I've never done a side-by-side but I can say for damn sure I believe it I'm grown clones versus seeds multiple times and seeds are way more vigorous their growth is funky and the word is still escaping me am i that spelling when things are equal side by side I'm a watching chat I don't know why I'm [ __ ] forgetting that my hair got long I have to adjust my hat oh [ __ ] ah anyways I've dropped enough golden nuggets for the night I'm stoned his [ __ ] my fear is done and I want another one so I'm gonna call it a night and I'll catch you guys on the next year", "YBTCxX06o0M": "going on guys we are live partner Joe Parker here I'm just chilling here at my house about to do some gags today that's just so I'm gonna start off doing some dabs so that's what I do best and I'm going to swish up some rosin I'm going to show you guys how I won the secret Cup and turn this volume and get the feedback cool so yeah we're going to be squishing up some of this bubble hash I've got three different kinds I'll show you really quick what we got going on here so it's first kind is some super lemon cush I got four grams of this that I'm going to squish oh well you can throw this on that you know I bet you this will work better bring the camera right down here which is Jenna okay so we got super Lemon cush it looks a little dark but it's really not it's actually pretty good stuff it's just green stuff that it was in my pocket for a couple hours this one right here is a mix it's gonna be dropping in a greener today soon I'm not sure exactly what the name is and this one right here is also a mix that's gonna be dropping on the ground today so I'm pretty sure this is Wonka dominant and this one's pineapple dominant so that's just parent what I called them but that's not what they mean when they hit the shelf so first off I'm gonna take a DAB see if that camel looks good BAM so we got going on here all right cool so first off I'll take a dammit it's a this is some stuff I squished this is the dark rosin or the dark bubble huh just swish some of this earlier it kind of came out really nice so I'm gonna take a phat dab at this and I'll give you guys a better view I'm squishing it's nothing to be up there I'll bring it all down here so that you can actually see the squishing going on I'll walk you through the whole step of how I got how I won this Cup do it so the first thing that you have to do is keep an eye on or what I did is I kept an eye on the drops at a greener today [ __ ] is my torch well that's not good I thought I had everything set up here except I don't have a torch damn it I'm gonna be right back any like freakin well this is a dilemma because I found it there we go hopefully that's the right one yes sweet that could in horrible who say we got people from all over the country tuning in today Deb's - that nice being in Washington you know I'm not uh there's other places I'd rather be honestly but it's nice being the place where without consistently in the best quality I think just give so much fire all the time up here it's awesome so back to where it was I'm gonna take this down first actually job it out of my murk minion piece this guy's called the ancient astronaut my Merc minion there's instagrams called minion CCA looks like we got some new jerseys some Ohio Alberta Canada Spokane right on lots of people here today cool so um I'll get right down to it now that I had a nice pat down to taste awesome shut this guy up here for a minute bring us down here cuz you'll even look at me cuz I'm not not pretty anyways this bag this guy can get out of the way so pretty much what's going on is someone asked if would I get cake from my birthday and nobody brought me pizza for my birthday another buddy dude here from Connecticut that's cool right on so this is how I went about winning this before I read any more comments I'll pause this spot right here so I can get back to the comments after I'm done telling my my story so this is how I went about winning the secret cop you got to pay attention to the drops and a greener today because that is where the hash comes from that I won work these other people around the area that have amazingly bombed by barrage to but a greener I would recommend because all of it every single batch of public option that bought that one cups with all came from a greener today and what I did is I would call the store and find out when the next drops are coming and as soon as I found out when the fresh drops we're gonna hit I will go in there that day like that morning and I would wait for the hash to hit the shelf and as soon as the hash mister show I'd buy them all on go in there and look at it and I'd smell the 6 star in the 5 star and I would buy up all of the one with the best flavor or the best smell because you can generally tell the lightest one with the best amount and I made sure I had enough for my entry of course before I just bought it all and then I brought it home I rosin it up and this is my tech on how my rosin to that I take two graham pouches this one's actually just 1.9 I'm going to show you I'm doing this for yield this one's 1.9 grams and this is stuff that came from a greener ship today so I'll take the two grams at a time and I'll make it into little puffs first thing that's what I'll do and you can just use your hands with this stuff that it's so sticky it's bomb it's really it's all dried too so it's not sticky because it's wet or anything they do a really good job at drawing the cash that's why the when you rosin this it turns into just shatter it's not like sappy like a lot of the rosin you deal with this stuff is shatter glass so I moved that into a little puff like that this is about two grams right here 1.9 is what it was and I'll take I have these uh coffee filters right here you can get these at any grocery store really flavor announcing the good [ __ ] so I'll take them and I'll cut them up into little pouches wait about like this so it's like I can take it and fold it open so that's a people just a coffee filter that I've cut out I'll take my hash and put it inside there and squish it you don't want to be too thick I think the ideal think this is about a quarter-inch then I'll fold over the edges and you don't want your edges to be too big see how this one there's a really wide right here compared to this one's being short so we'll get my scissors right right when you find out what to put those I had all my stuff prepped up so wouldn't need this and I forgot forgotten instead all right so I'm gonna cut that edge off so that it's not all big because you don't want too much paper because it's just gonna be raw so he's gonna paper the possible the better and then you can use reynolds parchment from the store is what I like to use um I try not to get this stuff with gritted minds so I feel like sometimes the grated lines kind of may leave stuff in my material I don't know what that's about so I like to get the ones without the grit in it will just work way better and I'll take this take this this tray and put it here so I can remember the wait turn on my hair straightener this is just a Remington you can get them at Walmart this is where I like to get them honestly because they come with a you can get a replacement plan for these for three dollars and this is my third one so the replacement plan is well worth it because with these ones I have two different strainers by the way two different models this is the one that I like to use for bubble hash I use another straightener for Keef and for flowers when I'm pressing bubble hash this is my favorite straightener and the reason it breaks then breaks right here at the neck because I step on it right here and apply pressure right here at the net and they just it explodes but you can bring that back to Walmart with your replacement plan and you get a brand new one so that's awesome all right now it's a little teapot and it's a 380 that's not good I just turn it down to 300 that's as low as it'll go it's going out to cool off first second I have it turned up in 380 so so that's it there and get ready well I might as well take it down right so here's some of the stuff I pressed earlier it's pretty good stuff it's not bad I'm enjoying it it's uh with some really cheap not well cheap inexpensive is what I mean cheap really high quality level half price though so let's say congrats someone the secret cut up thank you I believe that they're going to have the batch that I won lift dropping and the greener today any day it was epoxy OG so look for the epoxy and a greener today it's gonna be dropping here in the next couple days and that was actually the batch that one would you go in there [ __ ] check that stuff out and yeah you can actually sample what I won the secret cup with so that's kind of cool yeah it's pretty awesome I bought hash for my green and today level hash and want to [ __ ] pho contest with rosin it's pretty sweet because of the secret cup the top two people a first place was actually bubble hash from third gen fan so [ __ ] fire and second place was rosin so yeah so yes why do I like that straightener specifically for bubble it has to do with the wave the straightener now it's like a little bit of flex inside of it here let me get back over there I'll talk about it get back there try to stay on this [ __ ] weird ass tripod up boom cool so the reason I like this straightener specifically for bubble hash it has a little bit of play see how it flexes right there when you press it then like the place I like Springs behind them or something and I like it because it doesn't cause you to break the pouch I'd do it at 300 degrees I don't turn it off and the reason being is because I don't burn the stuff still because I don't go for too long it's like a short duration that I do my press for with this stronger pressure that I can do which isn't that much because I'm [ __ ] the week I'm on my [ __ ] but so here we go I'll do my press for you I got my pouch already I'm gonna show you our plan here's the pouch I'll hold it up I'm gonna take the pouch and I put it in here it doesn't matter what way you put it it really doesn't matter at all but I am gonna do it kind of close to the edge so you can maybe see so I'll take it and start with a hand press and I do it just lately I like me also because I can use my hand right here without anything burnt cuz it has these little extra plastic came over as soon as I hear it sizzling I actually watch it inside I wish I could let me wash it okay you can wash it and you can watch the parchment flatten out or the filter as soon as the filter flattens out then you can step on it for 10 seconds and you really cranked off in those 10 seconds give it as much pressure as you can leave your foot up don't worry about blowing up your straightener because you know you get a free one if you blow it up whatever it is o'clock so there's the filter it's really pressed it's not really good for a second press honestly so I take these my throw me one of my cups that I got just chilling over here when I'm just filling up with second press pouches and I'll play it wash my face no later something well not like so actually we got a 55-yard buff of ethanol I just say I soaked that's what I'm used to using back in the day so there's the press from that I'm not gonna worry about collecting it at this second I'm going to go ahead and press them all out for you really quick and then we'll collect them all and then we'll win them all and then we'll point out actually it's so the next one that I'm gonna press up is this one this one's a lot smaller it's point eight so it's not quite as much and it's not gonna be called Wonka when it hits the shelves you know I don't know what it's going to be called this is just a mix from the greener today I do not know what they're gonna call it I just went to their lab because I work with those guys Mitch in this panel actually I just went to their bubble hospital because I work with those guys on my recreational side and we helped them do some grading so it's backing up this stuff so it's point eight I'll take my filter put it in there fold a packet over it just like normal and cut off the edges just like that and then I'll set this aside start stacking those up together grab another piece of parchment I already had always pre-cut just to kind of save some time with the press it's something I'm not going to worry about have it on the side because I could avoid show you anyways so I put it in there like that and I just kind of look in there I'll keep my eyes in there and watch that packet flatten out shows up something flattens out you can step on it and you just don't fully go you slowly go into it when you go for ten seconds total and when you open it welcome look closer this time you can see that the hash cannon is away from the [ __ ] packet also that's another thing I like about this straightener is it really juices the whole yield there's really no need for a second press because it pushes everything away so put that in a cup over there and I'll pull this up and collect it here in a minute and I got one more this one is a foreground press this is some super lemon cush bubble hash so me that we work with actually a camp in that personal garden I dropped it chunk this is exactly for ground just not like 4.0 103.9 or anything it was like four point zero zero on the scale so it's a little more solid like this because it has greased up in my pocket and I'm cooled off because we're in Washington where things aren't you warm you may take a little bit of playing with to kind of get it how you want it ideally you don't want your puck to be too wide you want it to be as small as you can but it can't be too thick either I've juiced the most I've ever juiced inside of one of these is about an ounce and did that with the third gen guys I didn't get that one on a video because we did that that's why I pulled out my video camera cuz I was like holy [ __ ] we got to record this press session it was Teddy's [ __ ] press so much house there I saw that video on my youtube little bit ago so there's the puck I'm a that's four grams I already got a filter right here and this one isn't full six-star like the other ones this is probably a solid three start I would say this hash and those other two actually one-sixth re there's other two or five star so they were closest six star those two or five so that I press and this one is a three star so we'll see then we'll see the end up the final return and the final product all the way to the end I'll swap it out and again this is super lemon cush in this one because it was so solid I'm going to take a second slipped out right there I stopped actually because I wanted to make sure that these are folded over properly after I heated it up a little bit because this is such a big patty I don't want this packet you know pulled out and open up on itself and then just sweet hash everywhere make sure there's a good press so that's what takes really is one little feet like that and then you're back it's gonna be good to go so just like normal you watch it and it flattens out it's gonna take a little bit longer on this one because it's four grams and it's three stars so it's not been melting so it takes a little bit more pressure and having guns flattened out and then I'll do a 10 second foot press looks like I might have broke the bat hope I didn't kind of see how dark it is I already know I did I squeezed all that hatch out damn it it's okay I'll be wrong that is what I'll do so I'm gonna get my filter we'll do that really quick here so my back breaks like that it's not that awesome pretty shitty actually put whatever down a minute cool tip for cooling this down you can just put it on your window only take a second maybe a couple seconds so yeah it's really dark because the bag broke and there's a lot of hash in it select all that one quick well and then I'll reap uck it out which really sucks I'm curious to what we got for weight right now I'm gonna weigh it we're just gonna go with it we'll know in the end with the yield was because we know we started with four grams and we might have lost a little bit because now I'm not these two papers but whatever that sucks I'd rather have clean rosin one thing you can do to avoid that blowout but I just had is I might have gone a little hard with my foot don't go in so fast ease into the pressure a little bit more than I did and you can't just use anything like you'll see the difference here in the color of all these like it you almost have to use bubble hash that comes from fresh frozen material and it has to be from certain strains because not all strains are going to make a six-star if you're going to win the [ __ ] secret Cup especially the finals it needs to be damn clear so you need to have the proper strain of six star so it's super turkey and super light not many strains can do that pineapple is a great strain for it so I'm using a new with my hands just like normal I'm going to wait a little longer that's trying to let it flatten out a little more than I did last time this is good-looking rosin now I'm gonna do my 10 second rest is just squeeze it out I might make this one a little bit longer because it's 4 grams and I gotta wait a little longer to ease into the pressure then what's good to me let's check this filter out and make sure I didn't have a blowout in Derek's spot it might just be the rosin so it doesn't look like I have any blowouts on this filter it holds it up to the light and see it still looks like I have a little bit of a blowout though as you can see that dark spot right there yeah that's some passion and I believe so what I'm going to do really quick is I'm going to you before we're going to collect it all I'm just going to scrape that part out I'm not reading again not jams but I do need to get that away from the rest of it without noting the original Patty I'm still going to dab that up for sure but that's nothing like research that Robin Lee cool you know that that's all I'm taking care of this camera back up here because that's where it's gonna go where were we get these things out the wing get myself ready I'm gonna wait collect these all up now and get them laid for you let me take another down and read a couple these comments so alas there's power pair of the Pacific Northwest there's lots of POW I skied I like it snowboard too but I really see and yeah the snow is amazing right clothes to go snowboarding today got all sorts of gear at my lab so I was busy setting up it much more elaborate some of the glassware so that I can mix up clear actually I'm not going to call we're not going to call it clear and it's call it clear so you guys know what I'm talking about it's actually just not getting cleaned up food grains you know the pieces i aiming by merck oh [ __ ] I forgot to get a job I can't have that yet what did i do what did i do there it is I almost threw away this [ __ ] ball not Robin I passed earlier so you got any questions you can go ahead and ask them I'll be [ __ ] answering the questions that are on the street is I'm going I'm gonna collect all this stuff up here we couldn't weigh it up so we can find out what the yields are and then we're gonna download all just see we can find my sharpie there it is I see it hiding over there behind my hooves shoot so where are we I got lost in its chat room and yeah that's pretty deep wasn't so yeah this epoxy that's gonna be droppin here at a greener today is going to be dropping I know for a fact that's gonna be dropping at the shoreline location I don't know what other locations gonna be dropping yet but you can pretty much count on a shoreline getting all the first stuff to drop that's like this first drop point so if you want to get all that ball mount's - like the award-winning quality out right when it [ __ ] drops just bugs shoreline bug the [ __ ] out of them find out what day is the drop and go in there and sweep that fit drop that it's so fire and it goes quick like if you show up in the afternoon you might not get it evil they don't need to be there like right when it drops so I was pressing that hair straightener was set at 300 degrees it's a little hot I don't recommend that for Keith or anything you have to have the heat applied for a long amount of time if you're just doing a really short press like even that 4 gram press I probably shouldn't have done that it was just too much time I recommend doing like one or two grande presses so then it can be really quick like 10 seconds and then off the heat it's just going to work a lot better that way Oh someone asked if there's any stray and I can recommend for a cooler climate like an outdoor and I learn island honestly I don't know a lot of the new gorillaz trends that are out there but I know back in the day I would always order from Canada and some of the strains that worked really well for me were gorillas cold Friesland there's one called sea-level that was really good but I now I know now that they have all these auto flowers next I'm working with those meiotic right now and I have a feeling they've come a long way so this one is point six point six zero from point eight zero so that's a pretty good yo that strain was the wrong Cup next I don't know what they're going to call it when it drops but that one is point six zero from point eight zero and we'll be dabbing that in just a second yeah well we swish and Alex with a hair straightener when we were [ __ ] at third James booth if that secret cup and I was going back there were just showing each other's press tacking do just like clogged up an ounce in his hand really quick with his [ __ ] nuts and he's like [ __ ] put this in your filter and I was like oh okay well first I switch like two grams just to showing my [ __ ] he was like man we got to squish more than that he make an ounce to put my filter we squished it dude just [ __ ] crazy the puck was literally like the size of the play and it was it was pretty creative yeah there's so much [ __ ] rosin blew my mind why don't I use a 25 micron screen the reason I don't use a 25 micron screen is because I feel I get cleaner more clear rosin with the [ __ ] with the coffee filters the 25 micron screen isn't gonna break and [ __ ] on you that's that's true and the coffee filters do sometimes not very often if you do it properly but the [ __ ] screens the reason I don't use them is because look at the test results for these other guys in the cup the guys that did bubble hash that one had ppm or isopropyl or not isopropyl ethanol which means that it was left over from when they were Washington at bubble baths and the other guy that entered rosin you had an even higher ppm for ethanol enough because of his pressing screens had ethanol and on so that's why I don't use the screens because you have to clean them and I don't want to just throw them away after every use just reading through the comments here so yeah when it gets dirty you can just repress you will obviously want to make your puck as small as you possibly can so that you're not wasting or any in the filter on your second press because they already places some in the filter on the first pass or really minimize that so you want to make this as small as you possibly can because it's really gonna juice a lot to you so you can make it a little thicker on your second press you just gotta go slow slow into it like normal it's gonna go through the filter really fast cause it's already mostly rosin pressure and use my finger on that but if it gives a [ __ ] right as I'm dabbing the [ __ ] out of myself that one is 1.37 from 1.9 that one there's the pineapple nips from a greener today is I don't know what they're gonna call it when it drops like I say but that was the pineapple next next one to the foot method for me is definitely standard for bubble hash I have a different method for what I'm pressing flour and key I've got a little bit of piece but it's not very good if it is horrible like 30 percent really doesn't even look good low food bowl to get washed up later so this one's gonna have two weights because there's gonna be the dirty way from what busted I believe on the second time it might not even might just be thicker we'll see why the press it out and then the weight that I think is play there and this is from a lower star also keep that money whether it might be a firefighter there's two point three seven right there and point four one so all together it's two point seven eight went down this one really quick here actually before I do anything house um it does affect the quality yah when you except when you do after when you have to press it twice the quality does degrade it's not that good but that's why you don't want to you know this isn't the commercial press by any means I'm not doing this for production this is all heads - I'm gonna smoke all [ __ ] all that's just what I do so if you're gonna be producing commercially I would definitely not recommend second process for one or if this was going to be a cup entry that second press would you'd want to save that aside just in case you needed it like you wouldn't want to put that in as actually part of your entry definitely by any means unless you absolutely had to doesn't affect it that bad it's not like oh this one tastes horrible it's still gonna taste bomb as [ __ ] cuz it's gonna be fresh and if they wait longer it's gonna it's gonna degrade faster it's mainly what happens it might have a burnt flavor we'll see I'll let you know when I dab it but that's all about how long it is exposed to the heat if it's exposure that 300 degree temperature too long it's gonna taste poppin bird I used to use it Irwin quick grants parent like him I felt like they didn't get the right pressure like they would snap back sometimes in [ __ ] I'll actually show you what I use this is an urban vise also so it's like a double clamp vise so this right here you can see clamp down you clamp it to any table like I can clamp right up in here and then you got yourself a [ __ ] table vise so it's a vice that vices itself to any table it's pretty [ __ ] sweet that's what I used to [ __ ] and press my flowers and my key and that way I can do it at a lower temperature with a higher pressure and it doesn't taste burn where was that idea it just went down on it right yeah yeah if you just depends on your weight I'm a little guy so oh I don't know what happened there hopefully we're still broadcasting it says it we're still broadcasting I don't know says my cameras turned off for some reason I don't know what that's about yeah see if I gonna fix that weird should be on", "B-Im1QApqUU": "what's up guys we're back with another dive video dica grabs we're going up to we're doing [ __ ] we got the nice new piece you use there's a [ __ ]

keep thinking back right along with us", "WE4H-gXnGJA": "yo what up boy bacon babe today I just wanted to do not really a Q&A but kind of respond to some of the questions that I've been getting in the comment section some of the comments as well we're not necessarily questions they're trying to tell me different ways to do things so I'm not opposed to taking advice only a fool would be but I am opposed to taking advice from people who are just talking but don't do if you don't actively press rosin don't tell me [ __ ] about how to do it because you don't know how to [ __ ] do it yourself I actually do it one of the comments that I had was that on one of my videos where I left a pre pressed puck inside the plates for too long while I was trying to prepare the camera so he did the material up a lot and when it came out it was a little bit darker than normal so a lot of people like to comment on that one and a lot of people are you know one person told me use less less pressure because you get more plant material in your end product and just let the heat lose it all out well that time [Music] Oh [Music] whoa whoa all right I'm still not over being sick completely sober all right so that's what I was saying um that's Bob that's backwards straight-up backwards you want more pressure less key you're not going to get more plant material in your product by using more pressure that's just not how it works the rosin bags that I use are 160 micron there from rosin evolution and they work perfect with my pre-press but you guys have to remember that when you're pressing out rosin the filtration bag excuse me those bags are not for filtration actually they're guesswork [ __ ] look they're just for containment so when you have that puck of flour and you go to press it it wants to expand and as it expands it will reach outside of those pressing plates and then you're not pressing that material anymore right so what the bags do is they don't filter to keep the plant material inside they just they keep it so that the plant material doesn't expand too far out because you could press nugs without any bags and still get all the oil without even collecting plant material the plant material only stays right along the very edge of the Google oil so again those bags aren't for filtering anything they're just for containment and make it a little bit easier what else pressing temperatures so temperatures - depending on your material you're gonna start as low as 180 and go anywhere up to like - 30 to 40 the fresher the material is the less heat that you need to use also the less time you need to press it if material is not the right humidity you're gonna have to press it for longer and you're not gonna get as good of a yield usually 60 to 70 percent relative humidity for your but it's good to start with and I'll usually press it fresh material like starting around 185 190 and if I'm not getting the yield I want but I'm getting the quality then I'll increase the the temperature by about 10 degrees until I start seeing the yield that I want now when you increase the temperature got to remember it's like a it's like a sliding scale right and right where they cross those two lines cross that's the perfect like settings right temperature time pressure so what you're trying to do is you're trying to get to keep high enough to make all of the oil lose out without degrading the actual material right so it's heat that degrades it not pressure so ideally you want as much pressure as possible without blowing out your bags right or breaking your parchment with as little heat as possible necessary to facilitate the flow of oil out of the material usually that ends up being around a thousand psi on your plates so for example my plates are 22 square inches right now to hit a thousand psi you know you're gonna have to get up there around like 13 14 tonnes because you take the max pressure that you're putting out so let's say you're putting out 10 tons that's 20,000 about 20,000 pounds of pressure now you divide that by the surface area of your plates which for me is 22 right and so I end up needing to be somewhere around like what is it I think like 15,000 psi or 15 tonnes will give me about a thousand psi so do the math on your own the base of yes the max pressure you want to get to and then you just change your temperature based on that so the higher the temperature the faster your product will start to flow right now this is where it starts getting tricky and it's a sliding scales because your temperatures too high you degrade your product but if it's too low then it has to sit in there and between those heated plates were too long even though it's a lower temperature it has to sit in there too long in order to start flowing and get the final yield so now you end up with the degrading product so like I said it's a sliding scale you want to have a high enough temperature so that you don't have to press too long but you don't want to have it too high to where it's degrading the product and then your pressure you're just going to keep ramping up the pressure until you don't get any more yield out of it so that ends up being like like I said fresh material 180 to 190 and about two and a half to three minutes for fresh stuff and then for older stuff it's usually I go a little bit higher and press rike around 210 or so for about three or four minutes but it also depends on the type of rosin that you want so a lot of people would see this and be like oh man that looks like like a big bunch of doodoo but this is your super Turkey stuff that's been pressed out at about 180 185 so you're gonna get more of the oily sheen on there right you're gonna get a lot of Terps and it comes out more like a sauce and this is cured this has been cured for about two weeks now and so this is just super super stable and this is really [ __ ] bomb but a lot of people don't like material that looks like this and keep in mind this would be super golden if I were to thin this out but a lot of people want like ghost rosin which is the stuff that is so clear you can almost see through it but people are into the purple rosin now there's a lot of trends but you can't let the color dictate everything because it's not just about the color right because of this stuff fresh bud pressed out at 180 there's a little bit darker and more Turkey than stuff that I've pressed out at higher temps of the same bud I pressed out at 2:30 you know and I've gotten slightly different looking material it was more shatter consistency way lighter color even though it was a way higher temperature right almost 40 degrees higher same pressed time actually was a little bit shorter with the higher temperature because it started to flow faster so I didn't have to press it as long you know this is some more 190 190 180 but you know you can get all different types of colors and consistencies and the point is that it doesn't necessarily dictate the quality it just dictates the parameters that were used when they pressed it so let's see what else you guys want to know cover filter bags temperature pressure time collection don't collect on anything too cold I made the mistake of collecting on top of some dry ice there was a protective surface in between but still the cold got the the rosin too condensate and create some moisture on top of the rosin and that's just because it got too cold so now I added moisture where I don't want to I want to remove it so that's a conditional time to cure and get that out properly but make sure that you have I would say like a couple is regular ice packs and then put it like a cookie sheet and I still look on mat on top of that and that should be enough to keep it just cool enough to collect easily but not getting moisture on it Oh a lot of people asked me about the the paper I use PTFE squares so I don't use parchment the reason I don't use parchment is because 90% of the markets parchment paper is covered in silicone silicon is very very easily broken down by a lot of different terpenes specifically D limonene which is very high and a lot of Turkey buds and so when you go to press you'll notice you have your little circle your puck of Bud and then around that puck there's like little box where it looked like it seeped through the paper or the bud is eating through the paper and that's actually the the terpenes eating through the silicon and then getting through the parchment paper so what happens when that happens is the silicon gets broken down by those terpenes and then when you're scraping up your rosin you're actually scraping up bits of broken down silica that get into your rosin and then when you when you ignite that or vape it burn it whatever that's toxic silica is extremely toxic when ignited and ingestion so those of you that are pressing on silicon treated parchment paper still chances are they're silica in your material you may not notice it but it's there now it seems a little bit easier to collect material off of parchment compared to PTFE if you do not have the correct temperature to collect it on if I were to place ice packs underneath this and then collect my material it comes up extremely easy way easier than parchment nothing gets stuck to this it's the most nonstick one of the most nonstick surfaces known and unlike parchment paper that is only heat treated or heat rated up to like 400 450 degrees PTFE is heat rated up to 500 degrees and pressure rated up to 500 pounds I think it is which is pretty significant nothing breaks through this in my experience I have not broken through a single PTFE sheet so that's why I use these I got a pack of one thousand four by four squares for 125 bucks from turkey roof comm or you can check out the version PTFE roll if you guys are doing bulk compressing with larger presses get a whole roll of this this is 14 inches across and I think this sheet was like maybe safety ET or something like that and this was like I think 100 something bucks it's worth it so think that covers and yeah it's depressing show me what you guys got if you guys have any questions comments please drop them below this was a very impromptu video I was gonna do like a whole little script and make sure I covered each bullet point but dabs happened and then I just started talking and here we are now so that said you guys have any questions about processing material growing anything like that drop them below I reply to almost every single comment if it's worthy of a reply show me what you guys would like to see in the next video and if you guys have any material that you want processed and you know the Southern California area hit me up and I'll press your stuff for you and I'll show you what it's like happy dabbing I'm about to hit this and I'm gonna be out of here [Music] [Music] we're hearing all the stuff in my email probably today because I'm impulsive and I have money right now all I need is another control box similar to the one that I built for my rosin press a PID controller and a plug-in spot for the coil that I already have so it shouldn't cost me a more than about a hundred bucks and I'll be able to build the control box for for the email and I won't be torturing anymore because [ __ ] this shit's annoying especially because I smoke in the grow room now because my wife is pregnant and I'm not trying to have her getting all secondhand smokey up in this [ __ ] so I don't smoke in the living room anymore which is where I usually chill and play video games so I got a run in here to take dabs or smoke and then run back out there in between rounds or games it's like man I wish the [ __ ] was just always lit always torched up ready to go I could just come in here drop it down and be out but I got to spend like a good minute and a half [ __ ] torching this [ __ ] up to get it clean and then let me cool off but it's all good oh yeah the I don't have any packs in here with me but I did make these little gel packs I rosin in coconut oil this shake is for I take four of those it's a wrap a rat I was in Chicago for business with my lady over this past week and that was what I would do I didn't take any flour and dab anything to smoke at all all I took was those pills I was a pill-popping animal and she would hate me like 3045 minutes after I take them and it was just kale like chili Hey [ __ ] dog barking for no reason Cheers [Music] I can't wait to not be sick [Music] whoo [Music] alright that's it for me they can be about catch you guys next time", "LlrJgCBATaY": "what up y'all chill boy bacon babe I just want to bring you guys a quick video showing you some different rosin I just got this gorilla glue rosin back from my boy who vac purged it for me because basically I collected on top of some dry ice and so the rosin collected moisture so you threw it in the back of him for me and as you can see at that fire fire looks really good really nice color see right through it so there's that one and again people will say that looks dark but it's funny because this is a gram actually this is a little over a gram and this is the same thing straight up clear but yeah oh the dust and the hair and it that people think right my shits clean so there's that right and then this will give you a different view so there's that and then I've got some of this gorilla glue which is the stuff that I've been smoking on for the past couple weeks and this is a thick little puck right here but it just goes to show you kind of the different consistency that you can get there's kind of squeezing this down just from how stuff cures you know this stuff is more stable and then I've also got some black sugar rose rosin that I pressed out earlier today it's a really low yield err so I don't really do it often but I got a gram and a half off of just under 10 grams so that's what I normally get around 12 to 16 percent of the range I think I've pulled on it it's got just a really cool color to it it's really stable grab this here you get y'all just breaks off so it's super stable and so I'm gonna go ahead and actually take a hit off of that I'm gonna go ahead and close up this big guy here close that up and that's about 36 grams right there so I'm gonna try and get you guys a cool shot of me pretty much dabbing this and the clean email hopefully I can cut through here clean get a nice strip off broke all right so you guys can see what that looks like and let's see if I can get this for you and this is fire [Music] superbomb super stable all right peace out", "DrktgM8Qgh4": "this is a disclaimer this channel is for educational purposes and entertainment only for the cannabis community and other communities so if you're not 18 better get the [ __ ] off of my channel right now and shout out to King Vader for the instrumental of this intro go show him some love baby Ronnie do you get the [ __ ] out give me the damn view and then exit the damn video please and thank you and enjoy [Music] [Applause] [Music] what a duty always good week back in a dad dungeon shout-out to all my loyal subjects tuned in it's your boy king mark we're here and we out here you already know if you hear you know what we're here to do we're here for another review today we've got something for you today we got some loud some straight loud we got some yard you know 7/10 always got that fire we're gonna review today we're gonna decide or actually we're not gonna decide what we're gonna have a little debate you know what is better in my opinion you know what's better saws diamonds for Percy rosin and we'll be discussing that in this video today and we'll be taking the DAP of both we'll be taking a dad with some saws diamonds I will be taking the dev of some rosin so we better find out you know I'm gonna give you my personal feedback an opinion on what I think is better but to each their own you know what I'm saying take this with a grain of salt you ain't got a listen to what I have to say you know everyone has their own opinion on things but enough of the chitchat let's get to it you know how I like to start my mornings with a DAB so let's get to it alright so we got the saws diamonds right here from Oasis some fire og saws diamonds dipped in sauce those are nice bro look at that sheesh shadow Oasis all right have you guys ever like just dip the fattest diamond ever and just and took the whole thing in the dab she's amazing bro I swear and then right here we got the rosin as you can tell I've already dabbed it I've had a I've had it for like a few days now it's why it's got this color honestly man I'm not gonna lie to you the smell on this one's amazing it's the foot it's the flavor sour 10 sour tangi crossed with watermelon skittles this shit's amazing it's tier 3 I guess they have tiers on on 710 now you know tier 1 2 & 3 but you know here it is and we're about a compare you know we're not gonna well I can't tell you like you know which we get will get me higher because I would have to take I feel like in order to actually like see what gets you higher you would have to actually take a dab of one and then the top of the other but like separately separate time so you could actually feel the full effects you know what I'm saying but what we're gonna do in this video is we're gonna decide which one is smoother which one tastes better and overall which one do I think gets me higher and which one is better so personally me I can already tell you like what I my opinion is because I have yet to try the diamonds and I haven't had any diamonds in a while so I can't like compare them too much but personally me rosin is especially 7/10 Percy rosin is absolutely smooth and there's 100% flavor in it every time every time sauce diamonds Sol's diamonds kill you and they have an extreme amount of like terpene flavor but the thing about diamonds is they sometimes either come like this with sauce and diamonds or sometimes they just come straight diamonds no sauce or sometimes you'll get lucky and find a few of diamonds and sauce but that's the thing about diamonds you never know if you're really gonna have any or not and your when you cop them and with this Percy you'll know you'll always have this good nice color this quality and this taste but enough of the talk was getting to the action hold on before we get into that just get a diamond now look at that bruh this is already a coup Deb alright let's get to it just let you guys know I don't really like the torch with a high flame I used to kinda lie I used to torture the really high flame but I realized I liked when I owned a reclined collector if you're the type who likes to you know who have a who owns one or a collector reclined just know that the less the less high your temp on your torches the better your refund will come out for you and will come out lighter and it won't taste like [ __ ] regardless if you think about at the end of the day when you're torching your nail your [ __ ] what where's the gas going you know what's going through your glass it's the gas is going through the glass so it's going it's gonna obviously it's gonna take effect on your reek line just a little tip you'll obtain just a little tip all right so we're about to take a dab of good diamonds I'm gonna make it you know what they're add another one step let me know in the comment section down below what form of wax you prefer batter Saturday rosin diamonds [ __ ] distillate whatever all right guys Cheers and good morning I cried not even gonna fret [Applause] oh my god look at me I'm done and that was just the first dab whoo Todd guys I'm high off my cheeks God so my thoughts on that oh [ __ ] nah but on some real [ __ ] though I'm [ __ ] loaded off my ass bruh I ain't no cat imma to like this I had diamonds in a long time and those were delicious no cat no cat that [ __ ] was fired like I'm gonna tell you like this when I was hitting it I only I had a diamond then and I had a little diamond I added at the end on top of it and when I threw it in there and it melted in my nail the [ __ ] bra so when diamonds are dipped in sauce it obviously are coated with sauce and even though it may not look like much but there's their sauce all dripping around them and it doesn't look like it when you have it on the pig but they're coated in sauce and that's just still burns too so it makes a fatter dab than on top of what the just the diamond that you did in you can't forget it's coated what sauce because they've been sitting there so when you get the [ __ ] dab when you get the diamond from your [ __ ] container it's gonna your pics gonna have a little sauce oil on it you know what I'm saying from trying to get those Diamond Brite tell me why when I took that dab both of them rocks were melting and to hell a more sauce and that [ __ ] was still sitting there and they just get both I am so late I'm so late but ok grating it I give it a good 8 in half 9 its flavor was great the way that she melted was [ __ ] amazing it was nice and light yellow it was perfect it was beautiful it was very smooth the reason I was coughing cuz I coughed all the time so like people are different but I enjoyed every bit of it they were pretty damn smooth they were good they were very good now let's get on to the Percy embargo Super Saiyan before I take this [ __ ] die because I needed charge my key and recuperate my energy I need to come back you know what I'm saying I'm about to charge my key and go super saiyan in this [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah as eaters Beaute is more important to food booth hey it's more important to water alright and there's this monstrous dab that's I swear to god sometimes this wax does not look right sometimes Tommy just doesn't look like another hard substance bro Jesus Christ anyway this is it now let's do this better damn you up [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah if any company would like to sponsor the kid feel free to hit the bigger your notes if they go now and get there [ __ ] me me up stop [ __ ] playing I would gladly smoke out your [ __ ] [ __ ] hear me I love to smoke and review your [ __ ] so go ahead and yeah you don't know if we're going on user alright Percy rosin sorry tangi watermelon skittles Cheers [Music] I Wow all right Mattel it is the saws diamonds were [ __ ] amazing there's no Catholic absolutely amazing it burnt great and you don't even need a lot because that [ __ ] just burns into even more when you melt a diamond but this is just insane why does your birds it's you in smokes I don't know I love it you just it could just be the fact that since rosin just comes pressed from hash board or weed now it just produces thicker smoke I don't know and I've really enjoyed this one way more I am so dead guys holy [ __ ] I can't even talk alright so if you want to ask me I'm literally high off my [ __ ] cheeks look at my [ __ ] eyes god I am lit and I'm enjoying every single second of it so if it's up to me the choice is obvious is it between the diamonds or the rosin drumroll please and the winner is the perceive rosin yes sir the reason I choose the rosin and bra the taste and smoothness of it is an undeniable it's like smoking an ugh maybe it's just the fact that you know it's pressed from hash or Roselyn itself is just respiratory and it just tastes so good but that's my that's my choice that's my opinion let me know what you guys think what do you guys like more do you guys like batter shatter sauce diamonds hash water hash what do you guys like honestly that should be my next one because I really like water hatch I enjoy it so much that I would have it's a tough decision between water hash and or hash rosin honestly I know it's another form but I love them both well let me know what you guys think links to all my other channels and other Co channels will be in the description down below you guys already know how to [ __ ] this [ __ ] works go [ __ ] it like comment subscribe hit the bell I'll see you guys next time please [Music]", "gBxDK8RyU-4": "what's going on y'all supreme reviews here coming back at you with another episode of dab talk a series we review cannabis concentrates in six different categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was mildly

straight up nice lemony citrusy huh I feel it in my chest isn't it made me talk too much and you guys know a couple Appa oh my god I feel it in my chest it's the oh my god and I just feel it like that nice pain I'm not gonna lie it's on par with this with this heart ng from 7-10 I'm not gonna cap some gas and does it taste like the cart I won't you're gonna have to find out on the next video to get my opinion on that but holy [ __ ] final conclusion at the end of the day for the lemons and apples did I taste any Apple like any apple 'no sin it no not really well I did taste the slight sweetness but to be honest with you I don't know that was Apple but the lemon must have overpowered and completely because it tasted wonderful it tasted very citrus like citrus any I don't know how is that even a word yeah citrus any but very citrus flavor like very citrusy there you go that's the word very citrusy I definitely will give him nine out of ten it compares to the 710 sour tangi I'm not even gonna lie god I love it you guys should definitely get this if you see it on the market you when I saw them both I was like you know what wind up [ __ ] up I was looking for a cart but then I saw this in sugar form so I'm like like it and this new little form form of a conserving the wax and the Terps and flavor profile and the smell like you could definitely see the difference 100% like because of

at you and yeah we got the dry sip set we had this for some time now I just wanted to take a moment in a show that I do support even the guys that uh we talk [ __ ] to each other once in a while I still support you guys oh yeah but you got it all right you gotta support everybody in the community and uh yeah good stuff bubbleman screens not sure if they're made in China or whatnot but uh definitely good stuff love him they do the trick even picked up his little cards you know what I mean just to show some support man they're good little cards and he's a good dude that's been in the scene for a long time just because I don't agree with everything he does doesn't mean I don't like him I do subscribe to him and do watch his stuff and I suggest that a lot of you new guys do subscribe to him as well and definitely check out his stuff he does a lot of cool stuff a lot of traveling which definitely keeps me entertained and a lot of good hash making tutorials for a dry sift in bubble hash and whatnot so uh let's get to it over here we're over at the extraction office as you can see we're getting ready to just collect some nice heads and then gonna get to it with the big guns you know how we do it but uh okay let me just guys gonna have a little puff if you want and now let's get talking so what we got here is these are the little labels that go on the bag this is a pound that's a pound this is like a pound and a half these are some new flavors that I went ahead and created and after harvesting and testing these are some of the new strains that I'm digging the best that I really really like you can tell there is some leaf inch left on here because they're being collected for hash and stuff like that and before they get blasted so I like to leave a little bit of a better leafy air trichomes on there for the bounce on the screens this is the gorilla glue cross with the forum super super potent you can see even the outside of the fan leaves super crystally a big fat swollen notes I'll even pick up like little buds you can see the top big fat swollen nodes little leafy but these are for hash so uh just kind of picture them if you trim them up yourself a little bit better and there we go gets a nice nice color you can see great flush again this was from the organic batch so you can see a little bit more yellowing leaves than the typical hydro but the flavor is there and a full turkey profile as well you know I do get some gigantic knobs from the strain as you can see try to get some good light here this really does the butts no justice guys might not the lighting looks like [ __ ] as you can see perfect great flush nice organic flavors just stinking super super crystal a big fat notes just your basic fire guys again this hasn't been all squeezed up and turned into like super hard nooks and trimmed up so again judge it how you want call the schwag call it what you want but it's pretty fire actually it's absolute fire I love this string but uh this strain right here a lot better as you can see bigger fatter knobs that am more type less leaf but you could tell still picks up some of the color from the cookie Parliament now this was the key lime skunk or the lime skunk cross with cookies male pollen that's one male pollen you know this is what happened when I grew it out and it's super dank super hard the lime skunk mom was super vigorous plant that's why I chose to grow it as you can see again a little bit of yellowing no big deal that's the organic I love it when it's for my testing I just love using like nice organics we have mild nutrients just to get full flavor and a full trichome production as you can see the trikes are just overwhelming on every part of the plant not saying that can't be done with the hydro just the hydro does blow up your plants like mutant style so if you're trying to get a good picture of your actual plant and you throw it up in hydro it's not going to grow the same you know like outdoors and organic and all that so it's almost like cheating so I like to know that if I could do this with organics when the hydro comes it just goes insane but as you can see you guys look at those tops just beautiful and this one is tested as well where's the little tag there's the tag if you want you could pause it and compare the terpene profiles because that's really what's going on guys you can see the dark red really really full and the purple blue and then that little bit just has a whole bunch of terpenes in that little little area right there as you can see the Kimbo cookies has a wider spectrum a more full profile of more wide range of terpenes and it's funny cuz out of all the people that smoked it they think this is the strongest and I do too I think this is the strongest out of all the buds but again that could be due to the low percentage of CBN or the wide variety of terpenes has a lot of that cookie came to on this one just strikes so you can see the purple trichome stalks passed over from that Kimbo and that purple trichomes has a antioxidant that's similar to what's in blueberries and stuff like that but there's many varieties of that one antioxidant and yeah it could be linked to curing cancer as well so you use guys to search that and google that so a lot of us some purple strains that actually contain purple tricone stalks have a more medicinal value and now that's yet to be studied guys there's a lot of studying to do you know how it goes everything's brand new but this is just stuff I've been working on and that's why I'm testing my stuff a lot lot more and just trying to figure out exactly what's going on in these profiles in this cannabis as you can see it's complete fire I mean we already know that but we got to know what's actually making it fire a lot of people thinks it's just the 30 percent THC this weed gets me more high than all the rest but it has the lowest THC and as you can see it has way more crystals than all the rest looks by far better and has a weird complex smell that complex smell has all the Terps in it as you see but it's very hard to describe guys it does have a little bit bit of the berry from the Kimbo that little blackberry flavors it has a lot of the cushy undertones a little bit of mint from The Thin Mints but it really is hard to describe and in the testing as you see it just has a lot a lot of different terpenes and a lot of them in percents but low low THC and yeah guys now these guys always test about 10 percent lower than everyone else - so you see this like SC Labs it would be 28 instead of 18% and out something like that would be 31 instead of 21 but you know that's all due to how they cap calibrate their machines and all that [ __ ] so if you just stay testing from one lab that you know their lab is just like local to you and they're you know they're legit they're straight up at least you could just save all your snapshots and it's by their calibration so then you could save some of these and send that to SC labs and then compare the two to see exactly how much higher it was and all that but just for your own sake and just definitely to have good records on that it's very good to do it this way and also you can see it helps with Karen because you can see the date is over a month old and these buds right here you can see they've been caring for some time now guys and that's the other thing with people and how they do their weed you can see everything's intact well drying is key and there is no movement these buds do not get bumped or moved around and they get picked up very carefully put into plastic containers or into these bags just like this and then they get just sealed up all the love stays in there no [ __ ] shaking them when they really try all the trichomes fall off one shake now as you can see down there we keep the bow over two packs and I'm [ __ ] you to keep them up and these pecs are reusable guys you can see this is still that gel in it when they turns to crusty hard rocks just add water to this in a ziploc bag leave it overnight and it'll rehydrate itself and turn back to gel and then you can throw it back in your bags especially not big big bags that have multiple pounds you know there's a big huge huge s turkey bags guys so you can put a few boulders in one of these but as you can see it helps it look barely any trichome stuck to the bag itself because the buds are still really nice for curing like that perfect not too crunchy not too sticky you can see the stems are perfectly dry but not gonna shake all your trichomes off all over the place so that is key in keeping your trichomes real real nice for a long period to get a nice care and then to let these sit out maybe dry over here on the board on the table throughout the day to get them real crispy and then you could go ahead shake them off just how you want and then you have a nice cure trichome heads and then you come back and blasts all the rest but the beginning is to keep those buds perfect like that throughout the whole curing process guys and that means don't [ __ ] touch him don't [ __ ] with all year I down all right guys I just wanted to do a little talk what do we get nope didn't even talk about the wax so this is what's being produced what you're gonna do about it but super stable super wax that's what's really popular right now seems like the shatter is dying down everybody's going for the mortar vivre value stuff and as you can see we're putting in work so stay up guys big Dan over over now I just wanted to do a little update of what kind of fire has been a town what's been going on and a a little bit talk about the extraction process and these are real nice to oil slicks PTFE sheets real nice pour out your stuff don't throw these in the oven good to go real nice reusable and you know parchment is good too but if you got time and you want to try those out real good you could use it for your

going down do it", "J28tzotya0g": "we hope everyone's having a good ass day today we're going to do a review on gmo cookies is the strain it's one of my favorite strains back in the like you can tell basically pretty recently i used to only like like my fruity strains like the strawberries and everything like that and like tangy i still i still do that i'm still always dabbing on but i have began to love the like gassy gmo strains they have just became like a staple in my my dabbing whatever the hell you want to call it but yeah so that's that we got gmo cookies live hash rosin from grow science grow science is one of the upper echelons brands here it's like 710 if you're from california and then we also got some more live hash resin gmo this one right here it's starting to butter up but it's not it's not all the way buttered up you see how it kind of looks like it has the you know clear like just not buttered up texture like this one this one right here is buttered up there's nothing wrong when it gets buttered up it's just buttered up i mean as you see how that's a lot different texture right there we're gonna take a dab out of both those um really what happens is when it just uh is out in the air for a while or it um you know gets agitated i guess is when it starts to butter up which there's no problem with it some people um prefer it buttered up i feel you do get a little bit of different terps from it um so it is pretty good and then we got the hash this is just regular like five star so it's not depressed like this it's not pressed like the live hash rosin god damn i got my [ __ ] ah all right but yeah so that's the see if we can get that yeah there we go full melt live hash rods gmo cookies as you see this has just a way a way different texture way different consistency there we go about time just look at the difference in that and we'll take a dab of this too even though it's almost gone i need to get some more of this five star hash if you haven't tried five star hash it is just it's like it's really a game changer when it comes to dabbing in my opinion anyways um it's just a lot different like live hash rosin is a game changer too if you haven't dabbed live rosin you are missing out it is the smoothest just best dab you're gonna have it is and it gets you high like a flower high too which is the great um great thing about it so for all you that don't know what live hash rosin is um let's let's get google's definition of live hazard let's see what they have to say live hash rosin okay i want to be a [ __ ] live hack of course you get everything in live hashtags and carts of course you can't even really get anything that's crazy all right let's try hash rosin all right sorry about that just how it is sometimes our hash rosin 101 made with no more than water heat and pressure and a few good tools half thousand became one of the most prized forms of cannabis resin today that's one thing that i just wanted to make sure i was highly positive that all half rosin was just ice and water and heat and pressure and that's how it's made um there's no chemicals no solvents i was i was 100 sure that but i didn't know exactly if it was just always iced and that's how i get all the terps off if you haven't watched like ice hash making video go and check that out it's it's amazing like it is really [ __ ] just badass how they make it um since we're talking about a little bit of hash rosin too um that's honestly what i love to dab on the most um so then we got other types too um well we got this is gonna be some live hash rosin jam which is [ __ ] just amazing too of course from the grow science cultivators out here as you see it's like a syrupy like sap just it's like a sap and it's uh got a really nice texture to it just really good texture good flavor this is straw nan oh not your straw nana straw man oh oh for sure and then um this is one of the ones that has been flying off the shelves here in arizona pink pellegrino bypass resin press press and this is what i'm talking about this one hasn't really buttered up at all and that's what you get when it's not buttered up at all this [ __ ] tastes like pink grapefruit and it's just such a smooth smooth dab that's one thing that's great about the live hash rather than ros and dabs such a smooth dab just it's it's it's [ __ ] great if you haven't tried live half resin try it growth and is doing their [ __ ] thing here in arizona with the live half rosin they're my really my go-to when it comes to live hash browsing here in arizona grow sciences definitely doing their thing that's for damn sure but anyways enough to talking enough for the [ __ ] well actually we're gonna talk a little bit more because we're gonna take a dab of this gmo and then we're gonna talk about gmo and then that will be my review on gmo live hashtags from grow science let's get it while we're heating up this banger we might as well uh go and get the strain that we're doing today which is gmo cookies gmo gmo cookies strain gmo cookies strain here's the definition of straight strain or moving uniformly in one direction what a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] i guess we'll type it in because we're having all sorts of trouble let's try one more time strain gmo cookies right now in mesa there's only a low chance of rain well i don't know what the [ __ ] that was all about but pretty annoying all right let's heat this banger up and let's take a dab all right well what uh you're probably just gonna hear the [ __ ] torch that's all you're gonna hear but uh gmo cookies aka garlic cookies is a powerful indica dominant strain cross between chem dog and girl scout cookies ah i like it when the chem dog comes through the most out of doing the gmo but anyways um the ability to it comes with the ability to re relieve playing a pain without putting your ass to sleep i don't know this [ __ ] really [ __ ] puts me on some couch block that's for sure gmo cookies [ __ ] it puts them back i don't know why it definitely does the indica hits me strong well and uh yeah every gmo cookies that but anyways um the chem dog ancestry and demo provides a pest a petrol smell layered with coffee and fruit while it's gs girl scout cookies for senator tries a sweet and earthy flavor chemo cookies is bred by divine genetics what do you bark now what yeah damn this video is getting [ __ ] up that's for damn sure but we're gonna keep rolling we're doing the one take on this one i will start editing um my videos more when i figure out how to use the everything uh software i downloaded um i honestly have never edited anything in my life so we're gonna just give it a try one of these days but this is not gonna be that video i just feel like doing a one take on it and that is what it is so um yeah we're about to take a few dabs with gmo and then we're going to call it a [ __ ] video show that's how we're doing it bang your [ __ ] [ __ ] good in the hood boom boom boom yes i know i heat up my banger way too long everyone tells me that but uh yeah this thing is just some cheap glass like get the [ __ ] out of it just about every time get everything off of it and it's still clear this thing's a couple months old and it's cheap cheap quartz in it [ __ ] still that [ __ ] [ __ ] pretty clear bro and i [ __ ] heat the [ __ ] out of that and i do dab quite a bit um but yeah let's go ahead and get this dab ready let's put it this pink pellegrino back in the stash what are you burning that booga bat all right and uh the first one we'll take is uh off the gmo that's not quite completely buttered up it's starting to butter pretty good already um that's my fault well really i don't really mind when it's buttered up but i try to keep one buttered up in one knot just because i'm i'm a dork like that um but yeah it's all personal preference we're gonna pop this back in on some ice and i'm back just like that anyways this banger should be about about where it needs to be about where it needs to be i guess not i guess being close actually you know the first dab didn't already have that on now that's already on the dab we'll take that next step is going to be oh damn how much [ __ ] [ __ ] is gonna [ __ ] like that would have been [ __ ] that i would have took out you know but we're not taking anything out we're gonna take a dab with this right after the dab of that we'll talk about this dab once i take that right now yeah but uh if you haven't yet go ahead and hit that like button if you're watching it on youtube go ahead and hit that subscribe button give it a thumbs up we're going to be putting more content out like this if you like like the reviews and my thoughts on stuff you know let me know we'll keep doing it if you want to see something else let me know that too if you just want to see big dabs we can do that too but i think i do like reviewing stuff well you know i already have the review of the aura maybe we should redo the one of the g pen and pick up some new devices what do you guys think what do you want to see and we have all missed that [ __ ] too let's get it live hash rosin gmo cookies from grow science get that [ __ ] [Music] [Music] hey see everybody will notice see if anyone notices order everybody wants to catch that wow that is a class right there [Music] did you catch it that time probably not we'll do it one more time what the [ __ ] are you talking about if you didn't catch it you didn't catch it it is what it is but if you did catch it put in the comments see if you're right see if you are right wow i [ __ ] nailed that dab right there it's one thing that's really [ __ ] nice about that temp gun especially when you're dabbing [ __ ] [ __ ] like this [ __ ] this [ __ ] 70 80 dollars for one gram so i mean nowhere no way near is this any cheap ass [ __ ] and that's the thing like i know you can go get grams of [ __ ] shatter for 10 bucks but i would rather have this one grams all day than eight grams of shatter say why because i would"}
