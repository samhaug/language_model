{"9m3BFQd0-6Y": "all right folks so what we're gonna do today is talk a little bit about making apple cider and I used to make apple cider years ago I never done it for a real long time and I'm talking like 15 maybe even 20 years and just recently has okay you know what I feel like making a batch of cider some hard cider and what I'm gonna do though is I'm actually gonna try to make apple pie hard cider and there's gonna be couple different things that we're gonna do to try to pull this off I went out on the internet looked around and I'm not the first person to come up with this idea so I'm not that original or clever but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use just some Wegmans this is a hundred percent fruit juice it's made from concentrate it does have some vitamin C additives to it to kill bacteria but that should be fine typically when I used to make cider I would actually use my pressed apple cider that you can get and you have to be really careful when you buy that because a lot of times they'll put yeast inhibitors in there and if you buy something with the east' inhibitor it's not gonna ferment I think there's some tricks that you can do like boil it or freeze it or something like that to pull the inhibitors out but I'm not gonna go through that setting out for this we are going to just use straight-up fruit juice you can use organic for juice and you can actually make other kinds of cider too like you can use grape juice or cranberry cocktail or just variety of different things to go ahead and make that now when I would make this stuff I would add sugar to it and the reason I would add sugar to it is super boost the alcohol content right that's the whole reason that you're making hard cider or not drinking regular cider and for this one I'm actually gonna add dark brown sugar a lot of folks will say things like hey don't put sugar in your in your hard cider because it's so easy to ferment apple juice or apple cider any way that it gets to be really really dry and the more sugar you put in there the dryer and products going to be but we may have a plan for that when we get there but for this I'm gonna use one gallon of juice no put two cups of this dark brown sugar in there and I'm adding that dark brown sugar in there because I want to get it more like an apple pie taste than just a hard cider and then I'm gonna put I don't know four or five six of these cinnamon sticks in there as well and then for the east I decided to go with this champagne yeast and again I went with the champagne yeast you can use you [ __ ] you can use bread yeast and get it to ferment which are we gonna end up with about four to five percent alcohol by volume that's one thing that you can do is use a yeast it doesn't ferment fully or don't ferment as long and then that way your your end product won't be as dry but you could use beer brewers yeast you can use wine east or you can use this champagne you stand even have a cider use I'm going with the champagne East because of tolerates higher alcohol volumes and so I'm gonna ferment this for two to three weeks and I'm hoping they get somewhere around 15 I'd hope to get 20% alcohol by volume but I think I probably finished at around 15 I can't find my hydrometer so I don't know how I'm gonna be able to measure alcohol content but what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna pour this into a big old pot put this cinnamon sticks in there and I'm gonna boil it up and one of the reasons I want to boil eyes I want to get this sugar fully dissolved into into my juice here but I also want the flavors to get a chance to kind of meld together before I put them into the glass jug for fermenting and then add in the yeast so that's it we're gonna move on to the next step all right all right folks so here we are and this is the inside of the cooking pot so the first thing I'm going to do there's no good for this gallon of juice in there we go the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to add two cups of the dark brown sugar and you can see that stuff is clumpy that's gonna be tough to work with but that's why I wanted to get this on the oven and get it get it boiling I'm hoping that's gonna help it dissolve and break up and I'm sure it will and then I want to make sure this has a really good cinnamony but that's the word taste to it so that's five just go ahead there alright so this isn't gonna be overly glamorous so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna boil this I don't know 30 minutes something like that after I've seen all the sugar dissolve and then after that the next I was gonna be let it cool down and then transferred into the glass container that we're going to this is our primary fermentation vessel so yeah that's it folks see you in a little bit alright folks the recording studio is not really set up for this so moving forward we're gonna have to do this kind of stuff somewhere else if we used to continue to do videos like this so anyhow this is the stuff that boiled on yesterday earlier in this video and the day got away from me while I was waiting for this to cool and I didn't get a chance to get it fermenting so I'm gonna do it today one thing I did off-camera that you guys did not see is I took this bottle and I added one cup of Earl Grey black tea and brewed with two tea bags the reason I did that is I wanted to add some tannin to the mixture so I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna add some yeast to this we talked about it yesterday we're gonna use a red star champagne yeast then we're gonna put a little bit of this yeast energizer yeast nutrient in then so uh let's go ahead and get started I don't have to use the whole pack of yeast I think a half a packet would do I think even a quarter of a pack with you but this stuff is so cheap and I don't know what I would do with it I guess I could wrap it I'm put in the fridge and all that stuff but I don't want to measure it so that's almost all of it and then this yeast nutrient calls for 1/2 of teaspoon per gallon let's go ahead and put that in there all this stuff has been sterilized you want to make sure that you keep your stuff reasonably clean while making this stuff smells like apples they put this on I'm gonna shake the [ __ ] out of it I'm not sure if I should have done that or not but it seems like it makes sense all right there is the one gallon glass container that we're gonna go ahead and ferment in so I have a sanitized funnel we're gonna go ahead and put that in there and then carefully I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna pour the juice really smells like cinnamon I mean it really smells like cinnamon there goes all my yeast alright what I'm gonna do and I probably should have put the yeast nutrient in this jug but that's okay we're learning as we go here what's gonna put three of them in there and because I'm worried about that yeast I'm just gonna put the rest in hopefully I didn't screw that up but we'll find out and I will 14 days or so alright the next step let this quark in this bottle and we did that and then I'm gonna take this airlock I'm gonna squeeze that in that quark and we're in there and then let me see if I get this on camera for you this is a one-way airlock and what you do poor little water in there drop this one and what this allows I can put the cap on it allows the gases created by the yeast or the fermentation process to come out through this bottle but it doesn't let other things in like nasty wild yeast it's in the air so there we have it I'm just worried and I hope I made enough it looks like there's plenty at the bottom enough yeast in this thing there's some in his neck we'll see if we can well it's just gonna have to be alright well check in later thanks everybody", "oiulBiynrj8": "[Music] every fall i've got to have an apple pie and today i'm going to show you how to easily make a delicious apple pie hard cider at home i make this every year it tastes like fall in a glass spiced with cinnamon and kissed with vanilla i'm trent mucho and you're watching the brew show let's celebrate fall and make some hard cider making cider is a great way for beginners to get started home brewing it only takes a few ingredients apple juice yeast and the flavor in this case cinnamon and vanilla to give us those notes of fresh baked apple pie if you're headed out to any apple orchards this fall feel free to grab a few extra jugs of apple juice or cider but if not no worries i'm just using store-bought apple juice this recipe calls for 2 gallons of juice and will yield just about 1.75 gallons once complete feel free to scale this recipe up or down to make as much as you'd like as a reminder for store-bought juice make sure it has no preservatives seen on labels as sorbates sulfites or benzoates these preservatives will inhibit the yeast from fermenting before starting we need to take an original gravity reading in most cases store-bought apple juice comes in with an original gravity of 1.050 now i put the juice in the fermenter i'm using a 2 gallon food safe bucket but you can use whatever fermenter you have at home a small glass jug or a large mason jar work perfectly as always make sure your fermenter and anything else that comes into contact with your cider is clean and sanitized this will just make sure no wild yeast or bacteria infect your cider that could ruin the whole batch next i add yeast nutrient 2 teaspoons these nutrients feed the yeast so they are happy and healthy and i can limit off flavors that come from poor yeast health it will also ensure a fast start to fermentation you don't need yeast nutrient but will help make better cider for yeast i'm using saphale us-05 american ale yeast i like this yeast because it has a clean flavor and lets the apple and additional ingredients shine feel free to use whichever yeast you have on hand or feel like using now i give things a good stir to mix in the nutrient and then pop on the top to the fermenter a good mix incorporates oxygen oxygen is important as fermentation starts so that the yeast can use it to do their job but once fermentation is in full swing it's important to avoid oxygen as much as possible or else you can risk oxidizing your sider leading to off flavors then i add the air lock to allow co2 to escape and not let anything in if you don't have an air lock you can just use a piece of foil over the top of your fermenter i set the fermenter in a cool dark area and allow it to ferment for one week until the airlock stops bubbling [Music] at that point i take a final gravity reading and get a reading of 0.998 meaning this battery comes in at 6.8 percent it's time to add the apple pie flavorings i'm going to use two cinnamon sticks you could use ground cinnamon as well but i prefer the sticks i also add a half teaspoon of vanilla preferably pure vanilla but you could also use whatever vanilla extract you have on hand in addition you could also add cloves or ginger feel free to experiment and play around with your favorite fall flavors now let that sit in a cool dark place for another five to seven days take a sample every day or so until the flavor is to your liking once the cider is at my preferred taste it's time to bottle or keg kegging is always easier but i'm going to bottle this batch up and this is how i usually bottle condition my drinks i start by using a priming calculator like this one it has instructions and extra information on the page i put in my specifics like the amount of cider desired pressure and temperature note that the temperature is not the current temperature of the cider but the highest temperature it hit during the last few weeks if you're unsure take a temperature reading now and add 5 degrees that should put you roughly in the right place as fermentation creates some heat once everything is put in it spits out the amount of sugar needed to feed the yeast and build pressure in the bottle to create bubbles corn sugar is the best option in my opinion because it dissolves easily but table sugar works just as well i'm using table sugar today and it takes just a little longer to fully incorporate i put the sugar into another clean and sanitized bucket or pot and then i carefully rack the cider onto the sugar this way the sugar is evenly distributed throughout the cider some people like to divide the sugar into each individual bottle and then transfer into that but to me that's a bit more work and i'm all about making it as easy as i can give things a light stir with a sanitized spoon to mix in the sugar but don't mix too much or you risk oxidation now i just transfer that mixture into each bottle again making sure the bottles are clean and sanitized and make sure your bottles are fermentation grade not the thin decorative bottles you see at dollar stores this bottling wand is a nice tool to have as it uses a spring that when pressed down it lets out the liquid but as soon as you release it stops but you can always just crimp the line in between bottles to limit spilling be ready with plenty of towels on hand fill the bottles all the way up and when you take out the wand or tube it will leave the perfect amount of head space just enough to build the right amount of pressure [Music] once the bottles are filled cap them up and set them somewhere dark and cool for about two weeks at which point the cider is ready to drink [Music] this apple cider is crisp like a fall day it has a perfect level of tartness and dryness that i love but if you like it sweeter you could try back sweetening your cider before packaging and the hints of cinnamon and vanilla come through strong on the nose but just lightly on the palate giving you that subtle apple pie flavor without hitting you over the head with spice you could definitely dial this up but just go slow and add a little at a time you don't want to overdo it what's your favorite fall flavor do you like apple pie are you more of a pumpkin spice person this is a great change out from heavy beers that are often associated with fall and if you're already sick of pumpkin spice then i recommend you giving this one a try and let me know if you do if you have any questions about making cider be sure to let me know and don't forget to subscribe for more videos like this", "mj3qhNNXRmw": "all right folks this is the apple pie cider that I made and I said I was going to go ahead and I was going to do a taste of this one screen when I put this in the bottle actually fill it up a lot further but the bottle is expanded I know if you can see there's some ridges here but these have pushed out and then the bottom has actually beveled out and you can see there's some sediment in there that leaves me a bleeder some carbonation going on the glass we're going to go ahead and get started that didn't fit a whole lot well if you can see there is a little bit of carbonation in there not a whole heck of a lot but let's go and give it a taste it smells really athlete and it has a pretty strong apple flavor that's kind of bitter maybe somebody be into that I don't know I'm not really sure I am I don't know if I make this exact same recipe again I think the cinnamon taste is really strong it's a lot cleaner than when I had it the first time so I don't think it's um it's not terrible or bad it does taste pretty cidery well maybe dr. week the recipe a little bit or something like that I don't know it's a little sour too it's not terrible it's definitely drinkable so i'm going to write the other bottles and now that's it just wanted a quick update", "ozZl3BrEtSo": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel today I'm going to show you how to make apple cider pie this apple pie has apple cider added to its giving this apple pie a really delicious apple flavor so let's get started first pre-heat the oven to 450 degrees and place a half sheet pan into the oven while it's preheating this helps the pie to knots come out underbaked on the bottom and for the apples you can use any kind you like I'm choosing Honey Crisp but the choice is up to you so you want to wash the apples and then peel them and every time you peel an apple place it into a bowl filled with ice water and sliced lemons so they don't turn brown and then corns chop the apples into small pieces and place them into a large pot then add in the apple cider and place it onto the stove over high heat until it's boils stirring it occasionally and once it's boiling place the lid on top and cook the mixture for another five minutes over high heat stirring it occasionally [Music] and after five minutes remove it from the heat and poured through a strainer over another bull set-asides the apples for now and pour the liquid into a small saucepan and return it to the stove over medium-high heat and heat it until it's boils and once it's boiling keep it boiling until it has reduced to a third of a cup it can bubble up so if you need to take it off the heat so you can see how much it has reduced so pour it into a liquid measuring cup and it should be a third of a cup if not to put it back over the heats for a little longer so once it has reduced to a third of a cup pour it into the chopped apples and mix them together until they're combined then out in the cornstarch sugar brown sugar cinnamon nutmeg and salt and mix them all together until they're well combined [Music] then pour the mixture into a chilled 2 pie crust I showed you how to make this pie crust in the previous video and I'll link to it in the description box then cut up the butter into small pieces and place them all over the top of the pie then roll out another pie crust and roll up the crust around the rolling pin and then roll it over the top of the pie then trim off the excess and pinch the two crusts together to make sure they're well sealed and if you like you can flutes the edges of the pie [Music] and cut a few slits in the top of the pie so that steam can escape while it's baking and brush the top of some milk or you can use an egg wash and sprinkle the top with some sugar and place it into the oven on top of the preheated baking sheets and bake it for 10 minutes to start with and after 10 minutes turn the oven temperature down to 350 and bake the pie for another 40 to 50 minutes or until the top is golden and once it's done remove its from the oven and let it cool for about 15 minutes and you can serve it while it's still warm if you like and that's how to make apple cider pie check out more of my videos here and subscribe to my channel here so you don't miss out on any of my videos I hope you enjoyed this recipe and this video thanks for watching and I'll see you next time", "Xo1sB2s5rmg": "hey youtubers Steven here Cheers 17 okay so you might have seen some previous videos where I'm wearing the same clothes well everything was filmed today so we're going on to our third hard cider experiment this one's kind of special because I mentioned on Facebook that I was doing four experiments but I was actually gonna end up with five until they came up with two more recipes so now we're looking at seven experiments in total anyways back to this I wanted to do you know an apple pie hard cider using some cinnamon sticks and brown sugar now this is where experiment number two comes in this is going to be a two gallon experiment or eight liters of apple juice two cups of sugar it's a one cup for every four litres or one gallon and we're gonna put in four cinnamon sticks for each gallon or four liters so eight sticks two cups of brown sugar alright so I already have the apple juice in here and the idea is four liters I'm just going to siphon off and bottle as per normal the other four liters I'm going to put it into two-liter pop bottles and I'm going to freeze distill it or make Apple Jacks if you will I've had some subscribers you know mentioned to me on my comments if if I've ever done it so this is my first one alright so let's get our brown sugar in here and I do have a yeast starter going just like I did with the the first two experiments I figured you know what now that I have these you know food grade plastic buckets from my wife's work that I'm gonna make it exactly the same the same amounts of water a little bit of dextrose but the yeast in it you know water is probably a little lukewarm and they started that oh well 40 minutes ago so let's uh let's get this stuff stirring okay that was pretty quick and easy alright so eight cinnamon sticks we're gonna throw in here there are only short ones they're not the great big gigantic ones so there are only short but maybe four inches two three four five six seven feet hahaha yeah okay Sesame Street humor it's not appreciate just all right so we got that in there this one's going really really smooth let's get a hydrometer reading okay so this one's just a little under my mark it's 1.06 eight but you know what two points I can live with that so uh put this all back in here all that sweet goodness we're gonna make this one really quick and easy we're gonna take our yeast starter there we go airlock this off here and that's perfect fit nice and snug and it's just that easy we're back everybody okay so the apple pie moonshine has been bottled at bulk front now what I did since was was a two gallon batch and I knew one gallon would give me ten bottles or four leaders would give me ten bottles so I bought priming with 60 grams of dextrose because it's eight liters I filled my ten bottles and then I grabbed three two-liter bottles pop bottles they're all cleaned up sanitized I don't know if you can see the liquid in it but I'm basically going to put them in the deep freezer like this sitting on their sides I don't know if we've better straight up and down or on its side but either work maybe I'll put one bottle up and two bottles on their side I don't know I'm sure people will comment you know which is better on the side or straight up and down but we're going to freeze this and then I'll probably leave it until the next four days that I'm off and then we'll find we'll see what this comes out I did buy an out commoner volka meter I'm not sure how you pronounce it but for testing for seeing what the alcohol is in spirits so we'll see if that actually works with this freeze distillation so stay tuned folks and we'll be back alright we're back it's frozen I literally just took this out of the freezer but this is kind of cool this has been in here for two weeks they've had it in the freezer I don't know if you can see the liquid but that's all that didn't freeze so we're on to the next step I did three bottles but I don't have two containers so we'll do these two first also going to do is I'm just going to open open up the caps did you hear the hits sounds good to me so we're just gonna basically take these flip them upside down and as you can see it's just off the bottom we're gonna keep an eye on it and soon as the ice inside is just white there's no color into it then we're gonna flip our bottles out and that should be all of our apple pie moonshine so the Pepsi bottle has got some some in there to here I'll just check it up quite as much as the other bottle but we're well on our way so I don't know how long this is gonna take so I'm not even gonna guess but I do have my Alka meter Oh comet err I don't have to say I think I said in another video nice I still don't have to say it so we'll be back in a bit alright we're two hours in that's a little bit in there still get a little bit of orange in the bottle look over in this one and a little chunk of ice just fell down which has some color in it but we look up at the top move this so I could change the light a little bit yeah I have chopsticks stuck in there holding the bottles out of the out of the liquid alright so pretty white at the top just a little bit of color dude on the bottom and like I said we're two hours in so maybe another half an hour to an hour and I'll get another bottle in here and we'll see how strong it is hey everybody okay sorry to interrupt this video one thing that I've learned about the doing these hard cider experiments I need to have a clock board so I can keep it straight actually the last two that I just made I had a notepad what was holding it up but I seem to be missing some footage I don't know if I thought I hit record didn't record in a hurry to get all these done either way I apologize so this little break here I did thaw the third bottle combined the three of them I still don't know if I'm saying it right alka meter or Alco meter so one for alka meter if that's how I'm supposed to be saying it or two if it's a comet err either or it didn't register anything so just looking at it I heard cider was only 8% even if I doubled it by freeze distillation that would only bring it up to 16% so I'm sure it's meant for men actually measuring real spirits then you know freeze distillation I'm not sure but I'm having fun that's what matters right anyways I ended up taking what I had collected putting in into one two-liter pop bottle which I left it for another I think two or three weeks maybe four weeks I didn't write it down on my calendar anyways so let's pick up where we left off hey youtubers Stephen here how was everybody's day going well all right now we're just about in the middle what they're dubbing white one junior it's a blizzard snowstorm it's the end of March March 26 to think today's they just I don't know I'm on vacation so any hope I know the way notes were pretty bad we're gonna continue on with our apple pie moonshine for the freeze distillation this is going to be the review for the apple pie moonshine cider that I made they're starting to look carbonated a little bit I think they may have just needed a little more time like I've said in previous videos so let's give it a sniff you can smell the cinnamon and the cinnamon you can almost picture the brown sugar knowing that there's brown sugar in it but with the apples uh that's kind of make you think of apple pie when you smell it so give it a swing Cheers 17 eat oh wow this is actually my last bottle I've been drinking stuff up like it like there's no tomorrow um these recipes are so good it does taste just like apple pie not quite like what Jake was saying on its cast you know you need to taste the crust and ask me how i gets crust in it but wow you know this is actually really good I'm gonna have to make all of these recipes a little more I'm sure you could probably hear my snow blower go back my son's out there clearing the driveway mum's on her way home from work so good but freeze distillation let me grab the body bottle all right della Pitt Street slushy if we turn it upside down hopefully I'm getting this on camera I can't see there's something like some alcohol there as long as I'm doing this I have a sanitized bowl with a coriander in there stringer try and use fancy terms sometimes you get them wrong but all right so I'm just going to take this I'm just going to set it in there sanitized strainer hopefully it'll balance and well-thought it will come back all right here we go it's pretty much all just ice in there now so you know what we're done crap that's terrible try to get as much over this as I can this is very precious liquid not much left in the bowl all right now give this a little stir everything here is sterilized spilling a bit all right well that's kind of disappointing hey everybody okay so my battery died yesterday when we're doing the apple pie moonshine so it's a little bit a half I have a full court and this is what I have left out of when we start out with to two liters or was it three three two liters yeah anyways I did check with the El Camino and it's not registering so it's not that strong however I'd say it's probably in around 25% give or take a little bit cuz I mean it was 8% thinking out loud you know 8% if you double it that's 16% and then we froze it again could it possibly double again to 30% possible possible but I'm not sure I'm definitely going to do this experiment again but I think I'm gonna use turbo yeast and really bump the alcohol up in it before I freeze it what are you guys thoughts who who do the fries distillation do you think 18% 16% would be too much to try in fries but either/or let's give this a little sniff you can definitely smell the alcohol in it there's no question there and you do get a bit of an apple so let's give it a sweet game Cheers 17 mm the apple the Apple is great up front Wow but there's an alcohol warmth there's a warmth to it but it it's not overpowering it's not a burn but after the initial Apple after the initial Apple you get a little bit of the brown sugar and then and then the cinnamon wow this is exactly like what we were drinking in Montreal the apple pie moonshine that Marco had so yeah cheers to that looking forward to the main meet hoping to buy some down there someone may be bringing some apple pie moonshine Hunter comb the snowblower probably going to make a few dollars blowing somebody out but yeah anyways cheers everybody seventeen hoping to do a few more of these experiments and see how they turn out with as higher alcohol but anywho Cheers mmm delicious", "Knkk8mWLvrA": "this is a great hot cider spice like apple pie it calls for the same spices that you would use in a pie like cloves ginger nutmeg cinnamon allspice and it's so easy to make makes your whole house smell really good I understand that sometimes when people are trying to sell their house they put apple cider to heat on the stove and it makes the house smell so good that buyers just want to buy the house because it smells so good so remember that I think is a great idea I'm still recovering from my laryngitis as you can hear but you know I was in the kitchen thinking gosh I have the best job in America but I also have a really dangerous job because I can just make anything I want to make on this show that's interesting and I can learn from experts but when I go into that kitchen I can also eat like a all I do is taste taste taste and then I have to get tighter and tighter and tighter underwear it's not great but three tablespoons of light brown sugar not really I can't find underwear tight enough actually and then we have a pinch of cloves don't use too many clothes because they sort of cloud up the cider a little bit but that little bit of clove is so important a pinch of salt very important in something sweet and then a teaspoon of allspice oh I love a half a teaspoon of ginger powder ginger you can actually even put a slice of fresh ginger into this cider if you like and try to get organic cider if you can find it oh just a few scrapings a few gratings of nutmeg I love to great nutmeg fresh because it just is so superior to what's already ground and a whole cinnamon stick which you'll take out of course when you try to serve this warm this up it already smells like apple pie cooking in my house I love this and and then when you're done this is all done you can take out the cinnamon stick it's very hot and OH for those of you who are serving adults add a half a cup of Calvados which is an apple brandy from France really tasty and makes it pungent and beautiful a fresh cinnamon stick and a nice ladle or two of this hot spiced cider and you're ready to have a very nice party you", "WXDQr3SuJxs": "cider apple jack cider again it's time for some apple brandy [Music] so what is apple brandy really simple you make apple wine or apple cider and then run it through a pot still that's it so let's do that this is the juice that we're using your grocery store probably has a store brand check it out to make sure uh on the label that it doesn't have anything like sodium metabisulfate or potassium sorbate it can have ascorbic acid but that's all anything else is probably gonna really mess with your fermentation or stop it all together this has enough sugar in it to get it up to about six percent alcohol we want to make it a little stronger than that because when you're distilling you want a little more alcohol so you have a better volume we're gonna add some sugar to our juice the way we did in the breakfast cereal vodka video we're gonna use invert sugar if you haven't seen the vodka video i'll put a link for that one right up there invert sugar is sugar and a little bit of acid boiled in water so it's easier for the yeast to process it and eat it if you've never made invert sugar here's a quick little demonstration since our apple juice has enough sugar to get us about six percent alcohol i only want to raise the gravity of this wash up to around eight percent all you need to do is weigh out two pounds of table sugar add that to one quart of water one fourth teaspoon of citric acid available near the canning supplies in your local grocery store or you can use a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice stir to dissolve the sugar completely and then simmer for at least 20 minutes that's it now that we have that sorted let's jump right into making the hard cider we need to take a hydrometer reading of the juice to find the starting gravity so we know how much sugar to add add the yeast nutrient and invert sugar to your sanitized bucket then top it up with your juice take a new hydrometer reading to make sure you're on target then add the yeast of your choice and lock it up so in four or five days when this is done then we will distill it and find out what we get a few moments later all right so now the apple brandy is done fermentation finished out bone dry so then we got everything ready [Music] then there was a stripping run then a spirit run then i did a blending and the blending i actually did it right this time diluted everything tasted it to find where all the flavors were and then put it all together and proofed it down to about 42 so what did we get after all of that basically i ended up getting exactly what george and jesse predicted back in october when i met with them and we were sampling a cherry apple cider that i made i'd ask george if there was a way to bring the really cool fruit flavors in that cider into a distillate and basically the answer was not really what you'll have is you wind up with a really good spirit that doesn't necessarily taste like cherries right but it has it has that cherry character with some cherries right and you know i had i had that suspicion going in but i i have to test everything myself to see if i can you know beat the odds or whatever we got something that is it's a nice clean spirit that is reminiscent of apples i hate that george and jesse were right but also i love that that they work because it confirms to me how good it is to have um all these different experienced voices in our community so that we can all learn from each other i posted a poll on my patreon page to see what everybody suggested as far as the wood that we're gonna age this stuff with because it is a nice clean spirit and it does have some fruit character to it so we want to age it up nice and get something really cool we're going to do some toasted french oak and cherry some charred white oak and birch some maple and some mulberry we got two that have fruit trees in there and we're gonna see if we can get some of that fruit tree character to kind of bump this up a little bit but we have one more jar a couple of you guys and a couple of my patrons actually suggested doing an apple pie moonshine with the apple brandy and honestly i can't think of a better thing to do with this so we're going to do a quick little recipe on this one and get these guys aged up complicated right so now we'll just let these guys sit for i don't know what do you think thanksgiving ish that sounds good there's a whole bunch of different apple pie moonshine recipes so we're not reinventing the wheel here but i think because we're using an apple based moonshine it's going to be even better and i'm pretty excited about that all we need is some apple juice concentrate a jar of apple brandy one sliced apple some spices and fresh ginger slice your apple and put that in a large jar then add the brandy take one thick slice of ginger and bruise it with the back of your knife like this add 1 8 teaspoon of nutmeg to your pot just a tiny sprinkle of cloves because they're really strong add 2 cinnamon sticks your apple juice concentrate and ginger slice then heat it just barely to a simmer and turn off the heat let it cool for 20 minutes then strain into your jar and you're done all right so now we're done we got these all dosed up with their wood and we've got our apple pie i'm calling this double apple pie because it's apple brandy instead of regular old like corn whiskey or or a neutral wash i can't taste these yet they're not going to be ready for a couple of months so we're going to let these go until november but i can taste this one now and i have to say i'm a little bit excited about it holy crap that's good oh [ __ ] that is good oh man i i don't know if this is gonna make it until thanksgiving oh my god that is so good keep in mind i didn't add any sugar to this it was all just the apple juice concentrate now if you are in a place that does not sell apple juice concentrate in the little frozen cans it's easy to make you take 48 ounces of juice you just simmer that down until it's about 12 ounces of juice so all you're doing is reducing the water volume by about 75 and making a juice syrup or a concentrate and that will work perfectly well for something like this i did the same thing with making the cherry cider so if you need a visual reference on that i'll go ahead and put a link right up there if you want to use a higher proof go right ahead because you will be diluting it with that apple juice concentrate some recipes recommend as high as 70 percent i don't know that i would go that high maybe 50 or 55 and i think you would still end up with something that's really tasty and has a substantial kick to it one other thing about this stuff a lot of people recommend that you keep it in their fridge technically i think the alcohol content is way high enough for it to not spoil but as far as keeping the flavor consistent the refrigerator is always a good way to go i want to thank my patrons uncle duck thank you for suggesting doing apple pie and all you guys thanks for voting on the types of wood that we tried because i took a little sniffy of each of these and they all smell really promising like they're gonna be worth the wait thank you guys for voting on that if you would like to also contribute to decisions like this uh recipe ideas things like that you can consider joining my patreon i'll put a link down below i just want to say a huge huge thank you to you guys i am now in a much better position to keep doing these weekly videos because of you guys so thank you so very much this is it's kind of blowing me away all right so moving on i think that's all we can say about this stuff i am really excited man i'm gonna have to hide this from myself or get my wife to hide it from me holy crap i want to save the rest of this so that i can see if the flavor changes over time uh along with the the wood aging wow i might have to have one more sip of that so okay you gotta be my guinea pig give this a taste that's the face she does not like spirits at all double apple pie moonshine for the win give it back i guess we could just drink it all if you want to that's cool to me because i'm in love with it it was my favorite but now that's my favorite really yeah

everybody doing today it's great to see everyone hope everybody is having a great holiday season today we're in my kitchen we are in my kitchen because we are going to be talking about how to make this delicious stuff apple pie moonshine I actually have an older version of this video which by the way if you're in for a laugh go watch that it's hilarious it's back when I first started filming stuff it's films this horrible fisheye lens it's it's just bad so but I wanted to remake this because I wanted to put a little better quality video out there I wanted to make a shorter a little more concise video because that was a bit longer and being that it's Christmas coming up this really if you you know put a little decoration on there the wife made some stickers and stuff and if you put a little of that stuff on it it makes great Christmas gifts you can make like twelve bottles of the stuff or twelve jars of this stuff for fairly inexpensive in it and people love it before we get going on the video though couple quick points to touch on hey this stuff is strong it's made with either 153 to 190 proof alcohol depending on what state you live in and what your what your alcohol level legalities are in your area but it's smooth so you can kind of get yourself in a little bit of trouble because it tastes really good you drink a bunch of it so everybody just be responsible with this stuff I don't want to hear of anybody getting sick or getting into a bad situation so you know just enjoy it it's really good stuff but just be responsible be in my previous video I had a lot of these moonshine purist I guess these are guys that actually you know have a still in their backyard I know this isn't that okay it's if you look up moonshine recipe online you'll get a hundred different versions of this recipe this is what people call apple pie moonshine so if you're one of these purists that is gonna freak out and say this is it I think last time I got comments like that's just a girl's drink which by the way is sexist sexist guys guys come on I know this is not made in a still in a backyard but guys guess what moonshine is not illegal anymore you can buy at ABC liquor you can buy to drill oka liquor store it's it's not the same thing as it used to be moonshine is made with a corn mash grain kind of alcohol the base of this is a grain alcohol that's why people call this apple pie moonshine so just try the recipe enjoy it and relax just calm down it'll be okay give it a try you'll like it it's good stuff alright guys so now we've got all that out of the way let's get back to what this video is about which is how to make this apple pie moonshine recipe we're gonna try to get through this recipe in 3 minutes or less I don't have a good track record with that so we'll try but let's get to it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "kTw4B8lPHpA": "double crest pie i want a slice i'll work on it i'll get back to you hi i'm erin jean mcdowell recipe developer cookbook author and new york times recipe contributor as you may or may not know about me one of my favorite things in the entire world is pie and this time of year is sort of my ultimate pie time i get to talk about pie and eat lots of pie and make lots of pie so what we're going to do here is sort of a choose your own adventure situation with a master apple pie filling that can be used 10 different ways some of them are pie some of them are not but no matter what you choose everyone's going to be happy [Music] so let's talk about this pie filling it is going to have one major difference from many recipes that you see which is that it involves being cooked on the stovetop pre-cooking pie fillings allows you to thicken some of the juices and concentrate some of the flavors before you even get the pie into the oven and that means you're going to have a better chance of that having a really beautiful nice slice with no runny pie business going on any really good baking apple is going to work here so you know a jonathal the gala honeycrisp they're one of my favorites for baking with because they are a nice blend of tart and sweet they get soft but they don't break down into mush which i like for an apple pie filling i like to do diced apples for this filling and for one reason it makes it a lot more versatile it makes us able to use it in 10 ways very easily it also allows us to kind of control the juiciness aspect a little bit but the size of the dice is sort of up to you i've just been doing a pretty standard rustic dice here i like to be able to have some pieces that are a little softer and more broken down and some pieces that are a little bit firmer and still have some bite once you have all your ingredients ready it's really as simple as putting it all in the pot i'm gonna add some of the ingredients to the pot and save a couple for later brimley really smells the pie i think he wants in on this the all-purpose flour is going to provide a little bit of thickening here so i actually like to add the sugar right into the flour so that when we add it to something hot like this pot it won't clump up it smells so good so since you have to cool your apple pie filling completely before you can use it one of my favorite ways to do this is to just spread it onto something with more surface area like a casserole dish or a baking sheet more surface area will help it cool a lot faster one of the things that's so great about this filling is how versatile it is by cutting the apples into smaller pieces it makes it more friendly for different sizes and portions of desserts including one of my all-time favorite pie recipes which is my fried apple pies i've got my cooled apple pie filling ready to go and i have my mealy pie dough when it comes to something that you're frying it's actually very helpful to have the fat dispersed more evenly throughout so you don't end up with any kind of errors or problems come fry time the shape of the dough is not that important it's more the thickness of the dough that is important and we're gonna fill them basically you just want them to be plenty full but not so full that they're going to ooze out as you start to assemble them now i'm going to just dip my finger into a little bit of water and run it around one half of the little pie we're just trying to give the dough on the other side something to stick to and it's important to have a good seal on fried pies because otherwise they're likely to burst open if you don't have a thermometer you can actually just do the way that i learned to test fryer oil which is to use a little scrap piece of dough at first it should sink to the bottom of the pot then shortly after it should rise to the surface and start slowly browning okay i'm gonna drop a few of my chilled pies in at a time and we're gonna fry them until they're evenly golden brown and we wanna make sure that we give them enough time because we don't want any raw dough so this is gonna take several minutes you can usually fry three or four at a time in a large pot like this you just don't want them to be so close that they're touching too much of the fry time and coat them generously these are the stuff of fast food and carnival dreams times a thousand they are so delicious everyone loves them and you can eat them fresh when they're warm and just freshly made and that is the best thing in the world these are perfect i can't talk to you anymore bye cobbler is such an amazing fruit dessert there are lots of different styles of toppings but i really like a biscuity topping for a cobbler and this is sort of a cinnamon biscuit and you just dollop it all over the filling that's what i like about cobbler it's really customizable really homey really comforting so this is a great dessert kind of for any level of effort even like weeknight level of effort so for these mini pies instead of using a regular pie dough i'm using kind of something with a shorter more crumbly cookie-like texture rather than something light and flaky and airy and the main advantage of that is you can just press it into whatever your vessel is you could easily put a couple of these in a box and leave them on a neighbor's porch or something as a little treat so that way you can make a whole pan but you don't necessarily have to eat the whole pan all those flavors of apple pie but you know in a bar i'm like not getting tired of watching this filling go into pans yet so i'm just like look how caramelly it is and bars like this are another great way to keep it easy you know this is something that kids could really help with both in the preparation of the recipe and with the assembly i always recommend galettes for people who really like to eat pie but don't necessarily like to make it a galette is a more rustic sort of pie from the perspective of it's not made in a pie pan it doesn't require any kind of extra bake time or anything but that's one of the things that's nice about a galette is you can kind of choose if you want more filling or or a little less all right now i'm going to fold the edges over kind of letting them naturally pleat all the way around just let the crust fall where it may another really fun and easy thing that you can do with this apple filling is just leave out flour and turn it into apple butter instead and you're going to puree it it's going to get even thicker when you return it to the pot for kind of one last stage of cooking and it's going to have this really incredible deep caramel flavor from all of those other things that were going on in our apple filling i'm calling this little iteration an upside down pie because it isn't exactly a tart to tan the most traditional upside down pie that butter is going to react with the other ingredients in our filling and kind of make this amazing caramelized topping so i just like to use the rolling pin to sort of guide the dough into the pan like this this is going to become the bottom of this pie so we don't really care what this looks like then we'll bake this until the pastry gets really golden brown we've got a steamy hot upside down apple pie so if you definitely have some non-apple pie lovers in your family you might want to opt for a layer cake instead and in the middle i'm just going to spoon a nice big scoop [Music] heart eye emoji i can't wait to eat it one of my other favorite things to do with this filling is to sort of take an ala mode slice of pie but turn it on its head i'm going to start by spooning a little bit of the filling into the base of my sundae dish as many as you want no judgment here we're gonna spoon some more filling all over the surface then we're gonna use some of our pie crust streusel that we made our little bits of pie dough and we are just going to put those all over the sundae all the flavors of apple pie without actually having to make any pie double crusted beauty i first go all the way around the edges pinching the top crust and the bottom crust together we take that excess crust at the edges and we tuck it under itself like this and it's not only going to stay put but it's also going to give us a little bit more dough at the edge for crimping only egg wash the center of the pie because the edges brown enough on their own already so now we'll give this a chill until it's time to bake the oven and the piece the resistance the double crust apple pie made with our master apple pie filling thank you so much for joining me today as we made all these amazing apple desserts it was sort of a choose your own adventure apple pie situation you can make a classic apple pie you can make fried apple pies you can make little ones or free form ones or you can skip the pie all together and go for cakes and sundaes it's really up to you there are so many pies abilities here and i'm so excited for you to make some of these in your kitchen

Fremont so we're not going to tell you guys where we're at but we will tell you what the pubs were about to do Mitch let people know yeah all right so the happy Apple so what is this decider technically igniter everything about Apple drink is what they classify that because I don't know what cider that catarrhal anyway we'd reliable we tried to joke up and add it on top and it was not in fused it tasted great so we're going to try to get 10 milligram reviews to 10 milligram infusion this is readily available at Diego page there I believe it is selling somewhere between 7 and 10 dollars retail out the door so let's check it out pop top Krusty Mariners coming back though right everyone ate on a dog or something like that oh you gotta get that that's the hard part about doing this kind of it all is really not plastic addy you cannot be more prepared with the childproof cloth oh oh all right so this is carbonated everyone definitely carpenter naturally carbonated got it all over myself tastes delicious but that is a problem when you do but when you buy a single 12 ounce bottle of something it's going to sit around and roll around everywhere I mean in the car in your bag how are you bringing you're not just excited you can sit on this on the cardboard we're good I'm not even trippin on it it's still bubbling it's still delicious go ahead hold on horn adulterers or the water reserve you guys can see the coloration we've got some cereal print so definitely carpet in the afternoon carbonation is definitely more says that you get whether to applicant not apple cider exporters even aside well the gay universe their first it [Applause] we're really good Beverly Apple no cannabis until the occupants oh yeah it's a slight handle good I don't even know it maybe because it's just the carbonation this kind of burns away Africa but it still I would say lightly carbonated and burn my nose not like sprite or something where you know the phase or the carbonation for the difference how about that for how much big is doing you don't take this is definitely a great taste like good doesn't taste too sugary either I personally don't drink soda so I don't like sugary beverages but this is something I think it's only 10 milligrams so for the irregular adult serving something like this isn't going to be too overpowering unless of course you're not used to having kind of astigmatism at all in which case micro dosing comes into play drinking half of it at a time or going just a glass like this it's going to be really really your best option myself and Mitch were along the lines of you know consuming a full ten milligrams even more so for us this is just going to get a friendly buzz we're going to be sitting here in Fremont planning an event here at nectar room so this cure a runner in good choice here not happy Apple uh that's definitely close on that it's a good thing you know when I first first tried because when the drinks came on the market

how to make apple pie moonshine from scratch to make this recipe you'll need a few things first you're gonna need some apple juice concentrate you'll need some spices and you will need alcohol and some apples so this recipe calls for apple juice concentrate as opposed to standard apple juice in a jug this is less diluted than regular apple juices adding this to the alcohol and spices will create a higher proofed final product you can you actually use any kind of white unaged whiskey it all depends on your own personal preference so just use whatever you like the best we're making apple pie moonshine so we're actually gonna use moonshine you can use whatever kind of moonshine you like you will need about six cups of alcohol in total I went down to the store and bought some of this stuff here these folks actually make apple pie moonshine and you might ask well if apple pie moonshine is available at a store why don't I just go down and buy some of that instead of making my own not to knock this or any product like it but what we're making here is fresh it's from scratch it's homemade it's simply it's better the last ingredient we have here our spices what a lot of folks will end up doing is just adding a couple cinnamon sticks to some apple juice concentrate and alcohol you could do that you'd add three or four sticks per quart and leave it sit that will make something that's vaguely passable as apple pie moonshine but that's not going to be amazing what we use our apple pie moonshine spice kits from clawhammer Supply we make these we love them we've done tons of testing we've made tons of apple pie moonshine in our opinion it doesn't get any better than this this is made with cinnamon ginger cloves allspice vanilla even some pepper so the first thing we're going to add here is the moonshine I'm going to add six cups I'm going to add this just to a standard stockpot all right I've added the alcohol the next thing I'm gonna do is add the apple juice concentrate I'm adding four cans here this is just standard frozen apple juice concentrate that I got from the grocery store I left it fall out overnight I'm gonna pause for a second and note that if you want to make a version of this that is slightly stronger and less sweet you could add seven and a half cups of moonshine and only three cans of apple juice concentrate so the last thing I'm gonna add here are the spices I'm gonna leave the set 24 hours I'll leave it set overnight with a lid on it I'll come back tomorrow and we'll wrap this up okay I'm back it's been 24 hours I'm ready to wrap this up so what we're gonna need next are three quart jars a strainer and a funnel the best kind of funnel to use is a funnel that's specific to canning I can't find mine so I'm just gonna use this so all I'm gonna do is just pour this through the funnel until the jar is full one thing I forgot to mention we put three full cinnamon sticks in every spice kit so you can add that to the jar and I wanted to add an apple slice as well so leave a little bit of room I didn't do that I'm actually gonna pour some out here okay now I have a bit more room in here I'm gonna grab my cinnamon sticks out of the pot I'll toss them in there and then the last thing I'll do is cut up a few slices of Apple and there you have it homemade apple pie moonshine you can find these spices kits on our website and call hammer supply calm thanks for watching see ya", "WI3eIjQ4AMQ": "so let's run some moonshine boys hey the other day what we did when we did that double your output mash that's what i have in this fermenter and it's about ready to go my fermentation stalled just a little bit we're going to take a gravity reading make sure we're about where we were yesterday uh then we're going to transfer over to the annual anvil foundry we're going to put the t500 on this anvil foundry and we're going to run it and then we're going to do a taste test on this particular corn mash what we did was we gelatinized it we did it for a protein rest we got as much sugar as we could out of that corn and then we put in some barley to help it along now we're getting closer to a whiskey white dog recipe and i think on the next video we're going to use a little wheat we're going to try to do something close to a uh maybe a maker's mark white dog we'll compare the two we'll see what's going on and help let's get started i didn't take y'all through this whole process that just got it set up a little bit so right now what i'm going to do is i've got the anvil founder down here and i've got this hose connected to it i didn't put a little clamp on there because it's just gravity it's not like i got a pump putting pressure through it so i got this hose in the bottom of this kettle but what i'm going to do first is i'm going to make sure i don't get a whole bunch of crap coming out the bottom of this now you see my valve is pointed straight up i've got that tube inside of it's also pointed up so let's go ahead and open it up i do need to take a gravity rig let's make sure we get all this trash out of it i don't want to get a whole bunch of stuff in there to scorch now this anvil founder is really good about not scorching all right that's about it right there that kind of stuff will score so i just leave that out let's go ahead and fill this up see how it's a little clearer it's not as milky that's what i was looking for before we go any farther i'm gonna go ahead and take this gravity reading we're gonna see where we're at we're gonna calculate how much alcohol potential alcohol we should be getting from this run we're right where we were the other day we're at 10 12. i could not get it go below 10 12. i think it was because in that mass recipe we went up to 155 that alpha amylase really uh um uh didn't have a good effect on breaking those complex sugars and the simple sugars i'm gonna have to think about that next time we run another mash we're gonna go ahead and set up this turbo 500 for this anvil foundry it's just a really simple steel it's it's really easy to work with um i'm loving it anyway let's get that done all you really need is a phillips head screwdriver take this handle off really simple stuff so inside the steel is a bunch of packing material stainless steel i got copper up top we're going to turn it over so all that don't fall out when we take this nut off you gotta put some man hands on it i hope you can see those copper i mean those stainless steel put this top on it like this this nut threw it back on get it on there pretty good you got steel son look at that i'm gonna plant this down water coming in spirits coming out exhaust water going out let's get that hooked up [Music] [Music] turn it on with this little switch down here we're going to turn it up the bowl all you got to do is push that minus button one time it goes to 212 which is bull we're gonna go to power we're gonna go down one time it's a hundred percent we're gonna push power again cut right on [Music] it's been a good i'm at 150 and i've got drips you can see it right there here it comes so today running between 145 and 147 is giving me the perfect little stream of spirit coming out of this anvil with the t500 i'm in the hearts now because it is freaking smooth as silk when you taste this there is no bite i mean it's alcohol trust me but there is no bitterness there's no off flavors anything so i'm gonna go ahead and proof this and see where we're at i would estimate that we're probably running around i don't know [Music] 188 so now that we've got enough let's measure this elixir of life 188 proof [Music] you know based on our calculations we were only supposed to have approximately 0.33 of a gallon 5.28 cups i've already got two four six cups and filling up this one and that still tastes as clean as the first one that came out we've almost filled this jar up i thought this was going to be our last jar the drip has really slowed down after weeks of running this particular recipe through the mash process to the fermentation process now through the distillation process we've got a high output mesh that we've tried to create or that we created we created that through the video i'll put a link to it up there the video about how to get the high output from a moonshine mash so now we're through with that process as you heard earlier we've got more than what we expected so let's go ahead taste cut this down we'll cut this down to a certain percentage i'm thinking around 90 proof let's see how many milliliters we have in this cup right here 375 milliliters let's see what proof this is that is 188 proof like we said earlier that was the first one we tested 188 target proof i want 90. and we're going to switch the gallons to leaders and then we're going to put 375 calc we need 431 milliliters of distilled water so gonna go ahead and take this out of here put this in here and then i'm gonna pour this in here and it needed 431 or 430 425 something like that let's just put 425 milliliters of distilled water in here there we go that should give us about what we need if there's any tails in here at all it'll turn it cloudy um as you can see that's crystal clear it had some bubbles in it but now it's crystal clear that is crystal clear got some bubbles in it but they're coming out real quick all right it's going in the jug i wonder if we can fit it we're gonna see come on one gallon come on one gallon almost well that is close to a gallon we were supposed to get .77 gallons out of this batch i think we got .9 out of it i'm okay with that let's see what proof we came out with after it was all mixed up [Music] heck it might need a little more water you remember i'm trying to get to 90 proof that's where i want to be right there 98 proof that's 98 proof right there if i filled the rest of this jug up with water i bet i'll be at 90 proof or 90 let's just see give it a little little turn that's what we were looking for and that is 94. 92 proof that's 92 92 proof one gallon of 92 proof moonshine you know we gotta try it after it's all mixed up it's proof down right let's wash our glass out this is crack corn from the feed store a little barley for the amylase enzyme let's see what it tastes like wow you ought to come try this real quick on camera my wife said no", "9acAYJPo4nI": "hello my fellow youtubers part 2 on my water distilling and right now we are sanitizing the system we are using this be Bor systems got a thumper and right now we are sitting we are sitting hold on one second and you get your plug back in its what happened the first time I ran out of power we are sitting about a hundred and forty degrees I guess we're about 15 minutes into this hour time I filled it right here we got cold water for the condenser we got a thumper the thumper is starting to get a little warm you can feel a little a little bit the steam comes out of the mean fermenting tank five gallon tank comes up drops into the thumper the thumper is like a second distilling basically so the steam will leave all its contaminants it'll leave contaminants into the first tank but it'll come up and come into the thumper and then leave any metals heavy metals contaminants into the thumper then we'll come out into the condenser which is cold and it'll drip start to drip out the very end there back to what I was saying is why is it important for your body to be alkaline well while my phone was charging I went and peed on this one and you can see my pee is darker than my saliva this is what a pinch of baking soda how alkalinity that is and this is the 10 point 10 per 10 ph which basically is a lie it's not 10 it is sitting 6.75 we determined with the pinch of baking soda it brought it up to a 8.0 which to me now looks more like an eight point five alkalinity right I said eight point it's like eight point five my saliva on my body is more like a seven point two five which is a very good balance and not aesthetic at all and my urine is sitting at a smooth seven point two five two a seven point five which means my fluids in my body are very alkaline this is a test that's for humans are you alkaline today and pretty much this test for saliva and urine and why is it out important for you to have alkalinity in your body well this is the important part your pancreas is controlled by your metabolism your metabolism naturally at the age between 27 and 30 will start to slow down your pancreas puts out secretions of alkalinity so no matter what you do to your body or can just ingest will consume your body itself will release alkalinity which will keep your fluids in your body which is supposed to be 80% fluid and 20% mass and that's not a hundred percent accurate either because as you gain fat your oils in your fat take up mass and it restricts the intake of water so basically if you're supposed to be a healthy body 80/20 ratio and you got a fat mass you you got a discount that fat mass so that means you might be sitting at a 70/30 or 6040 depends on how much fat you have in your body which we know that is not good because you need the water and why is important to have the water alkaline well the alkaline water puts a negative ion charge in your body in your fluids why is it important for your fluids in your body to have a negative ion charge well the way it works is that your your your muscle mass in your body acts like capacitors they hold the charge so when you go to move your arm it takes energy there's a constricting your arm and then we're putting it out so it takes it takes energy to do that and different parts of your body to move takes energy and that energy comes from these built-in capacitors and these built-in capacitors are in your muscle mass and they are like layers of mass that are like capacitors and on these capacitors all right we're up to 150 160 you want to get about 170 180 and we should start to very hot down here very warm here and very cold here nothing dripping out yet will be happening soon so what happens in your body the definition of a healthy body is a body that can reproduce healthy cells and I urge for all of you watching this video to learn about your cells your plan that makes healthy cells and in order for a cell to maintain to be a healthy cell and maintain a healthy cell it has to be at a negative 25 millivolts and if I take my hand here and if I smash it with a hammer it and smashed my finger we're going to have a dilation in my finger it's going to send out a signal and it's going to require new cells to be built in that finger and in order to reproduce healthy cells new cells you're going to have to be at a minus 50 millivolts to produce a brand new healthy cells and if your body does not have the charge in the capacitors to do that it will request it from other parts of your body so it will go to different muscle masses like your legs which are stronger the strongest muscle in your body and require for it to get them 50 millivolts funny thing is that I learned is that your teeth are like breakers and your body set up in different areas of this charge and this charge comes from different muscle masses that will require to help a friend out which another ligament or Sutton such-and-such to reproduce healthy cells so you have to be able to produce a minus 50 millivolts to produce a new cell now I urge all you guys learn the timeframe it takes to make cells whether it's skin cells any kind of cell that's in your body how long it takes now very important because if your body can't reproduce healthy cells or new cells what happens to that organ what happens to that part that finger doesn't heal to properly so as we get older we start to get osteoporosis because why well I would think than one of the main reasons is our body is very ascetic and a natural way of our body to balance itself it would go ahead and take calcium from your bones and when it takes calcium from your bones or from your teeth it starts to decrease but you have you mean your your bone mass and it all matters so I want you to do the own research on your own side just putting this out there for you guys because I don't see it anywhere and pretty much you know it's it's very important to know your body that's the key thing here know your body we are up 270 degrees we should soon start to see some vapors come out the Sun feeling a little warm right here you got to know your temperatures if you're making beer or liquor you don't want to make ethanol you go to high you could make pretty much poison your body versus make what you're looking to make so back to these alkalinity things very important I urge everybody to learn more about your own body and what's keeping it alkaline and what's not I'm not a doctor I just do research love research very hot now very hard so like I said the whole premise here is to distill water we're going to deplete it of its contaminants we're going to distill it and one thing I want to teach you about distilled water which distilled water to drink is all not that good because what happens is we were unbalanced in the water here we're taking the the trace minerals out of it and it's unbalanced so when you what would happen the question to you guys is if you were to drink a glass of this distilled water or any distilled water how does that water balance itself if you would have drink it well the answer is this if you drink that water and consume it what it would do is balance itself in your body it would take the calcium and the trace minerals in your body out of its places and it will basically balance itself when it comes out when you pee it out it's already balanced because it's told it sold the calcium from your bones it's told any minerals that he needs to balance itself out and not a lot of people talk about that one more thing I want to talk about before this thing kicks on and starts dripping out is how we're going to balance this water out once we make distilled water well we're going to do it this way we are going to use Himalayan salt I have this block of Himalayan salt and from my studies is that Himalayan salt has the same 65 minerals in it as our body does and what we're going to do is set up a system to where this water when it comes out from here it will drip down the block of water and it will make its own little culvert down the center and it'll pick up its own minerals from the Himalayan salt and it won't be added as if I poured it in there it will be at it because it picked it up itself so like I said when that water wants to balance itself out in your body instead of it doing it in your body and stealing calcium from you and giving you a yes proces steal on all kinds of iron and everything else it needs it's going to take it from this salt and it'll just make a crevice so that is the plan on here I hope you guys we're up to almost 200 degrees I think about 220 is where we're going to see this water start to drip out and I'm gonna keep you on so it starts dripping out now vapor is coming up and getting caught in here you know thumper and then in the thumper vapors will build up until there's enough pressure in there which will come down and go into the worm of the condenser and then it will pull down then come out back as as a liquid versus a gas so this is a good chemistry thing to also be focusing on is how to turn liquids into gas how to separate the trace minerals contaminants from the liquid how to separate flavors which is the skins of bananas and oranges as where all the oil is trapped which gives the orange and the bananas its flavor and that flavor can be condensed into oil and we could make one batch which I guess we will do one time is make a batch and we'll get some oils now remember oil and water don't mix so you really can't mix the two if you go ahead and try to mix the two what you'll have is something called concentrate which what does concentrate so let's go in the refrigerator and let's look at my grapefruit juice for instance grapefruit juice will separate and this says never from concentrate so they're saying that's natural juice so if you do have something from concentrate that means that the concentrate would be would be where you separate the oils now you can see that this side starting to shake still cold in there yeah we're getting up to about 210 degrees think about 220 I'm guessing we're gonna start to see a drip come out of the worm there it goes look at that look at that I just seen a nice little nice little drip coming out so what'd I say about 220 we're at 210 there we go we're starting to see a little little pup going there and starting its own little puff pump there it is down to pl it's about 220 I read up with distillers on when you'll start to see the water you can see that there's condensing bubbles showing up on the worm now you can see we're starting to get a little flow pretty soon we'll start to have a steady flow this will become a steady flow especially when we get to teach wine and that water up top there is kind of getting warm like hot so let's get a little ice that's why this puppet is important that's why it's important to have this cool down so I'll have to focus on this pump as well now you can see it dripping gotta cool that water down very important for the condenser to start cooling down you can see some drips coming out as I put ice in there can't be hot water up there repeating the purpose of a condenser where the condenser is to be cold and we'll do that by chilling it down and we're up to 200 the temperatures drop down by itself a little bit and we're starting to see a little steady steady squirt cuz I'm cooling it down a little bit more on there so basically the eye can see now why the pump is essential here because you what you want to do is flow the water cold water through there and that's what's needed for the condenser to work is that water to be cold so very important on using a distiller to be able to cool it down let's see if I could turn this pump on pump out some water and see if I can create an airflow here got water coming out and so this might be a summary of it but I don't know I don't want to stick it in the water but definitely put nice in there will make the difference oh yeah some hot water now so basically the key element that I'm disregarding right now we're now focusing on is the fact that that one needs to be real cold that it needs to circulate so I guess if this is submersible this would be filled with ice water it would circulate this whole worm and then that worm you can see how as it cools down the vapors come back locale that ice Melton might have to put the pump on to circulate some water out of there you can see as it cools down you get a steady flow go ahead and suck out some water and then we're going to suck some this yeah if that's the key is the worm needs fresh ice oh put you down for a second it's kind of hard to hold the phone should be a steady flow coming out temperatures at 200 I could smell the vinegar so the vinegar is carrying over but it is also do what it's supposed to do on sanitizing the stainless steel containers as you want to stand that you want to sanitize everything the copper tubing the worm the ends the outs of 210 bumpers very hot for meditation pot is very hot very hot and probably has vinegar case but let's check it's coming out cold let's put a test drip on it this is a distilled water this should be very ascetic water they say that people who have cancer will run about a 5.5 pH which stands to reason because your liquids in your body are very ascetic let's see the top is very orange notice that the 10-point the 10 pH is faded away and my little touch of baking soda is solid goes to show you this is just because they added some electrolytes and some potassium drops and you can see that this distilled water is sitting at about a 4 about a 4.5 if you test your body and your ascetic like that I would go get checked if that's not healthy so for first time out distilling or even using the distiller I can't say this is that bad I would say using the circulation pump is the way to go I don't want to ruin this by sticking this in the water but I would think that going to let's see how this works it will pop it out and I'm not getting electrocuted so it is a submersible and it is circulating all right well circulating water to stick some ice in that water grab some ice because we only had one mine basically that cold water so want you guys leave your comments there's the cold water you can see we're starting to get a good flow water is circulating which will you feel a little warm water coming out but that will cool the whole the whole thing down temperatures still in 210 we needed to come up a little higher this may be where my outside turkey fryer might come in handy to get the temperature up oh no it seems to be working good I'm cooling it down so it is is submersible oh yeah look at that ah hell don't do this with electric and water guys so on this pump you can have it suck so right now we're should switch these two where the warmer water is up top there's some things to learn here so obviously myself needs to learn here so i know water hot water rises so basically this here should be where the cold water goes in here's where the hot water should come out if it's warm up top it should come out right now we are pushing water we're sucking we're sucking water out mmm interesting well you see the Vice melting you see the water dripping out there holy you're gonna overflow here so let's stop that oh god I want to overflow I just want to there we go we're sucking it down now decreasing put the plug back down now we're gonna see it come back up so I got I got a little bit to learn with to see the water coming back in now it's coming out all right so for first-run want you guys to learn from my mistakes you can see that we still have some good water coming out it's nice cold temperature pretty interesting not bad for the first run hopefully you learn something about this and stay tuned so what I wanted to show you on this cup there's a plus and a negative so I think if you swap that over it'll act differently let's see you can see the airflow coming out so now what we're doing is we're pushing water out of here there's soap getting in from the inside and I think my son just came out he wants to cook some lunch right out there kill his video you guys got two legit what'd I say peace out comment", "Awj1uoFxwv0": "hi I'm Kelly with southern boy Steel's and today I'm going to show you how to make a sour mash this is really similar to uncle Jesse's mash we're going to be using cracked corn so we have five pounds of cracked corn in our six and a half gallon bucket and then we have seven pounds of sugar so we're give that a good mix and the reason we add these together before we add our hot water is so that both the corn and the sugar will get that hot water immediately so the sugar starts to dissolve faster every water here is 180 go ahead and pour this straight into our bucket we have two and a half gallons I'm going to keep stirring it until all the sugar dissolves now we're going to let this sit for about an hour until it reaches about 85 degrees okay we're back finishing up our coordinate here before we add any yeast we're going to add two and a half gallons of cold water you want to make sure you have three to four inches space from the top of your bucket if you don't then this is a good time to switch to a bigger bucket because it's going to rise give that a good stir check our temperature all right perfect we're sitting right at about 85 degrees before we add our yeast we're going to use our hydrometer to check our alcohol volume we're looking for about a 15% reading which is right we have two tablespoons of distilleries that we're going to stir in now that that's mixed up we'll put on a tight-fitting lid with an airlock we'll let this sit for five to seven days see when it's time to strain visit southern boy still calm or like us on Facebook", "WirxYyNi68g": "it's the first snow I've seen in about 15 years so in honor of that we're gonna make some hard apple cider snow isn't that weird but seeing snow on a banana tree that's kind of weird [Music] alright so today we're gonna do some apple cider and yes there are dozens of videos on YouTube about how to do hard apple cider but the one thing that's different about the way I do it is that I don't use any preservatives I don't use any artificial sweeteners this is literally just papal juice and yet I can still get a sweet sparkling hard apple cider so stick with me this is a really easy recipe we're just gonna once again take some Kroeger apple juice and some laughlin 11:18 little champagne yeast so we're just gonna combine these we're gonna put an airlock in the top of the jug and since we're gonna do this one on the cheap we're gonna roughing up the tops of our apple juice jugs with a knife so that the hot flu we're gonna use later will stick really well we're just gonna take a drill and drill a hole through the lid of these jugs so that they accommodate an airlock file then we're just gonna throw a little hot glue on there and we've got a ready-made fermentation vessels without having to do much of anything you can use a balloon for this process but I like doing an airlock just because it it's cooler looking so yeah so one of the things that's really important about doing any sort of apple cider Applejack is that you need to use apple juice or whatever type of juice you're using that it has no preservatives in it it can have ascorbic acid but no potassium sorbate if it is potassium sorbate that will kill off the yeast and your fermentation will never take off [Music] I already created a fart smell on my own and I don't need my fermentations doing it so whenever you're doing any fermentation with apple juice apple cider grab Applejack always use some yeast nutrient to make sure that the yeast is nice and healthy and happy and it doesn't start getting stressed stress yeast makes fart smells not good trust me and one other thing we're also gonna add if you want to have nice clear apple cider apple juice has a lot of pectin in it and pectin makes for a very easy brew no matter what you're doing so you want to always add some pectus enzyme to your apple cider and Applejack just to make sure that you can get it as clear as possible [Music] so now that we've got our apple cider with the yeast nutrient and the Mexicans I'm and it's yeast we're gonna go throw it in a dark area so that it can do its thing all right so our cider has been sitting for about a month and a half something like that and it's a completed fermentation and it's also gotten nice and clear let's take a look [Music] most of the time if you want to make a sweet sparkling hard cider you have to basically use something that won't ferment any further to sweeten your cider so you would take something like stevia or something you let your cider ferment out completely you put some stevia in it to sweeten it and then you carbonate it and really that's not good it's gross once you put your cider into the bottle with your whatever you're gonna use to sweeten it sugar apple juice whatever the yeast that's remaining in that cider is going to eat up the sugars that are in that juice or sugar syrup whatever you put in there to carbonate the bottles for you but in doing that they eat all the sugar so there's no sweetness left and you end up with a dry hard cider that's not bad but that's not what we're going for today so how do we make the yeast stop doing what it wants to do and make sure that it leaves us with a carbonated sweet cider well let's bottle it first a lot of people use a keg for doing their cider just because it makes this process a little bit simpler you know they'll drop a Camden tablet in it to kill all the yeast and then they'll throw them in there sweetener and then they'll carbonate but I don't have that option because I'm still bottling then they don't have a keg setup you know what can I say I'm broke so let's go ahead and get to the bottling and then I'll show you how we're actually gonna make this magic happen I don't want to use anything artificial to back sweeten my hard cider I want it to taste super happily and also be sweet and also get the carbonation that I'm with you so all I'm gonna do is take my hard cider and add one of these concentrated apple juice I want to make sure that it doesn't have any preservatives in it this one has vitamin C or ascorbic acid to preserve it but that's fine it's not gonna hurt the yeast take one of these thought-out and we're gonna add it to our hard cider right before bottling so I've got my two gallon bottling bucket set up with a spigot on it I just get these free from the bakery in the grocery store they're just icing buckets they're just gonna throw them away so always go over and ask and see if they've got any that they're gonna toss and get yourself free bucket plus they make great small batch for Mentors [Music] now that we have our hard cider and apple juice concentrate mix together we're just gonna bottle it but we're gonna do something a little bit different because we want to be able to stop the fermentation that's happening inside the bottles the bottle carbonation the bottle conditioning we want to stop that at a very specific point basically when we have enough carbonation we're gonna shut off the fermentation the way that we're gonna know that we have enough carbonation in the bottles without having to open one we're gonna use one of these this is gonna be our test vessel you know we're gonna do is fill it up just bottle it like normal don't worry it will hold the pressure and every day we're gonna go and squeeze this bottle and see if it's firm once it gets firm enough usually about four days in then your carbonation is ready and once we get to that point I'll catch up with you [Music] [Music] now we're just gonna wait until that coke bottle is firm to the touch to the squeeze just as if it were a brand-new coke all right it's been about four days so now we know that our hard cider is carbonated but still a little bit sweet we know that because we filled this bottle up at the same time as we filled the glass bottles all we have to do to test it to make sure it's ready is give it a squeeze and it should feel like a fresh unopened soda nice and firm and you can see there's very little give in that bottle at all and the cider is coming out nice and clear so now that the bottles are carbonated to the level that we want and we know that we've still got some sugar left in there we're going to do a process called pasteurization basically we're just going to heat the bottles up to a temperature that will kill off the east and then let them cool slowly down so let's get that started pay close attention to this next process because it is a little bit tricky there is a potential for catastrophic failure so be careful good luck don't blow up your kitchen so now all we have to do is get a pot of water up to a hundred and eighty degrees put our bottles in let them sit for about ten minutes to kill off the yeast and then just let them cool to room temperature overnight [Music] one thing you need to note is that when you're filling up your pot make sure that the water in your pot is going to come up above the level of the liquid in your bottles because it's got to cover that in order to kill all the yeast word of caution here when you're heating up that water do not put the bottles in the pot nothing in the products of the water bring it up to 180 turn off the heat then put your bottles in then put the lid on and walk away from it for about ten minutes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay so I hope you enjoyed disco fish he's our house mascot other than the dog so these bottles are done no we're just gonna let them air cool on the counter overnight and then you can do whatever you want to with them you can refrigerate them you can pack them and send them to a buddy whatever you want to do the main reason to do this is we're not using a chemical stabilizer to stop the yeast activity we're using just heat so there's no preservatives there's no nothing in there this is what pasteurization is gives you the opportunity to keep the sweetness without adding an artificial sweetener and to stop the yeast activities so you can keep the carbonation where you want it and also it makes it shelf stable so you know the fact that you can do that without spending any extra money on chemicals or putting anything in there that you maybe don't want any preservatives whatever I really like this process so after all that the fermentation the siphoning bottling and then the pasteurization what do we have left to enjoy was it worth it does it taste good well all of those bottles that I pasteurized they're all gone I gave them to my sister and brother-in-law for Christmas and they drink them all I give him I think I gave him about 12 bottles and they drank them all in a couple of weeks so they said I should become a cider maker I you know I'm not gonna take their word for it but at least that means that they enjoyed it and what that also means to me is that this process is solid enough for me to share with you hopefully you can do this in your own kitchen and have some equally fantastic results so what I do have left what I do have left is my one little coke bottle that I used for my pressure testing to make sure I had enough carbonation in my in my glass bottles without having to crack one off and then waste it so we still have this one to enjoy this has been sitting in the refrigerator for a month it's still got some sweetness crazy amount of apple aroma got some good tartness to it and just the right amount of Sparkman's the co2 I think is just right in there I thought when I poured it it was such a big head on it I thought maybe that was a little too much but it died down real quick and it's just it's just about right and the more times you do this the easier it's gonna get for you to dial in the amount of sweetness you know like if you want less sweetness but just a little bit you can go for another day once you hit maximum firmness on that coke bottle if you want a little more sweetness just when it's almost there on the firmness go ahead and pasteurize it and you're good to go so lots of variability lots of room for adjustment in this whole process to give you your own unique flavor so you know have fun with it play around do some experimentation and try this with some other juices you can do exactly the same process on pear juice grape juice anything you want to do so as always thanks for watching so if you enjoyed this video and you learned anything go ahead make that like button if you have any questions if you have any

craft apple pie moonshine [Music] now like i said in the intro guys this weekend i have some family coming up from chicago and we are having a little christmas party i'm gonna make some apple pie moonshine and i'm gonna go over kind of some of the the stuff that you need to do this one gallon of apple juice one gallon of apple cider two cups granulated table sugar two cups brown sugar you can use light or dark some cinnamon sticks and a pot to boil everything in so let's get started alright guys now as i said i have one gallon of apple cider 1 gallon of apple juice some cinnamon sticks some brown sugar some granulated table sugar and about two and a half quarts of all grain uh high quality moonshine [Music] i mean how we're going to start this off is put some of our apple cider or apple juice into a pot with our sugar and uh start cooking it down all right guys so let's get started here um today i'm using my just a standard brew pot it's eight and a half gallons brew masters these pots are super cheap i bought this one off of morebeer.com it's been a great pot i've owned it for years this is where i kind of started out was brewing beer so this pots really come in handy and i really enjoy using it plus the life kind of gets a little upset if i start using her nice cooking pots for for stuff like this so what i'm going to do here set this on the stove and get it heating up and i'm going to pour in about half my apple juice [Music] all right so as you can see i added about half my apple juice now i'm going to go ahead and throw in six cinnamon sticks um i have a few of these i plan on doing some more recipes some maybe some wine and a few other things some apple cider hard apple cider so um i'm gonna save some of these cinnamon sticks but uh this recipe will call for six get this thing open here [Music] and there's exactly six i'm going to save that container you never know what i might use it for the pot is kind of shifting around here um i usually use this on a gas burner so it doesn't really give me this problem i think what i'm going to do is try to find something to stick underneath of it here all right guys i got my pot stop shaking here a little trick i just stuck some spoons underneath of it um just away from the burner as far as i could and i'm just going to let this thing heat up and then while i'm doing that just kind of let this thing go i'm going to measure out my sugar get that added in a bowl [Music] and as you can see i just got kind of got it in a bowl here our pot is starting to get hot i'm going to go ahead and add this in and just stir it up until it dissolves all right now i'm gonna go ahead and let this simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes let that cinnamon open up let it kind of get in all the juice that we have in here once that time is over we'll come back and i'll go through the next step now you don't have to do this i happen to have these on hand and i need to use them up this is just some dried cherries i'm going to stick in this pot and kind of let them simmer with the cinnamon sticks all right guys now i let this go for about 20 minutes you can smell the aroma in here it just smells like someone's baking a homemade apple pie here i'm gonna go ahead and shut this off and remove my spoons here and i'm going to go ahead and pour in the rest of my cold ingredients now i don't know if you can see the condensation on the drug here but i went ahead and i left this out in my garage for i don't know i'd say a couple of days enough for it to get real cold and i'll show you here in a few minutes why that's a great idea i'm gonna go ahead and pour this in all right now our gallon of apple cider and i'm gonna be real careful with this and i don't know if you guys can see the sludge that's in the bottom of that but that's from cold crashing um and i'm gonna try not to pour in all of that sludge because once you pour it in you can't get it back out and i want all the flavor of the apple cider but i want to try to leave some of that stuff that's going to plug up our filter at the end of this process [Music] out [Music] all right and you can see in the bottom of that there that that is just pure sludge and i'm going to try to keep that out of our mixture here i'm going to give this a quick stir see what we're feeling here yeah right now the bonus to doing it this way and dissolving your sugar first and then adding everything else is that it's kind of like when you do a sugar shine you don't have to let it all cool overnight now i can add my alcohol straight from here if i wanted to and that's what we're gonna do here but the before we do that um this is really sweet and i don't mind sweet but uh to kind of straighten that out i'm going to add about a half of this jug of cranberry juice and it's kind of a drier flavor so it'll kind of even out that sweetness all right now we can add our alcohol um i got about i'd say just a little over two and a half quarts of 180 proof sugar shine here if you want to know how to make this stuff or how i did it go ahead and click the link above i'll put a card up there for you guys and it'll bring you to the to the video where i show you how to do this so we're going to go ahead and put this this one in you can smell that alcohol in there [Music] all right let's put one more in here do okay now that's looking pretty good i'm going to let this sit for a few minutes i'm going to get the filter and the funnel and try to get some of this stuff out and we'll be right back i got my pot elevated here so you guys can see it and what we got here is just a standard strainer uh stainless steel funnel in our jars and we're gonna just strain this in and the only reason why we're using a strainer is just to make sure we don't get any big chunks [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] all right guys now the next step to this now that i've got it all in jars is to add the leftover cinnamon sticks now i have eight jars here i'm gonna go ahead and add one full cinnamon cinnamon stick to each half gallon jar and then i'm gonna break these in half and do these four wow [Music] you guys know we're just going to cap this up now this recipe guys it i uh changed it a little bit from the beginning i added some fresh cherries or some dried cherries to the pot and i also put a little cranberry juice in it these things are optional i've made this a lot of times i change it all the time sometimes i use sugar sometimes i use honey if it's in season and i can get fresh honey that really is the best way to go uh being this time of year in december it's hard to find fresh honey where i'm at and uh so i substitute sugar in i got about almost three gal or about yeah almost three gallons out of it today um and this is kind of our test jar i'll tell you what man ice cold i don't think there's anything better than this i'm gonna go ahead and take a drink here [Music] and it's it's tasty it's a little hot yet as far as the the burn it's got a little bit a little bit of boozy on the nose as this chills it'll mellow out quite a bit and by this weekend it'll be fantastic i mean everybody will love it i've never had anybody that tried it that said they didn't like it um and like i said that that cranberry juice really mellows out all the sugar you put in it kind of dries it out just a little bit so it doesn't give you as bad it got rot um man i don't i don't think i've done a better job than this it's really tasty i better put that away all right guys if you liked the video today you know what to do hit the subscribe

ever actually I've had comments on some of my recipes that are like in order to make this recipe and have it actually tastes really good you cannot wear buttons so [Music] it's actually really sunny and beautiful outside so I'm actually pretty happy also I love apple pie but I'm gonna show you not only the apple pie but one of my favorite crusts this is actually legitimately my go-to pie crust for all pies that I make it's a butter crust and the I guess the secret ingredient is really the vodka so for this pie I'm actually I think probably most pies like there is the crust and there is the filling and the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to work on the crust this particular recipe makes a top crust and a bottom crust so we're gonna mix our dry ingredients and so salt very important I've got some AP flour there and some granulated sugar you know people don't really understand this that crust actually have flavor they should have flavor it this is cold cubed butter you can do this in a food processor or you can do this by hand or you can use a pastry cutter I like to do it by hand just because it's it's kind of fun so this particular technique is called Prasad and basically we're just gonna smear the butter into the flour and create nice flaky layers what I do is I just smash it in my hands you just have to go a little more quickly because your hands are obviously warm so here's what you're looking for you're smashing the butter into really thin layers and your each time that you smash it into your hand or under the counter you flatten it out and you get a layer of flour on the top and the bottom like all of these little like bits with the flour and the butter are gonna create flaky layers while it cooks the the steam from the the butter is going to expand and because it's sandwiched between layers of flour it's going to puff up alright cool and it's clean enough for pie emergencies I actually do keep vodka in the freezer and also in case anybody needs a cocktail [Music] it's good to keep the vodka cold basically everything when you're making a pie crust you want everything cold pour out a quarter cup of vodka a quarter cup of ice water and then I've got two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and I'm gonna make a little bit of a well here and then just kind of pour it all over all right and then you don't want to work the dough that much you just kind of want to mix it until it comes together and just holds its shape it is warming up so the butter is loosening up yeah well you know you could like stick your whole body in an ice bath so you can see like little pieces of are little bits of flour and that's fine all right I'm gonna Pat it out but it's a little warm so I'm gonna just Pat it out and I'm gonna stick it in the freezer for five minutes just to firm up a little bit I ate a little piece earlier we don't rob my family went to India and I pad my butter stored in my fanny pack and we landed it was like July in India and my mom saw something like trickling down my leg and open the fanny pack it was like have you just been keeping butter in here the whole time it was like yeah that's a pretty awesome better story I try a little bit of your rawhide oh of course okay so it's nice and cool I'm gonna show you one of my favorite layering techniques basically you just Pat your dough down to about an inch thick and then cut it into quarters and then just stack them up and then press them back down and what we're doing when we flatten them out we're just adding more layers to it I didn't write this into the recipe but like I usually do this four times just to you know make it really really flaky I'm gonna do it one more time just because I like to do this a lot layers now I'm gonna cut this in half and pop them out into disks and just flatten that out and you want to let this rest at least a few hours in the refrigerator that's gonna do a couple of things it's gonna relax the gluten that you have already developed but it's also gonna give the flour time to hydrate okay so this is the filling obviously they're apples so I have already peeled and sliced most of the apples so what I do normally when I make an apple pie certainly but even a peach pie anything that's gonna discolor slightly I always get a bowl of water and then squeeze a couple of lemons in it and so you're basically creating a acid bath so what I'm gonna do I'm using pink ladies it's one of my favorite apples pink ladies wine saps braeburns you want a firm crisp tart apple I'm gonna core this you can use a melon baller if you have that but who has that and then you just want really nice thin slices like a quarter to an eighth of an inch thick so the true Claire's not here so there is a trick I mean it's not really a trick it's like I hate blind baking pie crust it's just like so annoying do you pre-heat your your sheet tray and then you put the pie on the hot sheet tray and let it cook there for the normal time so you'll actually cook the crust and brown it alright so now I'm gonna drain these just put them back alright so now we're gonna mix all of the dry ingredients into the apples so we've got granulated sugar dark brown sugar always delicious in a fall apple pie salt salt is another key ingredient I can't tell you how much I hate deserts that don't have salt I'm using cinnamon cardamom and allspice alright it's looking good and now I'm gonna add a little bit more lemon juice this will continue to help prevent any browning but more importantly we're just adding some additional flavor and anytime you cook for long periods of time whether it's a soup a stew or a pie flavors start to flatten out and what any sort of acid does is it just brightens things so I'm gonna use some apple cider and reduce it on the stove and what that's gonna do it's gonna give you a really nice concentrated apple flavor we're adding whole vanilla bean to this so I'm going to go to and split this before I go over to the stove so just pour this in if you can find fresh apple cider that is awesome so I'm gonna bring this to a boil so you want to reduce this down by like half two-thirds it's gonna start to get kind of thick and then once that's happened I'm going to pour off the the juices that have accumulated from the apples into this mixture and let those reduce and then I want to take it to a really nice syrupy stage I'm also going to add some cornstarch this is going to help thicken the juices so this is reducing nicely and you can see like all those beautiful vanilla beans that are in there so I'm going to add the accumulated juice and now we will add those juices in and continue to boil but this is what you want it's gonna be nice and dark amber color it's almost gonna it's almost looks like a little caramel e we've gotten all of the flavor out of these guys now just stir up my cornstarch and water mixture and I'm going to add that directly in to the cider so we're just gonna cook this for about a minute we want to return to the boil still when you have whenever you're cooking with cornstarch or whenever you're using cornstarch you never get the full thickening power until the cornstarch returns to a boil this is going to bind with the liquid and create a really really nice little thick apple apple gravy so this is cool ever so slightly you don't want to let it get too cool you want it to be at least you know slightly pourable because as it sits it will actually stiffen up it looks really good it smells so good already I am gonna have a little piece so I like to roll my pie dough out onto a piece of parchment for so this actually just loosens it up a little bit and a good thing that Priya's not around or else should be eating my dough and that weird [ __ ] might also be leaking melted butter also weird I usually start from the center and then just pull it towards me and then give it a little bit of a turn pull it towards me turn pull it towards me definitely you want this on the thinner side but you know I think what probably is most important you can get away with a thin crust but the thing that you want to make sure is that it's large enough to fit your pie dish so as long as your pie crust is two inches longer than the size of the dish then you're fine and now we will roll out the second crust I'm gonna throw this into the freezer that's gonna be our top crust so this is the first crust that I rolled out and it's been in the refrigerator for about five minutes the time that it took me to roll out the second crust the top side is nicely unflavored so I'm gonna use that as the bottom and then just go and then just let its lumps out into the pie dish the freezer is your friend if it starts to get too warm just throw it in the freezer for five minutes so excess flour just brush it off you want to leave about an inch of overhanging over the edge of the pie and I actually did a pretty decent job of rolling this out so there's not that much overhang oh so good whoa you're probably thinking God that is like a massively overflowing pie but these apples are gonna cook down so you know this mound of apple is gonna shrink down probably a good two inches into the pie so we're gonna throw this in the fruit in the freezer just so the crust can firm up a little bit and then we will add the top crust the the crust is a little bit stiff which is good also the the apples the surface of the apples are actually really cold which is good because I'm about to put the top layer of crust on but first I'm gonna make an egg wash so this is going to do a couple of things it's going to be the glue that binds the two crusts together also gonna add a little water just to thin it out a little bit just like a teaspoon or so before I put the top crust on I'm going to take two tablespoons of butter and just dot the top as the pie bakes it's gonna melt in there this is my chilled top crust so you want this top crust to be slightly smaller than the bottom crust because we're gonna roll the bottom over to the top so I'm just gonna go ahead and trim this make sure as you start cutting that you're leaving at least half an inch of overhang so now we're just gonna roll the top over and again if it starts to seem too soft then just throw it back in the fridge or the freezer so now you can kind of press down a little bit just to seal it a little bit better and if you you know trim off a little bit too much or sometimes like as you're pushing the dome down and filling in the gaps it'll pull some of the the dough and you'll have less than you anticipated so what you can do is just fill in gaps with like pieces of the trimmings so what I'm gonna do is push in with my thumb in between my index finger and my thumb in my other hand and that will make a nice exaggerated flute egg wash the top and you can be pretty liberal with this you can use the Marrero sugar you can use granulated sugar you can use raw sugar I would not use just regular brown sugar because that's gonna clump and there's a little more moisture in it so the the steam vents are really really important and you can I'm gonna make sort of an exaggerated kind of decorative steam vent you can just do slits in the pie if you want I'm gonna make four little triangular shaped cuts and then just pull this up and over I think it looks pretty and also it's going to ensure that steam is going to escape all right now I'm going to put this in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm up the crust and to get a little chill in the apples and I have pie scraps which I'm very excited about okay so I have a hot oven 425 degrees the rock is set in the center and I'm gonna put this sheet tray in there to heat so this is the cold pie okay so one of the things that's a little bit unique about the how we're baking this pie is that we're gonna start at a really high temp 425 and then we're going to lower it after five minutes to 375 and the reason for that is we have we have a really cold hard crust from the the fruit of ten minutes in the freezer we're putting it in a hot oven to really set the crust do we have ice cream yes my god you just made my morning the one thing about the technique on the hot sheet tray you can see how nicely Brown the crust is on the bottom this is probably a Rick size slice but so it's still nice and juicy I don't like pies that are like overly set especially with an apple pie like you want some of that nice juice to still be in there it's just beautiful like thin flaky layers look at that that would be that would be wrong hi solo yes who do you want a scoop while I cut yeah great I want an extra big scoop on mine I mean it's pretty mad hi oh hi Carla I don't have the beautiful testicles it's B A's best but like a slight hybrid yeah I used the we need more ice cream oh actually that's that's even better yeah so I used bodkin the crust oh that was amazing in a great mood no good yay bye I'm just gonna sit here with the other third of this pie and a full pint of ice cream and I'm gonna be a very happy boy [Music]", "jOc6xx-72UQ": "alright ladies and gentlemen this is the warm apple pie okay warm apple pie so we grab apple cider cinnamon stick to heat those bad boys up okay give it a nice little stir so you really cinnamon eyes on apple cider beautiful rum I know you one think it of rum being the base of the string but

how to make apple pie moonshine so the ingredients that you need to make apple pie moonshine are really simple you need apple cider apple juice brown sugar white sugar cinnamon sticks one clove and I like to use 151 Everclear and vanilla vodka first thing you need is a large six and a half quart in the stock pot with a lid so let's get the lid off and you add your apple cider you're gonna add 1/2 a gallon now don't get too worried about whether you have exactly a half a gallon just pour in about half the gallon all right then you're gonna use a half a gallon of apple juice and this bottle is 64 ounces which is half a gallon so I'm gonna go ahead and use the whole bottle there we go once you get your apple juice and apple cider into your stockpot you're gonna go ahead and turn on your stove and put that on high heat until it comes to a rolling boil as the apple juice and apple cider start to come up to temperature you can go ahead and start adding your dry ingredients here's one cup of white sugar then one cup of brown sugar then you're going to add four cinnamon sticks one two three and four and the last thing that you're gonna add for this is going to be one whole clove now as you can see the coal the cloves are very tiny but you only need one they're very very potent so does just like that now as your mixture is coming up to temperature just give it a stir every once in a while just to get the sugars and everything mixed in at this point I like to go ahead and add a lid on to the stockpot this will help it come up to temperature a little bit quicker every once in a while just giving it a little stir to make sure the sugars are mixed in ah okay once your base mixture comes to a full boil as it is here you're gonna turn your heat down to a low medium heat so that it just comes to a low boil just about like that now you're gonna let it go like this for about 20 to 30 minutes this will allow all those flavors to mix together for this step I like to leave the lid off and let it condense down a little bit now that your base has been rolling like this for about 30 minutes go ahead and shut your heat completely off put your lid on like this and let it cool down to close to room temperature you want to make sure that it gets at least below 173 degrees which is the boiling point of alcohol if you put it in above that temperature all your alcohol is just gonna boil off and it's going to be a non-alcoholic drink now it's done for the good part so I have checked the temperature with my BBQ thermometer and the temperature is right at 99 degrees which is just right it's nice and easy to you can put your hands on the side of the pot like this and you don't have to worry about the alcohol evaporating off so let's go ahead and add the Everclear so go ahead and add the whole bottle nice and slow so it doesn't splash all over the place and now you're gonna do half a bottle of your favorite vanilla vodka oh that's about half the bottle and now you just stir it up and put it in mason jars I like to use these pint-sized jars these are just the right size for gifts and I like to take a ladle like this just stir it up mmm that smells good now this will fill about 12 of these pint-sized jars just like that well there you go apple pie moonshine this stuff will knock you on your keister so drink responsibly enjoy and share with your family I'll see you

watching everybody and we'll see you in the next video make sure you subscribe if you have it and click the thumb e take care everyone bye for now", "Zed9Zr7wKTA": "hi there today and it is a keeper I am showing you how to make my signature apple pie moonshine this cocktail is incredible it is jam-packed with apple cinnamon flavor and really pack the punch if you like this moonshine recipe make sure you grab a copy of my ebook how to make flavored moonshine in that ebook I give you 16 flavored moonshine recipes plus 30 cocktail recipes that you can make with the moonshine now I'm calling this moonshine but we're not gonna be in the mountains using a homemade still instead we're using grain alcohol for the moonshine part and it's strong but oh so good now once you make this recipe you're going to want to have it on hand all of the time so of course you should enjoy this cocktail responsibly [Music] okay let's get started making this incredible apple pie moonshine so we're going to start by adding a lot of apple flavor and it starts with apple cider I'm just going to add an entire jug of apple cider now you want to make sure you have a nice big stockpot for this recipe because we're adding a lot of stuff in here so to our apple cider we are also going to add some apple juice if you pour it just right mix plash --is everywhere see our pot is almost full here if you need to if you don't have a big enough pot you can easily split this up between two smaller pots just do half and half half in one pot half in the other oh I can really smell this this smells like being at the apple orchard I just love it okay so we need to sweeten this up and you're going to add some sugar to the recipe now it's quite a bit of sugar but this makes quite a bit of moonshine so we're just going to pour that all in there couple more quick ingredients we're going to add that apple pie flavour to our moonshine I have some ground cinnamon and I have some ground nutmeg that's gonna give it that apple pie essence okay last thing we're gonna put in here some cinnamon sticks so I just have whole cinnamon sticks we're gonna drop those right in and that's it we're gonna bring this to a boil we're gonna let it simmer on the stove for about an hour for everything to come together and that cinnamon did he pulled out of cinnamon sticks and it's just going to be wonderful something it nice and thick and syrupy okay so our apple pie moonshine has simmered and you're gonna notice the cinnamon sticks are going to open up and there might be a little bit of cinnamon and nothing I got the top and that's okay cuz as this moonshine sis everything's gonna settle down so we have one more thing to add to this and that is our alcohol now you want to make sure that before you add your alcohol to this recipe that it is completely cooled and that's for two reasons first of all we don't want our alcohol to evaporate off and a hot liquid would cause that to happen second of all green alcohol is extremely flammable so you don't want to use that anywhere near a flame or a stove or hot lessly so just to protect yourself pull it down completely before you add the alcohol so like I mentioned we are adding Everclear I like to use 190 proof this is the strong stuff now you may not be able to get that in your state a lot of states don't carry it and if that's the case you can't find it feel free to use a different or lower proof grain alcohol you can even substitute vodka or some bottled moonshine you just want to make sure you have 750 the leaders of it but I'm using the full throttle 190 proof in this recipe okay so let's add our Everclear to the recipe here we're just going to pour the entire bottle now if you wanted to make this even better and you wanted to kick up that cinnamon flavor you could add some cinnamon schnapps that would really kick up that cinnamon flavor add that in addition to the Everclear and i think okay last thing to do is we are going to get this all into some mason jars so we can store it away in a cool dark place for background two to three months because right now it tastes like rocket fuel and you don't want to drink it right after you make it it does need that time to mellow okay so let's label this into some jars now when I label it I always like to make sure I get at least one cinnamon stick into each jar so just carefully transfer that in there and you're gonna want to fill the jar completely up not to the tippy tippy top but come right up to where that neck starts to show and as this moonshine sits it'll pull more even more flavor out of those cinnamon sticks and the flavor is just incredible [Music] so that's it we'll take that final out put the lid on make sure it's nice and tight and then we're going to store it in a cool dark place you don't want it to have any temperature fluctuations or exposed to sunlight you just want to hang out and get mellow and even more amazing so I'm going to fill up the rest of my mason jars and then we will give this a try okay so I have some apple pie moonshine that I made previously so we're not drinking the stuff that we made today but you'll notice when you make it there's some stuff that's settled in the bottom so you want to give it a really good shake and just get everything mixed up and you get the cinnamon sticks twirling around I could just see the little bits of cinnamon in the jar I can't wait to get into this so we're gonna pop that open pour it into our glass I'm gonna try to keep that cinnamon stick from going in there so if you look you can see the bits of cinnamon in the jar I don't know if the camera is picking it up but oh so good and I just love how it tastes so cinnamon now I've had this so many times I know it tastes good but we're going to get this up anyway [Music] you I this is amazing I'm telling you if you make this for your friends and family and they are gonna want it again and again so be prepared to share the recipe this stuff is good I need to make a double batch of Becca thanks for watching you can get the full instructions in the video description below make sure you like follow and subscribe so you

honey from my new house welcome to my youtube channel I have a bonus video for you guys this week I'm posting on Thursday because I teamed up with some of my friends and we prepared Thanksgiving dinner menu for you guys starting with tofu wrapped in grilled eggplant from Eden I'll cry later pumpkin gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce from Borna papa roasted Missa Brussels sprouts from veget Orioles and here are the desserts mini salted caramel cheesecake from simply baking's and I made apple cider cream pie to get started gather all your ingredients I'm gonna be making butter oat crust if you don't like to use oats just omit the oats and use all-purpose flour instead so I have your all-purpose flour oats I'm gonna be using a little bit of sugar salt cornstarch make sure you use chilled butter I'm using unsalted chilled butter I like to use ginger either crystallize or candied ginger chilled apple cider vinegar and also chilled milk the first thing I'm gonna do is to add vinegar to milk set it aside now we can process flour oats sugar cornstarch and salt in a food processor just process it for about 30 to 45 seconds or so you don't want to make oat flour just process it until you have little bits of oats they're still visible and then you can add butter just post it for a couple times until it's roughly combined and now we can add our liquid you can see butter is still pretty big so that's a good thing and now for the liquid I'm adding milk that I combine with the vinegar and also don't forget to add crystallized ginger or candied ginger and you just want to post it until it's roughly combined and you can still see a little bits of butter so now we all you have to do is basically gather this together press it into a disk and you have to chill this for one hour I also like to chill my rolling board or cutting board I'm using for rolling out the dough well I like to chill it in the freezer for about 20 minutes until it's super cold and then we can roll out the dough I'm using nine-inch pie dish so I just gonna roll it out to the size of the dish you can also check if it's big enough and then we can transfer this into the dish it's still pretty cold it's gonna slide off right in with this dough because you have little bits of oats there you won't be able to do really decorative edge so if you don't like to use outs just don't use the odds use exactly the same amount of flour instead because if you try to do a decorative edge by with folding an or of all those different techniques it will start tearing up alright so now that you are happy with this we have to chill this again for about 20 minutes I'm gonna line it with parchment paper and then we can put dry beans if you have pie weights you can also use those I don't have pie weights and then you have to bake this for 15 minutes after 15 minutes you can take it out carefully remove the beans and we are gonna continue baking this for additional 15 minutes make sure you cover the edges either with aluminium foil foil or with a tool like I have here once baked slutted be until you make the filling for the filling I'm gonna be using apple cider reduction that I cooked down from 3 cups of apple cider until I had about 1/2 cup of apple cider reduction then we're gonna use eggs granulated sugar cinnamon a little bit of salt and also sour cream for the filling I'm using 3/4 of a cup of sugar and then reserving quarter cup for the topping and once your filling is smooth you can put it into your prepared pie shell and make sure you cover the edges again to prevent burning and then you have to bake this for about 3540 minutes until the edges are set and center is slightly jiggly and then you just have to let it cool completely and then we can prepare the topping for the topping I'm using heavy cream you can also use whipping cream granulated sugar granulated gelatine and cold water I'm using gelatine to stabilize the heavy cream I find this to be really useful especially when I want to make heavy cream whipped heavy cream day or two ahead so now you just have to let it bloom and then you can microwave the boom gelatine for about three to five seconds make sure that you're ready to cool a little bit before you add it to heavy cream you want to add dissolve gelatine into heavy cream once the soft peaks are forming and then you can also add granulated sugar beat the heavy cream until you have stiff peaks formed and then you can use a small spatula and spread this on your cooled pie makes sure that your pie is cool before you add the topping you can also dust some cinnamon on top or cocoa powder or sprinkle some chocolate chips on top that would be lovely too and now let's have a look inside here we go and this is what apple cider cream pie looks like I hope

move and progress and do more and more stuff ourselves and they have more stuff setting on our shelves that we reduced such as our beautiful lard yes and let me tell you what is there anything that makes better apple pie crust than homemade lard no is this is the best crust I've ever made what is it that makes it I mean what's the what every note is different it was just it came together better and it wasn't crumbly it was perfect and it tastes delicious we got our own honey yeah which we're gonna add to the apple pie this time of year we're thinking about apples we were looking for ideas

forth fall is upon us don't you love fall I do I love that beautiful I love cooking in the fall yeah we can bake and not have to worry about eating house up and our bees have been very busy I've been watching them come and go they've been packing stuff in everyday where it's fairly warm they're still packing stuff in a little while we're gonna check in with Alan the bee dude and see what he's got going on we're gonna take a look at our bees see what they're doing because I like my honey I know you do so much stuff music I have it everyday in my coffee local money yeah that's pretty local when it's you know 50 yards from the house alright what's the next part mrs. farmer alright this is what she really didn't measure and I always like well how much of that how much of that she would put and I believe about a half a cup of flour mm-hmm now back in the day that's all they did was cook all day long and they didn't measure they just made stuff they've done it I mean he didn't go to store and buy pies he made by honey pies everybody saves yeah think of the past yeah sugar what's a minute what do you think about a quarter of a cup server probably that was exactly a quarter of a quarter of a cup all right got a little bit salt that's all the salt in everything maybe 1/2 teaspoon couple shakes allspice gotta put some allspice in let's pray I know so much allspice reason what is it now I think what's going on it is about half a teaspoon oh that's right she didn't measure it can't measure gotta use your hands when you're grandma what's this cinnamon 'cimmanon yes all right if you want to stir that around all right okay some people just throw their apples in and throw this mixture on top and I kind of like it mix it mm-hmm all right now we're gonna get our special chopper that I love about this you know that's the great thing about the stuff that we used to look for it antique places or flea markets then I used to ignore now we look for the old kitchen stuff it's the best thing ever know how much that's about a half a cup of it so this was her deal she like pecans in her this is something little like sure to put in there something different give it a little then we took it one step further you know how when you have in the fall we eat more oatmeal and you put it on certain reasons and things like that I start thinking why not raisins and why not honey yeah I didn't do any motor scratch pieces even though I was thought about it that wouldn't have heard anything with it I like your raisin idea in your honey how about we stick with it you know it probably won't be good I don't know I love my butterscotch pieces alright this is your secret ingredient which i think is gonna be wonderful we're gonna put those apples and raisins now if you don't like raisins wee wees is my sister's college wheeze I think that's well mixed I do too hi Jeff how good a job you did really good you're great you did an 1100 good mixer I know I know we got to make pie dough and stuff and finish it out all right at a loss to let's clean this up before we go to the next step Allan's coming over to checking my fall honey situation now obviously the bees have to have enough to get them through the winter ma'am but if they have enough on that top box there's nothing there for us we'll take that yeah would you take some fall so we leave some for the bees and we get some for us yes let's check with Al and see how our bees doing bedewed gone but what's going on hey you know what it is it's Paul look at the leaves during that time you know this this spring you came in and we slung some honey beautiful white come but I'm sitting up there at the cabin II of the day and I saw somebody your honey there's a little bit darker mm-hm what a beautiful flavor it's different from the story it's a different flavor the following yes it's a bit stronger flavor to it you know but it's but it has its own beauty mm-hm now here's what I've got I've got spring allergies and I've got fall allergies you know me mister outdoor dude sneezing my guts out and when it comes around I found that this year I've been eating a lot of honey and I don't know if it's just me imagined things but seems to me like this is my easiest year so far there's a lot of people that that but it's really by the hunt for it's for their allergies yeah so whether it works and I don't know whether it's a mind game but I mean it's it's not too long ago got a stomach ache well actually I got food poisoning so the next day you know how your starting to feel better but you feeling kind of queasy I read somewhere take a tablespoon of honey and I am not kidding you I took a tablespoon of that honey that we slow and just took it straight down and within three or four minutes I felt completely I didn't have one more twang of nausea I've never heard of that mm-hmm now you know these guys I'm not gonna pretend like I'm an expert that's why I have you on I like to talk to folks who know no I'm not an expert but compared to me you are like the king of the bees alright so what I'm thinking is is I'm kind of greedy but I'm thinking is there any more honey in there for me but they obviously have to make it through the winter how do you judge that and look at this hat and say well what we'll do is uh when I open it up I look in there that top box should be full of honey if you're lucky the super Ruby both top boxes as long as they get honey in that top box you know you can pull that super no problem at all even if there's not a lot in there you can still pull that super just start feeding them just start feeding them and they'll put that's what a lot of people do once they pull then I'll start feeding like a two-to-one mix mm-hmm sugar water and feed the bees up and they'll build that up in that patch them through the winter it being fall being October what's happening technically inside the hive or the bees doing different careful winter well the the Queen true start she's starting to should start slowing down on her lane producing you know a little bit less brood in there and of course all the drones should be gone but now all the male bees they're all kicked out they kick them out and basically the bee should just be bringing in starting to make stores for the winter and stuff now from an outsider and from a long time ago I would say beehive and thought man you couldn't go in there you know you can't get a 150 feet that's the typical apostles here we are standing next to this hive which has been a very very manageable hobbit this was oh I can write a lot longer right yeah yeah this is a great high no no never you know you're seeing it now next week and maybe a little bit different for a moment well just in case I am going to stand over here with my EpiPen aimed right at my neck and now watching you do what you do a little bit by your watch filled up pretty good well they tried to do build more on their yeah they're sealing it up they don't want any air to come through there so the bees will actually go in anywhere there's a little draught or anything like that I think that's what they call this populist basically it's just wax and seal it up just like glue right there that pro kleh stuff that plenty of bees working up in here they have them capped off which means honey pull this middle and out just take a look at it wow dude you are golden I'm loaded every one of them's just like this no kid you can't ask for a frame you're looking better than that though so that's exactly this is what you kept up here ready to go mm-hmm it's really light - it's gonna be darker than the spring thing us but no I got some fun behind me of it yes awesomeness right there so the next time around is slinging again huh mm-hmm we're gonna get this off here and get it taken care act's me happy thank you be dude not a problem what's next research for me let's make us some awesome pie dough alright now I keep it mustn't this is large this is just isn't any lard this is our Lauren look at this smell that look at that look at that we rendered this down smells good fairly quickly and we still got that light of color look at that look at how many SKUs you look but three that is not anyway processed bleached that's just pure Laurel I do that and then let's put some sugar in there oh yeah just a little just a little hit there okay I'm gonna do about a cup and a half of flour in this I think that's gonna get us as our pie shell our pea plates actually kind of little it's all shouldn't even eyes I was always fascinated by this part okay so and this lard is so wonderful I mean it's not chunky and see I was just mixing right in the snow that's the best consistency yes does it make a difference put a little water in there for me if you would okay say we want to keep adding a little bit okay a little bit more okay then it might be good instead of looking at the amount of water that we're not measuring look at the consistency right but the dough like you like it I don't like the texture of this dough it's really good alright we're gonna break it in half because I'm gonna use half for the bottom and then we'll need have for the top later inches I'm telling you this lard makes the ambassador and I ever doesn't break it doesn't crumble I've never had dough work this good it's almost like I bought it at the store it's so perfect you know now they're saying lard in his purest form it's hard healthy omega-3 type stuff you're just so good and so easily done beautiful no nice here's a guy have more sugar Oh sugar it's pie I'd like to sugar up the it's a pie it's a pie that's right no I'll take this wonderful make sure we made now this may seem simple you may say okay they'll just make an apple pie but you know what this isn't any apple pie this is grandma's song with a twist she would loved she too loved your twist okay now before you put your special ingredient I'm gonna do what she used to do she took a whole lemon I love these yes cuz it gets rid of the seeds it's all over I have lemon juice in there gives us little target yeah did she take a half a stick of water this good for you oh yeah we're not telling you this the only way can be done this is just the way we read we're not saying this is the only way because there is no only way you can do it 18,000 different ways this is just our way we're following the instincts that we have when it comes to cooking you know it's good with butter honey oh and use the eye to just stuck it in like this with more sugar but I like I like your idea don't hold that now how could this hurt does it make it good we're gonna use fresh honey Oh that'll be terribly that surely won't be any good what quarter of a cup at least I think you did more man time stop yeah here going to run your finger across if it was too good to waste mmm YUM Wow now I just need to make a top let's cover this baby up and cook it right he smells good I'm telling you the lard and if you want to have fun in your backyard you can go to your butcher and ask for pork trimmings or pork fat you can render your own Lord look back on our recipe of rendering lard it's not really a recipe but in the process you can have it in your own kitchen so good it's gonna make some air holes here that's beautiful and another last thing that she used to do you wanna make me top look pretty she'd take a little bit width and cream I maybe have not even a tablespoon here we're gonna add just the egg white and she always put this on the top some people just put egg white some people have their own plate gives it a nice glaze oh she did with cream so I'm just gonna use my hands you can use a little brush of your honor just kind of move this around on there give me how much room is it got wait an hour and that's what she put on her pies and I think maybe sprinkle wait to be delivered yeah a little more sugar on top just in case all right we don't know awful and we're ready to put this in the oven now I have an idea while that's baking we got a little bit of time to talk to Alan and again show the process of slinging what you have to do to get your own hoodie right here in a cabin yeah we got to clean this up first for bringing these stuff in I mean a program I'm so excited we got spring honey earlier I think 17 jars I think I'm 17 17 punches are in the book and now you said we might even get more get more get more out of this one now they're packing stuff in today okay it's October mm-hmm what do you think they're hit probably some goldenrod left be a stir you know that's what I'm gonna assume that they're hitting right now no I'm gonna say no more get out of the way tell me basically what you're gonna do you pull this off I'm gonna pull it super off then what I'll do is take a brush the bees off the frames and separate them out and keep a cover on it and then we'll take them in there and yeah they say they've got plenty that's what I'm looking on pulling these every frame below here let's pull that shocking back yes sir now you know what every time I see you I notice you've got a little different setup you've kind of adapted to doing so it's just something you came up with now this is something that I actually bought and this is a call a capping box that is and basically just it's something for you put your cappings in so it can drain and you know you can save the honey out of it and this may seem redundant but this is this is spring honey look how light and clear that is so I can't wait to do a taste test that against the fall honey yeah but I already smell the difference I mean it's gonna be a different flavor yeah The Fault the fall honey's a little bit uh it's got a stronger taste to it just working it back and forth and just cook the cap well this man that's coming out of there come in just rake this up now you say that you don't really want to go too fast right no slowly okay you'll start seeing the honey sling on the sides is that too fast or that right go faster than that ask for that like a circus ride yes we're starting to swing now it's just pretty good speed right there then we'll take this and set it out there somewhere close to your bees leaning up against the tree and then I'll come in and I'll clean up a bit this sound take you back in the half of them just a strainer it's almost like cheesecloth yeah just strange there are different grades you know it starts off a little bit coarse strainer and keeps getting finer and finer I've got three a minute at two four and six hundred mesh in there I'm gonna hold this up next to that color as it comes up sniffing tell a difference little bit darker that's still light for fall honey yeah or so yeah I've seen it I'm seeing some color now you want ease it up comes slow gonna cap that off slide another one under here it's already gone through what two filters three years actually three filters in there yeah look at that I can be dude percent down see you shortly it's not like heaven yes it does apple pie it's ready all right let's get that out Oh perfect well I was taking pictures and put them on our recent Brown country kitchen Facebook page the other day now as if the house could smell any more fallish or Apple II this right here smells like potpourri when it's cooking Kentucky orchard Evans orchard makes this thing and we're gonna start off with a court that is 4 cups in Bangladesh and there's about a quart okay this is just a little reminder it is fall let's put about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar light or dark it doesn't matter we're gonna put some cinnamon sticks 3/4 teaspoon okay this is a spice and let's go half on the nothing okay all right now what do we end up with oh I don't know was this more your honey more fall honey I'd say let's go 2 tablespoons fall honey turtlenecks hmm call an old shirts apple pie I'm scooting this over here al careful you please kept a piece of that I'm telling you what that is the perfect crust

apple pie sangria if you're entertaining a crowd this fall Thanksgiving Christmas this apple pie sangria is a must make I first made the sangria back in 2013 it was one of the first recipes I ever posted on the cookie and it instantly went crazy even though I barely had any audience at all it's just that popular and that good it's so delicious we're gonna use caramel vodka white wine apple cider ginger ale and a lot of fruit and cinnamon you are gonna love it so let's get started I've already chopped a lot of apples and pears but we're gonna add a little bit more to our group and then we are gonna add it all to the pitcher I love a lot of fruit in this sangria because we're gonna let it sit typically overnight so that it'll marinate in all the juices and get extra tasty you don't have to do that but I think it tastes extra delicious that way [Music] I love the flavor that pear adds to the sangria it's a little bit different it's so fall it's really delicious okay once you have all your fruit chopped I'm gonna put a lot of it in the picture I'm having the recipe today because my pictures not as big as what I would normally use for serving your crowd but we like a lot of fruit in the sangria our next ingredient is apple cider you can use fresh apple cider if you have it or store-bought whatever you like next we're gonna add white wine I like a sweet white wine but you can use a table white a Chardonnay Pinot Grigio whatever your favorite white wine is is probably what you're gonna like most in the sangria [Music] next we're gonna add caramel vodka you can use apple pie vodka and I actually have a great homemade recipe on the cookie rocky or caramel vodka I like caramel because it makes me think of a caramel drizzle apple pie and I just think it adds a really nice depth of flavor to the sangria and if you're making a full version use one cup of the caramel vodka we're just going to use half a cup today we're not doing the full recipe top with cinnamon sticks and we're going to let this chill in the fridge for about an hour before we serve everything's been chillin for about an hour and you can just smell the apples and cinnamon and we are ready to serve I love to top with a little bit of ginger ale it adds a nice zip a little bit of carbonation and that ginger flavor that's perfect with apples this is fall in a pitcher you're gonna love it pour over ice and sir head over to the cookie Ricky calm for the full recipe [Music]", "k3HrNV9SHow": "hi today on City sitting I'm going to teach you how to make a super simple slicer or Apple mean however you'd like to know it has okay so the idea is I'm going to teach you how to make a super simple slicer which is actually just another name for meand and apple cider mixed together meat is honey wine we've all heard of that right you know think Viking or Egyptians actually it's been around for thousands and thousands of years probably the oldest fermented drink made it's also really awesome so today I'm gonna show you how to do it I'm gonna do it in less than let's say five minutes so what you need to do is get yourself some apple juice now you can use fresh pressed apple juice you can go and get the apples and all that kind of thing you'll want to pasteurize that though which means bring it to a boil or almost a boil hundred eighty degrees for about ten minutes or so let that cool then you can start putting this together you want it to be at room temperature when you work on it though otherwise you're gonna kill your yeast okay you're gonna need some apple juice mine has a lot of interesting ingredients here it literally says apple juice that's it no other ingredients if you see like sodium benzoate or sorbate or anything like that don't use that stuff there's plenty of plenty of good ciders and apple juices in the grocery store don't worry about it concentrate actually works too you can totally use concentrate you're going to need something to put it in I use a one gallon carboys this one has some water in formed that would be sanitary water because i sanitized everything a tube for measuring it's actually optional but it's nice to know how much alcohol you're making right a funnel just to make pouring easier you will want an airlock they come in a couple different styles and they cost about three bucks sure people will say you can use a balloon with a hole or just leave the lid loose it's three bucks spend the three bucks it's worth it anyway I'm gonna put that to the side for the moment what I also did is I poured out a little bit the apple juice into a cup and I added about a teaspoon of the east I'm actually using dance Tarbell sazon East today and I'm gonna use just a little bit of yeast nutrient - this is just one that I got from the local winemaker store no big deal what yeast nutrient does is it helps the East kind of get going um since this is a Mead and uses honey which I haven't shown you yet I have it warming here is the honey I'm gonna use two pounds of honey roughly some of it's gonna be left in the bottle I'm sure now you have to dilute the honey if you don't it will not ever start a fermentation okay so you wanted to use honey and apple juice I'm not gonna add any sugar I'm not gonna add any water that's it so let's just get started I'm gonna put funnel in there I'm gonna open the lid on the on the honey and just dump it in now this may take a minute or five so we may pause the video while I while I pour this in and we're back I'm still pouring honey as you can see it takes a little while and that's why you heat it up if you look in this bottle see it's just about empty it's gonna take a little bit more so I'm gonna show you a little trick probably not that big of a deal but you take some of the apple juice just pour it right into this bottle and shake it up sometimes it takes two or three times doing another word about the honey it really doesn't matter what kind of use but you do want to use prettier real honey you don't want the cheapest thing you can find this is a raw unfiltered wildflower honey I'm not gonna believe it's unfiltered because there was no little bits and pieces in there so it's probably just your basic honey that's been slightly filtered which is a good thing you want something that has some flavors something that's good but not too too crazy expensive otherwise honey can get very expensive and fawn has come in to that's the squeaking you're hearing one of our cats yeah anyway so after that I'm gonna put in apple juice which if you're in the United States this is cider because it's cloudy if you're in any other country this is juice or cloudy juice don't ask okay once you get to about this point you'll realize when you look at this that there is a pile of honey on the bottom and apple cider on top if you know anything about honey you know that it doesn't really like to mix with things very well so we have ways of making it makes I take the bung which is what this is some people call it a cork but technically it's a bung and this one has a hole in it stick my thumb in there and shake the crap out of it for a really long time you want to make sure this is completely mixed through so and this is after a few minutes of shaking check the bottom I don't see any extra honey in there you want to make sure it's pure it's really really mixed up well I'll just set that back down wipe off my hands stick the phone gotta pull this out first let's take the final back in and pour in the rest of the juice now I'm gonna leave just a little bit of room at the top here because I do have the yeast to go in and you want to leave a little bit of headroom because sometimes things like to expand and they go up into the airlock and make a mess and it's not pretty ruined a couple pairs of shoes that way yes I keep some of these in my closet that's about it the rest of its in here drink it good stuff okay now that I have that done I am going to put in actually hold the phone I'm going to take a measurement right now what they call gravity and this way we know how much sugars is actually in this mixture so that we can figure out about how much alcohol we're gonna produce at the end so for the moment I'm going to pull out the phone and get out my measuring system here fill this up you get to watch me spill this all over the place [Music] now when you do this only go about that high I'm gonna put this so you can still see things get out hydrometer if you don't know what this is it's basically I graduated too with the weight in the bottom and it has a bunch of markings on it and one of them is specific gravity what that does is it measures the heaviness or thickness of the of the liquid the more sugar that's in it the higher the amount of alcohol that will actually be produced so we are looking at wrong scale let's try the right scale came out at 1090 which is actually pretty good one point zero nine zero what that means is that's that much heavier than more as the alcohol is produced in the sugars are eaten up it gets lighter and lighter and lighter so we take another reading when it's done fermenting and from that there's a complex calculation I use it and I can figure out how much alcohol is in my sizer I'm just gonna pour this right back in because all this was sanitized ahead of time it helps to have steady hands when you do these things okay now that's done that's essentially everything you need except yeast and the nutrient the nutrient is optional I didn't really start using it until recently and I'm still kind of playing with the idea so I'm just gonna pour this in here now again all this is is a little bit of the apple juice with yeast put in to hydrate you'll hear things called starters and I messed that up I didn't get all my nice tin there but I don't really stir just gonna have to multiply you'll hear it about things called starters that's something else this is literally just hydration so I put the stopper in for another second so I can shake this up a bit and there you have since my stoppers already in can take my airlock stick it right in there and what that does is it makes a seal the airlock keeps things from getting in okay this is gonna produce co2 gas as it as it ferments and that's gonna expand it's gonna want to push if you put just a cap on here it'll explode I guarantee you I'm not teaching you how to make a bomb but with an airlock what happens is the water go the air goes up co2 goes up and hits this water if then it bubbles through and comes out but nothing can get back in bugs really like to try to climb in these every once in a while you'll see one in your airlock this is just sanitized water in here they're not getting in it's not gonna hurt anything if it really bothers you dump it out refill it and do it again I'm gonna put this in a cool ish place about 70 degrees or so my closet probably for about two weeks after about two weeks this should be done fermenting but I should start seeing action 3-4 hours as usual for this house I also forgot to put in the East nature so while I'm doing that I'm gonna talk to you a little bit more just because I can't seem to shut up so the East no dream helps it along but what we want to see is a little bit of action in about 24 hours if you don't see anything happen within 24 to 48 hours you might want to add a little bit more use just a pinch you know just you don't want to add a lot just a little bit and of course now that I've done that I have to shake it all up again and all that good stuff I'm just gonna swirl up there we have it super super simple sizer not much else to it once it's done I'm gonna make another video and we'll show a bottling and a tasting and a racking and all that kind of stuff so stay tuned you'll see part 2 of this video thanks don't forget if you like what I did or you have questions or you have something to say about it leave a comment down

you", "_Sa9W8ytO8E": "[Music] [Music] well welcome back to barley and hops on george yes the channel that dares to unlock all the mysteries of home distilling we're here today and we're going to make some apple pie moonshine now apple pie moonshine is a staple of the united states we know what's known throughout the world but it's kind of heritage and its origination is deep in the woods and many many people many many cultures and throughout the united states want to claim its originality doesn't really matter we know how to make that okay so here it goes um apple pie moonshine is a mixture um and it tends to lend itself to the season being autumn the thanksgiving christmas season because it makes great gifts you know they ought to have a label on the outside you know that fda warning label you know it has a tendency to cause you to lose control the english language makes you suave and sexy all at one time drink in excess could cause premature sleep it should have all those warnings i would just say be cautious beware it's really good and it does have a lot of effects [ __ ] well welcome back to barley and hops yep i'm george the channel that dares to unlock the mysteries of home distilling we say that all the time if you haven't had an opportunity yet please subscribe share us with your friends and of course comment below now we're here today uh to make an apple pie moonshine first of all you have to start off with moonshine that's that's a given okay so you're not going to just create apple pie moonshine uh you've got to start off with a product uh i recommend it we'll get to it but i recommend the highest proof that you could produce uh and there's a reason for that but we'll get to it okay it's not it it's critical it's not critical but it's important um now an apple pie moonshine is really a mixture a concoction that has developed over generations and many different generations claim the original the originality of apple pie moonshine but we know that it's universal throughout the united states and well known throughout the world of course now you have really two basic styles um there are many many different offshoots but two basic styles there will be the clear and then it would be the murky and the difference between the two is the base product of being the apple cider wow before we even do that let's just get down to the ingredients now this is my recipe that i've made several different times and i tend i like it it's mine just like you will enjoy yours however you make it now there are several different ways to do this to me this is a little bit more in depth i think but this is a basic recipe that we use here in the backwoods of the shop ha now fair warning this stuff should once you get it mixed and you do and you do offer it to someone it should come with that you know that fda warning label that they have on like medication and stuff like that that a couple drinks of this could potentially cause you to lose control of the english language it has that tendency or to make you suave and sexy all the same time you never really know um here we have we have apple cider i've got another jar of apple cider and i'll show you the differences of those we got some apple juice i've got clove whole clove some brown sugar some white sugar and of course some star nice and then last but not least we know cinnamon sticks now the the basic premise for an apple pie moonshine kind of lends itself to the fall season into the thanksgiving christmas holidays and that type of environment or that type of period that because it is really really a good drink could be drank warm or cold i tend to like it cold but some do like it warm and that's quite all right now uh they make great christmas gifts oh by the way um the difference between apple cider and apple juice to start with okay an apple cider is made by washed crushed apples that are placed together into like a big bag and then squeezed it and all the juice comes out and that's known as the apple cider all right whereas an apple juice is a product of the apples that has been filtered and pasteurized and that's why it comes out a whole lot cleaner all right uh your apple ciders have more of the tartish apple flavor and it's really hard to describe flavors but you'll find that an apple cider will have just a little bit more of that tweaking tartiness of an apple but a full body of flavor as opposed to an apple juice which just has the whole body of flavor of an apple and a lot of times minus that little bit of tartness that you kind of look forward to in a size okay now your mixture ratios can be totally up to you i i have a recommendation and it's normally about 50 50. but i normally go a little bit higher on the apple cider than i do the juice because i'm more of a fan of the little bit of tartiness now we also have a clearer apple cider which has also been primaries filtered so none of the pulp is available so you have those two different styles you'll have the clear and you have the murky whichever one you make is going to be perfectly okay all right i tend to make both of them because i know of different people who have different desires it's just that simple okay um in order to get this thing started what i'm gonna do you're gonna need a heat source you're gonna need some sort of a whisk to do some mixing uh and you're gonna need some pots all right uh so i've got two pots here and i've got my new wave cooktop you know that i use this on a regular basis i've done a lot of different things out here in the shop this really comes in handy this is a um a magnetic it's an induction cooker okay so it only works with a magnetic pot that you know an iron skillet or or a pot that has been designed with a magnetic base how do we know it's got a magnetic base well i use a magnet so if you go down to the store to get one of these make sure you get one that when you turn the up on the bottom a magnet sticks to it if a magnet sticks to it then it's going to work on this cooktop as opposed to this one i have which looks exactly the same only different it's not magnetic oh so what you'll have is and i want to show you this real quick because this this has come up a couple of times and people have asked the question well what happens if i have a pot that's not magnetic and i've got an induction cooktop can i still use that well the answer to that is yes not the most optimal way of doing it but yes this will work and that is find a small piece of mild steel that's also magnetic and i did i cut a circle out of this and you place that on top of your magnetic cooktop and then you place your pot on top of that that will work here's a demonstration if i turn on there you notice it doesn't make any noise you won't hear anything because it won't come on unless there's something magnetic on it nothing it won't do anything and if i try to start it it says e1 it's an error there's an error code it doesn't have anything magnetic on it but if i place this yep there you hear it it comes on automatically as soon as i place something that's magnetic and that's hot already yes that quick so if you place something magnetic on there it'll automatically get hot i also use a pizza pan this pizza pan is also magnetic i cut some holes in it place that on there and then place your pot on top of it now what happens to this spacer that you place in here well as it gets hot it starts to torque a bit you know bend and twist i cut holes to try to reduce that but if you've got enough weight in here with liquid it'll hold that down so you've got a constant contact so the efficiency of the heat transfer may not be 100 but it should get you through that rough spell now aside from that i've got this one which works extremely well all right so here we go the first thing we're going to do is we're going to add our i'll tell you what i'll do i'm going to add the juices and we'll be right back okay i now i've added i've added all two quarts of my apple cider itself and i've added about a quart and a half of the apple juice and the reason for that is i like i'm more on the apple cider side of the flavor profile as opposed to the apple juice but that's totally up to you the next thing i'm going to add is two cups of brown sugar and the two cups of brown sugar go right into the mixture and i've got the i've got this thing turned on already and i've already got a pre-measured one cup of white sugar now could i have used three pounds of or three cups of brown sugar absolutely i could have what i want is i want that this is just my recipe okay so i use one cup of white sugar and white sugar is sort of like a more clean sugar profile as opposed to the brown sugar oh then we give that a mix and what we're going to do is we're going to heat this up to almost a boil just short of a boil and we're going to allow that to simmer for an hour and the reason we'll allow that to simmer for an hour because what we're trying to do there is we want to extract as much of the flavors as we can from yes oh there we go now i'm going to drop in clove okay these are whole cloves there's two there's four 6 8 there 10 cloves now the clove the profile the flavor profile of a clove is a little bit more astringent and sweet there's a sweetness to them but they'll kind of give you that mouth feel that kind of give you that little bit of a numbing in your mouth but very very slight you don't want to overdo that i will drop in two star anise now what does this start the the flavor profile of a star anise is close to a licorice um now if you really really like the licorice flavor you can add more but i'd be cautious because they are very powerful and uh two of these are plenty uh because i don't want that licorice flavor to overpower anything else i just kind of want it there hidden in the background and then last but not least we're gonna add one and come out of there use two i'm add five of these three four five liquor sticks on cinnamon sticks um now at the end of this process when you taste it because what you're going to do is you're going to taste it for flavor for its flavor profile you can add more cinnamon or you can add more juice to lighten it up just a little bit but we want to get a really concentrated apple cinnamon star anise and clove flavor in order to mix into our spirit back shortly but you can see this oh this is see just give it a stir every now and then we're trying to do is make sure all those sugars liquefy but you'll see my cinnamon sticks floating there's or some star nice uh you'll see a couple of the clothes floating around but this gives off an aroma the wife loves it when i make this because it just makes the whole house smell oh festive uh it really really has a nice aroma so we're going to bring that to just about a boil and we're going to allow that to sit and simmer for an hour well you see here i've got it set to 215 and 215 is just slightly above the boiling point for water but remember we added sugar and what does sugar do to water it increases the boiling point so i've just got this really minor simmering action going on you don't want to over boil it because it will boil over so keep it here for an hour so we're gonna allow that to continue to simmer uh and we'll be right back now while we're waiting for that to mature and do its thing it smells wonderful in here the aroma is just so pleasant uh i've got just something to show you here and here this is we go back to that i said use the highest level of alcohol you possibly can or that you have that's clean and i'm going to use what i have is i have a quart of 96 percent alcohol and that is actually 192 proof now according to the app that you know you can get the app i'll drop it into the link uh into the description tab uh but you can it'll you'll download it directly to your phone um if i use the app the app tells me that what i need in order to drop this down to an 80 proof apple pie moonshine that i'll need 0.42 quarts of moonshine at 192 proof and then 0.58 that's 0.42 and then 0.58 of my apple pie mixture all right and that'll give me a blend and bring it down to 80 proof now here's what's important about that let's say for instance remember as the proof drops as your proof drops then you're going to use less of your mixture cool let's say for instance you have 150 proof or 75 alcohol now in this case it actually almost reverses itself because now you need what like point five two point five two um quarts of [Music] moonshine right and 0.48 quarts of your mixture so what you have now is you have you're diluting the mixture itself and it's not going to be as strong or as noticeable as it would be if you're using a higher proof and of course this even this gets even worse of course i mean if you do 120 proof well then your result here now is almost 0.75 of your spirit and about point 25 about a quarter quart of uh your your actual mixture itself so you can see how that gets progressively worse and worse as you go down the line and your proof drops that is the initial proof and all of these are in order to achieve 80 proof now what can you do you can do a couple of different things okay you can either rerun your distillate and try to get a pure more pure distillate at a higher proof okay that's one thing you can do the other thing you can do is you can drop the proof of your final product just a little bit say for instance okay let's say friends we want to drop this to 70 proof and if we drop that to 70 proof we of course we don't have a as strong of a mixture but it's a little bit more sociable okay remember we don't drink apple pie moonshine to get drunk uh it's supposed to be a social event oh something that's it's pleasing you can you follow me and if we do that then this actually drops to 0.36 quarts and then this goes up to 0.64 quarts so now our line is drawn here which in essence means that you're going to have a more flavorful a lot more flavorful lay flavorful apple pie taste and just a little bit less alcohol and you've only sacrificed 10 proof points i would submit to you a couple of 70 proofs and a couple of 80 proofs it's kind of hard to tell the difference once you lost control the english language you follow let's get back to mixing this well we are finished yep oh by the way i left the writing on if if that is new to you you need to back up the video and try to figure out kind of what that was all about um i've got three quarts here that i've made up of my apple pie moonshine ready for gifting uh you can notice that this one here i gotta add a little bit more to it because i was tasting um oh what a what see there you go yeah like i said you start to lose control of the english language um we are finished with this this is my murky and this is the one that i use with the of course the apple cider that was cloudy which was less pasteurized less filtered i've got a new batch here that i'm getting ready to make so i'll be able to make at least three more of these um in addition i've got some leftover mix here so all i've got to do now is run my still and i've got a really good potent mixture for my next apple pie moonshine gifting project yes the season is upon us and we are about to send this out to some close friends and relatives so um remember we use apple cider apple juice star anise clove cinnamon stick and then of course we use some brown sugar and some white sugar if you go back through the video you'll see the proportions of that now each and every one of those uh are adjustable it's totally up to you so um if you would just make your own and um should you decide that you want a little bit more of one thing as opposed to another you can always adjust the mixture yourself but this is how we make the apple pie moonshine you gotta love it happy distilling", "L7meLTEZeU8": "guess who's back Oh Mac again Joe where are we we are in Richmond Virginia because we have been invited by the community and by the Virginia tourists the governor of state yeah we got our wish what's making you welcome and we're starting off bad southern season finger to learn how to cook properly amazing very good for light is green sporto's let's edit they met their up was I why did you say the air conditioning explained sorry pi PI pi one of the places he recommended was to e to the proper pipe company while in Richmond Virginia so because we're lovely guys we're gonna do just that we order one that every PI we weren't allowed three Rachel's been planning up my selection three-day policy greater that case is Rachel that's why three pastry each go again is critical and watch all that right here in the middle which is you doing how they what you think well tonight is all about a meter but this might be the pushiest meetup that we've ever done the Virginia Torah sportive actually put on a proper like event first in Rappahannock which is a restaurant and a bar in Richmond and it's going to be it's impressive this is unlike any meetup we've ever done boosters Virginia wine cocktails and you guys I don't think they realize who we are he must have realized Gracie nobody's they might cancel his entire baton how many oysters were you shocked annoying well spin your records 1880 1890 no one ever caught you we're going to go on a boat and get some oysters and we're hanging out with a guy called Tom hey right I like likely why how was that that was amazing we have been wanting to film on a boat for how many years and that was not just a boat but that was just the best but in terms of the whole thing the story the food as their lifestyle is amazing they work really hard but to be able to take the boat out people who work there Laura amazing that large a dr. J what a nice way to end a coach looking yards is for Warren recent people you buy supplies mic signing something food I see there's any one way to get you speaking up it's on a kite yeah I see the halo man Moses this is what I'm eating for the next week to come to sleep we here's some more naming and dare I say it my mistake I need $40 which is pretty much remain today is our last day in Virginia and we've driven north to a farm called Potomac farm just not of Leesburg but where we are being given a guided tour of a farm who also has a restaurant and they serve all the food from the farm in the restaurant itself in a basket fine thank you this is like Ben's perfect day a chicken walking away from me what are you eating amazing prehistoric so changed Oh tell me about it and there is a an ocean that runs underneath where we are this mountain the got trapped during the prehistoric era when all the sonic booms so someone in the local areas drilled right down and now mines this sea salt which has been completely untouched by pollution and stuff like that so basically like that dinosaur I've never tasted a dinosaur there now very I don't think I've ever seen been look more home than swinging a little basket look look at the swing on that basket that is not a natural swing he's putting effort into us today is a foster swing one hand in the pocket of the red shorts yeah I think in some parts of the world they call that longevity you Vaska ask where you're leading us don't say that so here's the deal we have one recipe video left to film and we've been looking for a location to film when we're trying to find some places that are not our studio kitchen we've did some incredible stuff in Richmond at the boathouse and places like that and now we're at the Potomac farm and there's this gorgeous view overlooking the breach that takes you into Maryland but that wasn't good enough for Barry so now he's leading us down well into the woods I'm gonna have faith I'm going to George Michael all over you sometimes after a hard day's eating you just have to go and get some apple pie to finish the day off oh my God look at you that's our pine which bigger above the strawberries in the rhubarb for it right up through about 50 minutes booty slap", "itXF-exlqHk": "[Music] in this guy Ryan can just try to know you are ever side [Music] the surface okay light of you

"fzkzjJ9exb4": "hiya this is darren and monkey bar one today i'm going to do a turbo cider using the leftover bottles that i done in the last video of the laga european lager homebrew now i've topped up the lager with 23 liters of mineral water these bottles are clearly sanitized because they're containing food group so the water that was in there i only had probably only a liter or so left so um that's gone i'm gonna use this bottle to make some turbo cider now because i don't need to sanitize it which is great we can just go ahead and add our cider this is a tesco's apple juice it's um not from concentrate but it does have ascorbic acid in it now um i believe that's there to prevent it from um fermenting but hopefully we'll counteract that um by adding a little more sugar so what we'll do is get this in there we're going to make a ribena cider and the ribeena it's got plenty of sugars in it it smells nice now i'm not planning on adding any more sugars i'm just going to allow the sugars in the apple juice and the ribena to do its job now the water bottle was five liters and the apple juice is apple juice is a liter each that's four of those that have gone in oh yeah do you know i haven't had rybina since i was a kid so i'm gonna put in probably a third of this probably down to this band we take these bands there's a third can't see anything the labels in the way oh really there we go okay oh yes color looks pretty good doesn't it give a shake first where is it okay so i'm just gonna put a teaspoon teaspoon of yeast now this is so this is all supermarket um materials nothing from a brew shop shop anyway so the apple juice from tesco's the ribena from tescos and i'm using allison's yeast dry active it's for bread it works might not give you the best results it might taste a bit yeasty by the time that you get to drink it but this is a cheap way of making some jail basically it's uh it's the easiest and quickest way no i didn't want to stick the spoon in there because it was wet but i've ended up with sticky yeast mess in that jar so then goes the yeast so give it a shake make sure it's all mixed up we're going to take a gravity reading so we can get an idea of what our turbo cider hooch prison hooch whatever you want to call it um cheap plonk see what that comes out keep the lid on it stop any dirt there's plenty of sugar in here this is going to be an interesting brew so a hydrometer is basically uh or looks very similar to efficient flow and then this has got numbers down the shaft of it which is a gradient of the sugar content that you have in your liquid the more sugar the higher it floats less sugar the lower it goes so you would expect water having absolutely nothing in it would be down below the mark can probably have to turn it upside down to get it out on mine i have red yellow and green uh indicators gives you a visual indicator to how your brew is going um and they run from 1.0 i think we've got 20 1.120 at the bottom all the way up to what we've got going on here so that's um [Music] 0.9986 is the lowest and we're currently sitting and it bobs around and i got some really fine bubbles sitting around the number but let's take a rough guess of what we're looking at here 1.62 1.62 so we know what our starting gravity is now the yeast will do its job in starting to ferment the yeast eats the sugar that's in the liquid the sugar gets ingested and pooed out the back end of your yeast and that poo becomes your alcohol and the more sugar the more alcohol and by the start of this looks like we've got an absolute load of sugar so we could have something that will blow your socks off or for about four pounds so now obviously i've gone and bought this and the yeast but you know a lot of people have those sort of ingredients in the cupboard so you could end up just buying sell some apple juice so yeast is in giving it a shake now doing this on the cheap so that you could use [Music] a bubbler drill a hole put a grommet in there and stand it in there or a balloon i actually see people use condoms strangely each to their own i suppose this one looked bad enough but so i've stuck it in the sanitizing liquid so i'm not it's slippery and sweat as an octopus all right there we go we're on all right i'm happy with that and that's what will happen it will expand and inflate i can burp it so the head room here is vital so that you don't overfill because the yeast will um get active and causes the co2 to build up and it'll froth up and that froth will end up if it's too full obviously coming out or going into your bubbler if you've got a bubbler here um it'll over over spill so you need headroom to allow the co2 to expand and not allow your liquid to disappear out the top so you'll find that that will expand i can burp it because it's co2 the oxygen won't get into your drink and make it go off the co2 is heavier than oxygen so it will sit in there the oxygen will sit outside you could leave that off and let the yeast do its own thing the only reason that you have a sealed cap of some sort is to prevent insects and dirt and dust going in there the co2 that that's generated by the yeast will ensure that the oxygen doesn't get to it but it can't obviously prevent any solid mass matter so um so that's the only reason that you have a bubbler to stop any ingress of dirt the co2 will keep the oxygen out so we'll put that somewhere warm ideally again center of the house somewhere in the area cupboard somewhere nice and warm for the next this will probably only take three to five days maybe five days max before it sort of achieves what it's trying to do okay let's get that moved and we'll see you in the next video when we give it a try and see what it's like thanks for watching i'm darren this is monkey bar one please like and subscribe and if you're interested take a look at the patreon page and if you're willing to contribute then i'm truly grateful so take care i'll see you soon", "1TFfPep20FI": "[Music] welcome back everyone got a holiday treat here we make every year and i've already got a video on it but we're going to make it again and just slightly different with a different alcohol before we're gonna make uh apple pie moonshine but this time we're not using moonshine we're gonna use just grain alcohol which is that we have ever clear 151 so we're going to break this down to drinkable levels and we're going to season this up so let's get to this rebecca's going to call off my you need one gallon of apple cider or 100 apple juice we have some apple cider i have to shake this stuff so this is a half a gallon so i have two of them make sure you have a big enough stock car you want to save your jugs it smells aptly remember the better quality ingredients you use the better quality your final product is going to be two cups of brown sugar packed we have you can use dark brown or light brown either one i have basically have a mixture of both so we're going to try to get this in here without splattering it everywhere one cup of white sugar granulated white sugar one cup now onto the spices three cinnamon sticks or a half a tablespoon of ground you can use however cinnamon you want but three it seems to be good for us and you can also stick these in the jar when they're finished making you can even put an apple wedge in there if you slow the climb we don't do that a half a teaspoon of ground allspice it's part of the nutmeg family has a nice smell actually smells a little bit like close speaking of clothes we're going to put three whole cloves in there if you heard me say this before you have to be careful with these cloves you don't want to use a whole lot i messed up some homemade beer that way they're very potent these two were small so we're actually basically putting three in but they were small okay and a half a teaspoon of ground ginger now we're gonna do our wet ingredients one teaspoon of butter flavor this is imitation butter flavor rebecca will tell you where we get this rebecca will tell you where to find this stuff i bought this at walmart they also sell it at hobby shops that sell baking supplies like michael's and i think hobby lobby that'll help give it that crust flavor you're looking for that buttery crust flavor so good and a teaspoon of vanilla vanilla extract you can use a moles in any type whatever you have but this is i'm gonna put two because this is some one and a half i'm gonna put one and a half all right we're going to take a whip and you want to turn this on until you get a bring it to a boil reduce it down to a simmer and you just want to let this cook and cook down to about half anywhere quarter to a half but you want to make sure you don't burn the sugar on bottom so you want to make sure it gets good and dissolved with the heat so we're going to keep on that so while all this is cooking down it's going to take a little while you can go do other stuff once you get the sugar melted and you get this reduced at least a quarter and a half that way it'll concentrate that apple flavor and get all these spices blend in here so we're going now we're going to take this um i've got this everclear you can use any type of neutral alcohol you can use vodka they even sell moonshine in the grocery i mean the grocery stores in the here's the abc stores so if you're in other parts country it could be a convenience store so we're going to break this in half which gives us 70 proof right 75 proof and then when we mix it with the cooled off mixture when we get done we're going to mix it half and half again well that's going to break it down to 30. 2.5 something like 32.5 pretty good 35 about 35 proof if you want it stronger then add less liquid more alcohol but we found out this is it's plenty strong enough but if you're hardcore or you really love that strong stuff you go ahead and you make this thing as strong as you like okay all right i'm gonna go ahead and break this down do not put this in there while it's boiling or why it's hot you will burn off the alcohol so you have to get this reduced in half and then you have to let it cool to it kind of close to room temperature you don't want this we're gonna go ahead and take this is basically a half a gallon you gotta get yourself a gallon pitcher if you're not sure you don't have the measure stuff you just fill this box back up and pull it in there and you'll have half of it let's see how we have water you can use regular filtered water i wouldn't use tap because you may have hard water or you can go ahead and use distilled water and we're just going to fill this up to a gallon we're just a little shy i'm gonna i'm gonna fill it fill it up the rest away but i'm just gonna go ahead and mix this so right now we just made 151 proof basically 75 proof 75 and a half 85 and a half proof that way when we mix it half and half with this stuff then then you'll break it down in half again which will leave you in the 30 range again we want to keep this stuff stirring all right i'm gonna go ahead and fill this up to the galley mark with a little bit more water and then cover it and we'll cover and let it sit out of the way and we're going to go do other stuff until this boils down to at least i've already strained it i put it put them back in here as you can see i reduce it down to right at a quarter of uh of the liquid so we got our our apple mixture we have over here on the side i have my alcohol so we're gonna fill up some these are pints so what that means if you're gonna go a half and half then you just need one cup of it one cup of uh one cup of um apple juice mix and one cup of the alcohol which eagles to two cups is a pint so you can just basically fill up the cups until you get them enough and we're just gonna do two to show you what i'm doing we'll shake one up and give it a test now if you don't have enough pints you want to put them in quartz two cups is a pint so it's going to take this is a two cup measurement so you would put two cups of this in there and two cups of the alcohol mixture so we'll we'll work with this right here and you'll get the gist of what we're doing here's my alcohol covered and we had it set to the side i cover it so that alcohol doesn't evaporate trust me it evaporates and you don't get any criticism just nothing perfect you have enough room to seal it put the lid on it shake it up real good i think i filled that up just a little too high rebecca's was catching me yeah one is i was looking at the leader side okay so we're gonna find a lid one of these small ones here lid on here give it a good shake and rebecca's gonna come up here so here it is i'm gonna tell you right off the bat you need to let this sit a little while you can let it sit as long as you want this alcohol people kept asking me how do you seal it and all that look this kind of alcohol in here is going to kill any germs bacteria nothing's going to go bad in there okay long as you've just got it sealed okay so it's not going to go bad trust me leave it there as long as you want the longer you leave it the smoother it gets at some point around about three months you won't even taste the alcohol in here it's that smooth but i'm sure i'm gonna taste a little bit so cheers [Music] like a slice of pie right there that was delicious that right there don't have to wait i'm telling you right now that was sweet appley rebecca won't try one she don't want to try one that was delicious good thing i don't drink anymore because i'll be all right i

Angeles California it's partly cloudy anyway today I'm gonna be vlogging so in this cup is my apple cider vinegar and right here is a straw I've been reading that if you use a straw when you drink apple cider vinegar it's better for your teeth so after I drank my apple cider vinegar my friend clay came over what's up guys and now we're gonna go workout you can do legs today no you can do likes tomorrow nope you're not gonna do it anyways at all I am yeah no I'm not you are one goofy guy I mean you can that's my Jeep what are you doing my Jeep so uh so I just got in the shower after my hard work out if you didn't know I worked out you learned something new every single day for example the other day I didn't get enough sauces with my food but then I saw the sauce button I clicked it and it was the most surprising thing I've ever seen in my life nine-one-one what's your emergency oh goes right to 9-1-1 does it yeah I mean I just need one more ranch that's all I need so the sauce thing was something new I learned right so today I thought I'm gonna learn how to make an apple pie why I don't know none of your business anyway I went to the store and got apples today to make an apple pie you need apples and I can't seem to find them can you find the apples very good I wasn't necessarily learning how to make apple pie I was more guessing how to make apple pie the Apple has the most protein yeah everything I make I make with love so now I have to add my secret ingredient and I'll tell you what it's not so secret anymore I use just a little dab a little sprinkle of my grandmother's ashes because I loved her and you know then you just put it in the oven [Music] you hear that pies done you ready to be my taste tester fixing up a little plate here it's good is it not the best I ever had in your life I said it's good I'm not saying it's bad I said it's good you're sure I was upset because I have to be the best at everything good just isn't enough for me [Music] Alexander if you keep making apple pies you're gonna end up being the best apple pie maker in the world by the way you get my new merch no man I don't have the new stuff but I got your old merch can't really afford the new stuff okay then how about blessed day Alex by Jesus", "-wEfEH7t2UE": "[Music] oh [Music] hello there ladies and gentlemen and welcome once again to another episode of the cider drinker and today we are going to spain uh not necessarily because i actually got this bottle when i was over in portugal last year yes we actually managed to get away on holiday despite all the stuff that was happening on last year god knows what that was eh there there we go um yeah so today i have got a bottle of cidra con pera from mayloc melo i'm sorry my pronunciation of spanish is not good but um i'm assuming it's melo maylock something something along those lines uh and yeah there's cydra comparo or pear cider in this case um i don't have a lot of information on this i have actually had one of um this side company's range before i think it was many many many years ago i'll um pop a card up on the top of the screen so you can go and watch it after this one um but generally i think these guys aren't actually too bad they're definitely um they're definitely a little bit better than the usual mass-marketed stuff but the good thing is there is a little bit of english on the back here so it's an apple cider with pear so in a way it's sort of a pie there except not really because it's ten percent cider oh cider we're sorry it's cider with ten percent pear juice from concentrate so not a real seizure in this case and as you can see it comes in these really dinky little 200 milliliter bottles i'm sure there's going to be other ranges um out there as well down in the description i'll put them there and this is a pretty average four percent abv uh so yeah pedro some concentrate obviously means that it's not a real cider but that doesn't stop it from winning bronze in the international cider challenge awards so that's got something going for it um now spoiler alert i have had this before um it was in a four pack hence why it was coming in such small bottles but i'm sure it's in like 500 mils and 750 or something like that um as well now the cool thing is it doesn't have a normal bottle top it has one of those ring pool things that i've only really ever seen on bottles of tuborg before it's not a common thing over in the uk not a lot of um company in fact no companies do it as far as i'm aware but yeah it's really cool so let's just get the the ring pull off and i'll let you know what i make of it there's that hiss see it there you go give it a little give it a little pull and off it pops so oh slight uh there's a sl slight vinegary quality to this i didn't get that last time i don't know if it's because it's been um allowed to sit for quite a while but yeah i didn't get that off the nose before but bearing in mind this was in uh this was in portugal in like you know mid-30s heat so i don't know whether your smells and tastes change over there but there we go all right so as you can see from the color it's uh lightly sparkling completely clear as you can see it has been filtered down um yeah light carbonation nice light golden color there a little bit of foam resting on the top there but as with um every cyber imperium pesider and everything in between that's gonna disappear relatively quickly i would say so what's it smell like in the glass so that's my nail there's the pear it smells it smells exactly like pear drops literally just pear drops with a slight um they're gonna say in the bags of hair drops that you get there's always the yellow ones and the red ones it smells more like the yellow ones that you could get i don't know the difference between the two but there was definitely a different smell and taste to them so definitely yellow pear drops i'm getting on this with a sweet apple overtone to it as well that vinegary quality that was on the bottle's completely gone definitely smells sweet it's got aromas of um almost like uh like an apple crumble sort of thing sweet lightly lightly spicy but overall it smells really nice so let's go and uh dive in shall we cheers everyone yeah let's see what male orchestra wilder with uh has to order has to offer with their sidra comparer cheers taste is pretty much like the smell actually sweet right off the bat those pear drop flavors come through as well it's uh sort of got a definitely a sweet shop candy vibe to it for sure full body not sure if it's some thick and syrupy just yet it doesn't say that it contains sugars or anything like that i don't know if any have been put in but i would imagine the pear juice from concentrate is probably going to add to the thickness of the body super easy to drink i mean it's only four percent abv anyway slight um i want to say slight candy floss texture that's going to sound really weird there's definitely a sort of a grainy texture behind it and with the sweetness it's almost akin to a like you've just bitten into candy floss or something like that just uh like i don't know like a woody quality to it very strange that's actually just reminded me not it's coincidental that um well longtime viewers uh derpy derp eric bryan the guy that uh sent me over the ciders from new zealand um he literally put a review of another um bottle of mellock on untappd and he's pretty much had the same description of it as it was warming up almost like a cotton cottony sort of texture behind it and that is definitely what i'm getting like candy floss something like that it's just a it's hard to describe unless you taste a bit it's like a woolly cottony sort of texture it's a little bit bizarre but it's not terrible if that makes any sense at all yeah overall this isn't bad for a country like the uk this is probably going to be in the line of you you will see it on like supermarket shelves next to like you know magnus and magnus and whatnot but i tell you what for the country that it comes from this is definitely going to be a really refreshing cider to have it's just got the night a nice the nice balance of sweetness without being overly sweet and with it being so easy to drink as well you can see why it comes in like little four packs as well because you just like crack one open and just enjoy it in the sun for sure let's get a final taste before final verdict now there is a little bit of um a little bit of cloying up at the back of the throat probably from the pair just from concentrate to be fair but yeah this bottle is definitely not going to last long at all i mean it was only 200 mils as well so you're definitely not going to get absolutely blottoed off this you'd probably have to have like eight bottles of it before you even start feeling the effects of it so if you are in spain in portugal or something like that i mean i picked this up in um like a tiny a little like corner shop just uh not far from where we were staying i cannot for life remember how much i paid for it but it wasn't expensive at all i think it was something like four euros it might have been even less than that so definitely more on the cheaper end as well but the tastes are definitely a lot better than the usual mass-marketed rubbish that you do find on the supermarket shelves so if you have ever wondered what these guys are like definitely give them a go i'll i said there's going to be a card with the other one that i've tried with of theirs as well so yeah i'm relatively impressed with moloch i shall definitely have to um find out the rest of their range if i ever go abroad i'm sure i will hopefully if not this year maybe next with that said for a final third date i'm actually going to go and give millox sidra compara a seven out of ten definitely uh worth checking out naturally it's not gonna blow your socks off but for a nice easy drinking refreshing and nice tasting sidra you can't go wrong with this and with that said that's another episode of the side drink for you guys i hope you liked it and as usual i will be back with another delicious and tasty cider soon until then i probably give myself about five minutes to finish off the rest of this bottle we'll see eh take care guys until next time", "MumwE7SsC4U": "[Music] i've never even seen a honeycomb that big before like in person yeah [Music] that's a twofer [Music] wow this is the range what caliber is an apple very large very large ordinance right there [Music] you got factor in that window oh shoot way off i want to get sam switch [Music] i found my range on that far sam squad show out there i really put some apples in that yeti oh man ross we'd be dead by now uh yeah i went from i suck to i'm shooting i'm shooting the windigo in the backfield so good day for me red apple day on the ranch well i'm out amo that's awesome i mean we're ready to go we got all the apples we shot all the apples let's go make some cider yeah [Music] one at a time boys too much [Music] well there goes nothing give it a taste try a little bit sweeter than i would normally drink a cider not that i drink a ton of them yeah like with gold you know how like like family names like cooper was like a guy who made barrels right and miller it's like a guy who milked it do you think like preston was like a dude who pressed a ton of apples and then that was his name could be it oh yeah this is like one of those you're gonna get a little saliva build up yeah exactly it's on the roof of your mouth on your tongue it coats it's a heavy coating it coats you kind of feel on your teeth almost exactly like i kind of want to keep i'm not not licking toads right oh yeah we might want to grease these threads they're heating up i do not press dry foodlube.com lube your food it slides down your throat faster when you chew it fall is in the air woke up this morning it was like 40 degrees out which is like oh it's crisp there's start this the first time there's a chill in the air you know it was like 80 two days ago did was that what we needed you always give me plenty ross okay get after it just chitty chatty just a chatty patty sitting in the tailgate here yeah so this one we didn't heat pasteurized we used the old potassium metabisulfite uh-huh chemical pasteurization yeah and that was mainly just due to the fact that we had no idea how to deal with the honeycomb right so i mean i've never had a honeycomb i'm a city boy first of all you're watching this on youtube and you're a beekeeper and you have a better way to do this and it involves a centrifuge you can just keep your comments to yourself because i don't i don't have one of those and i'm not gonna buy it so our buddy jack gave us the honeycomb jack from the ranch jack from the old farmer the old farm uh blackberry blackberry man yeah where are we what are we brewing today uh ruin a robust porter time flies when you're drinking beer oh man all right so what we're gonna do is we're just gonna scrape this out okay here and we're just gonna you know use your hands and squeeze man okay jack hooked this up with it it felt like the right thing to do yeah why wouldn't you it's made out of sugar yeah so we have it's made to ferment we've been quite the we've been quite the hit with all the local bees and wasps be it ever so bumble there's no place like comb is that what they say i've never even seen a honeycomb that big before like in person yeah yeah again i saw this on youtube i saw this on youtube is the new hold my beer check this [ __ ] out yeah you want to get a little taste of that and see like if there's wax in it that's honey baby yeah honey no no wax no it's pure uncut [Music] so kyle sorted that out in the video mm-hmm and then you heated up some cider like just some work cider work synergies straight from the hip man running and gunning on the stove we're gonna do let's call it a light decoction with our cider we're gonna take out about a gallon of it from our five gallon bucket put it in a pot heat it up on a stove we've got our probe in our cider here on the stove we've hit our target temp of about 140 degrees fahrenheit we're gonna add that warm cider from the stove to the honey hot pan chef hot pan behind corner chef hot pan hopefully those sugars will start to just suspend in solution with the natural sugars from the cider and then we're going to add the other four gallons of our cider to cool it back down so we can pitch yeast in seal it up and begin fermentation oh yeah that's thick baby so that is our light decoction of heated cider i think we're gonna add it to our fermenter it's looking great it smells i don't think you can buy this at a store i feel like this is the type of autumn you have to go out into wild nature and find you know it starts with sulfur on the nose it's there yeah no denying it yeah it's young it's an unpleasant smell it's a long-term project the taste is a thousand times better than the old smell [Music] the final gravity was 10 12. 6.83 so okay got a little bit got a little more booze this is the honey cider and i pulled the wrong yeast out of the fridge earlier we're gonna let it warm up for a couple hours then we'll pitch it once you have kind of got past the the initial sulfur that like hits you it's right out of the schnoz cannon here and when you like approach the glass any other compounds are going to just get eclipsed by that initial sulfur yeah i would say at this point in this guy's or gal's age that's probably the most i can drink we're i'm gonna just right you know i'm not gonna throw it out it's not bad it's in the glass it'd be a shame to waste it i used to drink beers and bars that i put my cigarette out in oh good ooh ashtray shots if you're making cider get a couple of yeasts diversify your microbiology because some of it's going to be good now and some of it's not don't ferment yourself into a corner don't just shoot your shot with one yeast okay get a couple couple of yeasts i agree with that", "rEAhmGhLiGM": "hi everybody a Dan Cole here special treat today we have a recipe for sweet apple pie moonshine which is a wonderful treat on the hot summer days wonderful treat Mills cold winter nights what a nice holiday treat also this is a delicious delicious recipe that

simple to do if I can do it anybody can do it check that link below just take it click it put your email in there and get some information won't cost enough and I don't share email addresses so you're good to go there check it out all right okay here we go sweet apple pie moonshine now the trick to this is to use the real ingredients this is 100% pure apple juice this isn't frozen that's not concentrate it's 100% pure apple juice this is pure Everclear this is as strong as I can get in my area 151 proof is the strongest I can find here in Morehead where I live so you want to get a strong of alcohol of strong of every clear as you can on the mixture for this is very very simple what I'm going to do at the end here because I will also post this recipe on the end of the video but here's what we do it's very very simple you're going to use a quarter cup of white sugar then you're going to come over and you get up half a cup half a cup of brown sugar now this is a very very potent recipe that can really fool you because you don't taste the alcohol and it does literally tastes like sweet apple pie so use it with caution be very careful with it don't mess around with this stuff it will sneak up and kick your butt and please know driving when you're drinking okay all right here's the ELMO here's the secret from here on out you're mixing 50:50 Everclear and apple juice no you want to keep a little room on top so you got room to shake this up get all that sure to dissolve this is literally one of the best drinks you will ever ever have all right we're going to cap this and shake this real well to that sugar dissolves it only takes a minute or so of shaking all right so we have it mixed up all the sugar is dissolved now here's the trick you want to add a couple sticks of cinnamon in here and the reason I didn't do it when I was shaking this up is because the cinnamon sticks will flake and there's nothing worse than floaties in your drink and your your company won't really appreciate floaties and your drink either so I'm going to let this sit this is going to taste pretty darn good right now yeah that'll work look that cinnamon sitting there I'm going to let that

a good day", "4FL9WjP_tSY": "[Music] well due to technical difficulties I've managed to lose the opening file that I need for this video however we'll see if I can narrate my way through it what I'm trying to do this time is try to create an apple-pie brandy unlike your apple pie moonshine that has ingredients mixed in after the fact we're going to see what we can accomplish mixing in before distillation so what I started out with was two gallons of some freshly squeezed apple cider and a gallon or two of regular apple juice I then also took several already smith apples and cut them up and put them in a mixer and ground them up real good and put that in I also took some raisins and gave them a quick boil to loosen up the sugars inside added that to it and I also added a little bit of molasses for flavoring like you would have brown sugar you could also add some brown sugar to this as well now instead of the normal bread yeast and turbo yeast that you normally see me using I decided to try a different yeast and this is you can find this on eBay you can just look up the numbers ec - one one one eight and that's this official name it's a special wine yeast it is used by some distillers and so I thought I would give this one a go this time around and it gets mixed just the same as any other any other time you see me mixing my yeast up three packets of yeast should do it a couple heaping tablespoons of sugar and some warm water and let it set for about ten minutes before you dump it in and at this point we should be able to catch up with the rest of the video okay so now it's been a couple hours let's have a look at this brew or the chunk of Apple that didn't get didn't get chapter there we got some bubbling peel back the layers yes we have some building going on the raisins are fermenting we're filling up with gas and floating to the top oh yeah I can smell the alcohol brewing on it we're doing as far as the taste from the front that's not bad my granny smith ski with the right amount of tartness there's that there's that um what is an angry orchard it's either I think it's a hard cider tastes pretty close to that so if you want to take a shortcut you could distill bottles of angry orchard get something pretty close to this just to just to get a taste to figure it out of what you want all right let that sit we'll get back to it in a couple weeks for one week or two weeks okay so now it's been a week and here's what we have so far all the apples except for a couple of chunks here in there have sank to the bottom now look at this one after that we have here it's a bit translucent try this junk Apple here don't taste like a Granny Smith without all not as sweet as it was try a bit of when the wine we have here i hack that's pretty good there's a there's a certain crispness to it probably from the Granny Smith I would make up that would make a very good wine all in its own if you wanted to you wanted to drink it like that so now I will take this and will experiment with it a little bit see if we what kind of flavors we can put into it before distilling or after just do it okay so now I've got my formula pretty much worked out what I want to do and what I'm seeing on these raisins I'm not sure if that's yeast or not that has clung to it I'm actually it looks like they might have started to crack as they were building up pressure inside either way I'm going to I wasn't planning on filtering this earlier but now now thinking about these these little white spots all over the raisins I am going to do a slight filtration and I'm just going to use a spaghetti strainer and cheesecloth and fill up my still pot to a respectable level and then add the spices I'm not going to try to disturb I'm not going to try to disturb the apples and stuff that settle to the bottom I'll get this filled up here okay so now what I have is just a couple small ladles full and a line type glass and I've added just a little bit of seasonings to this some stuff that you might find in apple pie recipes and something that I other things I thought might go good with it so we just have just a pinch of these in there we'll keep this up for about a minute and get those flavors released okay I got it heated up it didn't take as long as I expected it to probably only thirty seconds next time but the aroma coming of that smells almost just like a freshly baked apple pie and we'll let that sit and let those flavors finish releasing and we'll give this a try okay it's been just about a minute or two give this a try and see what we've got Wow that's pretty good that is it's not it's not completely accurate as far as an apple pie goes but it is a lot closer than any apple pie moonshine that I've tried this has a much closer distinction - apple pie than most apple pie moonshine recipe so we'll try to tweak this it's not quite right but it is it is pretty close so we'll try to tweak this and see what we can get a little closer [Music] okay I've played around with a few different spices including things like vanilla extract and nutmeg and the the the spices that I think work best with this where some cinnamon sticks whole cloves and anise seed NSC bee has like a licorice quality to it and so after using these three and a pinch of brown sugar I got just as close to a homemade apple pie as I think I'm going to get and it's pretty good it's a lot better than the typical moonshine apple pie it's a lot better than the typical apple pie moonshine that that you see of these that you've seen a hundred times on YouTube videos so now I'll try to add these ingredients to the distilling pot and see how well these and see how well these flavors travel to our final product okay so now I'll gently squeeze some more liquid out of these raisins that works for me now we can take this and throw the contents away and we have a suitable amount of liquid for distilling so now to this I'm going to add three cinnamon sticks each one is roughly the length of my index finger I'm going to add a small spoon of anise seed and also just a small spoon of whole clove now we'll seal this up and we'll distill it and we'll see what kind of product that we get out of it okay now this batch has gone through but one thing is wrong I added too much cinnamon three cinnamon sticks is just way too much on a mental note the we'll add just like one cinnamon stick or even half a cinnamon stick that'll be plenty but we can try to fix it but now that it's finished it smells absolutely perfect X Mel's just like you want apple pie to smell like only this smell do not go into our final product curious but luckily we still have some of the wash leftover and so we'll distill that by itself and I will even boost that up a little bit so that we can get a stronger batch of apple flavor and then we will mix that in with the first batch that was rounded it's it's not a really good cinnamon flavor to it but it's not apple pie it's a real good cinnamon brandy it wasn't what I was looking for so we'll see if we can finish mixing this up and dilute it down and see if we can get what we're aiming for okay so the first mixture was too strong and cinnamon however the the cinnamon taste is good if that's what you want to go for it was really good as far as cinnamon goes but we're trying to get an apple pie tasting that was just too strong for out the pie so here's the rest of our wash and we're getting that drained and we'll distill that straight and I might even add something to it to make sure we have something to even out the cinnamon taste with where you have but there's only a little bit left so what I'm going to do is I'm going to increase the amount of alcohol that I'm going to get out of this and I'm going to add some which is already and it's okay but it's not the best I can do on Apple branded so we'll just add this I'm not going to use it for anything I've just been keeping it around now we have some extra alcohol in there to cut down on the cinnamon flavor that we have in the first run we're also going to take the first run and we're going to add that to it as well and the second distillation will cut the cinnamon down a little bit and will we still this and see what we come up with now remember you do this yourself I went too far with the cinnamon so just like use a half a cinnamon stick to one cinnamon stick per five-gallon wash okay so now we've let this sit a couple of weeks with two rainy Smith's cut up and put in there too so and the brandy has turned a nice Pleasant yellow color we have now that is pretty good that is about as close as we're going to get to an actual apple pie moonshine but I would let that set up some more the longer accept the more Apple taste you're going to get out of it now if you want you can take some of this and see how well it ages with oak chips and because I already have them I'm going to use the French oak chips these were purchased on eBay they're not that expensive they're the packages are really small but they'll go a long way so we'll take the handful of these French oak chips they're already toasted they're ready for use all you have to do is take a handful and put them in and you will have a nice French oak aging on this instead of a regular okay and if you only find the oak tips that Jack Daniels makes well go ahead and use those but if you can find the French oak chips go ahead and use those and we'll give that a try and we'll see how well those tastes so here we are in the modern age of 2018 some odd years later and this is as much as I have of this so what I would have done next is I would have taken anything that I had and filtered it through a coffee filter so like I said before this was an experiment and completely subject to interpretation what I have leftover isn't bad people have said they've liked it a lot but um is it apple pie well you'll have to be the judge of that and you'll have to see if you can tweak this because I this is my first experiment and I've never gotten back to it to see if it could be tweakable all right so with that good luck to you all", "SPizAul24GM": "what we're doing is wild fermentation homemade hard cider you definitely gotta try this recipe welcome back to the fermentation adventure this week we are making the original colonial beverage that was popular even before beer we are making hard apple cider now this apple cider is the perfect way to use up all of these apples during apple season typically in the fall this is actually going to help you store all this amazing apple flavor in the refrigerator or a cooler spot perfect in time for the holidays or you really anytime this is a fermented drink we're going to be making it's all natural and you don't need a ginger bug starter culture but you could actually use one that would be kind of like a different recipe to help speed up the process but in this case we're actually going to be making very natural apple cider join us on this journey to explore the world of fermentation if you'd like to learn how to make ferments like these start now by clicking subscribe and hitting that bell so you don't miss a thing [Music] apple cider when you hear that term there's all kinds of terms you might have heard like there's apple juice there's apple cider there's mold apple cider there's apple wine um there's apple cider vinegar there's hard cider hard cider which is what we're making today so what is the difference between all of those so really it just comes down to the refinement process and the fermentation process so if you start at the very basics so say you have an apple press and you press all the juice out that juice that you have left with all the stuff in it that's just apple cider it's actually pretty interesting because most of the world refers to apple cider as just cider it's just a fermented alcoholic beverage it it's only here in the americas that it's called something different so there's apple juice which everybody knows you buy at the grocery store that's when you take apple cider which is just the pressed juice that has all of the pulp and everything in it you filter all that off and you concentrate it and then you can store it and that's really just apple juice and you also pasteurize it so that's not what we want it's not what we want that's what you find in the store this is going to be so much better than that if you like apple juice you're gonna love this apple cider oh yeah you might have heard mold apple cider that's where you take apple cider and you add all the christmas spices like nutmeg and cinnamon cloves and all that stuff and then there's hard apple cider which has a very interesting history the four beer is popular in the united states there was actually apple cider and everybody drank apple cider it was the popular thing because we grew tons and tons of apple trees in the northeast i imagine where we colonized and of course since we had so many apples we would press those and everybody was making apple cider but then the worst possible thing in the fermentation world happened that was prohibition so alcohol became absolutely illegal and some of the lawmakers they even referred to apple cider hard cider as the devil's brew they were cutting down all of the orchards so long story short europeans came over and they really loved beer beer took hold they were still making beer even though it was illegal and by the time prohibition was lifted beer took off and cider it was just extinct almost time to bring it back time to bring it back so now that we're done with the history lesson let's get started and we're going to be making one quart of cider today which makes two bottles of cider now that's if you choose to bottle we'll talk about that later it's actually optional so we're going to be using though for the fermenting process a 2 quart mason jar so that's just because we want to make sure the whole quart of liquid of apple juice fits in there and then also there's going to be some foam on top so we're going to get into that later you just want to have a large enough vessel to fit your entire quart of liquid and the first ingredient is apples and there are a lot of different types of apples but we think getting the best apple cider getting the best flavor you need a variety of apples and today we're going to be using a combination of jazz apples gala apples and a granny smith apple the main apple that we're using for this one is a jazz apple and it's just slightly sweet and slightly tart at the same time so it's kind of like a mix between the two for apple cider you definitely want sweet but you want that little bit of a bite of the sour taste maybe a little bit of a tannic so the next one we're using is a gala apple and this is almost all sweet and to round out the flavor just like we were saying we're using a granny smith that provides a lot of sourness oh yeah now like we said before there used to be all of these really tannic crab apple type apples and those are really good when you ferment them for a long time now i really would have loved to be able to pick these locally but we just don't have a lot of orchards here in florida it's a little too hot but we do have amazing memories of picking great apples and orchards in canada and it was around october-ish so that's really good apple picking season in like northern america i remember that we actually hiked up a waterfall got to the top there was all of these apple trees and there was apples all over the ground it was crazy and it was free kind of ate a lot of apples that day so for this one quart recipe we want one quart of juice and that roughly translates into about three and a half pounds of fresh apples it's about eight or nine apples five jazz apples three gala and one granny smith so that's what we're gonna use today but let us just clarify too you can make this same recipe this cider the process of fermentation using any combination of these nine apples or you can even use the same apple if you want to we just thought it might be fun to blend them all up and get a really good flavor so guess what you guys we are using the juicer we don't get to use it very often but in order to get the juice out of these apples you can do a couple different ways we're using a juicer today you can also use a blender we happen to not have an apple press because i don't know why we would need an apple present here in florida but so this is going to work perfectly for us if you use a blender you'll just need a little bit of non-chlorinated water to get it going and then a cheesecloth to squeeze out all the juice now we can put these apples directly whole into the juicer but this juicer is actually going to separate the apples into the juice that we need for this recipe and then also over here the scraps go into like this waste bucket but today we don't want to waste these scraps we're actually going to use the apple pulp today because i'm going to make something special after we stop filming tonight i'm making something do you know what i'm making i have no idea apple pie no no it's scraps muffins that would have been possible yeah i'm gonna be making apple cake with the apple scraps that sounds good i know i'm really excited i'm getting hungry now so since we want to use the scraps it's important to cut or core the apple the seeds actually have traces or small amounts of cyanide i know i don't know if everyone knows that but you don't really want to eat the apple seeds so today we're going to core the apples doesn't have to be perfect i mean these are going to be pulverized anyway and we have of course compost make our papaya trees very happy did you know that apples were not even native to north america there was not even a single apple tree in the united states where'd they come from just people coming over from europe and they would throw their apples on the side of the road crazy what is that called wild planting wild farming well i guess nowadays it would be called gorilla gardening yeah that's what it is yeah oh that's a bad one i guess that can happen yeah kind of like something not so good in the middle it's rotten to the core so that's another good reason to cut your apples so i better get an extra apple wash it in regular tap water which here is mostly chlorinated dry it off before i throw it in the juicer you'll also notice there's even like a little spot on there that's not a big deal though because we're just juicing these see what this one looks like inside no apple of my eye let's get to juicing normally you would be using an apple press which presses with pressure all of the juice out so you can see we have our centrifugal juicer here it spins around really quickly and you're putting a lot of force on it so it might heat up the juice just a little bit and it could possibly pasteurize it the tiniest bit but we still haven't had any problems with it but we figured we would just let you know just in case if you're looking for a type of juicer and you want to make a lot of juice that doesn't heat it up you would want the masticating juicer and that just pulverizes everything and squeezes it all out that always makes the house smell so good 900 milliliters we're almost at a thousand so we're almost at one quart whoa that is a ton of foam that you have there if you've ever seen sea foam at the beach it's kind of like that it's kind of seafoamy it's a little wiggly but actually this tastes really amazing so there's really good flavor still in this foam it really has a lot of bubbles once those start popping they become the liquid we like to just go ahead and stir it in right now and if it looks like it's too much foam later as it ferments you can skim some off at that time and now it's making me think of a root beer float i could totally drink this right now and all we really need is just over that thousand mark or around the thousands so we should be all set for the juice that we need so now let's take a look at the scraps that i'm going to be using tonight to make some cake kind of looks like a thick apple sauce the skins are kind of still intact and that's fine i might remove big pieces of the skin to make some cake but otherwise i'm going to leave everything pretty much intact and just use it like that so now that we have all of our juice extracted from those really tasty apples we're going to add that to our 2 quart jar we are not adding any kind of a starter we're not adding a gingerbug we're not adding anything but you can add a starter at this point if you really want to to capture the wild geese we are going to have to stir this vigorously many times a day so let's get to the fermentation process so we've already started up once today all we have to do is cover it with like a loose top we want this to be breathable because as paul mentioned we really wanted to be able to be exposed to the air and capture that wild yeast so now we're ready for the fermentation process but question is how long should this sit on the counter we're expecting anywhere between three and seven days now you'll definitely have to keep in mind this is a wild fermentation so it could be between three and seven days we'll just have to find out but we're going to follow this through the fermentation process every day and show you what it looks like so you know what to expect when you're fermenting at home after 12 hours we don't see much difference which is to be expected but we want to give it a good vigorous stir to help capture that wild yeast and also give the yeast some oxygen to work with we'll continue to stir it a couple times a day after 24 hours there's still not much change although the foam continues to separate and sit on top there isn't a yeasty smell yet so we better give it another stir to help it along after two days there's still no signs of fermentation so stir stir stir it's been three days so about 36 hours and we're starting to see something we shouldn't see let's take a look yeah we're starting to see a little bit of these fuzzy tiny spores that are here and there on the top i think since it's such a thick layer that we'll be able to just scrape that off and i don't think the mold has affected the actual cider underneath i want to be careful not to stir in the top layer as best we can that's probably good it still looks kind of thick so we might have to redo this process again later but just to make this look prettier i'm going to go ahead and shake it up with a leak proof lid make sure it's leak proof now we're going to and check back on it again in about 12 hours see what it looks like on top maybe give it a little taste test see if any fermentation is actually happening yet and then we'll definitely check on it tomorrow wow this has been an interesting journey here we are we're trying to make cider and it's taking a little longer than i thought it would here's what's going on now check out those bubbles getting trapped in the foam layer the cider has also become a bit cloudier when you shine some light on it you can see movement from the gases being created it's super important to keep stirring at least a few times a day to keep mold from growing oh look at all those bubbles check it out i don't see any signs of mold so we're gonna go ahead and stir in the top layer after five days it's even cloudier and very active with large bubbles there's a lot of bubbles on top a lot of foam looking bubbles and we're gonna stir it up a little bit it smells pretty yeasty should we see what it looks like in one more day we have a side by side comparison of our hard apple cider this one we just made and this one has been fermenting for six whole days let's see what they look like now you'll definitely notice this one has a ton of foam because we just made it and we've also been skimming the foam off of this one it smells a little bit yeasty and actually smells a little bit sweet too oh definitely a little yeasty and you can see the bubbles coming up that's amazing so i think it's ready to try it looks good doesn't have any mold on there and uh it's really to taste i've got the nice glasses today all right before we taste it just another thing to mention you can keep it like this with only you know being a week of fermentation or so or you can do it long term where you rack it off you put it in bottles you clarify it kind of like the beer making process if you want to store it for long-term storage you can ferment this all the way out until there's no sugar left but it might be a couple months there's a lot of vitamins and minerals in the sediment on the bottom there so i'm going to stir it up oh and you can hear the fizz oh wow this is incredible it's still a little bit sweet it's almost actually on the tangy side a little bit i wonder if it's that granny smith apple it's gotta taste like a cider beer like truly a cider beer this is incredible but it's actually not beer because beer has barley and hops and all those things i can't believe we had a homemade hard cider now we could actually bottle this at this stage and carbonate it you know normally when you have a beer and you pop it open or even a homemade soda you pop it open you have all those bubbles we could do the same thing but i think it's just so good like this and it has a little bit of alcohol in it speaking of let's go ahead and test that alcohol to measure the alcohol we're using what is called a hydrometer which is this thermometer looking thing right here what we do is we measure the specific gravity before and after and then plug it into a formula and that tells us about what percentage of alcohol we can expect from our ferments it's pretty amazing home brewers use this when they make beer we're going to use it for our ferments here we've been using it to determine the alcoholic content of depache of watermelon soda blueberry rhubarb soda you name it ginger ale but in this case we do want to note that there's so much pulp so it might affect the specific gravity readings i think directionally speaking it's very accurate if you want to use one of these hydrometers yourself check out the description below we'll put links to everything that we use in all of our favorite gear we do want to make sure there's no excess foam when we pour the liquid into the hydrometer for the reading that will be very difficult to determine where the level is at we've already taken the initial reading so this is the final reading so we can tell how much alcohol is in here so it looks like the reading is 1.016 okay let's plug it in so we are just over three percent abv yeah after six days of fermentation we've reached over three percent almost three and a half percent so it's not exact but directionally i can tell that there's alcohol in this and that is very reasonable for how it tastes that it's around three percent incredible this can actually get between maybe even five to seven percent if you ferment it all the way out if you add yeast to it a wine yeast you can get it up to 10 to 12 percent and there's something special called apple jack which is really interesting version of fermentation it's actually distillation which technically is illegal so don't do this at home it's where you take apple wine and you freeze it or you put it down to freezing temperatures and the water in the wine freezes and floats to the top and you keep skimming it off and it gets stronger and stronger and stronger it's kind of crazy it can get up to 30 percent what so that's applejack i think i'm good with three percent yeah that's too strong for me so after six days a three percent alcohol content very nice i like it we hope you guys have loved diving into the world of homemade cider with us if you like this video give us a like don't forget to

"1AXq2uuhh5E": "[Music] hi I'm Jenny and welcome back to my channel I just wanted to make a quick video today to show you how I make my apple pie moonshine our annual Halloween party is quickly coming up and I like to make it at least a month ahead of time and let it set in the fridge with their cinnamon sticks before I go through the ingredients in this recipe I just want to say that I am doubling it the normal recipe is going to be 64 ounces of apple juice 64 ounces of apple cider now I live in Arizona the apple cider we don't have fresh apple cider yeah it usually comes out end of September October so but we do get the canned stuff so this is the pure pressed apple cider also going to use a half a teaspoon of cinnamon and a half a teaspoon of fresh ground nutmeg and you'll need a bunch of cinnamon sticks for your jars at least 14 cinnamon sticks also you need 750 ml of Everclear now I'm doubling it but my second bottle instead of using two bottles of Everclear because it's a really really strong I'm gonna use a hundred proof vodka with it so I've got everything doubled here and all we're gonna do is get them in the pan and start eating them so I'm just gonna put all the juice in here first put all of the juices into the pan and since I'm doubling this recipe I'm going to put a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and I'm just gonna guesstimate in greatness fresh nutmeg and to the town looking for about a teaspoon since I'm doubling this [Music] man I'm just going to toss in all of my cinnamon sticks and then later I stick them individually in jars [Music] a little bit so I am just gonna put this big guy I'm gonna move him over to the middle of the stove here put them on the big burner and I'm gonna bring this as soon as it comes to a boil I'm gonna turn down the heat and let it simmer for one hour so I brought this to a boil and then I covered it and turned the heat down to simmer and let it simmer for one hour and I turned the heat off and it's been cooling for about almost 40 minutes it's still warm but I did work today I'm tired it's kidding weights so I'm gonna put the alcohol and it's warm but it's not hot so I'm going to add in the Everclear if it's still too hot then the Everclear does this weird boil so it's I can leave the top off that if I have some left I'm gonna so I am going to use this little strainer it's not a fine strainer but it'll catch the big chunks of cinnamon that have come off from the sticks inside the pan my whole house smells so good this is like potpourri [Music] sir [Music] all the poor so as you can see I've just caught the big pieces of cinnamon in here and then I'm just going to throw my little bears carefully it's like ham this really makes a lot I think I'm gonna have more than enough so I'm going to continue filling these and we'll be back when I'm done got my little jars all filled up I ended up getting about twelve half pints six pints and I did four twelve ounce jelly jars and then I filled those bottles back up it makes quite a bit and these drinks are honestly probably too big they're for two people this is really strong but I'm gonna clean these off and put the caps on the cinnamon sticks are still in the pan they are waterlogged of course because I cooked with them so I think I'm gonna stop at the store tomorrow and grab new cinnamon sticks and just pop them in the doors and so I'm gonna clean the tops put the rims on and here's my big box of rings I don't know how other people store their rings for canning I have no idea I am overloaded with them but I just kind of open this giant tote so I'll be back as soon as I have the rings on and lids on the jars these are complete I have just washed them and set them over here to dry I'm gonna dry him off a little better and get them into the fridge tomorrow I am gonna put some cinnamon sticks and some fresh cinnamon sticks in them and they will keep in the fridge for a few months prep you know last time I think I kept him for a good four months they're made with grain alcohol and 100-proof vodka they really last a long time and honestly with the other drinks that we have at our Halloween party we probably won't go through all these my son is getting married in December so in preparation of that will probably save some of these for that for that wedding also it's a Yuletide wedding so it'll be a good flavor for this season so I am getting tired I am still in my scrubs I'm ready for bed it's late so until next time thank you so much for taking time out of your busy day to watch my shenanigans until next time we'll probably come back with some more autumn recipes or things for Halloween have a great day [Music]", "mK6S1BUdRBw": "[Music] all right so today we're gonna make some hard cider never made hurts out in court but timings chef and we're gonna razzle-dazzle this snow ginger lemongrass and agave syrup so we're gonna use about sixty pounds of apples first up here's and grind your apples up we're using the Maximizer [Music] grow tip right we're adding these apple stems seeds at all seeds are not getting enough ground up yeah so and they're not gonna get smashed in the press either so let's get both it out in the basket so no need to cut these apples core on whatever [Music] so gap out I don't know six gallons of pulp here our press is only four gallons we're gonna scoop some out and then we'll throw this bag in the press first we claw here my bucket has gallon markers on the side ears so we know how much you have it looks like we're like for now do what you want man I'm going down that way sure it's your party bro yeah I like to party that's juicy right there yeah possible Warren's not bad to you man good leverage the leverage wise [Music] so we started with 35 pounds of apples we press about half of them we've got about a gallon and a half so I guess we're going to end up with about two and a half gallons of pressed juice we don't have all day to do this unfortunately elect me is honor percent juice from the apples that we press so we're actually going to supplement this with some apple cider that we bought from a store in fact you don't even have to press you an apple so you can just buy out the cider and make your own hard cider from that 100 exactly how much all right so it looks like we got about two and a quarter gallons of juice from our apples so we're gonna go ahead and add that to our cow hair no throw the rest of the ingredients in there as well I think this thing works pretty well mmm oh there's Evelyn happy juice we will put a link to this it's you can find this on Amazon we'll put a link in the description soon be adding ginger root to our cider and the first thing you want to do is peel all the skin off it you can use a knife or a peeler and you're just trying to get relatively clean pieces here we're gonna be juicing this it's the best way to part the flavor into the cider if you were to just cut this into pieces and add it when you're pasteurizing it you would not get as much flavor so we want ours real gingery so we're gonna add a bunch of ginger have about three pounds here this will probably trim down about - now that we've peeled all of our ginger we're going to go ahead and juice it [Music] all right so we're going to add the juice from our apples to the kettle here we have the screen in the kettle chunks and what not that did make in there Tommy's juiced our ginger yeah so it looks like we've got about two and a half gallons in here we're going to top this off with some cider that we bought retrieved for about five and a half gallons per gallon markers are etched on the inside of our kettle here so we're not quite there yet so we're at five and a half gallons here and now you're gonna have the entire bottle that'll also help with the water that we added to so yeah this is going to add a little bit of agave flavor plus it's going to boost the fermentable sugar content which means it's going to be a bit higher ABV and it would be if you're using straight cider you got a match nicely with the apples it kind of has that caramel background notice that you would find an apples never gonna add our lemongrass stalks you need to take the stalk and we're gonna bruise it with the back of the night it's going to release some of the oils so you want these kind of split like this just so that they're able to release their full flavor grab it dissolves pretty well in room temp water yeah I'm gonna stir this up a little bit just to make sure it's dissolved then I'm gonna grab a sample of this so we know what our starting gravity is going to be we're at 10:50 here so we're gonna dump this back in here vacuum will leave a little bit out that's it very good yes get a little bit of that ginger spice pulpy it's very spicy so our system has a built-in heat thermometer port and is powered by this controller so all we need to do is set the temperature we want on the controller here which is gonna be a pasteurization temperature of 170 degrees well sudden alarm on here as well once we hit that temp we'll be good to go to move on with the process so we hit 170 here we're going to cool this down here in a minute but before we do that we're going to circulate some sanitizer solution through the the lines the pump and the wort chiller so we've circulated the sanitizer to the pump and the lines and the chiller now I'm going to move this over to the kettle it's gonna pop it on the quick-release here open this up let's go ahead and just run it through until we get the sanitizer out and then we'll start recirculating so go ahead and pop that up in here so again the idea here is that we're gonna circulate this 170 degree cider which is a pasteurization town through the lines and the pump and the chiller again we don't have the cooling water on we want it to be hot at this point because the heat it's gonna kill any bacteria that's any which is important for this you don't want to boil Seidler necessarily it can turn it cloudy so it's fine if you don't mind that so we'll let this circulate here for just a minute and then we'll cool it down alright so we've cooled the cider down to 80 degrees we're using this loud then ICI 1118 yeast that's why nice it's also good for champagne style beverages and it's telling me on the package to rehydrate at 95 to 98 degrees generally I would always say just follow the directions on the yeast package however I have a too lazy to make any starter at this point and today that we would have had to do it an hour ago anyway so my plan is this we've cools this down to 80 degrees we're gonna pitch this at 80 will then throw it in our fermentation chamber set to our actual fermentation temp which is 63 degrees I think yeah okay sanitized Santa's solution uses some Starbucks and for that I'm gonna seem like get my hands in here let's just pop this down in here I guess transfer this over generally can you use this basket for grain once you're done to the grain you can fold a basket pop some clips in this time around looks like we got ourselves some lemongrass and a lot of ginger some a nice man nice excellent work I'm excellent proud of you man yeah all right let's throw this in the fridge and we'll call it a day tires done so I just doing time to taste it cool it's really dry no there's not a lot of sweetness some cider you get a lot of sweetness yeah or if it's from the apples we used yeah it's probably from the wine nice we use mmm the a be beyond this 6.43 10:50 starting gravity 1001 ending gravity so the yeast just plowed through all the sugar that was in there fermented all the way down to almost zero so there's hardly any probably residual sugar left which is why it's not very sweet and pretty you JA yeah I kind of like that yeah it's real crisp yeah get a lot of ginger you get a good amount of ginger not getting necessarily tunnel in the grass in here it's got a nice spice to it I put it on tap four days ago or something in the very first day it was really strong like it was overbearing I didn't like it it was bad when we do too much ginger is what I thought what happened though was I didn't call crash it before I put it on tap so there's a lot of stuff still in suspension and I've noticed that every day that I've come in to drink more there's I've had like my first pours been really cloudy like all the ginger and whatnot has settled out of it so now because we pureed did you yeah yeah so now that it's sediments gone it's much smoother than it was so if you happen to make this recipe and it's just overbearing your first I'll just give us some time and it's it'll mellow I like also that it's gluten-free mm-hmm it's gluten-free which is you know we haven't made anything that's gluten free dinners there's no gluten in there it's good yeah I like it I like it yeah if you drink this yeah I can drink it I haven't actually been doing epic toes been hearing all this but anyway nice wrap on this one awesome cheers Cheers thanks for going over this recipe thanks for watching and give this a 10 of 10 again definitely brew this beer please brew this cider cider beer yes our beer if this is what you're into thanks for watching is it excellent okay can't you see what hey it's free don't worry three", "g2XlmXcW97U": "all right we're going to use I don't on to pronounce that but s - so for dry L yeast we've got our water 104 degrees this is supposed to give us a good sweet a good sweet sweet flavored cider I like them sweet instead of dry we're going to add it to this water rip that up and throw it in there we're gonna make five gallons I'm gonna stir it in let it sit come to life while we're out here getting that rest of the cider bucket ready alright we're gonna make cider today we got five gallons of juice first step sanitize everything stars' and second step get your yeast ready let it sit up third steps before you do stuff okay make sure it's apple juice make sure it don't have super lows in it they put sucralose in it that's fake sugar it's not good they can say juice from concentrate you could say a hundred different things but if it says sucralose in it as an ingredient it's not gonna work and it's gonna be bad for you give you brain cancer and all that other [ __ ] felt confused sucrose was super loathe sucrose means sugar sucralose is a chemical it's like aspartame [Music] all right you want to use a cup of sugar per gallon you could use more if you want or you can add at it later after a couple weeks to a month after it sits you could use white sugar brown sugar I use about half and half this time I'm going to use three cups of white sugar 2 cups of brown sugar we're going to stir it up real good all right you want to add the east so got air bubbles in it mix it up real good now you want to set for at least two weeks probably better off you set for a month but you could you could take and if you wanted to you could switch it from this this barrel to another one in two weeks which are you sanitize this before you use it you want to let it sit somewhere where it's dark and about room temperature all right we want to clean it up so we're going to remove we're gonna move it from our our bucket to our secondary so I'm gonna use this car boys my secondary you need an auto siphon these things are real cheap you don't want to put this on bottom because you don't want to suck that sludge up and put it over here we're trying to get rid of the yeast and everything that's left over in the bottom of the bucket so we're gonna move all this liquid into this big glass jug just called carboy and when we do that we're gonna let that sit a couple days we're gonna do this again we're gonna move it from the carboy to our bottling bucket I'm going to be sweeten this because it's really dry I took a little sip of it and it's really strong I let it sit a lot longer than it needed to because it kind of got cold outside and I just I'll let it go over the winter it's normally you could brew this in 30 days I just want to show you what we're trying to avoid there's a little layer of sludge and dead yeast in the bottomless bucket it's what you're trying to to get away from you don't want to remove that into your clean this is where all your clean stuff is you don't want to see that I mean you it won't hurt you the worse didn't give you the shit's if you drink it but if you could avoid that being in your bottle and then then why not so we try and stay above that and yeah we're gonna end up wasting probably out of a quarter of a gallon of liquid I mean if we really wanted to we could get that out there the quarter of a gallon but I mean it's just water it's just just apple juice and reaching the bottom to where we might suck that up and I'm gonna avoid that at all cost because I don't I don't want that [ __ ] I don't want to see that [ __ ] when I'm drinking a bottle of beer all right now we let this sit for a day or two so all that whatever whatever yeast is left is going to settle on the bottom of this which is a very tiny amount now because most type of got left in that other bucket we're now moving it to our bottling bucket over here and once we move it to our bottling bucket we're going to put some corn sugar in it so that it creates some co2 after after it sits in these bottles for a couple weeks that sugar is going to turn into carbonation and then be carbonated like beer I already got these sanitized these are really cool bottles most of our gross I think this was the Fisher I drank these a long time ago I've been reusing them ever since we'll come back to you nuts once it's all moved and we're adding our sugar all right you want to prime it which means you want to add sugar to this before you bottle it and we use corn sugar it's called priming sugar or to say corn sugar they could say dextrose you could really if you wanted to you could use apple juice you could use corn syrup you could probably make you a seer out of some water and some sugar on the stove just regular white sugar you can use brown sugar as long as it's it's real dissolvable it's real fine they use this most of time because it's really fine and it dissolves easy but we use point six six point six six ounces per gallon point six six ounces per gallon on average we got about three gallons of cider left after everything said and done we're using two ounces of this and we're just we're not going to dissolve this on the stove with a cup of water you could you can put a cup of water on a stove top you can dissolve this but we got this badass mixer and we're about to use it alright this is a bottling one real cheap few bucks at the bottling store it's got this little tip in it you put it on in here you see this here got this little lever this is a bottling bucket this is specific for moving this stuff in the bottles so basically you turn this knob here and it sends it through through this hose and then you put this down inside your bottles it's got a little tip so you get right up to where you need to be and it stops because this little Tiffany end all right so once you get this bottle you want to let it sit for at least the wig usually you wait two weeks after week if you want to try one we're at one up open it up pour in a cup see how many subs you go and hopefully it's it's carbonated should be good and crystal clear it's a little dry I like it still has an apple flavor though some people re sweetened with Splenda I don't use fake sugar for anything I never will I don't I don't consume it I don't let my kids consume it it's just nasty [ __ ] so if you want by all means use use some Splenda might give you brain cancer or something ten years down the road but whatever alright if you don't have the seal tops from the girls bottles you can save old beer bottles clean them up whatever you want you can leave the labels on if you want to i scrub them all get you some cash users they have oxygen barriers coming a pack like this at your broom route Tinsel's store but basically set it on top put is this thing here put the cap on top or you can shove there's a magnet in here so you can shove it up there if you wanted to I'll show you one once we fill it up so basically you fill it up to about there put your cap on you see this things adjustable you buy one of these and brew tencel's also you can get a cheaper model this tomorrow if you're gonna bobble some stuff get this with you push down it crimps out on there for you that's good and sealed let that sit for two weeks that'll be me a fresh bottle beer look it's already look at that two weeks that thing's gonna be sparkling alright so in end result we we ended up with a lot of waste you'll have that sometimes you can prevent it if you really really want to we end up with three gallons to Bob and we ended up with all these bottles from that I got some green ones here these are old still the bottles I drink Stella a lot I forget what these these are from like five years ago it's my drink I used to have a bunch of em still like bottles but it's not strong enough beer to drink anymore and we ended up with some of these these are really cool you don't need one well these bottling things and one wine bottle or one-fifth Bob so we got a little bottle of champagne I guess but it's gonna be good we'll show you the next once it's carbonated all the way we'll open some up we'll drink it I'm sure this is leftover imma drink this now either drinking like that it's just you want some cider you want some suds in there it's good like that though it's like a want apple wine will show you when it's carbonated it's been like two and a half days but I can't wait I want to see what happens in two and a half days is there any carbonation at all I heard it very little two-and-a-half days No hell no God wait longer still gonna [ __ ] drink it though one week that's more about we'll try it let's keep that over here oh [ __ ] we got sons homie look at that [ __ ] son boy hell yeah that's good another week is gonna do even better one week and you get suds probably have more subs after after two weeks oh yeah you see that that's beautiful that shit's good too two weeks [ __ ] awesome", "V00j2Pf_vuU": "[Music] what's up guys we're coming into the holidays and I'm about to make your dreams come true this is part one of a two-part series where I'm gonna show you how to make a couple different versions of moonshine this is my first time doing it so we'll see how it turns out part one is going to be apple pie moonshine made with just a few simple ingredients so we're gonna start out with some orange juice or apple cider I'm sure it will be orange juice this is apple juice I'm sure it'd be better if I used apple cider but this is this is what I can find in the store today so simply Apple I'm sure it's gonna be terrific you got a dash of cinnamon some cinnamon sticks and brown sugar and most importantly some Everclear now this is 190 proof Everclear you'll see a lot of people saying that they can only get 151 in their area we could get 190 here in Tennessee of course you could actually get the real moonshine speaking of this I know some of you guys out there gonna say moonshine it's close enough this is as close as I could get this is kind of a hybrid it's still grain alcohol 190 proof it's gonna be pretty darn strong so that's all the ingredients we're gonna need so let's head over to the stove let's get it whipped up let's make fairy tales come true okay guys moment of pure vulnerability here I may or may not have been sampling a little bit of the product when I was uploading the video so I lost this tiny little segment good thing is not a big deal so here's what you need to do in a saucepan you need to mix two cups of your apple juice or apple cider whatever you choose and a half cup of brown sugar you need to mix that together along with a cinnamon stick and it - of cinnamon I like a lot of cinnamon so I add a little bit more you're gonna notice that the final result is a darker brown color but just go to your taste on that now I will tell you that the final product is a little strong based on this recipe so if you want it to be smoother double the amount of juice which would make four cups of juice and a full cup of brown sugar mix all that together and bring it to a simmer you want to simmer this stuff for about 15 to 20 minutes key note here do not under any circumstances add your Everclear at this point two things will happen first thing you're gonna end up evaporating off the alcohol which is not at all what you want to do second thing is you could burn off your eyebrows and possibly burn down your house stuff's flammable if it's not flammable it's not good so it is flammable - be very careful you will create an explosive situation we're gonna add that in later after we've cooled this mixture down to room temp but absolutely do not add it in right now now back to the regular filmed segments alright so at this point our apple pie mixture so our apple juice our apple cider the cinnamon the cinnamon stick the brown sugar that's all come together we simmered it for a while and now it's finally at room temperature now we're safe cooktop is cooled off everything's good I'm not gonna blow up in my face nothing like that so now we are going to add the pixie dust the magic mix this is Everclear 190 190 proof gray now before I do that it's just it's very important not to get dehydrated while you're doing this just a lot of effort and a lot of work you don't want to be dehydrated so let's go we're gonna go with 2 cups 2 hours later so here's our two cups and that's a lot of grain alcohol folks so this is gonna have a kick to it it's gonna kick you in the belly and then while you're down probably gonna kick your teeth out so I want you to be really careful you've got to drink this responsibly it will creep up on you and do the right thing make sure you're staying at home when you're having this so let's add the two cups right in there we don't want to waste any of it oh goodness blessed baby Jesus okay let's give that a little stir make sure everything's mixed up real nice and good now what I want to do is take that cinnamon stick that's in there I want to take it out because that's all cooked up and it could get a little soft eventually and it'll break off in there and you don't want all kinds of little bits and pieces in so what I want to do actually is I've got my quart jar I'm gonna put a fresh cinnamon stick in there got to find it out over here there and put a fresh cinnamon stick in here oh that's good stuff put that in the bottom and now this stuff is ready to go into our mason jar a quart jar here's where I'm gonna get 15 ways of country on yeah I couldn't find my my funnel that I use for food and I certainly don't want motor oil mobile ones pretty good stuff but I don't want to be eating it or drinking it so just cut the top off of the milk jug it's gonna work perfect in my mason jar and then we're just gonna pour it in there so smooth the silk easy as pie so right there you can see we've got the perfect amount you don't want to fill it all the way up to the very top because you want to have room where you can shake this stuff up before you drink it every time I like to anyway that way if there's any any particles that sell doubt you can so you can screen this through a cheesecloth and get out all that any little impurities or bigger pieces of sugar lumps of cinnamon that may have fallen but I really don't care so look at that it almost looks like apple butter it was just pure perfection right here so apple pie moonshine gonna make up a couple labels little gears guns and grub apple pie moonshine and so try it out for yourself check it out you could put this stuff in your freezer with proof as high as it is it's not gonna freeze on you so wow this is good anytime but this time of year just seems like apple pie and the holidays goes perfect together so this is my gift to you so check it out apple pie moonshine check out part 2 where I'm doing the lemonade moonshine obviously good anytime in the year duh and but especially summer time so check out part two as well with the lemonade moonshine and enjoy but be responsible thanks guys see me [Music]", "ynAtHjTtv_k": "today we will be brewing one of my favorite fall home brewing recipes guaranteed to make you feel basic within seconds of sipping it strap in Becky because we're going to be making some pumpkin spice hard apple cider form using machines calm please respect the local laws of your municipality before producing or consuming alcohol to brew pumpkin cider you will need the following ingredients for a five gallon batch you're gonna need five gallons of apple juice four cans of 15 ounce pumpkin four cups of sugar 4 tablespoons of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of nutmeg for the yeast I recommends to fail' so4 and I'll explain why in a minute so let's first talk about juice selection you can use nearly any store-bought juice provided that soar baits have not been added to it if you look on the ingredients list you should see the words sore baits added or potassium sorbate typically store-bought juice will have a ascorbic acid to preserve the color of the juice this acid is harmless as it is a vitamin C if you are sourcing juice from a farmers market or local orchard fantastic just be aware that the juice is likely unpasteurized so there's a higher chance of the site or developing infection with all the microbes in the juice for the pumpkin you will need to reach out and grab a few cans from a store be sure to grab two canned pumpkin not pumpkin pie filling we'll discuss more on how this is incorporated into the batch later to bring up the alcohol by volume we'll add in some sugar typically apple juice alone will naturally finish at five to six percent if we add sugar we'll bump our cider up to seven and a half to eight percent ABV cinnamon and nutmeg are the traditional pumpkin pie spices so they are a must for the yeast I recommend using stuff ale so4 to give a clean fruit-forward finish combined with the pumpkin flavors the high alcohol content is sufficiently masked you are welcome to try any other east though when brewing this recipe for special equipment you'll need a 12 quart kettle minimum a fermenter I'm using a bucket with lid modified for an airlock a spoon a thermometer and for bottling you need around 40 empty bottles and bottle caps a bottle capper and sanitation supplies I personally use stars' and you can find links to these products in the description of this video all right let's start brewing in the kettle on the stove pour in two gallons of apple juice start heating this to a boil add in the sugar and spices now carefully add in the canned pumpkin to the mixture do your best to avoid splashing when scooping it out of the cans the pumpkin is a very dense with the pumpkin sugar and spices added stir the ingredients in as best as possible your kitchen will start to smell strongly if pumpkin pie at this point and it will smell awesome the pumpkin won't dissolve in the mixture and will stay suspended and this is to be expected allow the mixture to come to a boil and boil for about 30 minutes stirring often while the pot is boiling on the stove prepare the fermenter by sanitizing it with the stars' and add in two and a half gallons of apple juice to the fermenter you'll want to save half a gallon of juice by refrigerating it you'll need this for bottling later with the boil complete remove the work from the stove allow it to cool for a bit no more than 70 degrees Celsius with that cooled carefully pour the countenance of the kettle into the fermenter pumpkin and all it will be hot but the remaining juice will help cool down the batch stir together the contents of the fermenter now once the temperature drops below 40 degrees you can finish the yeast with the yeast pitch move your fermenter to a cool dark area and install the airlock and allow the cider to ferment a week the first day or so you'll notice that the pumpkin will settle at to the bottom and form a very visible layer this is normal now at this point in the video if you're enjoying this recipe be sure to hit that like button and to subscribe to greens and machines to be informed when more videos like this go live after a week set up the secondary fermenter and siphon the cider off of the pumpkin layer on the bottom the pumpkin layer will resemble sludge but it should be fluid enough to pour out once you're done racking with the cider transferred to the secondary fermenter reseal the fermenter and allow the liquid to settle for an additional week you may notice that the cider might be a bit cloudy at this point this is also to be expected as boiling the apple juice causes the haze to form it is harmless so don't be afraid of drinking it with the second week up and now it is time to bottle before racking the pumpkin cider into the sanitized bottling bucket add in the half gallon of apple juice you saved from earlier the sugar in this juice will act as priming sugar to carbonate the cider and it's in the perfect amount transfer the cider to the bottling bucket and allow that to equilibria for 30 minutes before filling and capping the bottles after about 10 days the cider should be carbonated and ready to drink [Music] I hope you enjoyed this recipe if you happen to give this

to life as it would have been during the reign of king edward vii wow look at this place archaeologists alex langlands and peter ginn and historian ruth goodman are going back to the early 20th century to live the lives of edwardian farmers for a full calendar year they'll not just be farming but getting to grips with the rural industries that once brought wealth like fishing oh wow we got something and mining so far they've established themselves as an audience by setting up a home taking a rival of their first livestock and fertilizing the fields ready to grow crops with deadly quicklife [Music] now it's october time to branch out into new ventures like market gardening we've got one to go in there egg production and a beef bird but to make it a success they all need to be up and running before the frost comes then they can see in the winter with halloween [Music] in the edwardian age cheap imports of cereal crops from america meant it was no longer economically viable for british farmers to grow wheat to survive they diversified beef was one of the few things still guaranteed to provide a healthy profit so alex and peter have called on local farmer sarah burt to deliver a herd of cattle [Music] lovely looking breed well these are devons which are also known as red rubies so named after their jewel-like colour of their coat they are fantastic breed as you can see they're actually very quiet and does usually very easy to handle and they're immensely hardy as well they'll tolerate both very hot climates and very cold and wet which is just as well living around here and in the time of the edwardian times it would be very likely that they would have been used for milk as well as for meat so for novice stockman these are really ideal for us absolutely perfect and the great thing about this breed is that they are they almost completely look after themselves very economical the red ruby has been reared and bred in britain since pre-roman times what's going on there then sarah well that's called some bullying that heifer that you see riding the other cow yeah it's a sign that she's come in season that she's ready for mating herself right so she's mimicking the ball she is mimicking the ball and indeed we should get a ball here as soon as we possibly can right the cattle will be put out of pasture until the worst of the winter weather sets in i'm going to hurt the cows now if i step over here they can see out into the field to their new home look at that gorgeous [Music] it's not just the farm that they're stocking with animals the cottage needs a regular source of milk and ruth's got an edwardian solution most of your milk from your cows was going off to market one way or another commercial sort of farming and that often meant that there was next to no milk left in the countryside for families so many people kept a couple of goats in all the scruffy bits that of land and with all the scruffy bits of grazing that wouldn't be good enough for a cow they must be milked twice a day it's a job that's proving a challenge for the novice goat farmers what's she doing no she's nibbling my trousers the thing is i've seen i mean in terms of goats being milked i've seen these stands basically that you get there it's like a tabletop you walk the goat onto yeah and then you're milking them up there having done about two days worth of goat milking i can see exactly why those stands have been invented push so the milk goes into the hole [Laughter] [Music] [Music] your aim's worse than mine you do look funny like that either that is what i would call an uh compromising position peter we've got one word for you dignity that's better that's it yeah i see you relaxed lady [Music] in edwardian times the tamar valley was famed for its huge market gardening industry thousands of acres of fruit vegetables and flowers once grew here in the warm damp sheltered conditions thanks to the railways produce could be in london within 24 hours of being picked the government even produced advice for farmers who are looking to grow cash crops like strawberries board of agriculture and fisheries leaflet number 207 growing off strawberries and it's giving us information on the sort of money we expect to make on that which is really useful it says gross returns may be said to lie between 40 pounds and 60 pounds per acre that is good isn't it against stockholm that's certainly is wheat for the edwardian farmer growing strawberries was very profitable in today's money this would mean earning around 5 000 pounds per acre in this region it was clearly a lucrative crop to grow in the edwardian period was different in every part of the country and around here market gardening was the big thing you know the microclimate here is such that it's warm and wet the earliest part of the year yeah and we're on south facing slope here so these these strawberries are going to be ready and ripe long before anybody else is in the entire country so ready which means we're going to get a premium price for until them half a century ago now the team wants to bring them back to life but it's going to be a race against time the slopes must be cleared and replanted before the first frost if they're to get a crop next june first they're rescuing the few remaining strawberry plants tangled amongst the weeds we're sort of potting all these little tiny new plantlets whilst they're still attached to the parent plant so the plant sends out a runner grows a new little plantlet but while it's growing it's still fed by the main plant as it's starting to root instead of it rooting into the soil we want it to root into our little pots and once it's established then it no longer needs the parent plant and you can snip off the runner they really are ready aren't they if we left it much longer they'd have started rooting in the soil themselves and then lifting them would have damaged the roots yeah would have destroyed the plant you did such a great job in the rain no today this is the life having rescued the strawberry plants the next job is to take the terraces back to bare earth it's a chance for the farm's latest recruits to earn their heat right this one looks particularly overgrown here look at these tasty weeds you'll love it we're just going to uh stake out our goats essentially it's just got so overgrown and what we want them to do is do a little bit of hard work for us first just eat back all the plants so when it comes to turning it in in the mid-winter it's just a little bit easier machines don't clear land anywhere near as well as animals do they not nearly as good no while the goats get to work the boys are taking delivery of an important new resident to breed cattle they need a bull hi paul hi paul and local farmer paul hutchins is lending them his prized specimen oh here he is shelimo king david ii he's uh ruby red devon bull the duke of bedford he owned the majority of the land in this area and uh he believed that they were the best cattle for small farms right so in terms of sort of authenticity these are the the sorts of cows that the duke of bedford would have been promoting on these very farms here exactly he has got aristocratic lines being king david the second right okay so uh maybe he's a friend of our duke come on good boy come on yeah i'm on come on hey hey hey he's coming through coming through good boy goodbye hit your back with your girls need that gay oh god come on good boy come on come on out the hedge oh no i think he's gonna go i'm just keeping an eye on him you guys go in there i'll keep an eye on him [Music] come on david come on [Music] that's good they're saying just calm it now just calm it right there where's that food where's the food [Music] you didn't need us all right boys here we are through the gate come on now boy good boy david wow see that wasn't such a trauma [Music] although there was little money to be made from growing cereal crops in edwardian britain they were still cultivated on a small scale as animal feed in this part of devon the acidity of the soil makes it infertile a huge problem for farmers alex and peter have dealt with this by neutralizing it with quick line this scientific approach will ensure the soil is healthy enough to grow crops and in the edwardian age growing crops still relied on good old horsepower the farm has two shires and it will take their combined strength to drag the plow farmhand megan elliott's showing the boys the ropes right well this is our introduction really to the heavy horses here at the farm and uh it's a fantastic opportunity for myself and peter to get to grips with working with two horses two horse work we've done we've always had someone sort of holding our hands so this time we're we're hopefully gonna go alone and see if we can get these two to work together and of course they're working with two complete novices in peter and myself do you have any set commands that you use i do yeah to the left when you're driving them yeah um you need to say come by come by come by and then to go around to the right let's say come around come over a million shires worked the land and they were still used in farming as late as the 1950s it's just amazing to think that they've been selectively bred for that very purpose isn't it yeah it's amazing the power you know i mean 10 men can hold them down if they really wanted to go yeah if there's any hope of getting a good crop it will be vital for alex and peter to gain the trust of these equine engines see they want to walk on the ground i'm hooked up yeah i'm a little bit more nervous now [Music] it's going to be fun peter i don't know depends on your definition whoa they're used to being in the lanes pulling carts around so of course they're getting out here they've got no weight behind them and they've got this wide open space and they're a little bit they're a little bit excited they might be sensing my nervousness but i'm even more nervous now than i was about 10 minutes ago there are alex another go they'll be fine good luck right look at your hands now [Music] yep steady weighing up to a ton shire horses are capable of pulling double their body weight and could easily wrench a farmer's arm from it come on that's it good boy almost had a straight line there good boy princey it's quite nerve-wracking but there is a definite thrill to work in horses like this to be honest to me this is a much greater thrill than driving any internal combustion engines so come by come on come by good boy it's hard enough doing things with one horse but doing things for two horses just complicates the situation and then we've got to factor in the machinery such as the ploughing we've got to get straight lines because we don't get straight lines we can't weed between our crops and then when we come to harvest the crops we've got even more problems so we've got to get the basics right so we've got to get this stuff in the field right now absolutely on the money before we start powering up this field it's going to be quite a task next summer the odorian farmers will need to draw on extra labor to harvest the crops these workers were paid insider and although this was outlawed in 1887 ciders still remained a vital part of the rural economy and farms were judged on the quality of their scrumpy alex and peter are keen to follow in this tradition but first they need a decent crop of cider apples about a ton so they're checking out more well and keys cider orchards well we've certainly got some very large apple trees but they seem remarkably bereft of any apples no apples no apples no apples i mean these might be coming to the end of their days which might account for the total enough lack of apples should we see if we can find at least one can you see there's a little little red thing up in that tree i don't know it's either a robin red breast or a single cider apple so at least we know they are apple trees at the peak of the drink's popularity there were over 350 varieties of cider apple available all right here we are oh one handful it doesn't overly healthy does it i think we're gonna have to buy some apples in peter let me eat it man the only one we've got it's a real blow actually because we couldn't possibly face the summer without our regular head of cider could we no of course not alex and peter's apple harvest may have failed but ruth funny looking things aren't they she's got a crop of local apples that she wants to preserve so they can enjoy them over the winter they're called sweet larks and they're not that sweet but they're not sour they're not like a crab apple although they look small as a crab apple and the thing that's interesting about these though as well as being a local variety is the recipes that local people put them to these are pickled i've never come across people pickling apples anywhere else but around here it's a tradition you just peel them and then pickle them rather like you would a pickled onion but with a bit of sugar in them in with the vinegar as well i suppose you know along with your cheese i think old apple does sound quite nice doesn't it actually it's quite nice thwarted in their side apple quest alex and peter are taking drastic measures well i suppose being down in the west country we can't be without our cider and uh with the woeful harvest from our own orchards we've had to go out and purchase ourselves a ton of cider apples and we're just taking them up to the press so hopefully come spring we'll have some fantastic scrumpy of our own alex and peter are taking their apples down river to a cider press at cateal in cornwall navigating the winds and tides of the tamar needs an experienced touch the boys have called on boatman joshua preston he's been sailing down the tamar all his life i suppose the best way to move anything around these very very steep valleys is via the river via the river exactly yeah not from plymouth with dot dung limestone yeah and then produce of course from the market gardens up here straight down to davenport market basically every industry in this valley for market gardening the mining and farming was reliant on one river a highway at its peak almost a thousand vessels a year passed along the tamar at cateal they're met by cyber press manager chris groves here we go thank you so much joshua that's good yeah anytime i can help with that i think we'll take you up on that offer and we'll be here to help you cheers joshua thanks so much see you later we'll see you shortly cider is simply made by fermenting apple juice so the first job is to press the apples to extract the juice using a press this type of press dates as far back as the 1600s this is an absolute monster this it is yeah it's a bit of a beast of a press um yeah quite large then we've got the large beam at the top and the single screw so yeah be good to get it up and running well we've got the best part of uh about a tonne of apples okay brilliant yeah so what do you want to do with them well in the first processor we're gonna have to mill the apples so should we get them pulled yep let's get going milling the apples will turn them into what's known as pumice well it looks like the pony's got the meal working properly here you can see the two stones with the teeth in there to grind up the apples so it's now a case of just very very slowly starting to introduce the first few apples there we are just to get the pony used to the sensation of having something to pull against in devon apple thomas is traditionally bound in layers of straw to make a package or cheese ready to be pressed the word cheese originally referred to anything that was wrapped up and then what we're gradually going to do all right it's just to build up a layer radiating out from the um the center of the of the cheese right and what does this straw do it just contains it and it allows us to build the cheese up to it to a good height so we can fit all your apples in in one go so we're going to build this up in layers aren't we yes this is just going to be our our first base layer and then with the apples and that will hopefully get at least six layers going on this that's probably enough straw now we're ready to start putting on our first layer of apple promise we'll why both one is actually horrible to taste and it's hard to think how something so horrible to eat can turn into something so delightful on the palate ten months down the line but proper cider apples you see have the right mixture of sugars and of yeast and of tannins as well and it's that proper balance between the three which means that when this goes into the barrel after the press and starts to ferment it produces a sweet tasting cider a good scrumpty cider so we just plonk this in the middle a smooth layer of pumice is built up on the straw to ensure the pressure from the press will be evenly distributed so what we want to do with the straw is we just want to encourage it to break in the right place so if you just hold your hands um out flat and then you just fold it over like this and then you just use a bit of the pumice just to hold that down or push it into the pulp yeah that's it keep the edges as even as possible so that it's not too thin in places where it might leak out your side looks a lot neater than mine well i'm not sure about that we're almost there should we um start uh putting on the next layer of straw yeah i'll grab some straw roots pickle the sweet lark apples and now there must be a box to be stored for winter so i'm pouring the pickle onto my sweet logs so this was just two pints of vinegar then i boiled up with a pound of sugar and i poached the apples very gently in the vinegar as it was cooking and then as soon as the apples began to soften i'll whisk them out and let them cool and then i boiled the vinegar on for another half an hour so that it reduced somewhat so the liquor is quite sticky it should taste like like a sweet pickle sort of like solid chutney or something [Applause] [Music] six layers of thomas have been built now the cheeses are ready to be pressed the head block alone weighs half a ton allowing the screw to deliver several tons of pressure you can really see it coming out now peter look at the volume cider look at the color of it apples are 80 water so a ton will produce up to 100 gallons of cider it's really flowing being highly acidic cider is naturally germ free and many times in history it was safer to drink than water it really is remarkable isn't it how this straw is acting like a bag and holding all of the apple in i've never seen that before that's brilliant so simple all right the tommy bar yeah excellent it's quite a large one so over the next few days the pressure will be gradually increased to get the most out of the promise putting some serious pressure on it it would have been a sort of three or four day process right for a proper farmhouse scrumpy exactly yeah you have to be very patient with these things perfect here we go [Applause] the apple juice is poured into barrels where it will be left for over six months to ferment and mature to produce the siding excellent [Music] that you're taking over when we get to the tamar when we get to start going uphill we're still in cornwall in an age before domestic refrigeration the only way to store meat for more than a few days was to preserve it so yeah so you're cutting the skin in the cottage ruth and her daughter eve are preserving a leg using salt when you're salting a leg of pork you're trying to get it to preserve you're trying to get the salt into it before infection can get inside and one of the things that makes it easier makes it more reliable as a process is to take the bone out so salt obviously as it moves into the meat preserves the meat but if it moves too fast it can burn it salt sucks the moisture out of the flesh drying it out to preserve it ruth's using a mixture of different sized salt crystals to penetrate the meat at different speeds ensuring all the tissue is preserved and i shall be wanting all of that sugar she also adds molasses which helps draw out the moisture and some cloves for flavor the salt mix is always called a pickle i mean nowadays we tend to think pickle just means vinegar but the old word pickle meant anything that you preserved something in all right let's just put him into the salting trough okay and rub it firmly into the meat but you do want to make sure that you get the mix in every little tiny nook and cranny if you feel the finer salt is already sinking into the meat and you're left with the big crystals on the surface i mean it's only been on a minute and already changes are happening yeah it's getting in the way applying weight speeds up the drying process clunk so we should see dripping oh it is yeah they're tipping already it's dripping already excellent right bones can go in the stock pot okay trotter that's for tea joshua's returned to katil key to transport the cider back to the farm i don't think i've ever worked so hard for a pint of cider peter no well we're all looking forward to that the barrel of cider weighs getting on for a quarter of a ton so joshua's craning it into his boat using a barrel hitch once or not every boatman would have known steady guys precious cargo there look very precious cargo we're not talking about peter either the eagle has landed we've got the wind on us you know here the wind on the tamar is unpredictable so sailors often relied on their oars rather than their sails to navigate the river but they were at the mercy of the river's tides joshua i feel like it's uh it's it's our side of it that maybe we should be doing some of the hard work here so uh is it time for a little uh rowing tutorial i would think so yeah um just give the the or just a little twist as she comes out right [Music] so basically all passage on this river and all the industries that rely on it are dictated to by the tides exactly right you know you work the tide up and you work the tide out again right if conditions aren't right we don't sail [Music] and are these the remnants of market gardens back over my shoulder there yes these are old edwardian market gardens yep look at that peter paver up and away we go and we're bound for santiago do you know the rest of that one well oh fab it's huge good as well as the lag of pork ruth's also got a side of bacon from the slaughtered pig to preserve it for the winter she's using a different method of preservation smoking a technique that dates back to prehistoric times the winter coming on it's important to have quite big stocks of preserved food of one sort or another and of course smoking is a fabulous method brilliant that is a perfect fit it's gonna be fairly solid when you kill a pig a pig is a big beast you can't possibly eat it all fresh in the few days you've got before it starts to turn so you've got to sort of divide the beast up and you eat those things you can't preserve so the first things you eat are things like the liver and so forth and then everything else you sort of have to get into a sort of a keeping pattern a holding pattern some things you eat fairly quickly but a salted and smoked joint will keep for months and months and months there you go you'll flip your bacon it's going to do a number of slices this isn't it and is that hanging about this right that's perfect right in the middle lets the smoke get all rounded yeah now to start with i want the fire out here nowhere near the barrel i want it out the front because to start a fire you're going to get lots of flame coming off it and flame is no good for smoking meat because i don't want to cook the meat i want it to smoke and that means that the smoke around the meat has to be cold not hot so this little hot fire i'm already going to start damping down smoking the meat not only dries it it introduces the preservative formaldehyde into the flesh and wards off insects keeping it maggot free so it's a balancing act you don't want to put the fire out but on the other hand you don't want too much fire that's good temperature is it it's nice and cool in there it's cool good that's what we want i'll defy any bacteria to live in that it's been two weeks since alex and ruth rescued the strawberry plants from the abandoned market garden now these new plants must be separated from the mother plant but will they have taken from the time it was established in 1883 the royal sovereign strawberry became the breed of choice for market gardeners in the tamar valley these very very young plants i could force on in the greenhouse but to be honest if i'm to have a big commercial edwardian style market garden i'm going to have to buy in the best part of 300 plants because it was so critical really in terms of money making to have as many plants as possible for that very very small window in the early season really it was something of a gold rush for edwardian market gardeners if you could get your strawberries up to london before any other producer then you stood a chance of getting the best prices but of course this means that all your eggs are very much in the same basket and if it goes wrong you get pests in you get disease you get mildew and everything will come crashing down around you and all that year's worth of work will go to waste on the market garden slopes the goats have cleared the bigger weeds but now it's down to back-breaking manpower to clear the rest [Music] on slopes like these you can't get machinery in it's just too steep you try to get a horse to pull a plow up and down here a horse would struggle you wouldn't be able to get any traction and pull and you'd also tumble the soil down the hill much too quickly so it's back to the ancient hand methods nobody's ever under any illusions that market gardening is easy but when you just look at the size of ground to be covered all by hand with next and nothing to help it's quite a prospect [Music] with the market gardening endeavour underway and king david the prized bull getting to grips with his new herd of ruby reds alex is keen to set up another new edwardian enterprise chickens have always been a part of the uh the british farmyard scene but it's really in the edwardian period that they go from being a kind of hangar on around the farm yard to a proper business and an enterprise in their own right so me being a big fan of chickens i'm looking forward to having my own paltry keysight concern he's come across an edwardian photograph giving a clue about the chicken enterprise that was once here at moore welum i'm trying to think of a location for my poultry concern and in this photograph there's actually one here located just beyond these cottages here and there just behind it is the poultry concern so what i want to do is i want to go back into the edwardian period and i want to recreate this poultry concern here just alongside this cottage in the corner of a field he's found a couple of chicken huts very like the ones in the photograph they've been given a tip off that this old chicken hutch is uh is spare and free to be salvaged so uh just have a look at its condition i'm sure we can get a good chicken out of this ah peter this is looking good not bad is it looks fairly solid in pretty good shape actually just come round the end yeah look at these nest boxes no bone dry absolutely bone dry well not anymore but no but that's a good sign isn't it a fantastic sign having dismantled the huts the boys are taking them down to the keysight the same location the edwardian enterprise was in we're against it really it's already getting getting cold now and you know one of the things you'd want from your commercial poultry enterprise is for your birds to be laying into late autumn and early winter because that's where the real market for eggs would have been in the edwardian period so we've got to waste no time in getting this thing set up getting the birds in getting them happy and getting them laying ah okay so there's the nesting box she's doing spin round we're just [Music] straight on top yeah yeah [Music] right so your portrait concerned it looks a bit kind of eastern block circa 1953 or something it's not looking like the most industrious egg producing meat producing enterprise at the moment is it to expand the enterprise alex has ordered a consignment of new birds they look lovely be good to get some uh new blood into the flock [Music] thank you lovely oh here we go chickens welcome to your new home there you go let's get these fellas in the hutch we'll have to lock them in there for a good two or three days i think get them used to their home so you know where yes yep and you go boy go on and you can okay here we go he's a little bird as well him so he will definitely in the cottage the pork's been salting for over a week and most of the liquid has been drawn out of course on an edwardian farm the chances are that we wouldn't have kept this for our own consumption we'd have sold it a ham sold to a urban family could buy you an awful lot of bread and jam outside the bacon's been smoked for three days it too is ready to be stored for winter smoking away merrily so i'll just hang this up in the cottage now and as long as we keep the flies off it it should be pretty good for the last few weeks alex and peter have been practicing driving the two shires prince and tom together come on yeah tom come on okay whoa whoa princey alex is looking pretty good with the horses back up whoa stand good lads right now they're using the horses to pull a harrow to spread the heaps of lime fertilizer across the arable field come on boys that's it boys come on good lads good lads good boys come on good lad i have this really really bad thing that i do is i try and drive them like i'm trying to drive a mini metro you know and you're correcting yourself all the time and actually it's about picking a point on the horizon and aiming for that and if it's slightly off course bring them around more like an oil tanker or a battleship rather than a you know a quick change come on it's the most important thing to get to grips with and i you know i'm incredibly anxious about it because it's it's not something you learn overnight and it's maybe a bit arrogant of both peter and myself to think that we can but we've got to have a go at it we've really got to have a you know a really a stab at it and see if we um see if we can get close walk on walk on walk on good boys [Music] not all the line will be going on the field to the edwardian farmer it was a wonder product as cement lime wash even disinfectant but as quick lime it's highly caustic to make it safe it must be added to water or slaked to produce harmless lime putty it is having quite a violent reaction and the steam that is coming off this this is going to get up to roasting temperatures in the next few days so we just need to get enough water in there we've got two barrels worth this is going to serve us really well for any building projects we have on later in the year you can really feel the heat coming off this can't you yep this is sort of barbecue territory isn't it pretty much the line will be left for a few days to continue to slake thank the lord for diy stores peter good the slate lime putty must now be stored in a bowl in edwardian times barrels or casks transported produce across the british empire they played a vital role in british economic life so the barrel maker or cooper was a man of status once there were thousands of coopers in britain now there are just a handful peter's travelled to saint fagan's in cardiff to meet the only cooper left in wales hi andrew pleasure to meet you he's not using any form of template you haven't made any measurements at all this is all my eyes it's a lot going on and and i think it has to be passed on you have to physically do it to understand it aluminiums plastics other materials have come on board which have killed off so many aspects of the craft which is which is a shame yeah because once you lose the knowledge and the know-how you don't bring it back the barrel's strength will come from its curved shape so the straight wooden staves must be bent right so what do you do now what i got in my hand is called a swab right which is basically a bit of sacking on a piece of wood um but it's an ideal way of actually getting water into the inside of the cask and that water will eventually turn into steam because of the heat and that will go into the pores of the wood and over a period of time uh we will be able to make the timber hot enough and pliable now we can draw all the staves together the only thing holding the barrel together will be these iron hoops we'll start driving this hoop which is on the middle here yep down towards the bottom so uh let me say hold the driver like that right so make sure it protects your knuckles if you slips off the hoop just let it go okay okay and we walk around quietly okay the steam has softened the staves so they can be bent into the familiar curved barrel shape held in place by the hoops yet again i've had the pleasure to witness a craft that sort of takes years to learn and a lifetime to perfect [Music] i mean all of this process is done by eye but the final result is a work of art hey there sir well done [Music] back at the farm the chicken concern is up and running and the new birds are settling into life in their new home one of the ways in which a poultry concern could make a lot of money for you is if you could encourage your birds to lay eggs throughout the winter because traditionally birds when it gets colder and there's not much as much food around they tend to go off laying so i'm taking some tips here from the board of agriculture and fisheries and these are a fantastic set of leaflets published in 1915. so i'm just looking here at a leaflet that's actually entitled winter egg production what's going to be critical is that they've got something in their bellies which makes them think i've got plenty of food store i can carry on producing eggs the government issued leaflets to help farmers maximize profits here they suggest making a nutritious feed to sustain them through the winter greens wheat maize and bran are mixed with a less appetizing ingredient critical element to their diet if they are going to lay is shell or grit okay because otherwise if they haven't got access to enough shell what they start doing is they start eating their own eggs to get the shell and that is disaster the danger is if i feed my chickens this but they're still not happy for some reason and that could be because the huts aren't sheltered enough for because you know there's a fox running around every night you know if they're not happy all this feed will be a waste so now for the moment of truth to see if the chickens will take to my uh winter feed mix [Music] it's feed time and i've got a special little mix for you we are like that straight from the bucket [Music] hungry little birds i think i can safely say that's been a success [Music] peter's brought the barrel back to the farm ready to load with the lime putty this lime has done most of its slaking it's been a really violent reaction when we added the water you can see it has burnt all the wood timber that we put in here but this line will continue to slake and the longer you leave the lime the better quality it will be this is really really good stuff if i do say so myself [Music] this lime putty will last in this barrel for a thousand years if not longer [Applause] [Music] so this is one barrel of lime ready to store and the shape of this barrel means you can really steer it quite easily rock it one way or another it's late october and alex's chicken concern is finally paying off it seems the keysight chicken huts and the nutritious feed as a winning combination for egg production alex is keen to capitalize how can i help you well i wonder if you care to engage with me in an enterprise the hens are doing such a great job the team are getting more eggs than they can sell it's great this i mean a harvest already everything else will be known so far you know the market gardening bringing in the beef cattle we won't see the result for months and months and months this already a small income ruth's preserving the surplus eggs in lime and water this stops air getting taller so they'll stay fresh for longer the lime kills bacteria by having the lime in it i've got a sterile solution that's going to stay sterile however long the eggs are in it [Music] the eggs will be stored in the larder together with the rest of the preserved food it's important the larder stays dry a challenge when living in damp conditions next to a river ruth's found a solution in an edwardian household manual so the best way a book of household hints and recipes and it's got a piece a wholesome pantry a small box of unslated lime kept in the pantry will absorb all impurities and keep the air beautifully dry and sweet well that makes absolute sense unselect or quick lime is trying to draw all the water to it and that will draw it out of the atmosphere hopefully keep the door shut my pantry therefore will be a dry place instead of a damp place looks like we might actually have something to eat this winter the end of october will bring the first frosts of winter in the market garden the strawberries must be planted before the ground hardens if they're to get a crop next june in the hope of ensuring a bumper harvest alex has brought in hundreds of extra strawberry plants to supplement those rescued from the slopes hey these are strawberries yep we've got a fair few hundred here gosh we are just gonna have to weed like absolute heroes to prepare the ground for these i think we're gonna have to start casting the net a little further a little wider and see if we can find some some soft fruit growers in the valley market gardeners would employ dozens of workers not just to plant but also to weed and harvest throughout the year now we're looking for something that's really thick yeah so yeah that's right ron luke's family has been growing strawberries here in the tamar valley for generations and you said this is what your family is to do oh my family do a lot of these yes yes we sell them all the southwest of england we used to grow about half a million strawberry plants [Music] it's really labor intensive work very labor-intensive but of course if you get a good crop of strawberries it's very rewarding because it has a high cash crop isn't it yeah does bring in a lot of money so so it's worth having labor yes it is planting the strawberries is an exacting job the rose must be 18 inches apart and the plants firmly bedded into the soil my father used to come along when we were planting he'd do his tests here a one leaf test you used to call it you had to catch all one leaf and pull it and it fit the plant came back the ground you hadn't planted it properly you were in trouble no trying again [Music] here we go last one for me i think this is the biggest of the bunch there we are done so we've got what five to six months to wait yeah so it all depends on how early the spring is isn't it oh it's quite exciting really [Music] with their new enterprises up and running the team have earned a celebration it's october the 31st so tonight they're having a special halloween meal and alex has brought something for the table well it does give me great pleasure to eat my own chickens but whatever you do i'm sure it'll taste delicious i'll wait and see [Music] nice firm skin chicken was the sort of dish you had for special days without battery farming of course it took a lot more to raise the chicken for the table and therefore they cost more edwardian britain chicken was really a rich man's meat most ordinary people didn't have chicken on a regular basis for the edwardian farmer a dish like this would have stretched to several meals and then the whole chicken goes on top i want the whole chicken because obviously i'm trying to get maximum flavor out of them if you use a modern supermarket chicken to cook something like this it's pretty insipid it's not very exciting food [Music] but if you're using a bird that's been running around that's a bit older had time to develop a bit of flavor not only does this sort of cooking make it something delicious when it would be a bit stringy if it was roasted but it actually makes a dish that's really nice it's a set of stronger poultry flavours that modern techniques have sort of made us forget [Music] traditionally halloween marked the first day of winter hi thank you it's a heck of a nice out there they've invited an expert in english folklore professor this was the great festival that opened winter the most terrifying of all the seasons it's the one in which most people died here in west devon this is the season you start to feel dartmore stretching out its mighty claws towards you in the night this is the season when the wild geese come over and their voices in the voice the wind wailing about the moor you hear the gabriel hounds the witch towns the hounds of hell dark and with fiery eyes and tongues coming for you in the night and as you pass the abandoned mine shaft the more and hear the air trapped sobbing within you hear the voices the souls in hell rising in torment that's where you know christmas is on its way [Music] so what are we having tonight we're having one of alex's chickens what is actually [Music] it's the moment of truth for alex's chicken so i've got no idea what he's going to taste like if you'll just excuse fingers there chris excellent thank you it's um full of body uh but but also for the flavor right was that a compliment i think it might have bitten i could mean it was a bit stringy actually after dinner it's time for halloween [Music] this game is absolutely vile it's pure sadism the idea is to see if you can bite off one of the apples by getting your teeth right through and the reason why the candles are there is if you drag the uh apple down too much then the hot wax will spill over your face [Laughter] has he got it [Music] the reason why all these games tend to happen so much around halloween is staying cheerful in the face becoming dark and cold there's an enormous amount of laughter this evening and that's the greatest tradition of all [Music] next time on edwardian new technology and new ways manufacturing", "jhI5MRswSVM":

"qDtCIF7fW0o": "[Music] hi my name is kayla welcome to my page if you're new here don't worry i am new here too and i am really excited to share this recipe with you guys so today we are making a cider whiskey poach puff pastry caramel apple pie bun and i am really excited to share that with you and it's on the easier end of my recipes it's not as complex um there's only a few steps but it will taste like you've done a million if you do it the way i show you and i hope you do and i hope you tag me and try it and like and subscribe and hit the notification bell and it will not keep you too long because i want you to see this recipe and i really want you to try it so without further ado [Applause] [Music] so this recipe is really easy i promise and we are just going to start by peeling as many apples as we want to peel and we're not going to core them we are going to use our melon baller i just used some apples that needed to be eaten or utilized because they're kind of on their last leg and i'm just taking the melon baller to scoop out the little area [Music] so [Music] so okay you can use whatever seasonings you want but these are my go-to's and this is what i'm using for this recipe [Music] so you can use whatever kind of whiskey you want as much as you want but this is how much i'm using and i'm just going to put a lid on this bring it over to the stove give it a good stir one more time add some lemon zest to it and then i'm going to put my apples in give your apples about 15 minutes but don't leave them in there for too long and then we are going to take some sugar some brown sugar and some lemon zest honestly as much as you want of all three and give it a good mix because we are going to roll our apples in it [Music] this part is optional as well but i'm going to take a bit of melted butter and brush a little bit over the apples before i roll them in our sugar mixture and then we're going to get them ready for the pastry [Music] and i'm just sprinkling some sugar in the apples because why not and then we're going to get our puff pastries some shape cutters and our melted butter and get that rolled out [Music] so [Music] you can also stuff these apples with whatever but today i'm choosing caramels and we are just going to pop a couple in the apple and really fold up the corner and the end pieces and it's really easy make sure you pinch them nice and good though because you don't want them to come open when they bake [Music] [Music] so we are going to take that shape and we are going to use it to cut out basically like little leaves you don't have to do this but i did and you don't even have to cut the little designs into them like this but i did [Music] we are going to brush these with egg wash to attach the little leaves and then all of these little apple pie bombs are going to go into the oven for about 35-40 minutes [Music] so and this is what they look like out of the oven i am just going to add some caramel drizzle to it you can have this with a couple scoops of ice cream you can have it by itself but let's crack this bad boy open and look inside you", "SH-rCbmepv8": "[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] you", "lepq9wEw_9A": "apples they keep the doctor way the prohibition had a major impact on farming apples in particular let's go back for a second remember at Johnny Appleseed most know him for planting acres of apples across the US but what is lost to history is what purpose those apples before if you go to the grocery store and look at the produce you notice that apples are the most popular item they're well known varietals include Red Delicious Granny Smith Golden Delicious the list goes on and on likewise if you drink wine at a restaurant you notice that there are tons of options in all different grape varietals Merlot Pinot Noir Shiraz all of these types are good for winemaking but at a store they're just red in green grapes can be very different from each other type variants sugar levels acidity and tannins among other things if you don't know what tannins are they're the reason why if you drink some wine your teeth and gums still feel dry okay so what's the point of all this grape talk you see grapes and apples are very similar both have a mountain of different varieties in 1905 WHU Reagan wrote a book entitled nomenclature of the Apple a catalog of known varieties referred to in American publications from 1804 to 1904 this book labelled out over 17,000 known for riotous of Apple some of them were repeats yes but that's a far cry from the amount of apples that are well known today apples were popular in America for really only one reason people wanted booze that's what it really comes down to grapes are a well-known source of making wine but growing grapes needs to right climate that's why the majority of wine comes from either Italy then or South America now both are warm climates where grapes thrive yes grapes can grow in California but we're talking pretty early in American history here majority people were on an East Coast the cold snowy East Coast where grapes don't grow hey wait you might be thinking why not just ship some wine over from Europe for a multitude of reasons this was a bad idea the first reason being that shipping across the Atlantic was pretty expensive these trips took months after all but also untreated wine has a pretty short shelf life in case you didn't know when wine turns bad it becomes vinegar vinegar is Latin for sour wine people didn't understand the process back then of what turn grape juice into wine they couldn't see that there were microbes eating out the sugars in the mixture in pooping out alcohol and when left untreated other microbes eat the alcohol in poop out acetic acid the main ingredients of vinegar it wasn't until Napoleon hired Louis Pasteur to help the French wine industry discover why so much wine was become soured that the pasteurization process was invented this process took the wine and killed the microbes thereby not letting it ferments further into vinegar which can then be packaged and shipped anywhere in the world but this wasn't until 1865 this is a very long way of saying that Americans wanted alcohol but couldn't without a hearty crop that has lots of sugar and has a good taste to it not only was alcohol a way of entertainment but it's also a way of life sewer systems weren't built in America until the 1850s and it was pretty hard to get clean water back then however alcohol was a way of sterilizing the water beer was a common way to get water as a process of brewing sterilize the water and the alcohol kept microbes away however beer was more of a German beverage and early America was predominantly British however plants have a way of filtering out water from everything else so fruit juice is a pretty good way to get water but in the land where grapes can't grow what can we grow you guessed it the almighty apple thus the American frontier gave rise to apple orchards Johnny Appleseed was a trailblazer who planted apple orchards for a rising frontiersman however the majority of the apples he planted were for brewing not eating the Apple could handle the cold harsh winters and the harvest will be full of apples next fault in fact the cold winters actually gave birth to a concentrated drink called Applejack the process included leaving the apple cider outside during the winter where the water would freeze alcohol however has a much lower freezing point and didn't freeze the frozen water was taken out of the mixture thereby freeze to stealing the cider this process would actually preserve a cider longer because the microbes that ferments will die if the alcohol levels are too high so we talked about the rise of the Apple now it's time for the fall Prohibition came into effect in 1920 breweries across America scramble to stay afloat Goose island a popular brewery in Chicago started selling soda Yuling and anheuser-busch started selling ice cream so now what our apple orchard supposed to do a lot of the crop was intended to be brewed but not all of it there are still some apples they can eat raw legally apple orchards had no reason to sell apples me for brewing they didn't taste good raw they were actually called spitters simply because you take a bite out of them and they were so bittersweet people spat them out so they stopped growing them and instead focus on apples for eating however cider was already on a decline already cider was a common drink in colonial in frontier times however it was starting to fade by the late 1800s German immigrants brought with them a love for beer in the Midwest soiled help grow the barley cider was starting to seem like a poor man's drink since cider was more of a hodgepodge of different apple juices something just thrown together William Henry Harrison ran his campaign trying to appeal to the everyman by becoming the log cabin and hard cider candidate two things that appeal to a country of frontiersman with a belief of manifest destiny before in the colonial times it was quite common for everyone to own apple trees cider was mainly a homemade product however with modernity created breweries this industrialization made people give up their old frontier style way of life they thought why should i toil to make cider that might not even turn out good when I can have whiskey made by state-of-the-art technology a fancy new factory today's apples don't make cider like they used to simply because they weren't designed to be brewed cider is making resurgence along with craft beer but it will take decades to make apples into what they once were some varieties of apples still exists that are good for brewing but it seems that everyone forgot about cider people have just assumed after years of being five varieties of apples that that all there is even one of the most popular thing that people think as a cider doesn't even have apples in it Redd's Apple ale listen ingredients on the websites it includes water corn syrup barley malt yeast hop extracts but no apples just apple flavoring it is literally a beer that they add apple flavor to Smith and Forge another MillerCoors product advertises its product as something from dayz far gone it claims that it is made just like cider used to be back in early American times but they also put flavorings in it to give it an apple taste if you think I'm complaining too much right now just think what people would say if someone had it flavoring to make wine tastes more like grape juice wine doesn't taste like grape juice and cider doesn't taste like apple juice but cider has been popular for almost a hundred years so how would anyone know better even though they changed a lot apples are great historical symbol for the successes of America cider is an American classic just as much as apple pie thanks for watching [Music] hey everybody I hope you liked that video do me

beautiful classroom for northern brewers Minneapolis store today we're going to talk about how to make hard cider the easy way and we're going to do it in three simple steps the first step is all about cleaning and sanitation cleaning is the most important part because it helps to remove any organic soils from the surface of your fermenter sanitation is really key because it helps to kill on any kind of living yeast or microorganisms that might end up affecting the flavor of our cider down the road Northern Brewer carries a couple of different products that work really well one is going to be easy clean and another is one-step these products will help to clean and sanitize and they do it all in one easy process we get questions all the time about dish soap can we use dish soap for cleaning and sanitation you can but it's typically not recommended because dish soap is going to have an aroma to it and maybe be oil-based those oils can get into your fermenter and create a film and sometimes a residue that could end up in your final project so let's get started let's clean everything up [Music] now that we've cleaned and sanitized our fermenter it's time to move on to step two step two was all about selecting your juice you don't need to own an orchard in order to make hard cider you can use any store-bought apple juice or even an apple cider but there's a couple of things that you want to be aware of look at the label couple of things are important you're gonna look at whether the juices past your eyes or not most juice you get from the grocery store is going to be pasteurized I recommend getting a pasteurized juice because it ensures that there's no living organisms or wild yeast already present in the jug one other thing you want to look at turn it over and look at the ingredients list you're gonna want to make sure that your cider or your juice that you're using is not going to be stabilized now stabilized is not a word that you'll see on the label but one thing that you might see is sulfite you might also see sorbate or benzoate these are all stabilizers that help to prevent fermentation for juices that you're gonna drink without any alcohol in them as you get them from the grocery store that's great but if we want to ferment these juices we need to make sure that there's nothing that's going to inhibit the fermentation of the yeast we pitch into the fermenter step three pitching your yeast you've got a couple of different options you can use some of the more traditional yeasts that you might look at one is gonna be the Y yeast forty seven sixty six does a great job to ferment out all the sugars that are available gives you a nice cider character without giving too many additional flavors another option you might have is by the white labs company this seven seventy five by white labs is an English cider yeast very clean dry fermentation and really nice for your traditional English style ciders one of my favorite options that I like to use is the red star cote de blanc dry yeast I find that this yeast gives a little bit residual sweetness which I like it doesn't ferment out completely dry and gives retains a nice Apple character in the end so if you're working with specific varietals this is a great yeast to help draw out that specific flavor some other options you might consider might be a Belgian ale yeast maybe an English ale yeast and of course white wine and even red wine yeast will work great for this application if you want to try something a little bit funky give it a little bit more character you can always try maybe a French saison yeast like why use 37:11 or you could even move into one of the more sour cultures like the Y yeast rosa layer blend that's going to contain Saccharomyces lactobacillus pedia caucus and also Brettanomyces your apple juice is probably going to ferment to about 4 to 5 percent alcohol if you don't add any additional sugar if you'd like to boost that alcohol a little bit you have to add some more form animals you can do this a couple of different ways you can use either priming sugar corn sugar bottling sugar in a larger quantity if you'd like a couple of pounds and a five gallon batch would boost your gravity a couple of a couple percentage points probably you could also use table sugar keep in mind the corn sugar and the table sugar which is sucrose doesn't have a lot of character to it so you're gonna get alcohol but you're not gonna get a depth or a complexity if you're looking for more depth and complexity you might try brown sugar which is cane sugar or you might also try maybe a Belgian candy sugar which is gonna be more of a beet sugar and we'll give a little bit more flavor profile as well some other considerations you might make maple syrup is very common and if you want to give it a nice twist maybe try some agave syrup if you'd like to look into adding some fruit or maybe some spice into your cider you have a couple of options there - fresh fruit is always gonna be the best but you want to make sure that you're not adding too much wild yeast that might be on the fruit already some options that you have to avoid that would be using any of our purees or any of our fruit bases some nice flavors that go along with the apple cider might be apricot or pear cherry or even blackcurrant if you're looking at maybe adding some spices you have some options there to some things that work really well might be candied ginger maybe some vanilla bean and also perhaps some cinnamon sticks most ciders on the market are carbonated and you can carbonate yours as well by adding a small amount of priming sugar to the bottle just like you would to bottle conditioned a beer and then waiting one to two weeks for that carbonation to build up if you prefer a sweeter cider I recommend letting your fermentation finish out all the way and then back sweetening it with some kind of sugar maybe a wine conditioner and you could use additional apple cider or even honey if you're curious about back sweetening and especially carbonating a back sweetened cider check out brewing TV episode 67 for a lot more in-depth information about how to accomplish that alright let's get started add some juice to our fermenter and pitch our yeast so today we'll pitch the red star cote de blanc now that i filled up the fermenter and pitched my yeast we're gonna wait one to two weeks your fermentation should finish out in about that much time at which point you can go into packaging in bottles so let's recap step number one clean and sanitized step number two select your juice put it into your fermenter step number three select your yeast pitch that into your fermenter in one to two weeks your fermentation is going to be finished and you'll be ready for bottling if your bottle conditioning add your sugar and wait another one to two weeks cider made easy in three steps Cheers oh how it start",

We're covering all things you need to know to get in the best pie shape of your life in celebration of my upcoming\nbook, \"The Book on Pie.\" I'm so excited today\nbecause we are talking about one of my favorite\nkind of pies, fruit pie. At its core fruit pie is one\nof the easiest pies out there. It's a little bit of fruit, of course, with sweetener and some kind of thickener to sort of bind it, but there are a lot of\nthings to consider with it. Every piece of fruit is different, every piece of fruit whether\nit's in or out of season, whether you're picking it fresh, whether it's been frozen they're\nare all kinds of factors, and all sorts of things to consider, because even if you have a great recipe, if you don't know what you're looking for your fruit pies can go awry very easily, and you can end up with\na big juicy, sappy mess. We are gonna show you\nall the tips and tricks to get fruit pies right every single time. Plus, as always, we are gonna show you where things can go wrong and\nif possible how to fix it.

(upbeat music) There aren't too many pieces of equipment that aren't covered in episode one of our four-part pie spectacular where we covered doughs and crust, so take a look at that episode for the equipment you're gonna need. The only additional pieces of equipment that can sometimes be helpful\nwhen making fruit pies, we're going to be cooking on the stovetop. You may need a nice heavy\nbottomed pot or pan, and sometimes I like to\npuree my fruit fillings for that I might use an immersion blender, a food processor, or a\nblender, anything goes. So other than that all the\ntools you need are going to be in our first episode of our\npie spectacular check it out. (piano music) The first thing to think about when you're making a fruit\npie is the fruit itself. This is the hardest thing\nto explain to people who are new to baking pies, because they already\ninherently don't understand the ingredients quite as well, and that's what I'm hoping to\nget across to everyone today. First of all, think about\nif the fruit is ripe, and in season, or firmer\nand more out of season. It's not necessarily\nbad to use out of season or firmer fruits to make a pie, in fact, it can just\nadjust the type of pie that you're making. This is one of the lessons and\nkind of the main takeaways. You wanna consider your\nmethod of preparation based on the kind of fruit you're using, so if the fruit is really\nreally ripe you may want to try a different method. I think that one of the\nmost misunderstood things about fruit pies is that many recipes just have you tossing raw\nfruit with other ingredients, putting it into a shell and baking, and of course that works, it works great, but you can also precook\nyour pie fillings. Out of season or under ripe fruit like, just by saying that you might be thinking, \"Well, that's not good fruit.\" But of course, in many\nplaces in the country and all over the world\nsometimes you get some fruit and it just isn't the best year even if it is the right season, or maybe if you're in between seasons which is where we're at right now. We're kind of just finishing summer so I can still get peaches, but they're quite firm. They're not you know, a\ngood juicy ripe peach. And then of course, I'm also\ngetting kind of fall produce, like these Concord grapes,\nand good apples, and pears. So when you're in between seasons that doesn't mean you\nshould stop making pies. It just means you wanna consider\nthe method of preparation. Out of season fruits or\nfruits that are just firmer even if they are in season, fruits that are a little less ripe. They have a tendency of course\nto be firmer and less juicy. That sounds bad, but that doesn't always\nmean they don't have flavor. These fruits can benefit from kind of concentrating\ntheir flavors using techniques like grilling or roasting. You can also macerate the fruit to help bring out some of the juices and concentrate them down. But out of season fruit or\nfirmer fruit is also really great for an often forgotten preparation, which are whole fruit pies. You can wrap a whole piece of\ncord fruit or cleaned fruit, trimmed with pie dough and bake it. It's pie at its simplest. So the firmer the fruit is\nthe more likely it's going to hold up for a longer time in the oven. These are all the kinds of\nthings that you can consider when you're choosing both\nyour method of preparation, and the kind of pie you're gonna make based on the fruit you're starting with. One of my favorite ways\nto make a fruit pie is to use a combination of fruits, sort of a blackberry blueberry situation, or a strawberry peach. There are tons of options of course when you start combining fruits, but when you're mixing up\nfruits it can be even harder to determine that juiciness level, so it's something really\nimportant to consider. I mentioned before this\nmacerating technique, I first learned about this technique from one of my baking\nmentors, Rose Levy Beranbaum. She tosses the fruit\nwith some of the sugar or all of the sugar from the recipe, and allows some of the juices to come out then reduces it down. We're gonna talk more about it later, but I bring it up now because\nit's especially great to do when using a combination of fruits. Because you can macerate\nthe fruits together, those juices are gonna get\npulled out by the sugar then you can reduce them down together, and just better control\nthe juiciness of your pies. When you wanna use a\ncombination of fruits, this is also a great time to\nconsider precooked fillings because you can precook the\nfilling either together, or separate and control that thickness to exactly where you want it. Plus, with precooked fillings you can also do different decorating techniques, like swirling them together, creating patterns, it's really an opportunity to\nmake your pie extra beautiful and extra special. So when you're thinking\nabout combinations of fruits just remember that two different\nkinds of fruits are going to have two different levels of juiciness. You wanna control that\nas best you can upfront, so that you don't end up\nwith a mess of a pie later. We can't talk about fruit\npies without covering one of the most common questions\nI get asked which is, what about frozen fruit? It is A-okay to use frozen fruit in a pie, but you do need to consider\nthe overall preparation from starting with frozen fruits to which way you're going to actually prepare your pie filling. There're a few things to consider; first of all, when you use\nfrozen fruit you do need to thaw the fruit before\nbaking it into a pie. Why? The main reason is\nbecause as the fruit thaws it releases a ton of moisture. If you use frozen fruit in the pie filling it's going to release\nthat moisture in the oven; therefore, making an incredibly soggy pie, if you thaw the fruit you\ncan control the moisture. You can either reduce the juices that come off of the thawed fruit, or you can just remove them\nleaving only the fruit behind. The choice is sort of up to you. I usually opt to reduce the juices because I want all that\nflavor from the frozen fruit. But you can see a good example here I have some frozen wild blueberries which are one of my favorite\nkinds of blueberries to use to make a blueberry pie. They are so sweet and so juicy, but they're very, very small. Even these tiny small berries\nrelease a hefty amount of juice when thawed, so it's really really important\nthat you do this step, don't skip it or you're\ngonna have a runny pie. After you thaw the fruit you can either use it\nin a precooked filling, or an uncooked raw filling. If you're using a raw filling you can either discard these\njuices as I mentioned before, or reduce them down to\nabout a third of a cup then add them back to your filling. If you want to use a precooked filling, you wanna start by reducing these juices. You wanna concentrate those flavors before you even begin cooking\nthe rest of the filling. And remember, frozen fruit\nthat's been thawed is going to break down a little bit\nfaster because it's (laughs) Bren, what is it Brimley? Did you just wink at me.\n- Yeah. (Erin laughs) - And back to bed he goes, my dog, and lessly entertaining. I don't remember what I was saying, does anyone one else. (laughs) When you're making a precooked filling with thawed frozen fruit\nremember that during the thawing the fruit is going to\nbreak down a little bit just inherently that's what\nhappens when you freeze and thaw the fruit. Some of that moisture comes\nout all of those things. So again, that fruit is\ngoing to break down quicker in the pot too, so you wanna really think\nabout reducing the juices before adding the fruit back in, or you could end up with\nsort of a jammier filling, unless that's what you're going for, which would be delicious too. Even if that happens you can save it just make a jammy filling, it'll be great. Now, that covers your frozen fruit for whether you're using a\ncooked filling or raw filling, but also what about\nfreezing the fruit yourself. One of the best ways to have\ngood seasonal fruit year round is to freeze a little when it's good. Go to the farm and pick a little, or if you've got a bush out\nin your yard, or a tree, pick the good stuff and freeze\nthe things that are good for freezing; berries, stone fruit, lots of things freeze great. What I like to do is a method\nthat is formerly called IQF, or Individually Quick Frozen. This is sort of a home version, so it's not the appropriate, or full way that they would do this if they were doing it industrially. But what you wanna do is you\nwant to arrange your fruit in an even layer on a sheet pan. The fruit to be barely touching, but you don't want it touching too much. You put the whole sheet\npan into the freezer and freeze the fruit until it\nis fully, fully, fully frozen. After that point, the fruit\ncan pop off of the sheet tray and be put into a storage\ncontainer, a zip top, plastic bag, whatever you prefer. Individually quick freezing\nthe fruit kind of helps it maintain its structure and\nshape a little bit better. So if you are freezing a pie you can still have nice big\nchunks if you want them, and a little bit more versatility with how you're gonna\nprepare your final pie. (ambient music) Let's talk about the most\ncommon kind of fruit filling, uncooked or raw fruit filling. I may have not said that\nwith as much enthusiasm as I normally talk about things here on \"Bake It Up a Notch\" because it's actually one of\nmy least favorite methods. I still use it, and I think it's important to talk about how to get the best results. But you're going to see that\nI get a little more excited about some of the other methods\nthat we're going to discuss that give you a little bit\nmore consistent results. The problem with using raw\nfruit is that we don't know that juiciness level of the fruit itself. Even if you taste a\nlittle bit of it at first you don't know how much is hiding inside that is gonna come out in the oven. This is an important time to remember some of the scientific elements\nof some of our ingredients. Sugar is hygroscopic, that means it pulls\nmoisture out of things, and so when you toss sugar\nwith an ingredient like fruit, it starts to pull some of the juices out. If it does that in the oven you end up with a very soggy, juicy pie. If you take care of it\nbefore you put the pie into the oven in some form\nor another you'll end up with a more consistent result. I first learned about this technique from one of my baking\nmentors, Rose Levy Beranbaum, and she actually has a\ngenius recipe on Food52 that features this method and\nuses it with great results. Today I'm using it with peaches. You can see if I hold\nthis up a little bit, the peaches have been\nmacerating for several hours. During that time the sugar has\npulled a lot of moisture out of the peaches. During that maceration time when at the beginning of the\nmaceration time I tossed it with either a portion of\nthe sugar from the recipe or the entire thing, it\nsort of depends again, on what recipe you're using. I toss it a few times as it sits to kind of redistribute that sugar and make sure that it's\ntouching all of the fruit, getting all of those juices out. Once it's macerated for several hours, it can pull out as much\nas a cup of liquid, it depends on the recipe, and the type of fruit you're using, but really a lot of liquid can come out. We don't want that much liquid in our pie. We wanna reduce that\nkind of across the board, my magic number is about a 1/3 of a cup, somewhere between a 1/4 of a cup and a third of a cup is\nthe magic magic amount. So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to strain this peach mixture. I'm just gonna pour it\nright into a strainer, reserving the juices. I'll save the fruit for later. And if your fruit isn't super delicate you can actually press pretty firmly to help release some of those juices. We really wanna make sure that we get everything out of there. We want all of those juices\nto end up in our pie, but we wanna reduce some of the water. What happens by reducing some of the water is we leave just the\nsweetness of the fruit, the flavor of the fruit behind, we end up with this\nincredibly flavorful liquid. So what we'll do is we'll\ntake this to the stovetop, we'll cook it in a small pot\ntill it's about that amount. If you do this maceration process, and you only end up with about a quarter to a third of a cup of liquid just proceed with your recipe\nas is using that liquid. But at least you know before\nyou even make the pie, you know before you put it in the oven that you're in control\nof the liquid situation, you're in control the\nfilling, you got this. So we put this in a pot, we cook it down, reduce it on the stovetop\nuntil it gets the amount that we wanted. When it does it will\nlook sort of like this. It'll be slightly deeper in color, and it will be thicker and more syrupy. We wanna make sure that that\nmixture cools a little bit, but usually tossing it\nback with the fruit, the fruit itself is cool. It's you know, at room temperature. Usually this is such a\nsmall amount of liquid that you can kind of toss\nit right back into it. So now that's one of the reasons that I think fruit fillings, raw fruit fillings are so beloved is they're a little bit easier, because now all we have to do\nis toss our remaining sugar and our starch whatever\nour thickening agent is with the fruit, and then we can add that juicy liquid and any other flavorful\ningredients we're adding back in, so I'm just gonna add the sugar. This mixture uses some\nflour instead of cornstarch. I'm just gonna toss that until the fruit is\nevenly coated with both. Of course, you can use a\nspoon or spatula for this, but if you haven't been able to tell yet on \"Bake It Up a Notch,\" I\nlike to use my hands, guys. You can feel the food. You can feel what's happening. You can see if it's even, or if something's going on. All really important good stuff. Also, you might notice\nbecause I am doing this with some peaches here that\nI did not peel my peaches. This is a little Erin PSA for\nwhoever out there wants it. (upbeat music) I don't always feel my fruit. I like the peels. There's a lot of nutrients in there. There's a lot of flavor in there, There's a lot of tartness, and most of all there's\nsome thickening ability. That skin really can help\nnaturally thicken up a filling, so I like to leave it on. If you don't totally fine, peel your fruit, good for you. It's your choice, that's the customizability of pies. I know some people think\nit's a little tough even after baking, so it's totally up to you. I like the color. I like the flavor. I like what it does, and like I said there's a lot\nof nutrients in there too. All right, now our reduced juices go in. Oh my God, that looks so pretty. Get all of them, scraped like it's your Christmas bonus. Oh yes. So this mixture should look\nwhen it's done quite gloppy, and that's because the\nthickener that we're using to help thicken the final\npie is not cooked at all. This is completely raw. That's important to\nremember because people tend to forget the most important step when they are making a raw\nor uncooked fruit filling. At some point this mixture\nhas to come to a boil, or it's going to taste like starch, and it's not going to be thick enough. If it does not come to\na boil, an active boil, it's not gonna be thick\nenough when you slice it. So this is all to say that your fruit pie that's made with an uncooked\nfruit filling has to, has to, has to show\nvisible signs of bubbling, or lots of steam coming through\nthe vents of the top crust. So either way, whether it's\na single crust or lattice, and you can see bubbles\ncoming out from it, or whether it's a double crust, and maybe there's a little bubble, but lots and lots of steam then you know that that\nstarch has been activated, it's been cooked, and that pie is going to\nbe as thick as you want it. So that's the simplicity and how to make an uncooked fruit filling. (ambient music) Guys, let's talk about\nprecooked fruit fillings. These are incredibly\nunderrated in my opinion. No one knows enough about these. No one does these, and I don't know why. They make more consistent, reliable fruit pies every single time, and the feeling gets a boost of flavor from any kind of cooking that you do that concentrates those flavors. I love a precooked fruit filling. So let's talk about all the\ndifferent ways you can do it. The most common way to do\na precooked fruit filling is on the stovetop. What you're gonna do\nusually is toss the fruit with a little bit of sugar, and let it start to break down. This is that same moment\nthat we wanna consider the final texture that we want in our pie. If we want big chunks of fruit, and we want nice variance of texture, that's when we're gonna want to consider, making sure we don't cook this too long. If we cook it too long between\nthat initial cook time, and the oven time the fruit\nmight break down a lot more. This is especially important\nfor really tender fruits like berries. Other fruits like cherries,\nlike what I've got here, you know, are a little sturdier, and you have to really\nreally cook for a long time to be able to get them to break down, so you can not worry\nabout lengthier cook times and getting that juiciness\nlevel just right. After your fruit has started\nto break down a little bit with the sugar and is\nstarting to get closer to the consistency that you want, a little bit tender, some\nof those juices coming out, that's when you're gonna\nwanna add the thickener. What I like to do is stir\nsome of that thickener in with some granulated sugar. The granules of the sugar\nhelp break up the cornstarch so that when you add it to the pot as the sugar dissolves the\ncornstarch is evenly dispersed. This is also important because\nwe're going to be adding it to an already hot fruit mixture, so the cornstarch dissolves\neasily in cold liquids, but not as easily once the mixture is hot. And this is my preferred method, because I like to get\nsome of that juiciness out before I add the thickener. Once you've added the thickener you want to cook the mixture\nuntil it reaches the thickness that you're looking for. Now this is gonna vary a little bit based on the type of pie you're doing. Remember, double crust fruit\npies are gonna bake longer in the oven than single crust fruit pies, so you might wanna cook the\nfilling a little bit more for a single crust it's not\ngoing to thicken up as much in its bake time. If you add thickener to your mixture and it still isn't thick enough remember, it's going to thick\nand more as it cools down, and it needs to cool down\nbefore you put it into a crust. Putting hot filling of\nany kind into a crust unless the recipe specifically specifies to do so can make the\ncrust a little bit soggy, so I like to make sure we\ncool the filling completely before we go on. My preferred way to do this\nquickly is on a baking sheet just like this. I spread out the hot\nfilling into an even layer, and that increased surface\narea helps it cool faster, so I don't have to be\nwaiting for hours and hours as it cools in a bowl. But it's important to remember this is another precooked fruit filling, and as you can see it's a lot looser than this precooked fruit filling, that's because these are berries, berries have more juice, and I like then a juicier berry pie. So this is one of those\ntimes that it's important to remember at the end of the day pie is still about preference. All your desserts are, anything you're making at\nyour home you can customize to make it exactly how you like it. So I like a pie that holds a slice, I like to be able to lift that pie out, and not have the filling falling out. But I also like there to be\na little bit of juiciness, so what you prefer is the right way. There's no one right way to pie guys, there are so many right ways, and this is just one of them. I will say that I think precooked fillings give you the most reliable result, and they are adjustable. If your filling is a little bit too thin and you were wishing it was\nthicker even after it cooled, you can stir in a little\nbit more thickener to the cooled filling and\nreturn it to the pot to cook. If your filling is a little bit too thick you can always thin it down\nwith a little bit of water or a flavorful liquid like juice, whatever you want to kind of\nget it to the right consistency and get a juicier pie back. Once your filling has cooled completely like this triple berry filling, we can pour it right into our crust. This is going to be a\nsingle crust fruit pie with a streusel topping. So I've already par baked\nand cooled my crust, and now I'm adding the pie filling back into the cooled crust. Remember, this filling is going\nto thicken more in the oven because that starch is going to continue its thickening abilities. What is important to\nremember is I always talk about how important it is for\nfruit pies to come to a boil, but when you precook the fruit\nfilling it comes to a boil before the oven. So in the oven when it bakes\nit may actually have more of a matte effect on the surface than that kind of bubbly,\njuicy, overflowing sort of look. So it's important to remember especially when you're making a single crust pie with a precooked fruit filling that it isn't likely to bubble. Instead, it's going to get\nkind of an even matte look on the surface and that's\nhow you know it's done. (ambient music) Okay, so we talked about\nuncooked fruit fillings and precooked fruit fillings which I obviously favor a little bit, but there is something\nelse to think about. Rules are made to be broken\nso you can precook a filling and still get some of that juiciness, and that freshness from\nan uncooked filling. How do you do it? By just stirring some raw fruit into your precooked filling. I like to do this when I'm\ndoing combinations of fruit, but it's also great with fruits\nthat are particularly juicy where you want a little bit\nof juiciness in that pie. A great example is like a\nblueberry pie, or a cherry pie, this one's gonna be cherry raspberry, and that raspberries are gonna add a little bit of juiciness. They're gonna stay whole and fresh. They're gonna break down into the oven, and do all these you\nknow, juicy oven things that they like to do. And the precooked fruit\nfilling is gonna stay it's normal thicked, thicked, thicked, did I just say thicked. It's going to say it's\nnormal thickened self, and the juices from the\nraspberry are just going to kind of juice it up a little bit. So like I said rules\nare made to be broken, it doesn't have to be one or the other, in fact, if you wanna do a\npartially precooked filling, it can be both. And you know what's really crazy it didn't even need thickener. Okay, sorry. - I'm ready. - I'm ready too.\n- Are you ready? - Oh, am I ready. Okay, this is actually one of\nmy favorite types of fillings to talk about because\nit's pretty unexpected. For this filling I roasted the fruit. I first came about doing\nthis when I was working on an article for Food52 on\nhow to make an easy oven jam. Instead of having to cook\nall of it on the stovetop, and reduce it down I did it in the oven. The increased surface\narea of a baking sheet allows the fruit, the juices of the fruit to kind of spread out, and they thicken a lot quicker to kind of this jammy consistency. It's really amazing. So in that sheet pan\njam article that I wrote when the fruit was roasted\nit was tender enough that you would just sort\nof use a potato masher and mash it up and boom, you've got jam. But then one day I was\nin my kitchen thinking, \"Boom, I could have pie filling, I could have pie filling\nby roasting it,\" right? So that's what I did I gave it a try, and in my new cookbook, \"The Book on Pie,\" I have an amazing roasted strawberry pie, and an amazing roasted pineapple pie, but today, I made a roasted blueberry pie. And what is so cool about this method is the fruit stays relatively whole, and you get that kind of feeling\nof larger pieces of fruit, but the juices inside the fruit reduce in such a way that you\nusually don't even need to add thickener to the pie. Yes, that's right, no thickener,\nI can hardly believe it, but it's true. So all that is in this\npie is blueberries, sugar, and some flavoring, some\nlemon zest, some lemon juice, you know the typical\nsorts of additional things you would add to make that\nfilling taste so great. So you're gonna see I'm gonna shake it, and then my overhead\ncamera there you can see that it's firm, it's still\ngot some juiciness to it, but it's firm, and I didn't add any cornstarch. I didn't add any flour. So I've found that the cool\nthing about using roasting as a method for pie filling, not only is it pretty easy and hands off, but it also produces a filling that is really, really concentrated, and has this incredible depth of flavor. My assistant Katie, she gave a slice of that roasted strawberry pie to someone, and they said it tasted\nthe most strawberry of anything they've ever tasted. And that's how I feel about it, so this really concentrated, but also this really naturally\nbeautiful consistency. And while we're talking about\nunexpected cooking methods, another one that you might\nwanna try is grilling. Grilling fruit can kind of\nconcentrate the flavors, and give it a little bit of a char then you can just go ahead and chop it, and use it in either a\nprecooked or uncooked filling. But I love that little boost of flavor that the grilling gives it, and I also like that\nlittle bit of smokiness. So remember, it's okay\nto think outside the box with your fruit fillings, and all your pie fillings really, because you might find\nsomething unexpected that makes a really great pie. (chiming music) Crust considerations. These are the things\nyou need to think about when you are making a fruit pie. The most important thing\nis single crust pies. Single crust pies benefit from par baking. Remember, the general rule\nis that a single crust pie has less bake time in the oven, so it generally will not\nget brown sufficiently on the bottom of the crust, and you might end up with a soggy bottom, if you don't take care of par\nbaking that crust a little bit before you put your\nfilling in and bake again. Double crust pies on the other hand which of course are extremely popular in the fruit pie category and genre are usually require a longer bake time, and as a result they usually\nwill bake sufficiently in that amount of time\nincluding the bottom crust, and therefore don't require par baking. I will say again that I\nlike to bake, and par bake, and really just generally\nbake pies on a baking steel, or a pizza stone. Either one of these is great for ensuring that you get more heat\nto the bottom of the pie, and make sure that it's\nreally browning consistently, and evenly and that we don't end up with any soggy bottoms that could ruin our perfect fruit pies. (upbeat music) One of my favorite\nsub-categories of fruit pies is the upside down fruit pie. The most famous of which\nwould be the tart to tan. I like to make tart to tan, or upside down fruit pies\nwith any kind of fruit. This one I have here is pineapple. The way that you make an upside\ndown pie is very different than a typical pie because\nthere's only crust on the top which of course becomes the bottom. So we're going to invert this\npie in just a few moments. This just came out of the oven. You have to unmold it while it's hot, but it is good to give\nit a few moments to cool, because what we've done is we\nstarted with sort of a butter and sugar mixture in the pan, and then we added our fruit to that after that sugar began to\ncaramelize a little bit. It makes this sort of yummy caramel sauce, and then the fruit cooks in it. We put the dough on top, that's another thing that's so different about upside down pies\nis that the dough goes into like a hot pan, which is crazy. And then we bake it until that\npastry gets nice, and puffy, and fluffy, and perfect, and then we invert it\nwhile it's still warm, and that caramel sort\nof covers all the fruit. It even runs down in\nthe sides a little bit. It is killer, and it's actually an incredibly easy pie to make, no thickeners, no nothing. It's a great dinner party dessert. More people should be making tart to tans, let's unmold this beauty. (tranquil music) (laughs) It is normal when you unmold\na tart to tan sometimes for some of the fruit to\neither stay stuck in the pan, or to just kind of become displaced. I'm a food stylist, so I've got tweezers, but\na fork, a little spatula, whatever you got, you can\njust push your fruit back into its place. And as it cools the\ncaramel is going to harden, and it will kind of re-adhere\nitself to your crust, and make this incredibly\ndelicious, beautiful situation. So the takeaway here\nupside down fruit pies are incredibly easy. They're really adaptable to\njust about any type of fruit, and they are so delicious. If you're interested in\nmore about upside down or tart to tan let me\nknow in the comments. We're considering maybe\nmaking some more of these down the line if that would\ninterest our viewers here on \"Bake It Up a Notch.\" And in the meantime I'm\ngonna go ask my buddy Brimley what he thinks about this upside down pie. But of course, he won't get to sample it, I'll save the sampling for me. (laughs) (chiming music) So how can you tell when\nyour fruit pie is done? We've talked about it\na little bit throughout with the different cooking methods, but I still wanna put it kind of in a succinct cheaters guide\nso that you know exactly what you need to know to get\nit right every single time. If you're working with an\nuncooked or raw fruit filling, you wanna make sure that that pie bubbles, we wanna see bubbles to know that the thickener is activated. If you're working with a\nprecooked fruit filling it will have a matte sort of\ndarkened look to the surface, a slightly darker hue than\nit was when you put the pie into the oven. And another reminder people ask me a lot about pies browning too quickly. When I make fruit pies I don't always egg wash the entire pie. If I'm making a single crust\npie I might egg wash the edge. If I'm making a double crust pie I might only egg wash the top of it, because the edges tend to\nbrown enough on their own in that lengthier time in the oven. But if you find that a portion, or most of your crust\nis browning too quickly, remember, you're in\ncontrol this pie situation, you can tend part of or\nthe entire pie with foil to help it prevent continuing\nto brown excessively, and you can also reduce\nthe oven temperature. Sometimes your oven is running hot and you might not even know it, So knock the oven temperature\ndown 25 to even 50 degrees for the remainder of bake time. Just remember that when you\nknock down that temperature the bake time is gonna be longer, so keep that in mind. Don't take that pie out too soon, or you'll end up with a soggy bottom, or maybe even a runny filling. Upside down pies are slightly trickier to determine the doneness, because of course the fruit\nitself is out of your view, it's underneath the crust in the pan. So the best factor to look for is a really evenly golden brown crust. If it's only brown at the edges, it's likely not done. Don't take it out until\nit gets evenly golden, or you'll have kind of a\ndoughy bit in the center. The other thing that you can look for with upside down fruit\npies is some bubbling around the edges, around the outside where the crust kind of ends. That shows that the caramel\nunderneath is bubbling, it's steaming, and it's a good sign that it's ready to come out. (upbeat music) So here's the good news about fruit pies, if you follow the\nguidelines that I gave you in the first part of this episode, you're not gonna have a lot of mistakes. They're actually incredibly forgiving, and incredibly delicious even when you mess them up a little bit, or even when they are a little too juicy, you know, they really\nare just such great pies, they're just such great pies. But there are a few things to think about, so I wouldn't leave you\nhanging about those mistakes. The first one is right in front of me and it's one of the most common ones. I got a question a lot when\nmy first cookbook came out about one of my favorite\npies, my Concord grape pie. It's a delicious pie, really\ntart, juicy, so delicious, but it is entirely liquid when it is still hot, and that is really true for\nmost fruit pie fillings, if not all of them, actually. Yeah, yeah, it's all of them. All of them are going to\nbe loose when they're hot, so it's really important\nto let it cool entirely before you serve it. \"But Erin, I like to eat my pie warm.\" Understood, I get ya,\nI'm with you on that. We've got a solution for that. But first, here's what I'm talking about when I shake this pie you\ncan see from overhead, look how loose this filling is. This is a precooked fruit filling, which is already thicker\nthan a raw fruit filling, and it will continue to\nthicken up as this pie cools. But for right now it is\nabsolutely positively way too warm to cut. If we cut this pie it will be soup. That doesn't mean the recipe doesn't work. It doesn't mean we baked a bad pie, it just means we have to\nhave a little patience. And I know that's very difficult, especially when your\nhouse smells like pie, but you can make your\npies ahead and instead opt to refresh them. I write about this technique\nof refreshing a lot in my upcoming book \"The Book on Pie,\" but the number one thing to remember is that refreshing is possible\nboth to recrisp the crust and to gently warm the filling. My general advice when\nreheating is to start with your pie, or your slice of pie, or your individual pie,\nwhatever you're reheating, gently tented with foil. I like to start that way just in case it browns\na little bit too much in the process of reheating. Then you want to take that foil off towards the end of the\nbake time to help recrisp that outside edge of the crust to help bring a little bit of\nthe color back into your pie. You can reheat gently at\ndifferent temperatures, one of my favorite techniques is actually to put it in the oven and\nstart to preheat the oven with the pie in it to\n375 degrees Fahrenheit. If you do that it will sort\nof gently bring the pie up to temperature as the\noven comes to temperature, then you just usually need\na few minutes depending on how big the portion or entire pie if you're doing an entire pie is. You could need as little as\nfive minutes after preheating, and up to maybe 15 or even 20. Just remember still give\nit a good five-sh minutes of cool time before you dig in, but because the pie has set completely it will warm in that time, but it won't necessarily return to this sort of jiggly liquid state. So refreshing your pies\nis a great opportunity if you love a warm slice of apple pie, or any kind of fruit pie opt for reheating instead of cutting it while it's warm. Now this is one I've already\ntalked about quite a bit in this episode and it's\na really important one. This is a raw fruit filling\nthat has been baked. You see we've got kind\nof a mixture of jamminess and some pieces of whole fruit just by the nature of some of\nthat fruit being very soft, and juicy, and breaking down, and some of that fruit being\nfirmer and staying together, but I did not let this pie come to a boil. You can also notice that\nthe outside of this crust is significantly lighter\nthan the crust next to it, and that's because it\ndidn't bake quite enough. I like a really dark golden brown, crispy, flaky, crunchy crust. I want all those things. So we are cutting into this, and we are gonna see, oh my\ngosh, I can already, (chuckles) the mistakes happen part guys is my like favorite part of this show, but it's also my least favorite, it's all rolled into one, because I wanna show you\n'cause I want you to know what it looks like, but it also breaks my\nheart when the pie is not what it could be. But don't worry I'm gonna fix this pie, and we can still eat this pie. Never fear about that, I had a great question\nabout that on YouTube. No pie is wasted even mistakes happen pies not in this kitchen. So I'm cutting into this\nand you can already see I basically it won't even\nhold a line in the filling from where I'm standing. And it just, this filling did not, the thickener did not activate. So even as it sat to cool\nit didn't thicken anymore, because that thickener\ndidn't fully activate. (laughs) Well, the crust is flaky you can see that, look how flaky that is, dang! (laughs) The fruit is not even\nstaying on the slice of pie. Most of it fell back into the pie plate. So again, this would be tasty, possibly, but it might also have a\nnoticeable starch taste. I get a comment a lot on my Instagram from people who say, \"Do\nyou have any pie recipes that don't use cornstarch? I hate the way it tastes.\" I'm sure that there are people out there with incredibly strong palates\nwho can taste cornstarch, but if you use cornstarch effectively you should not taste it. The only time you should taste it is if you use it improperly, if it doesn't cook out. So if flour, cornstarch, tapioca, whatever starch you're using, they all work, they all work great, but you have to actually\nget them to the point that they can activate; otherwise, you're gonna end up with pie that is basically soup. That was gross, wasn't it? (laughs) The last major mistake that\nI do find people make a lot has to do with those things\nwe were talking about the very beginning of this episode, choosing the right preparation method for the type of fruit you're using. Remember, really, really overripe fruit actually works great in a pie, but when it's really, really overripe it's going to be very soft and very juicy. So sometimes it's best to lean into that, go with kind of a jammier method, or a precooked filling\nthat you can thicken up and get those flavors in there. Similarly, if a fruit is really firm, I mentioned you might wanna\nopt for a whole fruit option, like my apple dumpling recipe\nthat's great on Food52. You might also want to\nopt to cook that fruit in a way that concentrates the flavors that it does have. Because if you have a rock hard peach there still is juiciness\nand sugar in there, there's just not as much\nas in a really juicy, you know, really in season peach. So by grilling it or by roasting it you can kind of concentrate the flavors that are in there and kind\nof give them that boost that they need to really\nstill make a good pie. And then finally, when you've got fruit that's kind of just right, you sort of have your pick of options. You can use a raw, uncooked, filling, you can still opt to precook it, you can reduce the juices, you can kind of go any of these routes just go with what is gonna work best for the fruit and you're gonna end up with the best pie that\nthat fruit could make. (guitar music) I was like can I lift\nthis whole thing out? No not yet, (chuckles) she's\nlike, \"No, it's not possible.\" It's possible, I promise. It's pie-ssible. Yes.\n- Oh my God. - Let's talk about storing fruit pies, because unfortunately, fruit pies are one of the most sensitive to store. They really are best when they\nare made relatively fresh, or when they are refreshed\nfairly soon after being baked. So remember, when you're\nworking with an unbaked pie, they can be held in the refrigerator, you should cover them\nloosely with plastic wrap, so that the dough doesn't dry out. I usually don't like to keep pies, assembled pies like that\nunbaked in the fridge for any longer than two hours. Because again, that\nsugar is in the filling, and it's going to continue to kind of pull moisture out even if you've got a precooked, or if you're working with\nthe raw fruit filling, especially then. So no more than two\nhours in the refrigerator unbaked covered loosely with plastic wrap. Once the pies are baked\nthey are really best stored at room temperature. That's the best opportunity\nfor the crust to stay crisp, so you can just cover them\nloosely in plastic wrap, or even tend to them loosely with foil, and they're going to be\ngood for a day or two. As fruit pies sit at room temperature they will lose a little bit of\nthe crispness of their crust. So remember, they can be\nrefreshed using the methods that I talked about before which will help to recrisp the crust, and it'll also give the filling\na little bit of a warm boost to kind of get that whole pie\nback to as close as possible to when it was fresh. (upbeat music) Let's talk about\ndecorating your fruit pies. You're gonna find tons of\nideas for decorating pies in my new book, \"The Book on Pie,\" but I have a few that\nkind of are particular to fruit pies that are\nalways really fun to discuss. The first one is what's\nright in front of me and it's talking about\ndecorative techniques you can do with your crust\nspecifically your top crust. This is a piece of dough that I rolled out to make the top crust, and I've been taking some little cutouts from it using this little, these are sometimes called pie stamps, because they're not only a cutter, they also have a little plunger\nthat makes an indentation that is really cute, and\nattractive, and pretty on the final pie. What I'm doing here is\nI'm taking some cutouts from you can see kind of this indentation on the outside of my dough here. What I did was I turned\nmy pie plate upside down and gently pressed it into\nthe dough to make this guide, because what I'm going to do\nis I'm going to make a cut out from the top crust of my pie. So I'm gonna take these little snowflake pieces out eventually, and then gently unfurl this\ntop crust on top of my pie. This is particularly fun because it's a nice\nway to kind of show off your fruit filling on the inside, because you're gonna\ntake these pieces out, and you can see the color\nof your fruit filling, and you can give it some\nroom to bubble over. Plus, you can save these\nlittle cutouts as decorations for the outer edge of your pie. You can transfer them to another pie. You can bake them as pie scraps, snacks, and just munch on them, tons and tons of possibilities there. Another one of my favorite\ntop crust techniques is latticing a pie. I have a great article on Food52 that features tons of\ndifferent ways to lattice. There's so many more than\njust one way to lattice guys. There's so many ways to lattice. I also did a classic\nlattice on this pie today. Remember, they're both\nwoven and unwoven lattices, so if lattices feel difficult to you, remember, you could start\nwith one that's just unwoven. Lay all the strips one direction, then lay more strips and other direction, no weaving required. You can also use things\nlike braids and twists, multiple strands of pie dough braided, or twisted together as some of\nyour strips in your lattice, or even as edges decorative\naround the outside edge. There are so many possibilities\nof things you can do to get creative with your dough, and the best part is\nthey're all so delicious. My number one tip for using a lattice is to make the strips slightly thicker than you would if you were\njust doing a top crust, or even the bottom crust which\nyou want to be nice and thin. When you're working with a lattice you pull the strips back repeatedly, pulling them back, laying them back down, that action of pulling even\nif the dough is really nice and chilled can kind of\nstretch the dough a little bit. If you want to avoid that stretching, rolling it a little bit\nthicker helps make that strip, that lattice a little bit hardier. Plus who's mad at a little bit more crust on the top of their pie? Not I. The last thing I wanna talk\nabout is garnishing fruit pies. Because remember, you can garnish\nany kind of pie, you know, people tend to think, \"Oh, I put whipped cream on cream pies,\" or \"I put meringue on lemon pie.\" But you can really do\nthose kinds of garnishes, those finishing techniques\non anything you desire. I mentioned earlier that one\nof my all time favorite pies is Concord grape pie. So in my new pie book I have a great Concord\ngrape meringue pie recipe. I think it is so\ndelicious with, oh my God, look at this meringue. I love you, I think. It's the perfect swoop. It's the perfect, I don't\neven wanna put it on the pie, I just want to like marry it on the spatula right here, right now, and forever and ever they were happy. Oh, it's falling. (laughs) Not happy forever. I'm just gonna put this\nmeringue on the pie. Whenever I put meringue on a pie, don't forget to watch my meringue episode of \"Bake It Up a Notch,\" if you're thinking, \"I'm\nscared of meringue.\" You don't need to be scared of meringue. There's lots of amazing\nthings about meringue, and they are not scary. I like to pile my meringue a\nlittle bit more in the center than at the edges. Then I can just kind of\nscoop it out to the edges while still maintaining\nthat slightly mounted look in the front. So I pile everything in the center and then just kind of gently\npush from the center down to make kind of sloped sides on the pie. You can also not do this and just spread it in an even layer, but a little bit of a mound\nis always so beautiful, especially on a meringue pie. It makes it look so towering so mile high. It's like one of those, just\none of those things, right. And then of course, if you wanted to you could torch this meringue, because we like fire in this kitchen. But if you don't wanna torch it, it's also delicious, just like this. Remember, pies are an opportunity\nto be just as creative with your decorating as\nyou can be with something, like layer cakes, pastries, anything. There's a ton of fun to be had here, so get creative, find some pictures that\ninspire you, and get baking. You can make any kind of pie, kind of elevate it, take it to the next level with some of these fun\ndecorative techniques. Give it some swoops. Give it a nice little dollop on top, that'll look cool. That'll look cool. Was that cool?\n- Yes. - Okay. (man whispers) It wasn't, I'm gonna swoop it. (upbeat music) \u266a Yeah \u266a Thank you so much for\njoining me for this episode of \"Bake It Up a Notch\" where we talked all things fruit pies. I hope this episode arms you\nto get the most consistent and best fruit pies that you've ever had, so that you can be making\na lot more fruit pies, because you should, you should be making tons of these, especially as we head into fall, and I hope that this episode had tons of information for you. If there's any questions\nthat I did not answer be sure to leave them in the comments. I'd love to see what you're baking with #bakeitupanotch. Be sure to tune in next month for the last part of our pie spectacular. We are talking cream,\nchiffon, and cold set pies. It's gonna to be a ton of fun, don't miss it, until then happy baking. (upbeat music) \u266a Yeah \u266a", "s-ECvTnlTJk": "[Music] hi I'm Rebecca grant today we're gonna make a hot spiced apple cider it's a cold day outside and this is gonna warm us up the ingredients for this dish our brown sugar cinnamon nutmeg ginger allspice cloves apple juice or apple cider and that's it let's eat up our apple cider so I'm gonna pour 2 quarts of this you can double this recipe if you have a whole lot of friends coming over let's start eating that up now turn that stove on high and pour in your apple juice I'm putting in half a cup of brown sugar and this is why I know it's already sweetened you need that brown sugar to carry your spices otherwise like have you ever had a teaspoon of cinnamon it's gonna kill you so half a teaspoon of cinnamon goes in here and since you better that extra sugar it's gonna be okay then you do a quarter teaspoon of all the other spices cinnamon is a spice that you usually have more than a recipe than other spices the ginger is quite spicy so 1/4 teaspoon of that 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg now I use these dried ingredients they're so much less expensive than buying the whole ingredients like whole cloves whole nutmeg whole cinnamon this is a fraction of the price and now a quarter teaspoon of allspice now if you don't have allspice you can leave it out some of these spices just aren't critical and now I'm adding 1/4 teaspoon cloves now if you don't have that leave it out too I want you to be free when you're cooking now we're gonna mix that up I want those spices to dissolve in this I want to bring this up to a simmer not a boil so now I've turned this down to medium so this is my trick for getting those really cute cinnamon sticks like the restaurant supply stores the warehouse stores and they sell them like this very inexpensive and this is what I put in there it looks so pretty and the beautiful smell and aroma from the cinnamon comes into your broth but not as much as when it's already ground so this is kind of just for books so there's probably six servings of this so I'll put six of these in there now look how pretty that is that sugar is disolved those spices are in there so that's up to a simmer now oh my gosh look at that steam coming off oh it smells so good if only they had smell at YouTube maybe one day they will it's ready let's have some you can leave this on your stove for hours just keep it on low it's cold outside so this is really gonna warm me up let's try it it's fantastic that is the best spice hot apple cider I've ever had and I've ever made so make it for you and your friends enjoy your cold winter nights with your cup of hot apple cider Cheers [Music]", "_-q42cUSTYE": "this ladies and gentlemen apple pie vodka delicious dis looks okay apple pie vodka so here's how you do this we grab some apple slices okay beautiful we get those in there like a crisp our apples apples do look good right an apple a day keeps the doctor away little cinnamon stick making another infusion okay and now we come behind over those simple templates we got a speaking this bad boy up and now we hit this with some vodka okay we can fill this bad boy up with some vodka or we can just let this sit there let it marinate let his irate let us seal it up let those colors and you know let the taste infuse your shake you know a lot that's a three day infusion and put a little strain on top okay and just strain it into a shot glass and taste the deliciousness of that apple infused vodka", "FDZNwRQjRoA": "well pumpkin pie filling make a good need let's find out [Music] [Music] hey this is man-made Mead I have something I want to experiment with today I'm making a small batch Mead of hopefully apple pie Mead now I've done this with pumpkin pie filling and it turned out because of the filling and what was in it very very spicy tasting not a lot of pumpkin I'm thinking that this apple pie filling I have here because of its sugar content and I'm sure it has some spices and things in it it would probably and hopefully not be as spicy tasting we're going to make a one-gallon Mead and so I'll put my recipe up here what I'm using this one gallon Mead is going to be using avocado blossom honey from Dutch gold a witch how many else is this this is a pound of the pie filling apple pie filling or 21 ounces and then I plan on using the 11q a 2/3 now I've had I've had some more recent experience with it I like the yeast a lot it's pretty fast for omitting it doesn't have a huge ABV range which is nice because I don't really want an 18% apple pie mead it starts to feel like a moonshine at that point because it's so strong we want to kind of keep it lower so I'm gonna walk you through the process walking for what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put the pumpkin pie filling in the primary and I know that that could be problematic in some ways but I do wonder how that's gonna affect it I could put in secondary I don't really want to this time I want to try the primary and they'll be interesting let's find out first things first we're not gonna rehydrate yeast we're just gonna get our must started and we'll sprinker sprinkle our yeast on top in the end so let's get our must going with our roughly you know three and a half four pounds of honey okay I've gone ahead and skip the process of pouring the honey it's kind of boring to be honest we're just going to go ahead and add our water in and I'm getting my water from a a big old Ford gal this current the thing that I'm putting all this in is a two gallon fermenter so it will hold two gallons and I am guesstimating just a little bit with my water this time I have the four pounds of honey in there but I also want to get this water so let's go ahead and pour our water in all right here's our gallon of water as well as our four pounds of honey and we are ready to go ahead and mix it all I like to mix using a drill and a it's a really degassing stick wand but it's got a pedal on it so it works just fine I spin one way for a while and then it's been the other way [Music] all right we're gonna get it gravity reading it is currently setting with our 4 pounds of honey and 1 gallon water one point 100 which means we have around a 13.1 percent alcohol volume chance and my experience with my previous need that I used this yeast in means that I think I'll end up with some residual sweetness we'll find out there could be a little more gravity to be added to this soon because as it sits for a little bit maybe not all the honey got mixed in even though I started really well so I'll check the gravity again soon and have an update on that but we now because we're just gonna sprinkle the yeast on top we're gonna go ahead and take our pumpkin pie filling open it up and put it right in simple enough so let's go ahead and do that whoo there we go so we're gonna take this country I said pumpkin pie filling your country apple pie feel like goodness put that in there really one get all of it out taking our cue a 2/3 packet from woven and we do need to stir this in because that will help quite a bit so using my big paddle here a little stir also adding a little oxygen in you need some oxygen in your mead because that helps the yeast ferment and helps them ultimately have the best fermentation possible they need nutrients which will that add here in a second and they also need oxygen to survive so here's our oxygen and our mixing in you can rehydrate your yeast it's not always necessary and I I think I'll be okay without rehydrating at this time let's add in are these nutrient I have some pre-mixed yeast nutrient energizer here and so that again will help the yeast really thrive and have a pretty easy time permitting so we're gonna mix that in so we put our lid on and we are ready to let it sit all right lid is going on air lock of course and then my label it's just just like a little paper label that washes off the water really easily is on there now this will sit and hopefully run through the entire fermentation and we'll see how it goes and I'll give some updates over time all right so that's it making Meads pretty easy mix your water and mix your other ingredients in throw your yeast on top sprinkle it you can rehydrate it do all those things give it some nutrients you're good if I've done everything right honestly I should be able to let it go until it goes through its primary fermentation rack it into its new container and go from there should not be too many step processes too many things unless of course I run into complications where things don't ferment I do think I'm gonna run into one complication we'll find out real quick if that's true or not and that is my pumpkin pie filling is has some preservatives in it so I think there's a slight likelihood there's a slight likelihood actually no there is no interesting there is no preservative in here that's wonderful okay so then I won't run into any issues with this I might if there was a preservative that was in the the pumpkin pumpkin apple pie filling then the yeast would have had a hard time permitting on the sugars but since there's not it should be fine hopefully I'm fine I'm not

weekend in October and we saw lots of fruit prepares apple cider apple pies he isn't kidding everywhere you turn you see bright pink boxes we're going to have pie for dessert tonight and then pie for breakfast all right a lot of juicy really good apples I had a piece and it's fantastic you had a piece and you bought a whole pie back to San Diego gotta have some more you can also find apples and bags apples and baskets and apples on sticks oh we love doing Ennis oh he's just a little old country town and real enjoyable to come to what do you like to do when you're up here well we told our friends who are coming up so we have to stop and get apples for my mom she's gonna bake a pie and we have to go on down to the San Isabel and get bread for my girlfriend and so we thought we'd stop and get some prayer our selves it's very clear that in Julie and the Apple is a totally consuming subject you know it's unthinkable and probably even a little unpatriotic to leave Julian without taking a little bit of the country with you I'm probably one of the most patriotic people you're ever going to find rigidus ro News 8 on my way back to San Diego", "56PSkuovMxU": "i am honored to share this recipe with you for two reasons one it's really tasty and that's exciting but two because a vinegar pie has a long history in the south there are a few southern recipes namely southern pies that fall into the category of desperation pies and a desperation pie as the name suggests is a pie that was made with ingredients that people had on hand when really resources were scarce and situations might be kind of desperate so these desperation pies include things like chess pie shoe fly pie cornmeal pie vinegar pie is my personal favorite might sound odd to you at first but i promise the sharp acidity of apple cider vinegar and the unique sweetness of apple cider vinegar actually meld really well into the rest of the ingredients that go into this custardy delicious dessert join me in making something that is really a participation in southern history let's go as with any good pie recipe we start with our pie dough i have my pie dough here it's already chilled it was made over two hours ago and it's ready to be rolled out and fit into my pie plate if you're in time crunch you can use the store-bought crust just keep in mind that a homemade crust is better in flavor and texture so i'm going to roll this out into about an eighth of an inch thickness fit it into my pie pan trim it with about a half inch to an inch of overhang fold the overhang under and crimp the perimeter of the pie crust we're then going to line the pie crust with a piece of parchment paper fill it with pie weights and blind bake it for a little while just to help it start to crisp and brown before we put the filling in blind baking the pie crust here is necessary if you don't just throwing the filling into the raw dough and putting it in the oven won't allow the crust to bake all the way through and to become crisp and flaky i like to press down on the pie dough with my palm to help flatten it first and then when cracks appear like this one i can just push them together and press down with my thumb that way when i start rolling with the rolling pin the cracks won't widen and become elongated to get that perfect circle it's ideal to do a few passes of rolling and then turn the dough at a 90 degree angle and keep rolling and this prevents it from becoming an oblong or strange shape if you get cracks like this in your dough simply pull it together and press it together with your fingers the warmth from your fingers will help soften a little bit of the butter in the dough there which helps it stick together all right so i'm now going to press around the bottom of the edge now i'm just taking a pair of scissors and trimming around the perimeter so that there's about three quarter of an inch overhang all right and now my trick i use these two fingers and my thumb here and i press with my thumb in between these two fingers allowing it to create this nice looking round edge all right my pie crust is right here and i have a piece of parchment paper as well and i'm just going to put the parchment paper into the pie shell and i'm going to fill it with my pie weights this prevents any of the bottom of the crust from puffing up as it's baking okay i'm going to throw this into a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes and then i'm going to remove it from the oven take out the parchment paper with the pie weights and put it back in the oven just the crust by itself for another 10 minutes and this allows the crust to become lightly brown all over it's been 20 minutes and i'm going to take these out and then pop it back in for another 10. you'll notice dark spots at the bottom of the crust and that's just uncooked dough and that's why we're popping it back in for another 10 minutes until everything is lightly browned compared to all of the steps to blind bake a pie shell making the filling is so so easy we're just dumping all of the filling ingredients into a bowl and whisking until most of the sugar is dissolved and there are no pockets of flour remaining so in my bowl i'm going to combine four eggs with one half a cup of granulated sugar one half a cup of brown sugar two tablespoons of all-purpose flour one teaspoon of vanilla extract six tablespoons of melted butter three quarters of a teaspoon of kosher salt we have two tablespoons of honey and two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar these two work together to complement each other in flavor to balance the acidity with some rich deep sweetness and it's what makes this pie really kind of magical so in they go all right once you have everything in the bowl just use your whisk break the egg yolks and whisk until everything is smooth now that my crust is done blind baking we're ready to bake the whole pie so i've got my filling here it's well mixed and i'm going to pour it into my crust all right we're gonna bake this at 350 still uh but just for 30 minutes and what you're looking for is that the center of the pie doesn't jiggle when you tap the pie plate if it jiggles that means the filling hasn't set it should be after 30 minutes pretty firm and solid so let's pop it in the oven for 30 minutes i'll see in a few my pie is finished baking and i have let it cool to room temperature it's imperative that you let it cool all the way because the custard that is the filling has to cool to set completely so if you cut it while it's warm it'll kind of ooze out and that's not ideal you'll notice that the surface is browned and has kind of these like micro bubbles that have solidified on the top that's what it should look like that's great and a really easy way to decorate the pie is to just dust some powdered sugar over it it provides a really stark contrast to the deep brown of the filling and it's really beautiful this pie is a beautiful expression of some of the most wonderful parts of the south a place rich with stories and traditions and to think that this recipe came together as a means of a creative means of making the most of pantry staples during a time that was hard i think it's a really wonderful picture of the best of southern food traditions and it's also really really tasty so let me give it a shot you can see that the custard is semi-solid it's it's soft but it holds its shape it doesn't like ooze or fall apart um let's give it a go it's a lot of flavor the buttery and the salty crust complements this sweet and mouth-filling custardy center to the pie that is both sweet with the subtle richness from the molasses and the brown sugar but the vinegar in the pie is a tangy thing that you can feel in the back of your mouth kind of makes your cheeks like squeeze a little bit it's honestly not that dissimilar in flavor from a cheesecake it's got that really pleasant and slightly fruity tang that makes it so so good uh and also makes it really easy to eat a lot of give this recipe a shot if it's interesting to you or if you're curious about how vinegar could taste pleasant in a pie i promise our southern ancestors knew what they were doing so give it a shot and you'll enjoy it if you've enjoyed the video you've seen today subscribe to the southern living youtube channel where you're sure to find other videos like this one that we know you'll enjoy thanks so much see you next time bye", "wkqMjrAi7Wo": "hello everyone and welcome to my channel today i'm going to share my method for making boiled cider i love having this on hand in the fall it's great to add to any number of recipes or you can even use it as a syrup on pancakes or french toast it also makes a great gift i'm going to show you how simple this is so let's get started you're going to need apple cider some cheese cloth and a jar for storage i prefer pasteurized apple cider that i find in the grocery store but you might prefer a less processed type or an organic type and that'll work perfectly well i actually like the sweetness of the pasteurized a little bit better now we're going to be reducing this over several hours on the stove but stay tuned because i'm going to show you how you can make a perfectly clear boiled cider before you pour this into the pan i just was going to tell you i like to use the gallon size because if you're going to go to the trouble you might as well make a little bit more and this will yield about one pint for you and i like to use an older pan for this because you will find out that it does cause a little bit of scorching bring your cider to a boil and let it reduce down to an amber colored syrup this took about an hour and a half maybe two i wasn't really timing it i just let it bubble away on the stove and you can see i started up in here and now it's way down it's i'm saying about a third of the way down and here's another thing i'd like to point out this is why i like to use an older pan because you do get some scorching on here and you're going to have to really work on this later with some bar keepers friend or something like that and scour that out that's why i would rather use an older pot that i have it was from an older set and i just keep it for things like this so you're also going to notice that it's just a beautiful golden color but what you might notice in there is there's some sediment that collects in there just from the reduction so i'm going to show you how to clear that out so next we'll go over to the sink and we'll get that started i'm going to be using cheesecloth and i happen to get this at hobby lobby on sale but you can get this anywhere they have it in the grocery store i've seen it online so just some plain old cheesecloth and we're going to use several layers i first put a bowl down and then i have my colander and then i'm going to layer my cheesecloth inside the colander so i have three layers here of the cheesecloth and then i'm going to leave one strip that's not opened up and put that in the center so that should hold pretty much all of that fine sediment i absolutely love cheesecloth for any time you want to have a nice clear liquid so this is the final step that you'll be taking before you can store it in the refrigerator and it'll last for several weeks for you to use in any recipe that you like now i generally cool my syrup first and then i carefully pour it over the cheesecloth and then all you have to do is lift the colander up out of the bowl and it will have caught all the sediment for you and that's all you have to do and you just put it in a pretty jar and store it and it's ready for use my yield on this one gallon of apple cider was one pint and it's golden brown delicious and it tastes aptly and it's just wonderful it really is like a syrup or like a honey and it's going to be just so delicious in some baked goods this fall and i'll be posting some videos on some of the things i make out of it i hope you give this a try i think you're going to really love it it's so simple to make and there's so many uses for it and so many recipes you can find thank you so much for watching this video we'll see you next time", "DnGd-tqsJ58": "so we made some apple pie moonshine want to find out what the rest is let's quickly have a look [Music] okay so hello and welcome back to another beaver diy day once again thank you very much to everybody for the support on the channel that's for it has been amazing thank you for the questions thank you for the emails thank you for the whatsapps it has been a pleasure to help everybody and to chat with everybody and bounce ideas off of each other it is really a dream come true of mine to be able to be a part of this community so yeah thank you very much to everybody and uh keep it coming um so yeah as i said in the intro guys we are making our own apple pie moonshine so i tried this a similar thing to this in a small town called now straight in south africa many years ago and since then i've always wanted to try and make it or wanted to make it never got around to it so luckily on the channel a couple of suggestions came in for me to take my booty whiskey and make a apple pie moonshine with it luckily one of our friends over in america sent me a recipe that he swears by and yeah we'll be trying his recipe for a couple of liberties or stuff that i couldn't find in south africa to start off with he suggested either everclear which is a very high-proof vodka in america or your own moonshine at a high proof of at least 55 or above so luckily i proved down my own kubuty whiskey to 55 percent so i've got one liter of our other things that i will be using that i couldn't find that i'm going to substitute is instead of vanilla bean we'll be using vanilla essence i know it's not the same thing but i couldn't find vanilla bean in south africa not in south africa but uh in my region where i was in the last couple of days so yeah i'm gonna have to settle for some vanilla essence also one of the big liberties i'm going to be taking is on the apple juice the recipe that he used called for half apple juice and a half apple cider and we in south africa or at least once again where i looked for the stuff i couldn't find apple cider he suggested that i do a concentrated version of it so what a concentrate version of it is we will talk about a little bit later on but yeah cider is not the drink or the apple cider alcoholic beverage that we know in south africa it is unfiltered and unpasteurized apple juice so it still has all the pulp and all the other lovely bits in it that gives it a authentic flavor he gave me a nice recipe for playing around or getting something similar some of the flavor into it so we'll be doing that he also suggested that i switch out some of the sugar for some honey so i'll be going for some honey and then yeah so let's get into the recipe uh oh hold on before we get into the recipe quick feedback on the umkombuti whiskey while we are talking about it for everybody that's interested so over here is our wood finished community whiskey uh the wood has now started adding some beautiful color into the kombucha and the nice woody flavors are starting to come through and uh yeah it's it's quite pleasant and it's slowly turning into a nice drinkable whiskey without that very new makey tastes for everybody that has made the whiskey will know what i'm talking about so yeah it's mellowing out you're getting that vanilla you're getting that caramel flavors and all that lovely flavours out of the wood so yeah if you want to check what i did here link up for the booty whiskey and how i installed it and then age it cool over here what we have is our butterscotch so as you can see the butterscotch also nice and clear and i also ate it with a little bit of wood once again so that butterscotch candy that we put in here gave a beautiful butterscotch flavor nice and sweet very butterscotch heavy the the wood has pulled back on that sweetness and it is also once again starting to turn into a nice little sipping whisky that you can enjoy okay so let's get into the recipe enough talking let's get into it so once again exact volumes quantities and everything down in the description or send me an email and i will send you the recipe but yeah so what we're going to need is two liters of your apple juice so if you can get a two liter jug go for it um once again the place i would add only salt one and a half liters and a half liters so yeah you will be needing sugar so i'm going for normal white sugar you'll be needing some honey vanilla essence you'll be needing four apples some black pepper some nutmeg and then some cinnamon sticks okay i'll also be using a little bit of juice from a lemon just to get some acidity into the mixture so yeah let's start with the recipe firstly what we're going to do is we're going to take one liter of our apple juice and our sugar and we're gonna dissolve it and heat it up and bring it to a boil and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna reduce that apple juice down into a thick syrup so into a concentrate that as well as what we're gonna do with our apples so let's get our apple juice on and cooking okay so like i said we are going for one liter of juice that we need to cook down so this is a 500 mil that goes straight in and then we need to measure out 500 moles from this liter jug okay so that's 500 moles out of this 500 mole jar and that means that there is one liter of apple juice in our pot that we're bringing up to temp while that is coming up to temp what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna be adding two of our cinnamon sticks into the mixture and that's gonna cook with that important some of the nice cinnamon flavors we are also going to be adding our sugar so in goes our sugar and then while that is coming up to temp i'm just gonna peel two of my apples and i'm gonna slice it into [Music] eights [Music] okay as always try and get your pips and your stems and that type of stuff out you don't want that in your mix and yeah the cleaner it goes in the cleaner it comes out okay so while that is coming up to the boil time to add some nutmeg and some black pepper into this as well just to get that infusion process started so be careful on the black pepper you're only going to use a very little bit it just gives a bit of a bite apparently to it that gives a nice citrusy sweet flavor to the apple pie that heightens the apple pie flavor so yeah and then nutmeg once again very strong flavors so go for a little bit so if you don't like honey if you don't like the taste of honey you can go all sugar so i'm going for a cup of honey on the volume that we're doing here and then one teaspoon of vanilla essence if you had a vanilla bean you would take your vanilla bean split it remove the pips and then bend the vanilla bean put it into this liquid so it also comes up to a boil with this whole syrupy goodness that we have here okay so that's all the ingredients in the pot all we're gonna do now is we're gonna keep on stirring it so nothing burns and we're gonna let that reduce down to about half of the current volume that we have there so yeah it's going to take about an hour maybe hour and a half of stirring and cooking and stirring and cooking at high heat to get that down to the volume so once we get this into a syrupy consistence i will be back with you guys cool okay so as we can see that these bubbles are starting to turn really small now and the consistency of this is getting into a nice syrupy thickness you don't want it all the way down to a syrup so if you can remember the pot was about all the way to the top and it has now reduced down to about half of its volume and we can see that the cinnamon stick and you can smell the cinnamon coming the cinnamon flavor coming off of this and all the peels of the apple has now started turning translucent so next up all we need to do is drain this so we can catch all this uh sediment and then yeah we'll see the next step so let's get into draining okay so with the heat turned off time to drain this so all i'm going to do is i'm just going to pass it through this sieve nice and slowly [Music] okay so just to get that last little bit of syrupy sugary goodness out of that pot there what i've done is i've just taken my juice and while this was cooking down i put it into the freezer to get the temperature down quite low because i want to crash the temperature on this quite quickly so i can add my alcohol remember your same process as distillation the moment you hit critical temperature um on your alcohol the alco will start evaporating off and you don't want that you you want that nice bite so this i put into the fridge but i'm just going to use a little bit now into this hot pot to scrape the sides down and get as much of that concentrated flavor into this before we cool this down and then start distributing it into our jars okay so what you do with all the apples and the cinnamon sticks whatever you want to you can take the cinnamon sticks out let them wash them in a little bit of water let them dry and reuse them for the next batch or you can use them in your jars whatever you feel like doing it's up to you the apple slices are very sweet sticky and tastes like apple pie so you can eat those and yeah actually tastes quite nice so next up we need to take this thick syrupy batch add our cold apple juice to it take a little bit of our lemon squeeze our lemon juice in it so the lemon is to flavor i use just a quick squeeze on half a lemon this is just to bring some flavor to the top uh fresh lemon always just heightens some flavors and makes the sweetness come out so that's that next up we're going to give this a quick stir and a taste if we need to adjust anything like the sweetness or the vanilla or whatever we want to adjust we're going to adjust it now before we start adding our alcohol and that type of stuff [Music] okay that's sweet right on the money exactly where we want it so next up what i'm going to do is just going to move this to the side cut up my apples and then i need to put the apple pie mixture with the alcohol and then divide it into the jars okay so we should get about two and a half liters of liquid out of this we might be left with half a jar here so what i'm going to do is i will be dividing everything up in half or into thirds and then we'll see where we end up maybe we'll be ending up with three three-quarter jars or whatever so yeah you can always add a little bit more of your apple juice to bring it up to three liters it's up to you i just took the recipe as close as i could to get those flavors and then i can start building from that so time to get our apple this one time we're not going to feel it we are going to leave the skin on with a peel on we are just going to remove the pip uh the stems and then the little fluffy bit at the bottom okay now depending on the level of cinnamon flavor that you want so you can taste that and then adjust the cinnamon flavor i want a little bit more cinnamon flavor in this because i like the cinnamon flavor if you don't like it don't add any cinnamon afterwards because cinnamon a little goes a long way so all i'm going to do is i'm going to take one stick and i'm going to try and break it into even thirds and then divide them into the jars next up a little squirt of honey into each jar and then a tiny bit of vanilla essence into each one so i'm going for about a quarter of a teaspoon okay so next up what we're gonna do now is divide this up evenly between our jaws and then add our alcohol give it a good put the lids on give it a good shake [Music] [Music] okay so with any better luck if everything worked together like it more than likely won't um you should have three jaws that is filled to the lip so these are about one liter jars so full two just below the head line with a nice boozy concoction what i'm going to do now is i'm just going to quickly give it a stir decant some taste it and then see if i need to adjust anything remember that the cinnamon flavor will increase over time so after about three days i will strain out everything and only the liquid will be left over but that's purely up to you if you want more or less flavor that depends all up to you that is the apple pie moonshine and uh yeah let's quickly give it a taste so nice strong boozy flavor on the nose and sweet apple pie this is a really nice recipe guys i hope you give it a try and if you do please put your feedback or your suggestions or anything in the comments once again and as always have a lucky day [Music]", "wNITwgsJ-kk": "hey y'all jr. here finally getting around to doing something with this Hart Sager I started in early September first thing we're gonna do safety check from beretta 92fs and of course it is loaded for my safety I'm gonna transfer our cider from our five gallon glass carboy into these one gallon glass jugs looks like I got about four gallons of cider in there but I'm really thinking I'm only gonna end up with about three gallons I'll show you guys why must be two and a half inches of sediment at the bottom of this we're gonna use our Brewers siphon because they definitely don't want to be taking any of that with us into our final product after I get everything transferred we're gonna do some back sweetening and some flavoring give it a taste test and we'll see how it turned out there it is three gallons of cider I took a hydrometer reading ended up being one point zero zero which means we consumed all our sugar should be about 5% strong well the first thing I better do just give this a taste before I go adding any other flavorings and see what we think of it here she goes boy if I wouldn't have made this I'd say it tastes like crap doesn't hardly taste like apples definitely not like a boozy flavor I would definitely like it if it was sweeter so I think what I'm gonna do is start with some regular old white table sugar I'm gonna go a quarter of a cup at a time ooh shake the living hell out of it and then take a hydrometer reading and another taste test so in goes our first quarter cup low just regular white table sugar baking sugar or whatever the heck we want to call it then I'm not gonna make you guys watch me shape this so I'll get this all mixed in we'll take a hydrometer reading and see where we go from there I ended up using one cup of sugar my final gravity reading is one point to zero which is about how sweet we liked our Vikings blood mead the sugars seem to help to bring out the flavor of the Apple I don't know if the juice was lacking a little bit of sweetness or quite what was going on there I guess the yeast I am using really does consume all the sugar and has made both of my batches real dry so far maybe I'll look into another yeast maybe I'll just keep making strong booze and putting a little sugar in it at the end I'll get set up with our next flavors and show you guys what we got going on next up light brown sugar apple pie spice I'm gonna go with a full tablespoon of the apple pie spice may be called a heaping tablespoon I'm gonna drop that in there like that now we're gonna do one full cup of the light brown sugar again I'm not gonna waste your guys this time they could be watching me fight in one cup of brown sugar because I'm sure it's not gonna run very well again we'll get a cup in there shake the living [ __ ] out of it I'll take a hydrometer reading and give it a taste the brown sugars not as sweet as the white sugar I ended up with a final gravity reading of about 1.3 the apple pie spice didn't incorporate quite as well as I hoped it would it really did change the color between the brown sugar and the pie spice this I'll probably leave sit for a week keep shaking it up see if that spice doesn't incorporate a little bit more smells good tastes good I call this one a success third and final gallon we're gonna do two whole cinnamon sticks they're probably three and a half inches long I'm just gonna go ahead and drop those right in there I'm gonna do a half an orange sliced up so I can fit it into the jar peel it all oh that one's not gonna go when in doubt force it right so we got our half an orange tucked in there then I'm gonna do one cup of white sugar again because I really like how that tasted and brought out the apple flavor and honestly it isn't near the pain-in-the-ass that getting brown sugar through this funnel was so we'll get this all mixed together give it a good shake give you guys a look at here and I'm not gonna bother with a taste test because I figure it's gonna take a week or two for that cinnamon stick to dissolve and the flavor to really come out of that there it is the fruits of my labor three separate gallons of hard cider three separate flavors got the cinnamon orange pie spice and brown sugar and then just the sweetened with white sugar batch I really appreciate everybody stopping by leaving comments I had a great time doing this I'm gonna leave a link to the other videos in this series please when you're ready adopt-a-pet support your local animal shelters and I'll see y'all on the next one", "M3YrFXsAKTA": "hi cooking cronies today I'm excited to share with you a new recipe that I found it's called fire ball apple cider jello shots it's pretty easy and it was a hit at our tailgate party this past weekend so to begin with you're going to need about 16 2 ounce shot cups and then you're going to use apple cider not apple juice and the juice of half a lemon and I strained the juice so that it got rid of the pulp I didn't want the pulp in my jello and then I used two envelopes of unflavored gelatin and one cup of fireball whiskey I had whipped cream in a can for garnish along with cinnamon candy that I crushed in in my food processor so what I did was in a small saucepan I added the apple cider and the lemon juice and the two packets of unflavored gelatin and I stirred that well together and then I set it aside for five minutes so that it had time to bloom and once the five minutes passed then I put it on the stove over medium-high heat and stirring it constantly for until it came to a simmer and once it came to a simmer I removed it from the heat and added the fireball whiskey to it stir that in really well and then pour it into your little shot cups and I poured mine back into a big measuring cup it made it easier to pour then pouring trying to pour it directly from the saucepan and then just put it in the refrigerator for about two hours to set and once it sets then you garnish it with a dab of whipped cream and the cinnamon candy and in this case I used red hots and this was a hit so I hope you all enjoyed this recipe and come back and give us a thumbs up and become regular subscribers to our website god bless", "OTaS4ZIT6Xs": "[Music] what's going on everybody welcome to chopping brew i am chip walton there is a saying that you should never trust a skinny chef i say never trust a home brew web show host who doesn't have a beverage during the intro it's not actually true i think you could totally do an intro without a beverage but the case i'm making here is that i'm putting my dry january on hiatus for just a bit to tell you the story of this really interesting fermentation i made recently this is the ralk graf or the smoked graph or if you don't know what a graph is it's basically a hybrid of beer wort and apple cider fermented thus making a hybrid beer hard cider in this episode we're going to talk about why i made it and more importantly how i made it making a very small batch of work blending it with an almost equally small batch of orchard fresh cider fermenting them together and then i ended up having to back sweeten it which is something i don't do a lot so there's a little bit of discussion uh with my buddy don oh about the process of back sweetening and we do tasting notes on the unbacked sweetened version and the back sweetened version of this smoke graph i am very excited about the way that it turned out it's a beautiful color it's a beautiful flavor and it's a it's just a really cool thing that worked out so stick with us and we're going to tell you about the raw graph this episode of chop and brew is brought to you with ongoing support from bsg handcraft my smoked graph was made using all virumen malts and german ariana hops imported to the us by way of bsg and imperial yeast whose limited edition paramount is a specialized wine strain great for hard seltzer fermentation with 90 to 100 attenuation this strain is a very clean and aggressive fermenting strain combined with the correct amount of nutrients paramount will produce an excellent hard seltzer with low fuso levels and with the generous support of our patreon party people join them and chip in on the effort at patreon.com chopin brew here we are i got my notes i got my smoked graph i kicked open the shades a little bit more here in the uh home work from home office of elsa walton to shine some more light on the situation it's a snowy white day in minnesota so i want to tell you about this beverage so the first time i ever brewed this was in fall of 2012 or brewed slash blended fermented this um was in 2012. if you remember if you're a brewing tv fan we had just done like a series of episodes about hard cider with chris smith and then grant jose my buddy and former northern brewer co-worker from the first time at northern brewer blew my mind with something called graf which is essentially beer wort apple cider blended together fermented it comes from the fictional world of the dark tower out of stephen king novels there's a beverage mentioned in those books called graph and it's explained as like a stout meets a hard cider so of course the internet and homebrew talk um came up with a recipe we did episodes and grant was all about all things graph not just the stout beer hybrid he was about pale ales he was about cezanne grafts he was about belgian yeast fermented grafts so with that kind of inspiration in mind that fall northern brewer had just discontinued their ralph beer extract kit which means on the free table at northern brewer there was all these pre-built steeping grains that would have come with that extract kit those steeping grains would have been i believe a pound and a half of vitamin smoked malt and 0.5 pound of vitamin care munich 4. so i grabbed like three or four of those off the table brought them home on a lark mashed them at probably what i'm thinking now was like one uh mid-150s blended that with the cider fermented it and it turned out awesome elsa and i were just like this might be the coolest thing that's ever come out of the home brewery it was it tastes like smoked country ham glazed with like a apple cider glaze it was so cool smoked apples essentially so i've been meaning to do this every year since and just keep forgetting to do it keep it getting to do it keep forgetting to do it this year i finally put it on the docket so what i did is i went back to those old extract a recipe and i figured out the proportion so i did four and a half pounds of vitamin smoked malt one and a half pounds of environment care munich one i mash those brew in a bag style on my stovetop let them hang out for an hour and then i drained them the way i always do over in the sink and i got you know about two and a half gallons of work one thing to note however i have this really thin walled italian kettle when i do my brew in a bag on stovetop and it is really hard to hold the mash temp especially during a minnesota winter so whereas i started at 152 it ended at like 146 147 and that would come up again later in the process which i will tell you about but so i took the two and a half gallons of work that i ended up with i should say that i like bittered with an ounce of german ariana hops from bsg it says that they give kind of like this herbal maybe stone fruit and pine um which i was like oh that's perfect we're doing an apple cider if we get like stone fruits and some herbalness in there that would be really cool and i fermented it clean with imperial flagship i wanted the malt specifically the smoked malt to stand out as well as whatever apple i could get after i chilled the work i mixed them up in the basement i should mention a couple of notes about the cider that i had i believe you could do this with any store-bought cider as long as it doesn't have um preservatives in it but this cider was from our minnesota home brewers association we do a bulk club by every fall so this was from that and it was three gallons of um a variety of cortland harrelson and sweet tango so i got 10 gallons total and i was like oh i'm gonna divvy this up so i did two three gallon batches of just straight cider one fermented with imperial bubbles one with uh fermented with imperial juice which i really like those two things will be an episode in the future we'll talk about the split cider project but the other three gallons from the project became the hard cider portion of this smoked graph [Music] boom three gallons apple cider two and a half more of kind of smoky work for about five and a half gallons i'm gonna mix this up real quick just gonna stir this up see if we can get everything nice and conglomerated so we can get a final original gravity of the two sugar sources i guess i should take maybe like a little sample from tasting too what y'all think about that hold up no way it tastes like smoked apple pie already and i know what that tastes like because brian adams makes smoked apple pie and smoked peach cobblers [Music] all right let's get this bad boy covered up here i'm going to bring you all in real quick to see what it looked like so we ended up at 10 48 10 50 maybe probably 10 50. it's 12 and a half bricks so and that makes complete sense because uh our pre-boil for the word was about 10 44. the gravity of the cider as it was received i believe was 10 48 or 10.50 so so we got 10 50 five and a half gallons of some smoked graf smoked cider i'm gonna pitch imperial flagship i was gonna go with the german alt the kaiser or the german ale but as cold as it is outside my basement's not quite that cold yet so i'm going to go with good old flagship plus i figure this will kind of ferment it clean and hopefully let the smoky malt stand out and the apple and the quick taste it's crazy it's it's really interesting a little bit of tart from that apple from that cider but maybe also from the smoke um but it's really nice it's not offensive it really does just taste like a smoked apple pie or like um like cider that's been mold over an open fire it's really cool this will be super interesting and really good for thanksgiving hopefully we pitch the yeast and one more thing i'm going to do just because so much of the fermentables here is apple cider instead of like a malt a mash based work i'm going to sprinkle some of this mead cider nutrient blend that i've already got made up from a previous mead i'll probably make up more of that and dose it maybe in a day or two just to help out so after blending we basically had five and a half gallons of a cider wort mash up that was 10.50 i pitched it with the flagship i fermented it it fermented to 1004 which kind of blew my mind not necessarily in a good way i wouldn't have expected it to ferment but once i started to think about that i was like well yeah more than half of this is apple cider which always wants to ferment pretty much bone dry and then i threw a wort at it that really slipped when it came to the mash temperature into the 140. so of course these two things want to ferment bone dry i did tasting notes uh on the bone dry version i kind of liked it but it was it was just smoky and dry and tart i put aside a gallon and a half of it because i wanted it both for comparison's sake and i kind of liked it but after tasting it with elsa and mommers they both agreed it was too just kind of dry and smoky it needed more like apple all the apple had been fermented out so we did a little bench test as you would say with some honey crisp apple cider that we had and just adding a splash of that to a few ounce sample of the really dry version really woke up the smoke it woke up the malt and it definitely put the apple back in it so i've never done this before but i back sweetened with one canister of thawed apple juice concentrate into what was now four and a half gallons essentially of this cider and it made a huge difference it went up to 10 11 and it brought the apple back out it it gives it this like nice sweetness in the balance so next time i make this which i will make this again definitely next fall if not before i'm going to try to mash the work part of the project way high 1056 1058 even because that cider is definitely going to drag that into a low gravity no matter what you put at it what you put towards it from the wart real quick before i get to the zoom tasting notes with me and don oh kind of talking about the unsweetened versus the back sweetened version i want to relay some other tasting notes so um this was blended up on november 7th a week later at 10 50. a week later it was 1008 so it dropped quick and then it took another two weeks to get to 1004. on december 1st when it was at 1004 i noted that it was very wood woody campfire smoke not ashy or scorched flavor is very smoky apple is hidden some grape and apple tartness not much malt sweetness although the color is noticeable more noticeable from the straight cider so if you see this color check this out and then check out these photos where i have a sample of this all the way to the right and then the straight sample ciders on the left so as you can tell that care munich one gives it a nice ambery almost kind of orange uh light brown i don't know if i call that tan but it definitely it adds to the experience and just makes it a little bit more oomph than just cider and here in january when mommers and elsa had it the non back sweetened which i would still advocate for making if this is what i'm about to say if that's what you like out of a beverage go for it and don't back sweeten but very smoky um elsa called it a smoked pork chop tastes like smoked pork chop mama said it's fruity pear apricot elsa said tart tart apple candies without the sweetness not like champagne dry white wine but finishes before being bone dry almost watery sour beer which is kind of what i think it's almost like someone tried to make a session seller beer but didn't give it like enough foundation or backbone a big serving would be palette fatiguing versus the sweetened version at 10 11 more appley but not that much sweeter which i find very interesting and that's kind of what i wanted to go for the stripped down version was just like not very aptly so we need that apple someone actually noted it kind of tasted maple syrupy still surprisingly tart in the finish which is awesome smoke level is strong but not overpowering balanced so let's see what another home brewer such as don oh who lives not too far away but still ended up on a zoom with me because of current pandemic conditions to talk about the 1004 versus the 1011 version of this and a little wrap in about back sweetening i'm here with donno who lives a block and a half away from me but because of realistic situations we are on zoom you are also a back sweetener you are a habitual not sweetener never describe myself as such but i guess i am for my ciders i always sweeten them a little bit and also i guess mead the few meads i've made i sweetened those to taste as well yeah i didn't think about that i mean we're only doing this because it's my last day before dry january and i got to get this in and you were the closest person to get alcohol to but you actually have always been through the length of our friendship pretty much a proponent of back sweetening so maybe that'll that'll come in handy here so if you were just handed this unsweetened unback sweetened combination of smoked beer wort and apple cider what would you think well you dropped off what a sweetened one the other day or i picked it up or something because i've had it i had it before i had it last at the end of last week so i immediately got both the smoke character and also a cider element i mean they both came through in a nice uh harmony i've not made anything like this so it was fun to see that what you were making actually tastes like the you know ingredients that went into it i like smoked drinks so uh it was certainly not too much sweetener smoked drink lover i was gonna say smoked beer but this is you know not just beer um yeah mezcal smoked meat every day i mean i'll take smoking just about anything honestly yeah or solid and it wasn't you know too smoky for me i don't know if some people that just don't care for smoke i mean it's a little bit like a starter level of smoke i guess we talk about that sometimes with different smoke teles slightly smoked porter um some people just don't like the the strong smoke character but and this would not have a ridiculously strong small character but it certainly is detectable here you're talking about the back sweetened version i'm just talking about the smoke level in this graph in general because you can make a graph and have it not be smoked right right oh of course yeah so what do you think of the driest version what do you think of the 1004 well i don't think it's undrinkable or unpleasant i personally have not usually been a fan of a totally dry cider that's not sweetened if it sits around for a year or two and then i open a dry cider then it's it's mellowed so it's it's more palatable to me i know some people like them just totally bone dry as they are um that said because this has the beer in it it isn't like a dry cider um is it a little bit drier than the sweetened one sure but um i think it's i think it drinks okay yeah i mean the bone dry one is like you said like it is like smoke on the cider well your note on putting one can of apple juice concentrate in five gallons and that's this one um it's not it's not at all overly sweet i mean i think it's i do think it's different i think you can get a little bit of difference but i mean for my money like i said off camera when i have a really really dry cider i actually use three full cans of apple juice concentrate to sweeten it and then that gives it a medium level of sweetness it's not like this uh sweetest commercial ciders but then of course by that point it's absolutely not you know a dry cider anymore so this is to me this could be even sweeter but it's nice as is and it's sweeter in comparison to um you know the unsweetened one would you even dare to uh sweeten it more than what it is not drinking it now or is it to a level that you like it i like this if you were gonna suggest a beverage like this to anybody would it be more someone trying to sneak into smoke beers or somebody trying to get into ciders like i like it but i don't even know who to suggest this to well i kind of consider it sort of an advanced beverage in the sense of it's not either of those things i don't know that if somebody doesn't like smoke things they don't like ciders they don't like beer or you know one one or the other of those variables i don't know if you're like well here have this you know i don't want to know that there's like you just described a person that is i don't i don't like [Music] well i'm just saying i i just don't want to hang out with them for too long your target audience for this is me because i like all of these goofy creative things i like smoking ciders back sweetening uh you know experiments and uh you know so i don't know i mean i think you're trying to ask is this like a starter beverage for somebody who doesn't like one thing or another and i mean i don't know i don't know it's probably not i i think you're right i think this is for people you know to the point today josh landy one of the best cider makers i know of all the things he's done he's never done a cider that has kind of a smoke element whether that's through smoking the apples or through making a smoked beer he's never ever done a malted cider he's the king of like every variety of apple every combination a variety of apple every combination of yeast ever you know but he's still never had something like this i agree i think this is for i would like to see anybody who's interested in the flavors we just talked about try it it's definitely i almost i feel like it's a fall time holiday kind of vibe thing or it's for the nerd it's for somebody that wants to know how these two things meet kind of like to our point we always get the club by cider and it's like well i've got x amount of it what could i do with some of this while i have access to it and that's what i did i think it's well done and congrats to being creative and trying something different and actually getting a nice result i mean that's what we love i mean that's what i do like we all many of us do it routinely we're always tweaking one little thing or another and you hope you get something that is at least enjoyable and at best it's quite good and quite interesting gives you experience for future batches or other you know just gives you more uh information more experience to use for the next time you want to do something do something different smoked apples now i want to make a cider like you smoked the apples and then you press them but i don't know how much juice yeah you said that and that's that that's a real interesting idea um as you know if you've ever gone to one of those pressings where you grind up apples and then press them it takes a lot of apples to get yeah that juice so just smoke that many apples i don't know how you would do that i mean if you were making a small batch maybe like a gallon or so that'd be a maybe what you would do you like this shirt donno by the way sure from the griswolds yeah man you know i'm not the hugest lampoon christmas like a fishing auto but i mean i've i've seen it how dare you okay i don't know i'm going to end this now then all right donald trump brew for brew guess which one i have last still the dry on smokey well beyond sweden but it's we'll get to it we'll take care i'm gonna take care of business look at this but you're blending this is what you just said about what probably 1008 107. this is what you do after a few samples you start you start when we have like a few cans left on the table you start mixing and matching i really hope you all enjoyed this episode i really hope this inspires you to make a graph specifically a smoke graph or a raw graph but um just any kind of graph like let's go back to some of these weird hybridy kind of things that are a lot of fun especially if you like hard cider and you like beer i think there's a lot of flavors that play nicely and i've never made one with like hops that would be above and beyond i've always used i think the first time when i made this i use like northern brewer or sat so you know that apple flavor with some malt and then some hops of a very specific choice and maybe even a yeast could be a cool thing either way i'm going to put this recipe on the website chopinbrew.com recipes i'm just always out to do something fun because god knows everything under the sun has been done so and i know that there are like cideries out there that are able to do like beer cider combos that i believe have done this so it'd be really cool to drink a pro version one day but for now the beauty of home brewing is i can mash up a smoked beer and a hard cider and it made a wonderful holiday slash winter beverage cheers to you chow for chop brew for brew smoke for smoke apple for apple if you want to see this show continue strong consider supporting us at patreon.com chop and brew till the next time till the next wacky concoction chopper chop the idea will be like i will have already brewed it i will already talked about it'll be like one of your videos for a change we're like yeah we'll be getting to this point give me back what's left of that cider e like that a whole lot but i can run it back down the alley if you want shout out to donno for being available even during a packers game what's going on in that packers game can you see it from the room you're in yeah i don't know i think it's i think it's uh they've both teamed the bears and the packers both teams are scoring i don't know what the score is right now but uh it's happening 14 10 packers there you go oh of course it is my mom and dad i sent you that picture my mom's a packer backer my dad's a bears guy from the og so like you sent me a picture dude their living room is literally like divided down the middle and then like packer stuff bear stuff oh they always do some like wacky bet and like a month of back massages or like a week of cooking or it's been that way since i was a kid i was always like what are y'all gonna bet and it happens twice a year you know for the most part so it's always kind of i don't want to be the bears fan in recent years they've they've lost more than they've won i think it's true well did we do a good uh finale or whatever we did a good enough job we did a chapter shot brew for brew right i mean we wrapped it up one of those 12 beers of christmas i just didn't wrap it up and then we started the next video and i was like in editing i was like i'm gonna have to voice over a oh right yeah that's what i was wondering if you've got your ending that you need maybe you can cut that out", "Y0sVHdh_bvs": "hey there everyone how you doing it's Jake here and I'm here to try I'm here today to try my hand at some hard apple cider I've never done it before so let's get this on the go so what I've got here is my one gallon growler I've got a container with my airlock and my bum soaking in the stars and let some star san here I've got two containers of apple juice got my wine yeast and I've got my my thief here lay my pipe pipe my hydrometer and I've already measured it and I got a reading of 1.0 give it a spin I've got a reading at one point zero four two just with the apple juice alone so go ahead and stretch sanitize inside of this jug well and then we'll get on with that we'll be right back okay so I want to invert my sugar so I've got a cup and about cup and a half of water here boiling what I'm going to do is I'm going to just start to reduce the heat and I'm going to stir in two cups of sugar now I just happen to have some of this dextrose here so I'm going to stir that in and you can use normal table sugar I just happen to have some dextrose lying around so I've decided to use that all right be right back all right so what I'm going to do now is add my water and my sugar just basically two cups of sugar that I added to about a cup and a half of water and I boiled for about five minutes or a little longer convert the sugars all right I'm just going to add some apple juice start topping this up with apple juice apple juice top it right up next thing I need to stir it around too much next up pretty good there let's test the gravity again why don't we looks like about one one zero one point zero one point zero six one I guess okay well that will do that really doesn't have to be super strong now that will do about one point zero six one maybe six - that'll be close enough okay now it's just a simple matter of adding the east here we go adding in the using a full pack of yeast I wasn't going to use a full pack for a gallon but it all settles out anyways so it's okay to use one pack for a gallon I've had a few people tell me that it's okay to use and my sanitized whoops all right there you have it she's all set and ready to go another a batch of apple cider my very first batch of apple cider she's on the go she's ready to firm it and I'm going to let it ferment for a 10 days I suppose give or take roughly 10 days all right thanks for watching I'll let you know how it turns out hopefully it doesn't turn out I said hopefully it turns out good thanks for watching guys keep your mugs full and I'll see you soon Cheers check it out guys it's my one week sample for the doctor fermenting check it out just king this is the hard apple cider that I'm working on hmmm check it out look nice do you think of that no that I'm like crazy lot you there's no need that's fascinating very fascinating so hopefully she turns out pretty good hmm I'm open so hard apple cider take care", "7Kx-BwGiZTw": "[Music] hey YouTube this is Sasquatch Piper I'm glad you came back here to woods with me and OH both of us

gin fizz i've shown you how to make a dark and stormy today i'm showing you how to make a moscow mule but it's not just any moscow mule i'm going to be doing an apple pie moscow mule stick around and i'll show you how to do it [Music] hello everybody welcome back to corkandjava.com we're your go-to place for coffee and wine reviews and how-tos on this channel we like to expand and enrich your experience with all your favorite beverages make sure you hit subscribe and hit that little bell so you're notified when all our future videos come out so i am going to make a moscow mule and like i said it's a little spin on one because i'm going to be using some apple cider which is the cinnamon spice apple cider that i still have and i'm going to be using this caramel vodka so if moscow mules are your thing i think you'll like this little variation on it so here we go uh what you're going to want to do is take your mug if you don't have a mug that's okay um we are going to do three ounces of our vodka and two ounces of the apple cider and like i said if you just have regular apple apple cider that's fine i think the little cinnamon notes are gonna be nice so i'll do three ounces or so of this and then we'll do about two ounces of our cider [Music] and then we're just going to give it a little stir just to meld the flavors together if you have a cocktail shaker you could of course throw them in the cocktail shaker and blend them all right and then i will need some crushed ice cold ice from siberia oh my goodness okay and then we will top with our ginger beer just be a few ounces of that okay i'm gonna do one more roaster get all this going and if you wanted to make this extra cold you could you know throw these in the freezer for a bit before you make your cocktail i'm just going to throw in a few apple slices and easy peasy the apple pie moscow mule okay so i threw my apple slices in there you can use apple slices whatever kind of apple you have cinnamon sticks i'm going for it oh yeah this is good this is what fall tastes like like the caramel got the apple cider the apple all just melts together just like how babushka made it and you also if you don't have the um caramel vodka you could just use plain um it probably wouldn't taste quite as unique but i think there's actually uh i want to say that there is an apple pie or an apple vodka too so if you don't have the caramel on hand you could definitely use other variations of the smirnoff um different flavors they have we're just trying to wake up make our way through this uh bottle that we've had for ages so i'm trying to think of cocktails i can use to incorporate this caramel vodka in this though really is awesome though yeah it does it tastes great not to toot my own horn or anything but this is a great cocktail that i made all right guys so leave a comment below with what your favorite fall cocktail that we've made so far is this moscow mule is definitely in the running for me i also uh really enjoyed the dark and stormy and i've liked the maple whiskey sour um a handful of other ones were like the pumpkin spice white russian was surprisingly good so yeah there's a whole slew of them that i've really really enjoyed but this one is definitely on there so leave a comment below with which one you've tried and which one's been your favorite oh and make sure to give us a thumbs up it

canning day today and i thought i would bring you guys along um i am canning applesauce apple pie filling and cranberry sauce today so i've got my water bath canner over here i've got a great big pot full of apples already processed and we're gonna get rolling on so stick around to see how we work through all these apples and cranberries so here's a little update my great big pot is um cooking down with apples for sauce and these are probably got another five minutes or so before i'm going to blend them up with my immersion blender over here at the sink i'm still processing quite a few apples you can see what's already there from what i've processed and then this is my bowl and i need to get seven quarts of apple slices here so i'm just going to keep working away on that and this is for my apple pie filling okay friends here's where we are i've got my six quarts of apples um sitting in my bowl now and they are in a situated water so those are just waiting for me when i'm ready to make the pie filling i've probably got i don't know 10-ish pounds of apples still left here um what when the sink was full this was a full bushel now there's probably only like what you see and another like half layer under that there's all our scraps so far and we'll come over here to the oven and show you what's going on there so my apple sauce is done now i decided to go chunky instead of um smooth since what i canned earlier in the season was smooth applesauce was that oh that was just on the screen i thought there was like a yucky piece in there or something anyway so i am getting ready to jar this up and then we will be putting it in our water bath counter over there so applesauce requires a half inch headspace and i like to use an acrylic chopstick um to de-bubble i find it does a really good job de-bubbling so now i need to wipe the rim with vinegar get a linen ring on and i will put this down in my canner and we will fill the rest of these jars up all right i wound up with six quarts instead of seven i was probably about i don't know an inch shy of head space so i just went ahead and put the last bit in the free or in the fridge these are going to go for 20 minutes for quarts 15 minutes for pints and they have half inch headspace so i've washed up my big pan that's what i'm also going to make my apple pie filling in but i am not going to quite make that yet i want the stuff in the canner to get done first so i am going to eat some lunch and then i will bring you guys back when i start making this apple pie filling so i'm gonna throw this homemade loaded potato soup that i made last night into the microwave if you guys would like to see how i make this let me know down in the comments and i'll try to make a video for you guys all right these just finished their 20 minute boil so i have turned the water bath canner off and taken the lid off and i'm going to give these five minutes to just simmer down a little bit all right our time is up so let's pull these out those are some beautiful quartz of applesauce for sure all right guys that is our applesauce now on to our apple pie filling okay guys here is our apple pie filling down in the pot and i'm going to link to my friend heather over at the needy homesteaders video on how she makes apple pie filling because it's very thorough and i don't think there's anything i could really add that would make a difference in making it so i will link that up in the top and i'll link it underneath in the description as well all right this is my last quart of apple pie filling going down into my water bath counter i'm going to turn this up to high or to canning should i say put the lid on and we're going to process these for 25 minutes time's up i'm gonna flip this off and take the lid off and let this rest for five minutes before i pull these out", "6j_AL6lEQZ4": "hi this is Chris and welcome to wine maker TV do you like wine do you like cider do you like meat you want to learn how to make it yourself well this is the place for you new here please hit the subscribe button in a little bail notification so you'll know when I come out with a new one and a new video also I have a Facebook group if you the link will be in the description below please join it and so we could swap ideas build community and today we'll be making a cherry cider so stay tuned hi in order to make a cherry cider today we'll go over the ingredients you'll need we're going to be making a three gallon batch so you'll need I'm gonna use some cherry pie filler for the cherry part and we'll make three gallons so I got three gallons of apple juice that has nothing in it but uh juice and preserve this for citric acid I got a three gallon fermenting bucket and inside of it is a sanitizing solution so we've got us a sanitized three gallon fermenter and if you need your sanitizer links will be in the description below so you can pick that up today we'll be adding a little bit of acid blend to it again that can be had in the description below and I got a little firm axe this is a yeast nutrient and also you'll need some yeast today I'll be using a red star premiere Blanc so let's get started okay step one is adding some of your juice adding your juice to your fermenting bucket so we're going to add one gallon down and this juice is is pasteurized and it has so you don't have to add any Camden tablet at the begin with and you can save these containers you can use it later as a per meeting vessel to when you're making a one gallon batch so here's a gallon number three this bucket is a three and a half gallon bucket so they'll have plenty of air roots of headroom so nothing will ferment and come out of the bucket so that's step one down then we're going now it's time to add our acid blends we're going to add just a little bit of this I'm gonna add one teaspoon pour for three gallons get this stuff open let's just do this so 1 teaspoon of acid blend all right next up we're gonna have our yeast Lou trees this is the kick give our yeast a kickstart to get them going and this you add one teaspoon per gallon so we're gonna add 3 teaspoons of yeast nutrient 1 that's the count would go 100 200 and 300 Hey yeast nutrient has been added now we'll add our cherry filling so we're just gonna add this straight in we're not gonna need that any sugar to bump up the alcohol content because this pie filling has sugar in it I got my trusty spoon that was in my sanitizing bucket that's one down I add adding 2 large pie filling cans of pie filling now we're gonna stir it up we're gonna stir it vigorously so we can get the cherry mixed in also so we can get a little bit of oxygen in there to get this help get this a yeast kicked off when we add the yeast so we're gonna stir stir stir stir stir good thing about ciders they're quick and they're easy and we are to our last step which is to add our red star premiere bull and we can just sprinkle that right in this way we add our top then we add our airlock and we're done so we'll be back to wrap things up all right and that's how you make a cherry cider it's a 3 gallon batch moving is heavy so it'll take 7 to 10 days in a primary fermentation then I will rack it to a secondary fermentation into another 3 gallon fermentation vessel for a secondary rack and help clear it and stabilizing then after that two more weeks after that I will bottle it and then we're going to be bottled conditioning this so it'll be a sparkling cider and that's it it's quick easy and simple this is Chris with wine maker TV please hit the subscribe button and the bail notification and join my facebook group and that's all there is today", "MJdimcv4fv0": "[Music] look at how beautiful that is cheers YouTube it can't be homemade wine I'm serious this is the Le 16 Vermentino this is one of the limited editions bourbon Tino Italian white wine apparently it is super popular over in Italy but here in the US and Canada you never really hear anything about it that it's one of their most popular varietals over there and so that was in the only 16 Edition this time and yeah delicious kind of like Pinot Grigio it's got a little bit of a dry thing that is really fruity that's good but that's not why we're here I just had to have a beverage right today we're going to be making one of the cider house select cider kits I just went to pour myself to one of the mango peach ciders I had made I think I mentioned that in previous video and blue foams on out it's time to make another one so we're going on a Nikki night favorites a spiced apple delicious super easy to make and I'm going to do this all in one shot right here because it is it is just that easy I will also be using the catalyst from Etra now this is the first time you see me use the catalyst to find folks over at craft brew reached out to me to try one of their products their main product and give a review on it so I've done it for about your wine now we've got I believe I put a batch of you through it now we're going to do this cider and I just wanted to show you basically that in action not a plug for the per se because this got its pluses and minuses just like anything so stay tuned I will have a very detailed review of that but it's my open fermenter right now I've got the bathroom of conical but I wanted to try try this during this one just to see how it goes because I know how it goes in the assessment so let's do this first things first everything is cleaned and I swapped the heads on my acid sanitizer jug here because my actual sprayer I think the axe had melted something on the inside because now just spray from a straight line it doesn't do the mix well that being said let's get this other way well actually set that right over here I'm just going to go ahead and sanitize everything I'm going to start with the lid nothing should really be touching this but you know how it goes the one time you don't sanitize it going to be the time that it gets screwed up so I'm just going to set that one aside now I'm going to do the body of the furniture actually everything is already cleaned just gotta hit it with the Fant over here this is star scene so it's going to take a minute if you contact turn so what I'm going to do some spray everything down and we're just going to basically assemble it as everything is kind of drying a little bit oh you know what do my my stirrer here so you can either spin I had the paddle as what was on top of the stack so that's where I went with to find that's how I do a lot of things in my life I get surprisingly a lot of commentary on my sock color which I thought was interesting and it's no joke whatever's on top of the laundry the first two socks I see are what I grab I don't I don't make too big of a deal out of coming up with what I'm going to wear colors that coordinate how much is it a fox is it clean I don't work for me holy smokes as a break everything we got our I thought excuse me the acid in this was getting me I'm not sure if you can see that in the glass there but it's a hop cone but that was cool okay Santos i sanitized sanitize I think what we're going to do now is take this I kind of just in the sink there so it's just in dreamy look I'm gonna have to redo that one wrong so this guy we do it's close that way so goes this way I put this on backwards the first time I choose to tell evite yeah ya did it confuse the hell out like what is this thing we do well I couldn't have the different size what am I thinking I thought it was I thought I was going to but then I was like oh it's very clear down is out you know alright so there's that okay that second we're gonna go ahead redo this [Music] I think it starts saying he don't have to rinse off so this little bit of residue here is not going to be a problem at all works for me that's going to be what we'll do okay anything anything else oil screams gets inside these are outtakes you guys don't typically get a see me being a dingus dropping all the time I know what the problem is I have not had enough wine shooters alright so we'll take our scissors are over here sanitize those oh the nice part about having the sprayer that sprays the mist everywhere it just covers everything so you know nice easy to use don't have to worry about it you could probably sanitize this too I typically don't but for good measure I guess oh yeah I keep my paper towels on the ceiling pretty slick oh okay so if you've never done one of these cider house select kits they're super easy they've got instructions on the back there but really this could not be more foolproof you take your scissors I would wait you know what let's wait for this let's rock this foot I'm going to go ahead I'm going to get our water incorporated first because you add your sugar right upfront you use the kick here and two pounds of corn sugar so that sphere that filled that song I'm going to go ahead and add in some warm water [Music] [Music] so start there dextrose straight regular corn sugar dextrose monohydrate and it go now I did go ahead and seal up the bottom here the bottom valve get everything incorporated and then we'll open at the top to that five gallon mark now these kits are designed to do six US gallons five Imperials they're made in England and so I just take it to five us and I use a little bit less intercoastal kilogram one pound is 454 grams so up 900 grams so just shy of a kilogram and I found that works just great for me definitely I don't have to have extra I tried them up this perfectly in my tank so it's a nice easy to milk get a little bit extra flavor little bit extra sugar in there sorry I thought I had a drifter step 1 step 2 cut open your cider dip now inside the cider kit are two zones one is a wet side one is a dry side so I'm going to try to show that to you because this is a little tricky so where's the liquid so you see there well there's packs of information and stuff and then there's a central central plastic piece and then that's that's where all the actual site or extract is so what you want to do go your dry side and take all that out of it we'll go over that in a second so reach in make sure all your stuffs up now we're going to add the fire so then what I do I rinse the cider side with lukewarm water just right into the back because then we dump it in we add it think of it like a mole extract you want to get every little bit out of it that you can so rinse lives utensils I use warm water you can use probably whatever time fill whatever you want but obviously one water absorbs dissolve stuff into it just a little bit better I'm going to super hot with the water put if I spray everywhere just enough to uh just hold it and I'll show you what I mean you saw all that dark extract in there and as you can see for you bring a half gallon this is the cider side pretty much done okay so we do but it's kind of the benefit of the catalyst is that you can see you can see everything so in that dry side you have your instructions you have your yeast you have a non fermentable sweetener which I don't use I never use this stuff but a lot of folks do and they like it over and then you have the magic ingredient it's a cider flavoring pack so this is going to contain natural flavorings that basically make the fighter a lot drinkable a lot faster if you just use your apple base here you know it's going to take quite a while for that fruit player to come back this is going to have the flavoring of the apple and then also the spices that basically you know it makes it makes it palatable a lot sooner when I did my fresh fruit cider that's just a couple years ago now it took about a year for me to be able to taste the Apple blend again it was nice and dry it was like a strong bow but the first several 2001 just taste like boobs it just was really hot you know yeah it was now pan so now we cover that's the five gallon mark give another mix here make sure we're even whoo okay so now I'm going to open the collection though make sure everything's tight on there yeah there it goes I'm going to open it up all the way and that took us just below the five gallon mark so I'm going to add just a little bit more just a hair more cuz I'm going to drop the collection ball one so we're just over five yards us yeah so pretty much at the beginning of this make of these side ERK if you use mm and the Apple pace you don't put the flavoring in you dope with the sweetener and then your yeast you this yeast is so good you can actually just buy you know just this yeast and we have that in our store [Applause] delicious druggies so sprinkle it on you can stir it in you you know like a beer you can let it set I'm just going to sprinkle this across the top and let it set let it naturally kind of fall in I try to sprinkle it evenly across the top as I can I try to kind like a wine ease because that's really what it is it's it's memory serves me correct it is actually a like a subspecies of Saccharomyces it's an offshoot of a type of a champagne style use but it helps pop those free flips so that's it look how beautiful that looks mmm okay here what put this upside down go to stopper over there drink up important to make sure your gasket is in place on any fermenter you use so much don't fear I know okay so get that lined up lined up lined up with this lid I like to kind of go at it on the sides then go with the other ones because I've had one well tighten and then tighten at the top so there's that we will take our sanitized bump right in the top there's a big hole in that lid our sanitized airlock pop that in pop the top take some of our apps and sanitize right this off there and then put your little lid back on whoo and we're done where are we at time was 17 minutes 17 minute piece on the I mess stuff up there I dropped crap it's so easy they make it so easy so now what we're going to do this is going to get fermenting here probably I mean it wouldn't say it's one to the touch but I can tell it's definitely not cool so those cider yeasts and one you like it a little bit warmer you're going to be looking at probably I'm probably going to let this go for at least two weeks and especially because I've got the the collection ball here once everything firm it settles out you can dump that pop it back on and boom you're in that secondary period so although typically let this set for grand total it's typically three or four weeks I would say and then I go and take it directly and so when you just drop it into the keg that is when you would add this flavoring packet now when you go to bottle it you would do the same thing mixing a Previn sugar as a flavoring packet and contrary to what I say with some of the other flavorings we use I actually dump this whole pack in and I've noticed that it's pretty well-balanced for all the different styles we always have one of these kits going because they're so good and they're so simple and fast that kind of a no-brainer it's like a dedicated tap on my kegerator it seems as a as a fire so I dumped it all in however I do believe let's see see steps seven instructions which the instructions are Brewers that standard kind of instruction sheet so it's very very clear it's so easy to follow but Bob Papa there you go once fermentation is complete remove the lid at the flavor sachet and stir well secure the lid and airlock to the fermenter and read to sit for at least 48 hours before bottling this allows the yeast to resettle to the bottom of the fermenter reducing the amount of sediment that could be transferred in the bottles pretty common sense or just add it at bottling or just add it at pigging you know some people do add less than this whole packet and that's really your personal preference I found though that the amount they give your works really well to just dump it in and are you good you know it's very very balanced I guess you know free flavor wise balanced it's not too strong and like I said this cider is actually one of our favorites I have a spice apples killer the pineapple is absolutely killer standard apples classic they have a strawberry pear there's cherry I think there's a blueberry one actually which I think that's maybe my next one mango peach was surprisingly good it I mean I don't like mangoes and I don't like peach but apparently I drank the hell out of that you know what other ones raspberry lime again one you would not think was good LD Carlson actually gave me one of those I went to a convention they were they gave me one to try and man I was like that sounds terrible I delicious it was absolutely delicious I pretty much learned that these kits are just foolproof they're delicious they're easy they're fast you know if you've got a wedding coming up or something birthday you got three weeks crank one of these out I've done that twice now actually so then it was just that easy we're sitting right above that five gallon mark so it's going to work that well when we dump this collection Bowl and yes and now all I need to do clean up lies is rinse this off dry some things down but yeah that's it is just that easy so if you've got any questions or comments please do leave them down in the comment section if you're new to the channel please do like the video

one of my favorite drinks at Starbucks which is the caramel apple spice drink and this drink is super easy to make is perfect for fall and in my opinion tastes very similar to the Starbucks drink so if you want to see how I make this just keep watching so this is really really simple all you're going to need is 1/2 cup water 1/3 cup light brown sugar and 1 cinnamon stick you're basically gonna just cook this on medium high heat until all of the sugar is dissolved and then I will show you what is next okay my camera cut me off but what I've done here is my mixture came up to a slight boil the sugar was all melted so I added in 2 cups of apple cider you can use apple juice if you want and then I added in a spoonful or about a tablespoon of this Smuckers salted caramel topping now you can use regular caramel sauce whatever type of caramel that you want this is what I had on hand so this is what I used so now I'm gonna just bring this back up to a slight boil and then it will be ready this has been brought up to a slow boil so now what I'm going to do is remove the cinnamon stick that's in there and then I'm going to pour this into a glass and here it is finished I went ahead and put a little whipped cream on the top and drizzled a little bit of that caramel on there and it is delicious and definitely much cheaper than a Starbucks drink I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you so much for watching and I will see you on the next one [Music] you", "G9odKYNuRzs": "all right everybody's been asking for it this is gonna be the last run on this still so we're gonna make

good it's [ __ ] delicious", "9yS3VGeDElo": "welcome to the licensed Wizards episode 5 today we are going to be cooking for you with you always is Ryan pancake at and today we're going to be making a apple pie shot and what that consists of is what being what the recipe I guess consists of is they say a gallon of apple juice a gallon of apple cider some cinnamon sticks seven to be on a four cups of sugar and always my favorite some Everclear but the main thing is getting all your ingredients set up first Coors is not part of it but I'm telling you the part of making this night happen so anyway let's get this thing going we take off the lid of my pot oh you do need a big silver pot and also some main things that you might need are chef hat and your old Baskin Robbins work uniform now I don't know if you remember but I told you once when we were doing the other thing the jack and coke float shake whatever that I worked at Baskin Robbins here's proof yeah yeah I mean I just tied it in the front oh my god gained a little weight last time since I put this on anyway let's get this thing going to start with my apple juice first and I'm just gonna pour that in nice and gentle get that going and I'm gonna start my oven here turn it on high lighting it lit yet terrified it's lit I hope oh I could feel the flames anyway so I'm pouring out of the apple juice and I'm actually only doing a half today because I'm not going to be drinking too much anymore it is kiddy but we did Musel mince or muscle men's premium apple juice so there I got that thing rockin and rollin put that in there I'll just let that sit for a little bit while I get to sugar ready since we're only doing a half it calls for two cups of sugar so this is my cup thing right here got some huge chunks apparently I've never used sugar okay I'm all about another fine white powder powdered sugar none of this granule stuff so I'm gonna pour just one cup in right now move it all around so far so good all right second cup sugar yeah oh yeah good stuff ran out in there by the way if you want to know a little background story to this shot first time I ever had it with some friends that I used to work with and it was so good I thought now paint your house if you give me the recipe and I painted their house and vomit because I drank too much may mainly be Everclear [ __ ] my ass up or it could have been them taking advantage of me anyway gonna grab a spoon I choose plastic because you know I don't like wood like he's dead tonight dead to the world anyway I'm turning around you don't want that sugar to burn on the bottom still in there eventually it'll dissolve which is great alright just a recap of what I've done so far I poured the apple juice in started the things you don't know your pot Behrman now I'm putting in the apple cider oh yeah oh that's getting everywhere Oh oh man that reminds me of me this morning Jesus Christ I was pumping so much on my eyeballs gonna fall out anyway then this recipe calls for seven cinnamon sticks if you're doing the gallon gallon per gallon recipe but since I'm not I'm only doing three and a half one two oh two and a half and that's right I'll pick this back up and put that in there my floors clean xx honor yesterday anyway so we're back we're sad were normal and you just let that boil and they say for an hour and you know occasionally coming in stir it around you know get that thing going kind of looks like diarrhea especially when you get to the cinnamon sticks up in there floating around but as you notice I haven't put any Everclear yet because you add that last you let this boil then let it cool down then have you ever clear in there and we'll we'll be back soon so give me an hour we'll be back with you shortly and we're back it's been an hour and we're ready to do it it's cooled down it's still a little steaming but not as much as it was so we're gonna pour the Everclear in now and here we go since we're doing half the order we're only pouring in 500 milliliters which is half of a liter listen to that glug glug glug but it's gonna sound like when they pump your stomach because this is gonna [ __ ] your life up and there we are we're under set to rock and roll Oh pour it in maybe licky me stir it around a little bit and we have other ingredients later just to spruce up the look of the shot whipped cream and cinnamon on top will show you the finished product when we come back all right so so now we're getting close to the finished product and with me always is coffee Doug and Mike water pipe and here's some finished products right here what we did is after we put in the Everclear and stir it around a little bit we put it in the refrigerator to cool it off because it is supposed to be a cool shot and we do this is something I never done but we are today going to put Cool Whip on it and we're gonna put a little bit of ground cinnamon and all we're gonna do is just we're just gonna tilt that up and squirt a little in there and then you're just gonna put a little dab or two a cinnamon on there and all right everybody grab their shot and bottoms up everyone I thought very good that was great I was really good Wow I always I never clear strong oh yeah burns a little disclaimer I think it needs more ever clear disclaimer very good drink um ever clear will get you drunk very fast and I'm going to tell you is that the point that it tastes that good yeah I want to tell you it's one of those that just kind of creeps up on you one of those shots that just creeps up on you and if apple juice or anything Apple does that like makes you want to [ __ ] uncontrollably well and I only suggest maybe doing three shots because after six your [ __ ] is gonna be doing shots well shot them to the toilet four or five four or five will probably still make you poop uncontrollably a good wall and winter drink - I'm a fighter it is then get it in the produce department at your store by the way mm-hmm very good

it's WWAY youtube.com slash the wisest wizards see you later", "xZYQeyqF4NQ": "[Music] hi guys welcome to my blog pies and tacos today I'm going to show you how to make apple macarons let's check it out I'm going to start by sifting my almond flour and my powdered sugar which I have already measured I'm going to sit them in this bowl and I'm gonna set them aside okay so here I have a double boiler with barely simmering water and I'm gonna pull my bowl on top of the pen I already have my sugar measured out and my egg whites measured out that I'm gonna whisk this for about one or two minutes until the sugar is melted so the best way to tell if the sugars melted is to just touch it with your fingers if you don't feel any any sugar pieces in there use a sugar smelted and you're good to go to the mixer we're going to start with thee on little speed so start on low speed for about one minute so when the Marine is looking for me and starting to get white in color you start to realize speed [Music] now we're on VM for about two more minutes so when you see that the width is leaving some streak marks on the meringue it's time to up the speed stuff hi so a quick pause to check our meringue so this is definitely not ready you see if it's bending to the side it's not ready keep on whipping it let's check this meringue now this Mary is definitely ready see sip Peaks shooting right off with a slight bent at the top it's not bending to the side your meringue is bending to the side you need to keep on waiting in okay this is how your meringue should look like so what I want to do with this with this macarons I want to make the shell two colors I want to make the shells red and white so I'm going to start out by adding the dry ingredients to them to the meringue the sifted almond flour and powdered sugar and I'm going to fold this just until they're incorporated just until I see no more dry ingredients in the better that's it and then I'm going to stop okay so now that I see no more dry ingredients I've stopped folding the batter and I'm going to divide the batter into this two different bowls so I'm going to put half of the batter and this bowl over here so one batter is gonna be white and the other there is going to be red I'm going to cover it with a towel so it doesn't dry out I'm gonna set this on this side so we can work with this better word we're going to color this right so I'm going to add some red food coloring I'm going to add just a little touch of pink and now I'm going to fold this until the batter is ready to be piped so let's check out the color first to see if we need to adjust or add a little bit more red one side some more red food coloring so here check it out pick up some better the better is flowing very effortlessly off the spatula and it just won't stop flowing you see that still fly off the spatula that means folks that this better is ready to go okay and I'm gonna bag here I didn't cut the tip off the bag I'm going to put it on a cup and I'm going to put my better inside this bag ready to go see this better is not ready yet it's pointing off to slowly of the spatula and it stops flowing so this batter needs to be folded a little bit longer you want a better that's a little bit more fluid than that you know that's more like it now I have my two batters right there so as soon as you're done piping about the macaroons you want to slam the tree it's really hard to get the counter like this but make sure you slam it really hard against the counter so you can release the air bubbles they're attracting the better after you pipe the better track you're Michael Ruhlman's and see if you see any air bubbles if you see some air bubbles you can use a toothpick to help pop them okay now we're gonna let the macaron shells rest and dry and the drying time will depend on how humid the day is a pot your houses alright guys so now it's been about thirty minutes and I'm going to start baking the macaroons because the shells are dry to the touch that means that when I touch them with my finger no batter comes out of my finger they feel completely dry to the touch that's when you know your shells are ready to bake so I'm going to breathe beat one tree at a time and I bake for about five minutes rotate the tray bake for 5 more minutes rotate the tray make sure you have oven thermometers in your oven so you can control the temperature because home ovens they're not accurate at all and the temperature can be way off than what you started to so now the bottoms are baking I'm going to make the Apple feeling so here I have about one cup of chopped apples I chopped them tiny because since you're gonna want to feel the macarons you don't want huge chunks of Apple so this is about two small to medium apples I'm also going to add a little squeeze of lemon juice and I'm also going to add a little bit of water not even a tablespoon just maybe half a tablespoon of water we're going to cook this a toast for about four minutes until there's they have softened up a little bit you should notice that the mixture is a little bit dry you can add a little bit more water so now that my apples are soft I'm going to add some cinnamon a little bit of nutmeg and we're gonna add a quarter cup of brown sugar and we're gonna cook this until the sugar melts and it thickens a little bit with the apples now that the mixture has reduced and the surest caramelized and it's very nice and thick decals are soft we're going to add a little bit of cornstarch I have here about half a teaspoon of cornstarch and I'm going to add a little bit of water to it to dissolve it it mix it and add that right in with the apples and we're going to cook this until it's thick so should take about one minute so now I'm going to transfer the apple the Apple feeling to a little bowl and I let it cool all the way in the fridge hi guys so I'm back and now we're going to make the cinnamon cream cheese frosting so we're going to need three ounces of cream cheese one and a half ounce of butter one cup of powdered sugar sittin already we're also going to add some cinnamon powder and I'm also going to add 1/4 teaspoon of so I feel like this consistency is just a perfect it's not too runny and not too dry if you feel like the frosting is a bit too stiff you can add a tiny bit of water or milk to thin it out and if you feel like the frosting is too runny you can always add a little bit more sips of powdered sugar to make it stiffer so here I have my piping bag with a small round tip it's a 12 Wilton I'm going to put my frosting and this piping bag [Music] alright guys so here at my Apple locker rooms I hope you enjoy watching me make this recipe and go to my blog post and go to my to my blog peasant tacos to check out many tips on how to make macarons [Music]", "Q0400NP3jjA": "okay we're back this is classic Diane Lopez and we're from a plastics orchard and we're doing said after dark for any of those that caught us the first time I might have panicked and thought I was on my crafty quilty Instagram orchard and I need to be on the orchard so yes you're we're in the right stack all right okay so we are gonna do side after dark this is called apple cider on the rocks I am apple pie on the rocks okay and we're gonna use our apple cider that we just processed the first very very first batch of the season cider okay so when we make cider all we do is we take all of our apples seconds we put them through this press it's a hydraulic press so it like crushes the apples up it goes up this elevator it goes into this thing and then the the cidery the Apple II goodness goes into pressing claws and it gets pressed by this thing and the juice comes out and then we dump the dry pulp and then we do it all again yeah and again this process and it goes like that so the cider changes as the season goes out mm-hmm right now this is majority pala red apple cider but there is also zest our there's ginger gold some Scarlets there's Dutchess there's Chenango strawberry anything that we have stanzas there's even a Connie because we had some of those before we press the first batch so anything you've seen us oh okay so anything that you've seen us post that we have for apples that's in this cider but it is majority of Polaroids okay all right so the very first thing luckily we do not have to model oh it's good somebody left a comment oh I'm somebody's to work with when I was a kid actually that you muddle before you put the liquor in and then it works better oh so Justin Leonard yeah all right so I also already have lost my setter after dark mug but I have mine yes Dan's on top but I'm going to have drink Wisconsin believe which is perfect because the Badgers played tonight Robo buck right so weird I know then what we're gonna do is we're gonna take our site after dark shot glass I have created a zazzle website so if you guys want to order the mugs or the shot glasses or the coasters you can do so there I have my coaster Kim's is missing well I know where it is I'm just too lazy oh alright so we're gonna start with fireball and it says a shot a fireball but I really like fireball do you feel okay I love flower boy so do you think we should go like I think a shot and a half cuz we're gonna have to put another yes we have we have another you know about kiss so we're gonna we always add just a little booze to what the actual recipe says and then we're gonna put in some delicious Burnett's vanilla vodka so Frank bought this yes he did Frank and they went shopping so I'm guessing this is definitely top shelf and yeah yeah because Franco is good talk so this is this isn't a plastic bomb I'm sure we didn't find very many Woodman's I said well we do need vanilla vodka and bourbon so we'll have a bourbon something will figure it out okay there's not gonna be any room for cider okay so now our cups are this full of booze well it's mostly ice oh right nice all right so now cider it's on pasteurize i'm preserved i don't know the strainer might have come off a little so there might be some good pulp in here okay so we're gonna fill it with cider the recipe said four ounces who cares yeah fill up your cup all right yeah right then it also said did you give me the stir sticks and the spoon where'd you put them oh shoot okay so I was furious oh yeah so I was hoping this had a little thing on it and it doesn't so there's your pinch of cinnamon my pinch of cinnamon I was gonna like spam Lily sprinkle it but I don't have my sprinkler this is Ceylon cinnamon from pennsie spices then I have a little bit of we need a little I don't remember how much it's brown sugar I didn't say brown sugar so this is also brown sugar so then we're gonna stir no weeds this time okay cheers Cheers that's good it is good very good vanilla cinnamon there's definitely booze in this I definitely yes there's definitely poisonous um okay because I forgot to do this last time I have to try it with some bitters cuz I really like my drinks to be pink so I don't know it's like spicy here sort of horse you know charity but great kept some maraschino cherry it's not really spicy I know I don't know what do you think bitters taste like if you like bitters like Fitz I didn't drink this there was one wind and they have a little you overlooking well there was one drinking that will change your mind in the bitters right the track was oh yeah the chocolate did not need bitters oh yeah bitters are goodness baby very good don't feel free to add some bitters makes a pink earth I still need to find that glitter so I know I know I have glitter somewhere edible glitter um so yeah like so I was very good Oh excellent yep this is great cheers again Cheers alright guys thank you so much this I think is episode 27 or 28 alright awesome can you say you can", "aXR5vGzcUcE": "[Music] you", "eYphYwHrZOI": "bon jovi hey dude happy homebrew thingy you're right I wasn't going to do one this week because I've not really got much going on I bottled the the Cascade beer the Cascade Algar I've done in last week's video now forgive the noise that's not me farting that's next-door drilling they still having their extensions done on the roof and stuff so it's gonna be noisy not do anything about that apologize so yeah I'll be the beer has been bottled the cascade owl it might be the house beer don't really know yet until I try it it's bottled it's in the kitchen room temperature yeah so we'll see how that turns then they'll I believe that in the cargo boxes for a couple of weeks to carbonate and then we'll give it a go see what it's like but I thought I'd use this opportunity yes I haven't really got anything else going on I haven't really got any planned brews coming up either between now and Christmas because as you know I've got quite a few beers in the beer shed hopefully they'll be protected because they're all in cardboard boxes so hopefully you know the weather won't go down so much that it will freeze them at the moment they're all nice and course I could just pop out and have a cold beer which is quite nice but I wasn't gonna have a drink today I was gonna I was gonna because I'm still recovering from the way you came to go now to admit kendama some of you may have seen the videos before I had to take them down from YouTube apologies for that there were one or two curse words in there and a few offensive remarks made by individuals who were perhaps under the influence of alcohol so I apologize for that but I've taken them down now no offence was was made and they're gone so you ain't got worry about that won't happen again yeah awful it was a laugh we had a good day and oh it was all in good fun but you know those two layers they can't take donate for a day ere with royally they're not used to drinking bloody Navon 'as things ya know they don't know do they they don't know they're born yes I was owned I was endorsed by something like that might be about half-past seven so I decided to kick off the old cast anyway and we did a broadcast and it was it was good so it's good to see you in there folks and thanks for joining me after my day in London with the lads we did it anyway well later than usual but we kicked it off then we had a good time play some good shoes and had some good company in here so thanks for popping in just a little bit of a shout out to Jay muff I know he's not gonna see this but you know I need to give a shout out because he's not doing the wrong live casts anymore he's had enough of the of the trolls in there and negative negativity basically which you know you do need a heart of steel to be able to cut yourself off from it and sometimes it can get a little bit too much so he's decided to go and cost somewhere else and he's doing that right now and I've popped in there to see him and he's new location and it's all very well and good it looks really good a different location Turville I think he's on Ustream but I think if you go to Jay music radio services something like that calm you'll see you'll find him he's good lad so yeah it was a good night Jay popped in and we wave goodbye to Jay and we played some tunes and we had a good time but I'm rambling again look what I've got here this is a cider I know if you can see it carbonation there's pretty good it's the apple pie Turner both side of that I made in a few homebrew Wednesday videos ago probably two or three weeks ago now maybe even longer I don't know God everyone did it I can better remember what bleating died a week is folks at the moment it's just nightmare what else is going on yeah people who asked me about the job situation so I thought I'd just give you all an update it's just dragging on forever I understood that things were all done and dusted a couple of weeks ago and as it turns out they weren't so it's been delayed now and possibly until the 1st of January so you know between now and the 1st of january obviously I'm still looking for work elsewhere I can't rely on the fact that this other job is going to work out because it may not so I'm still looking folks and you know this time he is not the best time to look for work so it's a struggle forgive me I've got little bit of wind because I've had some of this cider yeah it's tough at the moment I mean it's tough anyway but it's even tougher at the moment because there's just no jobs so anyway enough for the round balls let's get on with this this is the turbo PI picture by PI turncoat apple pie cider it's not really apple pie like folks I don't know what those Canadians are thinking really see the carbonation is on me is not bad there is some carb in there now I opened it a week or two ago and it was flat as anything I don't know what went on because I did put the right amount of sugar in something's gone on at some point where it just didn't carve it refused to carve up so all I did was I open the bottles again and put in another teaspoon of sugar closed him up again kept an eye on just to make sure they weren't gonna you know turn into bottle explosions and fortunately all of these were put into plastic pet bowls some most of them were two-liter once you know the two-liter pop bottles that you can get most of them were gone into that and fortunately it's worked out okay so I put this bottle in the fridge earlier today as you can hear in the background the fridge is on there's no beer sadly fermenting in that beer fridge of doom at the moment it's just a normal box standard fridge and it's just keeping some cold beers cold for me I got I got surveys are in there and I've got the festival golden stag which I'll do a little review on at some point in the near future we've already done it on the forum live casts but I'll stick it up on YouTube so you guys can take a look at it if you don't want to chew me into the cows so there just give it give me a little sip hmm that's alright you can see the kalakanya sort the dark look usually the same color as my siders a little darker than usual there's an initial sweetness there there's a slight hit of alcohol which is unusual because I used a 775 yeast maybe it didn't quite ferment all the way out I think it did because it was there was quite a quite an initial hit of fermentation on the 775 it kicks off fairly quickly folks we've been sort of twelve hours it you know it starts going a little bit mental and it seemed to ferment all the way out to 1.000 so we're looking about a 5% cider here and it's fine okay it doesn't taste of apple pie so I don't know quite why that is the case or is not the case but having said that there's a hint of cinnamon in there although it's not ever overpowering what I think I would like to do next time is throw in twice as much cinnamon sticks then went into it this time because it's not it's not enough for me there's only a slight hint of cinnamon in there then it's on the smell really rather than the taste yeah little bit of sweetness in there too not quite as as perhaps medium to dry as my normal sizes are which is fine I don't mind sweet ciders I'll drink sweet side little medium sizes or dry side to side to side or anything they're back it's alright it's it's Pleasant would I do it again yeah I'd do it again but I put more cinnamon in France and more cinnamon sticks I think I only did a small batch as well I think I did seven liters didn't I so I'm glad I only did a small batch because the first time you try something if you do a small batch of it you know you can get to know whether you like it or not and you can tweak and put other things into it that you that you feel can improve it next time around I'll probably do a similar amount but twice as much cinnamon there's some brown sugar in there as well like brown sugar so yeah it's okay folks it's it's sweet it's aptly but it's no more aptly than a normal cider I don't think there's just a hint of cinnamon in there but not enough for me to say yeah it tastes like apple pie doesn't really not not to my palate anyway so shout out to Steve 45 CA anyway because he came up with the initial idea it wasn't my idea it was he's so Steve thank you for that I gave it a go but it's not cinnamony enough for me mate it's not quite right it needs a little bit more in there so yeah I will give it a go again maybe maybe not between now and Christmas but maybe next year we'll we'll revisit the ciders we'll do some more and we'll give it a go one thing I've also well about the sizes as well rather yeah it pop me is I did the last of my cider kids by muntins that I had lying around and again I gotta be honest folks it's hot it's not horrible but it's just bland as anything it's this is better than that this is better than that muntins cider kit to be honest with you so I don't know what it is but these cider kits folks I really can't find one that I like I've tried the loads and they either come out too thin and you have to brew them short but then when you brew them short you get sort of thick syrupy taste to them and trying to get this off the right balance between the sort of thickness the thinness and the taste is it's just too hard and they're not that good anyway so if you've tried a cider kit out there that you've found that really works for you do let me know because I'll be interested to to find out what you think about the side it gets folks I think you can get a better cider if you do it yourself with just normal supermarket apple juice but that's just my opinion you're entitled to your own opinion yeah that's the end of this week's babble folks I'll see you on next week's home very Wednesday video but I doubt there'll be much going on between now and then I might do some more taste tests of what I've got in the fridge of course we've got the comparison between the Valar good Mexican cerveza and the old Mexican cerveza okay so we've got the comparison between those two coming at some point so I'll shut those up maybe do those in the next few weeks and also a taste test on the on the Goulburn stag for you I really like it I think it's a fine hoppy beer and you know we'll give that a sip and I'll show you what it looks like and give you my opinion on it so that's all from me cheers folks I'll see you on the next one hello",

You can look online,and most of the recipes are for a very big batch. They say like a gallon of apple juice and a gallon of apple cider, And a liter of Everclear. But we're going to cut it down cause we are going to be more practical about it. Basically you take equal portions of apple juice and apple cider, put it on a low rolling boil and let it simmer with some cinnamon sticks; that's where you're going to get your flavor from. We're going to do 2 cups each, so\u2014 Just because I don't need a whole punch bowl full  of Hot Apple Pie shots. Okay, so that's 2 cups of apple cider\u2014 Then we're going to go apple juice on top of that which is another 2 cups. We're going to see how that turns out. And I think \u2014 We can turn that burner on. And I have some cinnamon sticks. Oh, look at that\u2014you can't see. We'll throw about three in there. And we'll let it go, ehh \u2014we'll go four. What the hell. We'll let that go for a while, boil it up, and let it simmer for awhile. And you want to let it go for about 2 hours. It will get all that cinnamon and apple flavor. Then we're going to let it cool down; then we'll come back, and we'll finish it up. I even added some more juice to this, because it kept boiling down. And you can see its a lot darker now. And I think the idea is that you want to get one part apple juice,  one part cider, one part everclear. Maybe slightly less then one part (of Everclear). so we're going to add \u2014 Whoa, that's a lot of Everclear, too. We're going to add a cup of Everclear to this puppy. It might be good , it might be terrible, but we're going to find out. We're going to find out in just a second. Alright so we got our concoction done; We're going to try it right now and tell you if it tastes like apple pie. Here we go, the Apple Pie Shot. Pretty delicious.  It tastes a lot like apple pie.  It's pretty grub. And it doesn't even taste that alcoholic  even though I just dumped a ton of Everclear in there. So, yes! Big hearty thumbs up.  This is the Apple Pie shot made with Everclear. It's pretty simple; You just need to set aside some time to boil down  your juice, your cider,  and your cinnamon.

Warm Apple Pie Shot w/ Everclear: Boil equal parts of: Apple cider & apple juice with cinnamon sticks. Let cool and add: Everclear to taste. Drinks With Diablo: A presentation of TheFNDC.com", "2tMSL6QATEY": "all right folks we're back it's been about 16 days and this hard apple cider has been fermenting it got really cloudy for a few days and most that is settled out not seeing much activity in it at all right now so we're going to do is we're going to siphon it out of here into another gallon container and then we're going to top it off with fresh apple juice and we're hoping that that fresh apple juice won't be enough to prime the yeast that's in here get them started a little bit we're going to pour it in the bottles cap it off let it sit for another week and then when we open it up at that point we're hoping it's gonna be fizzy so anyhow that's it that's the update all right folks so here we are we have siphoned the hard cider the apple pie hard cider into this gallon container topped it off with fresh apple juice and then what we're gonna do now is we're gonna bottle this stuff so let me get set up and actually know what I think I Bryce that up now we're gonna do this white trash stuff and if it turns out and it's good maybe we'll buy some some real bottles but uh I'm gonna go ahead and get this get this party started everything's been cleaned and sanitized this stuff smells very cinnamon cinnamon Nene just go ahead get this starting close yet we're making a mess all right I'm gonna need a second to clean up here lark folks here we are made a little bit bigger of a mess than I plan to we ended up with about three and a half liters and we're gonna let this sit for about a week and we're hoping that it's going to get a little fizzy I was able to pour myself a glass and taste it and I will say that it had a very unique flavor it's not quite like anything I've ever tasted and let's hope that over the next week it has some some time to round out and develop further so anyhow that's it just wanted to do an update let everybody know where we are I will come back in a week and let everybody watch me drink it thanks", "6l2O_wcPJ_A": "good morning how you doing today your humble Apple they make fantastic wine it's not a cider they can make from apples but other one is amazing there are so many varieties of Apple up there from the humble Granny Smith to your winged blush ones they all add different flavors to your wine serve experiments if you have a trainee Darden lucky you use them easier windfall apples use your go scrumping ghost footprint a neighbor's find the apples the flavors and the variety of apples will add great depth to your wines so try and use a mixture of different types of apple there are various different methods of maintain a pure white one is even juicy apples as you would do a cider but I like to make my wine on the pulp which basically means chunk up your apples and then you pour over boiling water and let the pected enzyme and the yeast extract all the flavor and nutrients first thing we need to do is prepare your apples so what you want to do is remove any bad bits of the apple any bruises any moldy bits use the simple knife cut them out and now into your compost heap we don't want for any of the multi bits in your apples because this will attract wild yeast and mold here one you want your wine to ferment using yeast but ideally only the yeast you add to it now you can make wine use in world yeasts that's a different matter but you don't want mold mold is bad mold is very bad when it comes to wine so to start all of those come off manual bits once you've gone through all your apples removing any bad bits you want to aim to be left with about three to four kilos of good Apple this will create a lovely full-bodied fragrance tasty wine if you have less apples if you have to remove more than you thought it would still make a great wine without two kilos of apples but I tend to like her a fuller bodied wine so I'm aiming for about three three and a half kilos of Apple then comes the fun bit of chunkier apples into little chokers the smaller the better because the biggest of the surface area the more they're to strap the juice and the flavor and all that lovely delicious sugar you don't need to peel your apples because a load of the flavor nutrients and sugar is just below the peel but he may want to remove the seeds if you're worried about a tiny tiny tiny bit of arsenic that they contain personally I don't miss worth worrying about once you've dropped all of your apples and you have about three to four kilos worth you want to put them into a clean laundry bag you can buy these online you can buy these from your local pam store pound loans deals whatever it might be dirt cheap normally throw in a pack and they're great for not only keeping your socks together but their grids as well for keeping all of your fruit together when you ferment in a big budget it just saves the pieces of Apple to get stuck up his - no one like that do they a bit of a couple of you siphoned make sure it's clean sterilized I have mine in boiling water just now if you don't have a laundry cloth I can't find one you don't use a cheesecloth they work just as well that said you want to put all of your chopped apples into your bag [Music] [Applause] add the whole bag which happily into your fermenting book and now it's time to prepare your sugar oh it's this recipe calls for one point three kilos of sugar I'm using 500 grams of dark soft brown sugar I find that the nuttiness of the brown sugar really brings out a great deal of extra flavor to gobbles it always becomes a caramelized toffee apple flavor in a wine it really complements a load of dishes to 500 grams of dark brown sugar and 800 grams of your white sugar fantastic so I've gathered [Music] and more oh your apples you also want to add a good squirt of lemon juice about one lemons worth so a really good pour if you use bottles or the juice of a whole lemon if you're using lemons I'm using the juice from the bottle because I'm keeping these lemons for a lemon wine that's coming up soon oh yes pour away and you also want to add one tea bag one normal tea bag none this herb of fruity stuff I've made fruity tea bag one people it's a good drop of wine you really won't be using a normal tea bag because that adds a lot of Italians that you need for this recipe for the Apple wine to really be brilliant next step is to put the kettle on to cover with about 4 litres of boiling water scrumpy and then give it a really good stir to dissolve all of that sugar and that the juice and tea bag all mixed in a fantastic the toffee apple fragrance is really coming through delicious and now it's simply a case of waiting wait until it cools down to lukewarm room temperature so drop with a kettle on half a cup of tea I'm join me and a few seconds now in a minute [Music] [Music] [Music] hello I'm back the Apple wine has been allowed to cool down to room temperature maybe just above it look warm tepid and it's smelling divine it is as given off a really great aroma reminds me of toffee apples it's sweet it's did he it's that brown sugar has really helped to bring out this nutty toffee a rumor to it and I can't wait to try this what we need to do now is add some pepto lace which really helps to break down the apples less peptic enzyme in apples and you really need to add some petal a's which is a chemical that offsets that pettite enzyme to prevent the patented haze forming in your wine if you don't add this stuff you could end up with a bit of a hey easy wine dress perfectly fine let me say if you don't have this it just means that the clarity of your wine isn't going to be as sparkly as if he didn't I'm sorry cheap and it does make your wine that much better so why not add a teaspoon to your wine if you're using a high exit enzyme fruits such as berries apples hard fruits there's a whole list and I'll give a link down below to all the fruits and vegetables you're shooting a stretch lace with whenyou anyone making service add a teaspoon per gallon into your budgets and also add your yeast I'm using a high alcohol dessert wine yeast because I think the toffee flavor of the toffee apple wine would really really make a delicious dessert wine it has the flavor it'll not carry the LDL strength so you just want to open up a sachet or open up your tub if use in the tub of generic yeast you don't have to use a higher draw wine yeast anyone Eastwood would it's just my preference to use this type of wine yeast in this type of wine but choose whichever one yeast you want to use you know open up your sashing sprinkle it in and trust it and then give it a really good stir you want to get that nests where those apples then all submerged bright the way under the liquid people pushing it down give it a really good stir the yeast and the pets lace will break down the apples extract all their flavor all the juice and all the goodness put a lid on it attach now look set it aside in a warm place for a week and let it ferment - wait you want to stir it daily every day of the week maybe twice a day the other time and let the yeast and the factories eat away at the apples that break them down but I saw they'd witnessed and then come and join me don't wait one time or a second in this video see you soon well hello you that's a very quick wait for you listen if they and you felt like a second anyway the toffee upper one is looking amazing it is fantastic the apples have been stewing in the liquid all week I've been giving it a stir every day submerging the upper pieces and it is looking and smelling divine fantastic anyway show you have a look oh yeah you're excited one of the beauties of using a mesh bag if that is so easy to hike out and pull out and extract all the pieces of Apple or fruit even using that right reaching put it up it saves put it through a sieve and having all those little pieces leftover shrimp off reaching there hey you wanted out to your net a trip string but don't squeeze it you don't endless running once it's tripped drink you want to put into a pot ready to throw onto neutron pasta and hike outs that tea bag as well that's been in there all week I have failed or at my last demijohns not bad I mean it's that's not too good it's not too bad either I light happen the more thing I'm going to be using a five liter plastic water bottle I don't mind fermenting in plastic but I like to mature my ones in glass I think we better get this filled up so this will be a simple trace I'll find a funnel pour it in and make sure that there are no apple pieces in it my boy has run off with that one he's going to use it as a toy don't drop I have a spare I always have a few of these in stock you make great toys and they're so handy for your wine as well so grab bottle or Deming job and your phone straight in math and then pour in your apple wine fantastic Wow the color is so rich the texture and consistency of the liquid is really thick at the moon's but that's just the apple pulp giving off bits of fiber but our drop down in time and it will clear out to be a beautiful clear smart thing won't move these caps are amazing they fit standard five liter water bottles and they come pre-drilled pre-board with a grommet in it they fit the bottles they fit standard air locks and they are cheapest chips and it's a really easy way of converting a five liter water bottle into a demijohn as I said earlier I don't mind fermenting in plastic however I am bit of a purist and I would rather lecture my one Zane glass demijohns so these are great for the initial stage of fermentation the link to these wonderful little traps is down below in the description I love them they are great a half half dozen or so on standby for those times when you do fill up all of your demijohns rather you simply then you're good to attach your ear doc said airside at a warm place let it ferment and bubble away to his heart's truths hence sediment would drop the sugar were turning to alcohol and all you need to do rack it off at amateur in a trance stemming job or even a plastic thing Johnny if you so wish why don't you check out some other country wine videos I've made a whole playlist worth loads of ideas and inspiration for you see you soon", "5wQPWkhVsXk": "hmm what sounds good after a apple pie recipe geez man i don't know how about hard apple cider and that's right guys as you know by now today we're going to go over how to make a hard apple cider this is my first attempt at it here i've never done this before so i'm taking you guys along for the journey all right guys now the first step that i'm going to do is add one quart of cranberry juice to this pot and get it cooking all right guys now that i got that that going i'm gonna add roughly two pounds of brown sugar to this pot and let it dissolve [Music] now that i've got my sugar in there it's mostly dissolved i'm going to add my cinnamon sticks and in this recipe i'm just going off of my tastes here i like cinnamon quite a bit so i'm going to go ahead and throw 12 cinnamon sticks in the pot um to my bowling pot i am going to add about two oh let's say three teaspoons of vanilla extract and that'll kind of give it a vanilla nice creamy flavor i'm hoping i'm gonna let this simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes let all those flavors that we just added this pot infused with each other and while we're waiting the next step is just to sanitize our fermentation vessel so if you guys don't know what this is it's just star sand um it's fairly cheap to use you mix it with water and it's just a standard sanitizer most beer and wine makers use this on the regular and it takes like half an ounce per five gallons or one ounce per five gallons i think it says yeah one ounce per five gallons now i only have just a little bit of water in the bottom of this here so i'm just going to go ahead and add just a little bit of this to it and that's plenty just built the everywhere man that's and i'm not even gonna add that up all right now i'm gonna take this and just shake it up all right now she's real foamed up and they say don't fear the foam on this stuff guys and we just pour everything right on top of the foam in this bowl i have my airlock and my stopper i'm going to just dump this right into here there we go we'll let that sit and sanitize all right guys our pots almost done and while we're waiting for that to finish up i'm going to go ahead and add this into our sanitation thing and just kind of roll it around here just maybe kill off anything that might be on that stainless steel funnel give this another quick stir here it's simmering real nice okay so i think we're we're getting pretty close here maybe a few more minutes all right i'm going to go ahead and turn this off now and uh we'll start adding stuff to our fermentation vessel all right now while we're waiting for that to complete what i'm gonna do is add my apple juice to my container now the recipe that i came up with is one gallon apple juice two gallons of apple cider and about a half of a half gallon so one quart of cranberry juice and two pounds of brown sugar and we're gonna see where that leaves us um and of course you know you got 12 cinnamon sticks in there and your vanilla extract so i'm going to go ahead and add this into our fermenter now [Music] all right this is smelling terrific guys i'm gonna go ahead and shut this down it looks done we look real good and i am gonna attempt to pour this in this four four ounce this four inch funnel here and we'll see how we how we do we got all of our sugar added here i'm gonna let this cool down good um and then we're gonna pitch our yeast now that our uh cider is cooled off we are going to take our starting gravity reading and what this will tell us is how much sugar we have for our yeast ferment um and our potential alcohol content um and this is a hydrometer if you guys want to know a little more about this check out my video it would be this corner uh which is uh tips for the new distiller all right so i'm just going to go ahead and let this float in here she just barely floats so we're at 1.070 i mean if you kind of turn this here um and it will give you roughly i'd say we're at close to nine percent alcohol by volume that's about where i want to be i don't want anything super strong um that will give us a good chance a good shot here uh of having a fairly dry product without a real high alcohol content i'm not a fan of something that has 15 16 percent alcohol in it i'm just not some people are and that's fine that's just not my jam so what we're going to do now is set this to the side and open our yeast the yeast we're using today is lablin's ec 1118 it's a champagne yeast it should ferment this down right to dry there should be nothing left it's a great yeast i have nothing but good things to say about this stuff i've used it quite a bit and other things so we're going to go ahead and cut this open and pitch it dry all right now i'm just going to let that do its thing it'll hydrate in there and get started while we're waiting on that i'm going to go ahead and put together our airlock and our stopper here all right guys and then we just let this thing do its thing we're gonna let it sit for about i would say a week 10 days and we'll come back to it and take a gravity reading and if it's still not done we'll give it a little longer wow this is the best stuff this is some of that apple pie that i made in the last video guys it turned out amazing it's super clear i don't know if you can kind of see it there um it tastes amazing tastes just like apple pie should it was a huge hit at the holiday party and no problems no complaints uh we drank quite a bit of it so

stay safe and shine on man that's some good stuff [Music] you", "2PMy32A7XmQ": "hey everybody I'm Adrian bustamante and welcome back to food deconstructed on this episode we're deconstructing the very famous dessert apple pie and this recipe is one of my favorites because I like to partake in the libations is the warm cider and rum cocktail we have a few different options here in regards to ingredients so we're going to start by actually taking our pot and putting it over a flame we're going to be using apple cider and unsweetened apple juice so I'm going to be taking about four cups of each and placing them in our pot 22 and theres two now we're also going to be adding three-quarters cup of brown sugar a quarter cup of granulated sugar two of sticks of cinnamon and then I'm going to be opening up some of this vanilla bean and throwing in that in there as well so let's go ahead and add our brown sugar quarter cup of salt again our two cinnamon sticks to open up your vanilla bean all you really need to do is slice this right down the middle leaving it almost filet it this way you can kind of take out the inside and place that in our pot here it should just come off a nice little black pace there for you throw that in there the same thing for the other side we're going to do is going to bring this to a boil and then once this comes to a boil I'm going to bring it back down to a simmer and i'll be adding our alcohol so we'll start working on now is our little man made cups now what we did was we actually scooped out the inside of our larger honeycrisp apples and turn them into a little vessel here for your drink later now this is a fun way just to kind of add a little bit of flair to like a party or just a little get-together you might have so you can try this at home it's nice and simple this one's already finished but i'm going to show you kind of how we did it on this slightly unfinished version so all we're going to do is we're going to take our little scoop here and just go at the inside nice and easy now what i like to do is try the best you can to leave a little bit of an edge around close to the skin you don't want it too thin start getting real soggy once you'll start putting drinks in it now this one actually sits flat on its own sometimes you get an apple it doesnt sit so flat so we did here is we actually just cut the bottom piece off to make it flatter but this one sits well on its own so we're not going to need to do that and so we don't have to worry about new spills we're going to take a little bit of a cinnamon and sugar mixture here and just kind of put it on the inside of the cup and then I'm just going to rub it around a little bit so you get that cinnamon and sugary flavor all throughout the cup so it's going to glad add those extra spices to your drink as you drink it through we are going to add once this boils and we spring it down to a simmer again is we're going to bring in one and a half cups of whipped cream flavored vodka and then we're going to bring in a cup of rum so again you can add as much or as little alcohol as you want this is about a good average mix compared to what we have in here so shouldn't be too strong but it shouldn't be too sweet should be right down the middle okay what I did was actually let this reduce for about five to ten minutes after it came to its boil so now we're going to add our alcohol a little bit of rum here and a whipped cream flavored vodka again you can add whatever alcohols or flavored alcohols you want is just some that I came up with so you have to wait much longer once that's in there I do is grab our ladle start serving remember to watch out for that vanilla bean pod and those cinnamon sticks that are in there you have it and what I'm also going to do is for a little bit of garnish play some cinnamon sticks in here now can't really use them as straws that well but they'll do for now there you have it guys warm apple cider and rum cocktail alright let's see how this drink tastes oh yeah that just reminds me of that holiday style apple pie you get at Christmas time just got that that winter time in front of a fire type feel to it and you just get that cinnamon the strong obviously apple cider notes and you just get the little hint of sugar that's on the inside of that cup as well one thing I will say is I'm maybe rather have used you know maybe a little less vodka or maybe none at all this kind of maybe a type of drink that uses maybe a dark liquor instead of combining two separate ones but again you can try whatever you like at home that's the fun of it so stay tuned for our next recipe which is apple and onion rings", "iGul9JHyqo8": "hey everybody is Jackie a vegan yack\nattack I'm here with a very special recipe today off of veganyackattack.com it is not a new recipe it is the most popular recipe on my website we're\ntalking 500 thousand and more pins on Pinterest people love this drink it's\napple pie

that might be a shock\nsome booze is not go on barnivore.com and look up your brand and the flavor\nand see if any animal ingredients were used in the process or if there's any in\nthe actual booze some contain honey etc so we have the cinnamon whisky video\nvodka we have apple juice some ground cinnamon some brown sugar for the rim\nfancy and some cinnamon sticks for the optional garnish now we'll just jump\nright into it this is not a hot drink as it may sound this is a cold drink so\nwe're gonna have some ice I'm using a shaker here you can use a glass jar like\nthis because you just want to be able to close it and shake the ingredients\ntogether so I'll put a few cubes in and now I have a jigger here which measures\nout shots for bartenders this side is 2 ounces and this side is 1 ounce I'm\ndoubling the recipe so that you and I can both get a drink in today and we're\ngoing to use the two ounce side so first the cinnamon whiskey two ounces of that and there's a few\ndifferent brands you can get this one rebels Revelstoke is good I like it it's\nfine some have their preferences and we have our vanilla vodka again there's a\nfew different brands that have vanilla vodka two ounces of that and now for the\napple juice you can use anywhere from six to eight ounces or even less if you\nwant it more like a shot it just depends on how diluted you want your drink you\ncan also use apple cider if you want it a little bit more spicy and a little\nmore sweet so I'm adding about six ounces maybe a little more lastly we\nhave our ground cinnamon so just gonna dump that in there you just shake it in\nand now I'm going to shake it up I have this and like I said if you use a jar\njust put the lid on it screw it tight and I'm no bartender so don't judge me\non how this straight shake goes all right just a few times is good ooh nice\nand foamy there before we put it in the glasses we're gonna do our rim so here I\nhave two saucers I have the brown sugar that I mentioned before but first we\nhave this saucer of water and I put a little napkin paper towel in the bottom\nso that when we tap the glass in it doesn't hurt it and then also you don't\nget too much water on the glass so we're just gonna gently tap it on the paper\ntowel drip off the excess and then gently press it into the brown sugar\nuntil we get a nice rim so there's our first one let's do our second OOP a little bubbly noise and you can\neven gonna roll it around in there really get that sugar on you yeah see\ndon't one's good we'll put that one in the center there we go now we'll put ice\nin here I'm just going to use my hand because we're friendly maybe use some\ntones if you're serving some people that you don't know just a few cubes in each\nglass if your winter is anything like ours in California it's actually warm but\nthis will be nice and refreshing next to a hot fire too\nso I'm gonna put a strainer over here so we don't get our melty ice in the drink\nyou can just use a regular strainer or pull the ice out with a spoon or fork\ncarefully I'm going to divide this amongst the glasses yeah that's just\nabout perfect there we go and now we'll garnish with our

apple pie moonshine so I have a gallon of apple cider and I have another apple cider here but you need two apple juice so you can get the cheap stuff in the Dollar Tree so I'm just gonna use the apple cider and the apple juice I have 10 cinnamon sticks and bottle of vodka they say that to use Everclear I don't have it so this is what I'm using so you need a big pot you need to dump the apple cider and the juice into the pot 10 secs one for each bottle that i'm gonna can up so now we're gonna put it on high when this comes to a boil then we're gonna stop it and let it come to room temperature I will bring you back so I forgot to tell you that we need 3 cups of dark brown sugar and I'm using my homemade and I believe that in the show notes or in the I cards above so I'm just putting these back on don't err get into them and I got my three cups we got to stir that all in so into the pot goes the brown sugar homie brown sugar guys homemade you get a wooden spoon and we are gonna stir in this pan when this comes to a boil then we're gonna stir it again and shut this off and I'll bring you back ok guys because this is a big big pot it's taking a long time to boil so now that we've got steam and you can tell that the flavors are combining we're gonna shut this off because I heard you don't have to heat it all the way up to boiling so now we need to cool this back down so we're gonna cool it back down and then we're gonna add the vodka and then we're gonna jar it up so this might take a while guys might keep the Royal came up to temp where you got the steam and it's really really hot to touch if I touch the pan but it's gonna take a while to cool down so I'll bring you back when we're ready to go to the next step okay we're gonna take the temperature of it it's it's good

I got you want to make sure when you fill them you just take the the cinnamon sticks out make sure your hands a wash clean so we're just going to go over here we're going to fill it up right to the rim and then before we cap it we're gonna put a cinnamon stick in which I'm not gonna do on camera but I will show you how many I got and then we're just gonna top it with the seal and the cover and

"it's just not the holidays without cider Martinelli's is a household name for apple juice cider and sparkling cider celebrating its 150th anniversary as a family-owned and operated company and it's great for those non-alcoholic Christmas and New Year's toast oh yeah I'm excited about that and we have a couple of pros here today to show us just how to make these delicious Martinelli's mocktails of course chef Scott Scott Tompkins and Charlotte's ammo from h-e-b welcome welcome welcome what are we gonna be making today so we got a couple of things because obviously it's Martinelli's so it's great to drink it's great to toast with but there is a lot of other things you can do with pretty much any ingredient so it's kind of the fun of what we get to do we're gonna show you how to make a kapil pie caramel sauce Charlie's got a couple cocktails we're gonna start off it's really simple so for this application I did use for the one you're gonna taste the sparkling apple cider but you can obviously use just a regular apple juice either one will work I'm gonna add a cinnamon stick vanilla bean some cloves and of course good amount of sugar buttercup you're gonna bring this up to temp let it all kind of like bubble get real thick and real syrupy and then at the end you strain out all of your vanilla bean and you get this beautiful sauce somebody will say this it's got a buttercream but it's just a reduction of the actual juice itself so it stays very pure and we're gonna serve it over ice cream so Charla has three different types of ice creams so we have creamy creations 1905 vanilla all right we've got creamy creations rocky road and then of course we have creamy creations butter pecan whoo let's go butter pecan oh girl after my own heart hmm that's rather low apple pie caramel sauce on top okay so we're some melted ice cream she's really good you can uh there's a baby there's a baby oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god we have a utensil yes I have a spoon I vary this is not this is not I didn't bring out the fine china just his clothes oh my eyes okay there's so much just a shirt so what we did is we made a cinnamon apple simple syrup to begin with simple syrup is very easy it is very hence the name simple so it's equal parts sugar it's apple juice right and what you do is you reduce that by half I added a couple of cinnamon sticks in there to give it that wonderful cinnamon flavor but it's great and I like to do that apple juice and a simple syrup to give it more of that cinnamon flavor or apple flavor Oh exactly right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna add about maybe a cup of that into our cup with ice I mean just pour down the bottom if you can it smells like it smells like Christmas right all right it smells like Christmas oh you just want to swim in the riots pool then to this we're gonna add a little bit of lemon juice and the lemon juice is really nice so it adds this really acidic component but also balances out all that sweetness so we're gonna add some lemon juice all right and then of course the sparkling components so we're gonna do the regular apple cider and we just throw that in there like that give it all look we pull those centers - all right you guys I love it thank you so much remember Martinelli's non-alcoholic sparkling cider is made from 100% US grown fresh apples and it's the celebration cider you can find martinelli products in the juice aisle at the grocery store and for more information go online to Martinelli's dot-com", "g5zTU-NO7ZA": "at Blake's we farm over 40 varieties of apples from over 40,000 apple trees from August through October our apples are individually hand-picked and placed into apple crates by variety one full Apple crate is roughly 20 bushels 2,500 apples or 300 apple pies but today we're not picking or cooking today we're pressing cider from the tree to the crate to the sorting table the apples journey takes it to the point where we pick which ones are worthy of our apple cider blends every batch uses five varieties chosen by Pete and Paul Blake any apple that doesn't look happy on the sort and conveyor is pulled from the mix only the finest fruits pass through this checkpoint and onto the washing and sanitizing tunnel where they get their final cleaning up the conveyor and into the mill they go crushed apples are then pushed through a tube and spread onto a rack and cloth style pressing table where a hydraulic system squeezes the apple mash creating fresh unfiltered apple cider the juice is chilled pasteurized and pumped into the bottle or where it finds a home and a half gallon or gallon sized jug it kept refrigerated until it winds up in the hands of our customers now it takes about 30 apples to make one gallon of cider it takes a lot of gallons to keep our customers happy [Music] you", "oI4Od1JT2Ic": "[Music] okay so right now I'm gonna make some apple pie moonshine apple pie in a jar whatever you guys want to call it everybody calls it something different it's not actual moonshine because it's not distilled but it's a good holiday drink that you can gift I'm making it so that I can put it in the pantry because it does stay for a long time and then can give it away for gifts or drink it up all right here we go guys okay so here's what you're gonna need for my recipe brown sugar white sugar cinnamon sticks this is actually some apple cider that a friend of mine gave us they squeezed it themself they went up to Washington and got a whole truckload of apples and they squeezed a whole bunch of it and gave me about ten jugs of this so I'm going to use that and then just regular old apple juice going to need about a gallon of that I'm using this clear spring grain alcohol it's 190 proof I'm also going to put this 360 vanilla vodka in it so all right let's start this cooking process all right so let's start and then next I'm gonna do two cups of white sugar white sugar [Applause] man down for the moment it's gonna be your cinnamon sticks in there no we just need to turn it on to medium you don't want it to boil but you do want it to come to like oh not too much of a simmer you want it to get warm enough to where all of the sugar dissolves some people do bring it to a boil but everybody has their different opinions on it I'm gonna for mine I'm gonna put it on medium just as it starts to simmer I'm gonna go ahead and shut it off and then I will let it sit till it becomes room temperature and here's what it looks like just getting it on and going as soon as it comes to a simmer I will shut it off and then let it come to room temperature before I put the alcohol in so I'll be right back and one more thing that I think I'm gonna go ahead and add I was kind of on the fence with it but out the pumpkin pie spice I'm gonna put a pinch of that in there this is totally optional if you want to add it to yours or not you guys were still going I actually put my candy thermometer in there I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to let it get to around 200 degrees Fahrenheit and then I'll shut it off I don't want it to boil but I do want it to at least get warm enough to where all of the sugar dissolves so I will get back to you as soon as it gets to 200 degrees 190 degrees I'm going to shut off my stew I'm pretty happy with the way this is looking now we just got to let it get your room temperature and then we can put our alcohol in so you just main thing is to make sure all your sugars that's all you don't want it to come to a boil but a lot of people put it on medium for about 20 minutes I didn't really count I just put my thermometer in there I let it get up to about 190 and just like a slow you know climb and everything is nice and dissolved so we're we're good to go so I will come back soon as this is at temperature and we're ready to add the booze so the next step I'm gonna strain this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put it [Music] alcohol to it so that's what I'm doing now so now I'm going to add a whole bottle of this 190-proof green alcohol and this one's a 360 brand but it's a vanilla vodka it's got the Madagascar vanilla in it okay so I am going to I got a bunch of these jars when I went to the store today this is the jars that I'm gonna put them in jail the jars it Mountain right there leave the head space wiper off lid on and there you have it I will probably put labels on these tomorrow you can put a little decorative ribbon or something on it if you want if you're going to be giving it away as a gift but there's my apple pie surprise in a jar hope you guys enjoyed my video please give me a thumbs up and share the video if you liked it [Music]", "BgZLatVJN_o": "[Music] given that we are starting on a sparkling apple concoction here that should lead you to think are we making apple pie moonshine natasha yes we are okay sorry starting with caramel sauce in the glass so we already made a bit of our own there yeah but you can just use any sort of caramel topping that kind of stuff [Music] yep [Music] yep well done with those nails it's a bit of a challenge pour that over the top oh in a circular motion yes loosens up the ice grab a slice of red or green apple and coat that in some cinnamon sugar oh that looks tasty you're right going right to the top you don't need to touch it so this is going to be you're going to like push the envelope for your buck so here drowning that sucker in the cinnamon sugar yeah yeah why not yeah good work [Music] wow an apple pie moonshine just like grandma used to make", "4Wi9GIm4JLc": "apple pie moonshine intro [Music] well I guess we'll come back to wolf monsters today I will be making apple pie moonshine use this pretty much for all of my Christmas gifts around the neighborhood and into a lot of the family events so what we're going to be doing is I'm going to show you how to make the apple pie moonshine and then one of the big things I've noticed people really like is they like these bottles so I get these bottles from Trader Joe's and it's a ginger brew that I use pretty much all year and I like to stock them up in the shed so give them a real good clean and then peel off your label which to do that I just put over hot water for about dumb soap for an hour and then that usually peels right off so the next part of this video you're gonna see how we make the apple pie moonshine one big thing is just be careful if you do share this with family and friends it does have Everclear in it and it is pretty potent so you could get in a little bit of trouble if you're not careful especially watch out for Grandma um oh yeah and in this next part here's everything you're gonna need [Music] so yeah enjoy this recipe here's the how-to oh and just a little real quick heads up thanks for all the new subscribers from just the last two weeks it's actually doubled which just giving this the world really appreciate everybody's support and yeah check out the little watermark over somewhere here I think hit that button you can actually hit subscribe figured out how to do that last week winning yeah so enjoy this video thanks for everybody support and Merry Christmas [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay once you add all your ingredients to the pot all your sugar your cinnamon sticks aunt white sugar you want to make sure you stir everything off the bottle and all you're trying to do here is bring this whole pot to about a boil and then one reduce to a simmer for about 40 minutes and then we're gonna let that cool and once it's cold we'll go ahead and add our alcohol after that [Music] so now everything has cooked for about 40 minutes so we're gonna let this cool just give it a quick spin and once we have it down to about room temperature you don't have all that steam out we're gonna go ahead and add our grain alcohol to it so the reason this is called apple pie moonshine is because we are using a grain alcohol this is not one of the things where it's out of a still from Kentucky or something like that so that's why people actually call it apple pie moonshine because you're using a grain alcohol so ya won't be right back as soon as this cools down we'll hide our alcohol but in our bottle [Music] Christmastime intro intro [Music] [Applause]", "l_pmNzGXQ9Y": "[Music] hi everyone it's a girl Sasha and I'm back with

making apple pie so stay tuned to the end of the video now let's get into it here I'm having some of the preparation done showing to you some of the ingredients that are reusing we'll be needing one egg a tablespoon of baking powder also a tablespoon of cinnamon powder which I already have a cup of sugar our apples ready this is all-purpose for vanilla extract to bring the flavor in in this dough some apple cider vinegar tear I measure you know the flower will be meaning 2 cups of flour next we'll be adding some baking soda also some cinnamon powder remember to tell a friend to tell a friend to tell another friend and stay tuned to my channel for what is coming next here I'm just taking the cold button from the fridge we're going to add some butter here I'll be cutting up the butter to make it easier to combined with the flour you here I'll be adding the butter to the flour you can also leave in the comment what you would like to see me prepare next here I'm going to add some ice water we're going to start to mix all these ingredients to form our dough we want to combine the butter with the flour just for our dough to get cripsy you hey we want to ensure that the combination is done properly so we have to get our hands in there and combine all ingredients together our dough doesn't have to be perfect we're not looking for a perfect dough right here you we'll know rap our dough and place it in the refrigerator for it to set somewhere you all our dough is set aside in a refrigerator we're now going to start and working on our ingredients our main ingredient of our pie which is the apple or Jamaican up Yemeni soda juicy or a Jamaican the apples can be diced to whatever size you prefer it doesn't really matter as I know while it is being baked to a shrink you now I'm gonna go ahead and add some sugar we'll be needing a cup of sugar we're going to add this to our apples you here I'm basically adding some floor just to get the juice from the Apple as I don't want the pie to be wet on the inside after all the ingredients are added to our dish of apples we're going to know fold in all the ingredients not going to mix what we're going to fold in just to get everything in blended in with our apples go ahead right no one give this video a thumbs up next we'll be adding some apple cider vinegar you that's all right there I think I'm finished now I am I play still playing with it all right so we're going back for our dough from the fridge after that we're going to flour the area where we'll be flattening over dough remember our dough doesn't have to be perfect we're going to roll our dough to the size of our baking tin remember we'll need a bottom piece and also a top piece after all this is done work no going to grease our baking tin they will place the bottom of our dough in our baking tin and we'll get ready now for our main ingredient which is our apple we're going to add it on top of that dough that was placed at the bottom of the Tina now we're just going to spread it out evenly after spreading the sauce evenly we want to ensure that we gather each side of our dough over the baking tin of course before we add our top piece of the other dough after covering the ingredients with the top dough we're not going to use some egg wash to put on the top of the dough and also to bore holes to make some air vents for the air to pass through while baking with our oven being already heated will placed inside and bake this for approximately one hour oh wow look at that my finished pie apple pie Sasha's kitchen creative ways go ahead guys hit that subscribe button like and stay tuned for more interested ways of developing more products you [Music] favorite ice cream [Music]", "jDf_Rc0krzY": "hey youtubers is your buddy Platt and today I'm gonna show you how to make a pumpkin spice hard cider so let's go well past Halloween and Thanksgiving zones here the holidays are around the corner and of course in the brewing world that means pumpkin pumpkin pumpkin pumpkin ales pumpkin Porter's pumpkin you name it I thought this time instead of doing some kind of pumpkin beer I thought we might do something a little different and making pumpkin spice hard cider really should do all we'd have is basically two ingredients a gallon of cider and some pumpkin pie mix we bought the store and I just want to show you this little recipe that if you brewed up now to be ready for the holidays so this cider is pretty simple like so just two ingredients and one quick little step as with all our little project first thing you want to do is sanitize I've got sanitizer in my fermenter and we're fermented or sanitizing the airlock so after we take care of the sanitization we get first a gallon of apple cider now if you're somewhere near an orchard or a place where you can get fresh unfiltered unpasteurized cider go for it here in Vegas I don't have much options on with my grocery store and just picked up a gallon of unfiltered cider and we're going to dump this inner pot all righty and we're not going to we're not going to boil this and cook this at all I'm just using this pot because then I'm gonna stir in our pumpkin pie mix now you might have seen on some blogs or some recipes out there especially in pumpkin brewing of beers pumpkin beers that they take either whole pumpkin or canned pumpkin and they cook it and then add it to the beer or the used canned pumpkin and then add additional spices cinnamon nutmeg vanilla what-have-you the reason I'm using this pumpkin pie filling is because it has all those in there has additional sugar in there it has the cinnamon nutmeg it has all those spices in there it's got everything I need in there so I don't have to add anything else and again the theme of this it's kind of keep it simple so I'm just going to then dump this in with our cider then once we get everything out you don't want to take a whisk and we're going to stir this all together make sure we incorporate all that pumpkin pie mix oh you'll definitely picked up the spices on the nose the pumpkin just smells like the holidays anyway we're just going to swirl that in to make sure we got everything integrated and now all I'm going to do is I'm going to take our sanitized Furman fermentation tank and I'm gonna fill this in there I'll be right back so after we got done combining our mixture I took our sanitized fermenter and I put our solution in now I remember we didn't cook it or heat in any way so is already room temperature so we didn't have to worry about cooling it down I put it in here now you'll probably notice you'll have a little over a gallon because remember we put the pumpkin spice in there so you could dump the rest out if you want to save it for something else or if you had a larger fermenter that's fine I forgot in the fermenter I had a third of a pack of red star champagne yeast if you've done ciders before you know a lot of people use champagne nice because it makes a nice dry crisp clean cider and so that's what I use you can also use a wine nice if you want to I do have I staying away from ale yeast because a yeast a lot of times add certain flavors to it some fruitiest or stuff like that and we're just wanting something nice and clean for this pumpkin spice hard cider so I threw this in there and we're going to let this ferment for about a week or so in the primary and probably one of the things you'll notice lot sediment on the bottom so after a week we're gonna rack off this and put into a secondary fermenter and we're allowed to sit in that secondary fermenter for another week and then after that we'll rack out of that and then we'll put it into another one of these one gallon carboys and we'll throw it in the fridge too cold crash it now I'll stop any further fermentation and also help clear our cider after that we'll be ready to bottle and then leave in the fridge he'll be right enjoy so here about two and a half three weeks we'll have our one gallon of pumpkin by hardside well I hope you liked this video if you did feel free to subscribe down below also share with your friends and if you have any questions comments

my kitchen well grab a whole that vine and swing out in my kitchen and let's get cookin good look at today because Thanksgiving is just wrong the cars and I know everybody's looking for their guests on Thanksgiving and this is what our safety I guess every Thanksgiving I wanna sit there and bring my recipe to you it is I'm so glad you swung into my kitchen today I wanted to sit there and share a little bit of holiday spirit with each and every one of yous but before we begin I want to say Happy Holidays y'all so we're gonna be making what I have been known for so many years of handing out at the holiday time and it is my version of the apple pie moonshine so we're gonna be needing one gallon of 100 cent apple cider now before you go and put your apple cider in I want you to sit there and shake it all up before you add it to a big ol stainless steel pot that I have off to the side so I'm gonna go ahead shake this all up let's go ahead and add all the apple cider for [Music] you're gonna be needing one quart of apple juice and also please make sure it's 100% so I'm going to go ahead and add some apple juice now some of my friends they'll go ahead and add a whole gallon of apple juice that is totally up to you if you want to do that go ahead but I only add a quart no I'm gonna sit there and we're gonna put three cups of brown sugar in here now I don't have any of the brown sugar on hand now if this happens to you don't fret we still can make brown sugar all you need is some molasses now I have four cups of sugar here even though we need three cups of brown sugar but the recipe also calls for one cup of white sugar so I already went ahead and just added the extra cup of white sugar to this now I'm gonna go ahead and dump all the four cups of sugar that we would be needing for our apple pie moonshine and now I would be adding about three tablespoons of the molasses so I couldn't so let's go ahead and add our molasses and that's about three tablespoons I'm gonna go and get a plastic spatula and we'll be right back all right I have my plastic spatula and now I'm just gonna give this a quick stir before I take this all over to the stove and we're gonna heat it up until all the sugar melts and then we're gonna allow it all to come back down to room temperature okay I have it over here at the stove and we're just gonna sit there and bring it up to like a medium heat or until all the sugar dissolves all right I brought this back over here and now we're gonna allow this to cool back down to room temperature and then we're gonna be adding the alcohol but now I want to sit there and tell you this apple pie moonshine it ages really well now if you have the patience to allow this to sit Furcal know a little bit on the pantry shelf I'm telling you the sugars blend out and the alcohol taste is almost undetectable trust me and I just want to sit there and say you've been warned now if you've aged this like I do because you know what I call this like aunt Thanksgiving time for the cook this is the cooks portion or the cooks ration yeah but bring this down to room temperature and I'll show you what we do next all right now all of our cider and our apple juice and along with the sugar and the brown sugar that has all cooled down to room temperature please please please please make sure that you have cooled it down completely because if it's hot you're gonna just burn off any of the alcohol that you're putting in and that's just defeating a lot of our purpose so folks please make sure that you bring this down to room temperature okay with that being said we're gonna take a whole bottle of the Everclear and we're gonna add that to the apple cider and to the apple juice mixture with the sugar all in there so I'm gonna crack this bottle open and we're gonna add the whole I cannot begin to tell you folks how good this apple pie moonshine is I mean it sneaks up on you I mean it's really good it tastes like candy and every time I say that it reminds me of that one episode of I Love Lucy where she's doing there I think it was a bita atom it mix or something like that and still sit there saying it's so tasty too and she gets men up like a lightbulb at the end of the episode I mean it's funny that's this stuff well anyways enough with my chitchat now you could add one or two cups of spiced rum now I use two cups two cups are better so what the hell you know what this last little bit is not worth saving in my opinion on my shelf so you know what we're just gonna add that last a little bit and now I'm gonna sit there and grab my plastic spatula and we're gonna give this all a good stir now I plan on using this for my Thanksgiving dinner so I'm not gonna sit there and bottle this up this is gonna be served to all our guests they come for Thanksgiving and there's no need for me to bottle it up because I'm gonna put it in one of them to care and beverage dispensers that way everybody can just go up and serve themselves so I'm just gonna sit there and put it back in the container until Thanksgiving Day and I'm ready to put it in my two aunts or my two gallon beverage dispenser so I'm just gonna ladle it all back in the jugs at the juice and all that came from so but if you were to give these as gifts I would be labeling them into the size I have here is the 1 quart jars and I would give them all as a gift like that or in my redneck China which is gonna be a future video I've been known to sit there and make the glasses and give you the glass with the apple pie moonshine in it you know for my chit chat again and I'm gonna keep labeling this all in my jugs so as you see I have it all bottled up here is another way that you could sit there and bottle it up I would just sit there imprint up some cute little labels and smack over the original labels if you don't want to sit there try to get them off of the jar it's real easy to do in like paint program now if you liked what you saw here today

to make and it's delicious so if you want to learn how to make this then just keep on watching the ingredients you're going to need for this apple pie are three apples mines RF Alice twist apples one egg three tablespoons of lemon juice one-third cups of brown and regular sugar 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon one third cup of flour a generous dash of nutmeg two tablespoons of butter for porcelain bowls I got mines at bed bath and beyond we'll also need to empty bowls as well as two boxes of pie crust and then that is all you're going to need for this apple pie recipe the first thing I'm going to do is actually just wash my apples making sure that they are nice and clean then with my peeler I'm just going to peel away the skin from all three apps you after i'm done with that i'm going to select my apples with my apple slicer here and then chop them up into smaller pieces so that they can fit much nicer inside of my bowl now that I'm done chopping on my Apple someone will just leave those on the side and next what I'm doing is just mixing all of my dry ingredients inside of one of the bigger bowls and mix it all together so that it's all consistent and mixed very well going back to my apples I'm going to grab those two tablespoons of softened butter I did leave it out till it's nice and soft now I'm going to add the lemon juice as well as my egg mix it all in and mix the dry ingredients right on top now that my apple filling is then I'm just going to move that guy on the side and now we are going to play with our pie crust going to wipe away my countertop to make sure it is clean and i'm just going to dirty it again with some flour I know that makes no sense but i rather just make sure there's nothing gross on it so i'm just going to add this flower right on top and then i'm going to roll out my pie dough and start making the pie crust so the way that i made the pie crust was just grabbed my porcelain bowl make a circle in too deep i cross and without circle i press it inside the bowl and any excess dough that was left around I kind of just build it up on the side and now I'm just going to continue this step with the rest of the bowls now that i'm done with the inner part of the type rest i'm going to grab my apple pie filling and just stock all these bowls up before I stop the top layer of my apple pie for us I'm going to just put my oven to 400 degrees next with a fresh layer of apple pie dough I'm just going to make these straight lines so that I can put those right on top of my apple pie and now i'm just going to layer these right on top with a classic apple pie you you now that my oven is ready i'm just going to pop these in don't mind my dinner I was also cooking while I was filming this video now we are going to move on to the apple cider drink what you're going to need is apple cider caramel syrup some ground cinnamon and some whip cream once you are done cooking your apple cider you are going to just pour it into a mug mines is this cute little fox one that I have but it reminds me so much of fall so I'm just going to pour in my apple cider then I'm just going to grab very little bit of caramel I use like the cap as a measuring and then I'm just going to stir it in afterwards I'm just going to add my whipped cream and some ground cinnamon on top and voila that is it and it's delicious my apple pies are now finished and this

and get started with our peanut butter cup latte first I'm going to add my coffee beans to the grinder grind grind grind I want a fine grind for my Vietnamese coffee filter since Halloween is during the fall and there's candies galore this is an ode to my favorite candy the peanut butter cup now in a mug I'm going to add one teaspoon of sugar about two teaspoons of peanut butter 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder put my coffee filter on top I'll adding about 2 tablespoons of ground coffee I'll even it out and then I'll tamp it down and pour some hot water in there I'll let the coffee percolate once it's done I'm going to give my peanut butter and cocoa mixture a good stir since peanut butter can be a little bit difficult to dissolve make sure the water is piping hot or you can nuke it for about 30 seconds to move it along then when it's dissolved I'm going to pour in my steaming hot milk making sure to stir to combine everything now to top it I'm going to add some whipped cream hmm a drizzle of chocolate sauce and to make sure everybody knows that it's a peanut butter cup latte I'm gonna add some mini peanut butter cups tada and here we have our peanut butter cup latte dessert in a cup I totally get that peanut butter flavor in there and with the whipped cream and chocolate sauce on top this is literally a peanut butter cup in a cup alright so moving on to our next one I thought I would make a caramel apple spice latte there's always caramel spiced cider but I decided to spike it up with some coffee and milk and it totally works in my medium saucepan I'm going to add in one cup of apple juice three tablespoons of brown sugar and a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon I'll stir everything up let it come to a boil and I'll just boil it down for about ten minutes until it becomes a nice thick syrup here's how you can tell when it's ready I'll just take my finger and draw a line down on my spatula if the liquid doesn't come back together then it's ready the reason why I'm making this syrup first instead of mixing apple juice with the milk is because when I tested it it actually curdled the milk I think it's because it's too acidic or something so making this syrup nice and thick will hold up to the coffee and the milk when you mix it all together I'll pour it into a jar and I'll save what I don't use for the rest of the week I thought if I'm going to go through the trouble of making the syrup I might as well make enough to last me through the week now in a mug I'm going to add in about a tablespoon of my apple syrup then I'll put on my Vietnamese coffee filter add 2 tablespoons of ground coffee tamp it down and pour in some hot water drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip done here I have a cup of steaming hot milk and I'll use my arrow latte to make some foam perfect I'll pour my milk into the mug holding the foam back and once it reaches the top I'll just scoop in my foam gorgeous now I'll draw in some zigzags with my caramel sauce and here we have my caramel apple spice cider latte so good that was so good I love the caramel drizzle on top it's just so flavorful and then paired with the spiced apple syrup you can really taste the fruitiness of the apples here you guys have to try this one it's really unique moving on to our last one which is the cranberry white chocolate mocha in my medium saucepan I'm going to add in one cup of whole frozen cranberries cranberries are really popular in the fall especially during Thanksgiving and this drink will take you right on into the holidays too 1/4 cup of sugar and 3/4 of a cup of water I'll stir it up then bring it to a boil for about 5 to 10 minutes until it becomes a nice and big syrup when it starts to boil I'm going to mash it down so we get all that rich cranberry flavor and color once my cranberry sauce is ready I'm just going to mash it through my strainer and here we have this bright red beautiful cranberry syrup I'm mashing this through my strainer because I want to get rid of the skin and the seeds from the cranberries all right to finish it up in my mug I'm going to add in one tablespoon of chopped up white chocolate make sure to chop up the white chocolate finely so that it can melt evenly in the hot milk and coffee then I'll drizzle in a little bit of my cranberry syrup and finally I'll make my coffee in the filter same process ground coffee hot water and let it drip drip drip drip drip drip and once it's done I'll remove the filter and give it a stir until the white chocolates dissolved if it's not fully dissolved the steaming hot milk will help everything come together like this whoa and then to top it all off I'm going to add some whipped cream white chocolate shavings and a swirl of my cranberry syrup so beautiful let's give it a try the tartness from the cranberries especially the syrup on top really really sets the smoked up heart and I love white chocolate too this drink actually reminds me of the cranberry bliss bars at Starbucks so good I hope you guys like my three new fall latte recipes I love coming up with new flavors and seeing what works and these definitely work comment below and let me know which one you would try first and also don't forget to check out my three other fall latte video thank you so much for watching and I will see you guys next time bye", "M1wEhqyoNuE": "one down with apple cider one

then just to top it off to make it very festive for the holidays I'm gonna add some diced apples to it and it's ready to go enjoy you", "B-69TS8OTvk": "kirby antoinette here i'm here with hugs and today we are making hubs's famous apple pie moonshine yep we're going to do it step by step journey calm down we're going to do it step by step so you guys know how to make it at home so okay let's get started okay so let's talk about these ingredients that you need where's the regular sugar you're only gonna need one cup per batch next is uh apple juice just regular apple juice you don't need that organic crap uh this is my favorite part is getting pure good apple cider actually go to the orchard to get it because it just makes the experience even better uh next captain morgan we're gonna be using the whole bottle gives a little bit more of a spice to it you'll notice that there's more spices to it i got the cinnamon ground cinnamon but you're not going to use the whole thing you're just going to use a batch of that also dark brown sugar just a cup and then the hard hard booze you got schmearnoff i just put it in there to make it even a little bit more potent and then what makes moonshine is the green alcohol and i got everclear which actually was pretty easy to find i thought it'd be harder because the quarantine everyone make it hand sanitizer but i was wrong so yeah first step you're gonna pour this all into the pot i used to have a big giant pot that i made this every year with but apparently we threw that out when we got married so this is gonna do it but hopefully it'll fit up fit everything you want to come over here get over touch it sure babe now can people make this with apple cider that they buy at the grocery store too you can but i like going old school and actually getting the pure apple cider during the season and make it during the fall because the taste is just better okay and i believe that this is a 16 16 quart stock pot for those who might be wondering how large this is i don't know it's not our wedding registry added i know what it is okay then next i'm going to put the whole bottle amaz apple juice okay all right next you're gonna do the sugar don't worry this drink doesn't cause anybody to get diabetic even though there's a lot of sugar like i said you don't have to be precise so i'm going to put this in and that's the white regulator next the brown sugar just gets kind of mushy should be pretty easy actually well it actually worked out as quickly easier than i thought and then put it in the bowl and that's it for this part now you just stir it up break it up it's probably in clumps i saw the brown sugar was [Music] and it's that easy for the first section of the recipe next you're going to simmer it for an hour this is the key part of making the moonshine because basically what happens is simmering makes the juices the apple cider all the sugars combine together and gets mixed in do this for an hour cupboard of course keep an eye on it make sure it doesn't overflow or anything and you do that for an hour and then i'll explain after that watch i'll just explain now after it's done simmering you have to let it go all the way down to room temperature because if you put this alcohol in there it's going to evaporate some of the alcohol it'll still be strong but if you want to do it right wait until it's room temperature and then we'll pour all the alcohol in but we'll do that in an hour after it's all done so when it was done after the hour we turned it off and then we let it just sit so that it could cool down and now we're the part where this is cooled down so babe what do we do next so basically as you can see it's at room temperature because like i said when it's hot all this can evaporate but now it is nice and cool so now i'm gonna let internet do all the fun stuff which is pour all the booze in so it's funny it's funny she's showing two bottles actually we're gonna pour all three bottles okay so do the everclear first okay how much you're important the whole thing the whole bottle all right hey so this is like kind of a dumb question but is everclear a brand or just the top quality grain alcohol okay you can use any grain alcohol but i chose number clear and like i said earlier you can actually find it pretty easy now since uh quarantine's pretty much almost over and people are making a hand sanitizer like crazy okay so uh go with the captain morgan captain and this is a 750 yeah i just grabbed the plastic bottles because they're easy to throw away okay uh guess what we still got more booze all right schmoon off baby let's do that this one i just added myself because i like it more potent wow so this is the bootleg part of it no there's a hubs edition part of it pubs edition i love it and we got all this alcohol from vinnie's right yep okay i used to work there so that's why we're choosing goodies but you can go buy it anywhere okay all right so what do we do next get the spoon the spatula spatula just mix it up all right can you smell the alcohol holy now yes so it's like a smelling high all right all right let's uh time to pour so we're using mason jar and that is what you're going to put a moonshine our apple pie moonshine okay let's do this so hubs i got a question yes um i've heard that like moonshine and sports have something in common they do so nascar which is in the south of course moonshine is where that originated so basically nascar was invented by moonshiners and moonshiners who basically during prohibition would make moonshine behind you know just in houses and stuff and they would race the cops on the highway past state lines so they could sell the moonshine in other states so if you go down in the south and you know some people who are moonshiners that means they can drive a car really fast i almost forgot cinnamon little dash in each cup little tab squeeze oh that's that's definitely more than a dash so whatever don't be mad at me for pointing it out yeah some people use cinnamon sticks i know we did that once but that's just a pain because then you gotta eventually take it out because they don't disintegrate all of it got it [Music] there you go now that this is ready how do we store this for 30 days you can store it anywhere you can store it on your counter you can store it in the fridge you can store it in the pantry for 30 days then after that i suggest you chill it for a couple days before you drink it because the best way to drink it is chill not on ice because that dilutes it just chilled okay and so that is kirby antoinette and hubbs is famous apple pie moonshine so if you really like this video we would love for you to subscribe to our channel and make sure that you like and comment this

2015 there out of New York it was like Williamson yeah Williams in New York so that's like I believe it's like if I remember correctly its East Rochester west of Syracuse yep yeah oh cool yeah like Lake Ontario area else we were like only again I haven't lived in that area for a while so I don't remember all the outskirts areas yeah 100% New York State apples gluten-free contains sulfites on the side here as American as apple pie is what we are replicating with this cider we're using a blend of American heirloom apples and apple pie spices to create a semi sweet cider using the best apples of fall harvest cheers to Americana embarked craft ciderworks hand crafts hard cider using apples grown on site at Wagner farms a family farm since 1909 because we are farmers first and foremost we focus on the quality of the apples we grow and the unique attributes of each variety to correct ciders with distinct flavor profiles within a range from dry to sweets our Tap Room on location in Williamson New York offers samples of our craft ciders as well as bottles sales drink New York X so this one is right between semi dry and semi sweet on the Richter scale on the back here notice 5.2 percent alcohol yeah let's give this one the pop open price point I have no idea my sister got it for me it was a four pack so I'm gonna guess somewhere like I don't know pry like ten buck new ten twelve books I don't think she would spend a whole lot more than that for a four pack of cider but I could be wrong but uh yeah looks pretty sweet oh it could be logo the artwork but yeah let's give it a pop open church yeah it's not really dry it's actually very sweet I guess it's not sweet it's yeah it kind of is like it's almost like the Richter scale it's it has that dry aspect to it but else has a sweet ass so he's way in the middle there like clearly that's pretty awesome but uh you're getting a lot of apple pie kind of spice taste to it is super tasty now really getting any kind of alcohol like lingering taste afterwards so this is dangerous I feel like you know oh great the end there you really get a nice like traditional apple pie flavoring right in there that's good Wow has super tasting I don't know if that caught on camera so it's spit up from the can yeah super tasty if you guys need your hands on these I would definitely recommend this this is if you love apple pie and you like hard cider this is a dangerous combination I feel like I said super tasty I give this a solid four and a half out of five and I love ciders so that's that's saying something for me at least again I apologize on price point I have no idea because that was good so um yeah if you guys are driving one let me know down the comments down below I'm not sure how far you'll be able to get it away from like I said the Rochester Syracuse area but um if you are somewhere crazy far away from then you found it leave a comment down below let people know where to find this I'm sure you can go to their website I don't see anything on here pi websites but I'm sure they'll have like a beer finder on there if you really want to find it um yeah so yeah leave some comments down below and I'll check back to you guys in the next video see ya and in just in case you want a color profile earlier had a glass a little pretty light-colored had actually from the for the taste of it I was expecting like a more darker color almost like actual cider coloured just from the flavor like I said it was was interesting um very I guess it's super tasting but uh yeah give a little try out of the glass as well still super tasty I'm sure someone's gonna comment down below that I'm using the wrong glass but I'm not pouring the whole thing in there so I'm sorry yeah I'll check my videos later see",

everybody Robert Jones back in the kitchen with the big cinnamon stick and some apples it's apple cider season you can tell we got the big jar last year we did some wine and this year I thought it'd be fun to do some cider for you guys it's fall season the weather has finally cooled down here I'm so excited and about a bunch of apple juice because they don't exactly have apples around here but I got some apples I got some cinnamon stick let's make some cider so it's gonna be a really easy process actually it only takes a couple ingredients as mother nature does most of it for us this could be apple cider it's going to be some sugar and it's going to be a bunch of yeast and then it's going to be a little bit of waiting a couple weeks and then we are going to have cider it's going to be so exciting all right you guys let's get started okay guys I'm just a little introduction on this because cider making can be kind of a long process but I'm going to really make it simple for you guys today we are using Trader Joe's Honey Crisp apple cider we are also using some Kirkland apple juice there's much more than this I just put this out so you guys could see the small bottles here we are also using some white labs English cider yeast this is the wlp 775 I also these apples are just for decoration just for decoration and we're going to be using some cinnamon we're going to use me a cinnamon stick we're going to chop a piece of this off and throw it in the big jug back here just to give it some cinnamon a flavor and this is some sanitizer this is a funnel we have a bubbler that goes on top of the big thing this I'm using to break apart the cinnamon and this is a measuring cup because I forgot to put it over here we're gonna be using some sugar this is organic unbleached sugar if he is brown sugar you can use white sugar you can use whatever you want this is what I have on hand a bit of my normal sugar so okay so these are the ingredients and as you guys may or may not know sanitation is a big thing when you're doing brewing because you want to introduce the yeast that you want but you don't want other microbes and stuff like that this is sanitizer as it's all sandy clean it's a low foam acid rinse for brewing at other applications and so what we're going to do is we're gonna put some hot water in the sink we're going to put in squeeze of this and then we're going to sanitize the tools we're going to be used today and also over a big jug that we're going to be using it's kind of nasty looking also going to be sanitizing our big jug so that it's ready to go alright so I'm just going to rinse the stuff through here real quick and then we'll start the actual process then for the big jug I usually put it in here then we can use the funnel on the cup put the hot water into there you go you can see now you can see I'm just putting the hot water into the container so we'll just give this a sandy sandy rinse since we don't one in microbes now I made sure that last time we use the brewing container for the beer that we we scrubbed it out really really well so the only thing that could be in here is a little bit of dust I might be a little bit because it opens on grating so let's give it a good a good swish amazing man whoa a big manly swish alright then I'm gonna give this a rinse okay and then we got our big cinnamon over here yes see the big cinnamon I'm just going to whack this thing a couple times just because we want some pieces that we can put in the bottle some nice shockers and I'm actually going to rinse these in the sanitizer just because I don't know what kind of funkiness is actually on this it's not going to change the taste of the cinnamon so I'm going to rinse this real quick and then we'll start the brewing all right let me reposition everything and we'll start some brewing after doing my research I found out that the recipe I'm going to be trying to use here after reading a bunch of different stuff is we're going to be using about a half a cup of sugar to one gallon of juice so we have juice and it's going in here and it's going to be a 50/50 ratio of the apple juice from concentrate not from concentrate here and also the 100% Honey Crisp apple cider unfiltered so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to check with a hot drama - how much sugar is in this and so since I know this is going to be a 50/50 blend I'm just going to do a 50/50 mix in the in the little test or tube here okay so we have our testing tube here and we have our hydrometer if you guys going to be doing any brewing spend the money get a hydrometer I think there were like under 20 bucks and what it's going to tell us is this is going to tell its how much sugar is in here which will also tell us how much we can expect volume of alcohol to be so I'm going to set this in something so if it overflows it doesn't make a mouse okay so we're just going to cetera hydrometer in and then it's going to tell us where we're at here okay currently depending which system you're using we are at a 1.05 or if you are using bricks we are at how many bricks are we at here we are about I'd say 12 and a half bricks or it also tells us what the percent alcohol yield will be and right now where we are about a six to seven percent alcohol yield and we're shooting for eight just because we're a sassy that way so we're going to add the sugar to this and then we're gonna do another hydrometer test and we'll see where that is so let's put all the sugar into the or let's put all the juice into the jug and then I'm probably going to put the sugar in one of the apple juice containers and shake it until it's mixed up and then we'll put that in there and then we'll give it a measure all right let's do that all right here's our big jug here is our funnel okay guys so we got all the juice in there and now with my calculation I'm going to use I'm using a total of four and a half gallons of juice here because I don't want to quite fill this thing up because it's a five gallon but if we put all that in here we'd be up to the tippy-top so we're going to do four and a half gallons of juice which means we're going to need two and a quarter cups of sugar so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put the sugar in with the last bit of juice and then I'm going to shake it to dissolve the sugar these are half cuff measures if you guys are wondering I will shake the juice and then I can just put it in here and I don't have to try to mix this giant this giant thing too much all right so it's two three four that's two cups and a half of one of these there we go okay so for my recipe that is four and a half gallons of juice two and a quarter cups of sugar and I'm using an organic white sugar it's kind of off-color because it's not bleached that's the only reason it's a little bit Brown all righty okay so we got the sugar in here can you guys see the sugar in the bottom right here this is sugar all right let's give this a good shake okay you guys women shaking for about five minutes here and it looks like most of the sugar has dissolved in so that's good you guys can do it this way or whatever way you want and adding sugar is totally optional you don't have to okay you guys now we're going to give this a big stir if we can here lovely assistant come hold the hydrometer for me ah Thank You lovely assistant okay we have got we have got floating action this is good we got our sugar mixed in and we are up to 0.06 which is going to give us about an 8 percent yield on alcohol that's our goal here anyway so 0.06 8% 8% alcohol that's what we're looking for it's gonna be fun okay guys let's put this back in here and get some yeast action going okay next you guys we're going to pitch our yeast again we are using the English cider yeast wlp 775 by white labs pure liquid wine yeast now this is one specifically for cider cider English cider but you can use other things if you want just do your research so we're going to make sure that this is mixed up now I'm a little concerned because we bought this back in April we did the beer video if you guys can see the date is May 28 it says Best Buy but I am pretty sure that the yeast is still alive and we're going to go for it we've got it up to room temperature our juice is at room temperature and room temperature for us right now is about 75 degrees so I'm pretty confident that this is going to be fine so well it's already foaming and got action going on so whoo all right let's do it over there yes it's still alive I guess being out of the fridge long enough it's just it's already grown that's a good thing okay I think we've calmed down here all right let's pit Oh smells so good you guys smells like fresh baked bread all right we're pitching our yeast our yeast is in it looks good all right we'll get the outside yeast off as you can see that side uses off so the other yeast is in there looks good and remember we had our cinnamon cinnamon sticks so I'm not quite sure how much those to put in here so I'm gonna guess like this plus a little bit more and I'm just trying to bake it so it's small enough to get it in the in the mouth here put a couple pieces of you send them um I don't want to blow it away so probably in total about one ounce one to two ounces of cinnamon bark maybe you just a tiny bit more all right I think we're good to go because I don't want it to be like blow your socks off cinnamon I just wanted to have a little bit of taste okay so let's give this a little little stir try to try to wash the yeast out of the neck all right guys can you guys see this thing it is a big jug of cider and it smells amazing it smells like apple juice it smells like cinnamon and it smells like yeast so let's get the bubbler top on this thing okay you guys very is the bubbler it's really easy you have this little tube and you put water in here so I'm just going to put some water in here you fill it up to the line that's really easy you put the cap on in the cap as I drop it the cap has holes and then there's another little piece you just drop on over the top and what it does is it prevents air from going back into your container so air can come out it can bubble out and then it stays in there all right so you just put the cap on like that then you take the cork believe it or not this giant bottle has a tiny little neck for this court so you just put the cork in here and then you just wedge the bubbler in like that voila just enough to keep the air from going in but the air can still come out okay we're going to put this in a spare bathroom what we have and we're going to put a time-lapse on it so you guys are I guess you can see me down here we're going to put it in the spare bathroom which is going to keep it at a nice temperature it's going to keep it at a nice home temperature between 70 and 74 degrees which will allow the yeast to grow and we're going to put a time-lapse on it so you guys can see the magic so check out the magic here and we'll see you in two hi everybody it's been about two weeks a little over two weeks since we've had our cider brewing and we've discovered that it's pretty cloudy and it's not settling out so doing some research I found out what winemakers use they use something called wine clarifier the mineral compounds called bentonite which apparently is a volcanic mud that hydrates in water so we have some hot water here and we have the bentonite and what you do is you put a couple teaspoons one or two depending on how cloudy it is ours is pretty cloudy so I'm thinking about one and a half to two per gallon of liquid so we have four gallons going right now so I'm going to try putting about six teaspoons in the hot water and we're going to put that into the cider once it dissolves so what you're supposed to do you're supposed to put this in the water and then give it a couple hours and then we'll pick it up from there all right doesn't smell like anything one six whoo look at that it thickens right up we may not have to let this sit and may be able to go right in so the idea here is that the mud has negative ions and they they cling to the positive ions of the particles inside the fermentation is really sticking to the spoon this stuff is so gluey okay now it smells like a mud wrap you guys see that super gooey alright I am gonna let this sit for a while because it's kind of a mess so let's see what happens in about an hour okay guys this has been sitting for a while and I decided to go with a whisk and mix this up it's kind of like mixing flour into water or cornstarch part of it just doesn't want to mix it's probably oversaturated but here's what it looks like it's kind of it's kind of thick mud okay so let's go into the room I'm not going to try to move the cider so let's take this in there and we'll put it in and we'll give it Little Mix okay guys we're in here where the fermentation is happening you can see it here just like on the other video but you can probably not see what is it's really cloudy so the yucky stuff you see on the top is yeast and then if you go down here you'll see that there's cinnamon stick and there's also some sedimentation going on that's the white stuff there but you can see for the most part it's still kind of cloudy so we want to try to clean this up so we're going to do is we're going to take the top off of here for the bit night in and then I'm going to use the pump stick because it's the only thing I have this long enough to put in here and they say to stir it vigorously so I was kind of concerned about the stuff at the bottom but they say that it'll all settle out pretty quickly so let's try this okay you guys Rin here it is pretty tight quarters so let's see what we can do so the first thing we have to do is we have to take off the bubbler then try to take out the cork it's pretty tight welcome too bad all right so now try to get out the cork there we go whoa smells like cider okay so we got our finding agent here it's gotten quite thick so I'm going to try to pour this carefully seems really strange to pour mud and you drink and like they said not all of it will dissolve and I was reading got most of it and now I've got our pumping tube here which is the only thing I have this long enough to give this a stir and feel the cinnamon sticks and goop at the bottom all right feels pretty mixed all right I'm going to put the bubbler back on and we will check this in about four days honestly I don't know I don't see any action happening it aren't you guys see in a couple days hi everybody I'm back it has been three weeks and we'll tell you about the whole saga what happened the last three weeks in just a second but basically here's what happened so we put the cider to ferment in the other room it's fermented for two weeks and it was very cloudy and you guys saw that in the last video so we did some processes with mud we put it in there and let me show you on the Steadicam here what we act alright here is the cider as you can see it's gotten a little bit darker but the best part is it's really much clearer you can almost see through it now and you can see that the mud settled all the way out there that brown thing is the cinnamon stick so you can see we've got the yeast at the top we've still got the bubbler which captured some bugs which is kind of funny but there sit all right now here comes the magic we have a bunch of whole bunch of recycled bottles here that we have cleaned and what we're going to do now is we're going to put them in a sanitizing bath and the same sizing bath looks brown because that's the color of the sanitizing it's like a black kind of [ __ ] we've got a whole whole system here so we got unsanitized area sanitized and then we've got a whole sanitized rack for the dishes everything's been cleaned and Clorox tanned such so now we're just going to put these through this rinse and that we've also got over here we've also got a whole bunch of other bottles but we'll get to that in a minute we could only got so much space so all right you guys let's get cleaning okay you guys so in this thing here we've got all the stuff that we think we are going to be needing so we've got some funnels we've got a chinois or a sieve which we're going to use to put coffee filters on to filter this we also have out there is hot water we've got the tube we've also got the let me call this hydrometer so we'll be doing that in a little bit we've got some measuring spoons because we going to be measuring sugar and we got a whole whole boatload man that is that's hot all right we want to do this bottle caps one after another very hot now and one ok so now we're going to just douse these coke bottles now we got these from the from some various places here in Santa Barbara we will not talk about going to talk about 5 coin we did clean them and took the labels off of most of them so they are pretty clean let's have a sprite bottle is making a lot of damage just get going now this is the no rinse cleaner so whatever cleaner you're using or sterilizing make sure you check it whether or not it needs to be rinsed or not ours is a no rinse non chlorine-based alright you guys I think that's it for our sterilization so we'll get this reconfigured umm for the next phase ok guys so we got everything cleaned here we got everything cleaned we've done what we can so now we're going to remove the air stopper and then we're going to take out the cork okay now we're going to be extra careful to not introduce new bacteria in here and such so we've got some hydrogen peroxide and a nice clean towel just to try to keep everything clean and shiny we're going to clean up the mouth of the jar here trying to keep as much bacteria as possible out it has been sitting in the other room so it's a little dusty and you never know what kind of funk is gonna do that way when we touch stuff and hopefully don't introduce any bacteria into that okay and then we'll get rid of this towel we'll just put in our dirty puddle we just keep making towels we are then going to take our siphon basically this goes in here yeah it has a little stopgap at the bottom and it's a it's like a pump so it goes in here this goes in here and then you use this and it pumps the liquid out of the tube so we're going to pump a little bit of liquid into our hydrometer - you guys remember this and then we're going to measure with this to see how much alcohol we have now after we after we decide what kind of alcohol level we have and we want to see what we're going to do we're going to put more sugar into the bottles which is then going to give it carbonation when it ferments for another week or two so the first thing we got to do is we got to get something we got to get some liquid out of here okay so we're going to carefully put this in here we don't want to drop it to the bottom we just want to put it into the liquid now we're gonna put that here and we'll do a little pump if you set your head drama door into a cup then you don't waste your product and we are about okay guys we got our math all straightened out so first of all we were noticing that look how nice and clear this is this is very exciting it's it's you know when you look through a big giant jug it looks pretty dark but this is this is pretty clear so we're kind of excited about that okay so we went back and looked at the old video and here's where we're at so our potential before and our number was for all you super geeks out there that want to know about the alcohol it is 1.06 was our potential which is an 8% potential for alcohol we are currently at one point zero zero six which is the 1% line so you subtract the two from each other and basically this is now seven percent alcohol duh duh we got there okay so we're gonna pour this in a glass and give it a little taste for this little snack all right no lean down here so you guess and see oh you know what that's a little sharp but it is already carbonated and it is quite delicious so I don't know if we're going to necessarily need to pub power it up or just get into bottles because it's already sparkling but that's really good it's a little tart for my taste but it does taste good yeah that's pretty good mmm you can feel the alcohol in your cheeks so what we have here is we have basically the three different size bottles that we have we have the 1 liter we have the 2/3 liter and we have the 1/3 liter which is the easiest way to measure this we did all the calculations for cider and for us it looks like just look online there's tons of cider calculators for how much sugar so this is the priming process so basically we want to add a little bit more sugar to this to let it ferment just a little bit more while it's capped and then it's going to release more co2 and that will be pushed into the liquid and that's how you get carbonation so we've determined that 1/4 teaspoon of sugar for a leader you know three quarters that are two thirds that for this and one-third that for this which is kind of funny because we have a couple different measuring spoons here so we've determined that a quarter teaspoon for the leader is a pinch this is a pinch - nib set I don't know what the actual measurements are but we've calculated this 1/3 of this so we'll get 2/3 in there and 1/3 in there so that's how we're going to do our priming so let's get to it so the way that I do this is we're just going to take a bottle I'm just going to show you one because you guys really don't need to see all of this we're just going to take a little tiny bit of sugar in a nice dry funnel and then we put it in there Boop and that's it and then for this one it's basically going to get to 1/2 and for this it's just going to get three little things of sugar one two and three okay so you guys see how that's done you don't need to watch us do the rest of this so we'll speed to the next step okay guys so this is basically how it's going to go we're going to put the pump back in here then we're going to run the tomb over and then I'm going to pump and somebody else is going to hold this and that's how it's going to work so I just want to show you the whole thing now I'm going to focus in just so you guys can see what's actually happening with the filling okay you guys look at the lusciousness look at all those bottles okay so here's the deal so we have a nice little contraption here this is the the capper so you put the cap in here you put it down on the bottle and then you pull this apart and it slams it down there so let me show you so you put the bottle put the cap on top you then put the capper with this thing over the top and it grabs the neck and then you just push until it pops and boom like that look at that it's all captain [ __ ] so exciting so same thing just put it down grab it pups you feel it pop and you pop it back off and voila nice cap you guys see that look what we did it's so exciting look at all these bottles you guys I haven't even counted here how many we got we got 28 bottles of liquor 28 bottles look at that these are recycled bottles thank you coca-cola for making really nice bottles that can be recycled we have new caps because you should always do that except the ones that have the flip towns which were cleaned I think that's a Trader Joe's bottle some bottles that somebody purchased for the last beer thing and then the ones that came with mr. beer and then of course coca-cola see you guys I think we did an excellent job so what we're going to do is we're going to let these sit for two weeks maybe a week because Thanksgiving is coming and then we're gonna drink some all right and we'll have lots for the holidays aren't you guys we'll see you in two weeks everybody been a couple weeks I'm sure you are as excited as I am to try the apple cider I hope you guys give this recipe a try it's not that hard you can totally do this at home especially if you just buy cider that's already ready to go a little sugar and your favourite yeast impress your friends make some bows enjoy all right you guys I'm Robert Jones this is you pneumonias mark - is my channel this is keeping up with the Joneses this is some cider making we did here today you guys can find me on Facebook as you know my name is Mark - or almost everywhere else as eudaimonia its EU dae mo ni us ma RK a I check out the blog we'll have some more information there and an airplane check out the blog will have some information there about what we did to make this cider and all kinds of other recipes from previous videos and even some stuff that's not in video so you guys might check that out in fact there's some stuff about sausages I did today on there all right you guys I hope you guys are having a week and everything is going well try this apple cider be perfect for the holidays or for Christmas or for New Year's or for Saturdays all right you guys I'm Robert Jones have a good one take care bye all right you guys it is the moment you've been waiting for whoo it is time to crack open a sprite no it's a cider people we're doing recycling here all right you guys so it's been in four weeks since our journey began and we're gonna have some cider jet sat down beside her okay so let's crack it open let's see I hope it doesn't explode like the last time we did wine so let's do I got the old fashioned opener and do look crack here oh it's just a little it's just it's just a wee crack all right let's see smell Oh smells like cider now if you remember when we did the taste test when check it out it was a little tart so I'm wondering if the sugars gonna help a little bit so let's try this let's do a line I spawn here not getting real full me a little bit of sparkle oh I can see a little bit of sediment coming up but I don't care can you guys see the color that is some brilliance all right I'm gonna stop pouring just so it doesn't get cloudy this is a little bit of sediment alright now we'll do a little PR rules Oh solder kind of excited alright let's give it a taste now I forgot to put this in the fridge last night so we're drinking it British style it's at room temperature and I'm totally fine with that mmm oh that's good you guys it's a little bit sweeter a little bit and a little bit more effervescence I wouldn't say it's like knocked your socks off the carbonation we didn't want to have the same thing we have with our wine champagne experiment but um could you guys see the bubbles and you see the bubbles it has bubbles it is a little sparkly it's nice not bad for a Monday morning Oh you", "hUMNOZX7CBU": "hello and welcome to my kitchen my name is Shari and today is Wacky Wednesday so we are gonna be making an apple pie habanero jelly but before I get started if this your first time here you love food you love fun and you love wacky recipes go ahead hit the subscribe button as well as a notification bell so you don't miss anything new okay so we are at the beginning of summer it is my favorite time to make jellies and jams because number one you can get fruit right now like insanely cheap especially strawberries and for two doing it in my paper chef blender makes it insanely easy so we're gonna do an apple pie habanero jelly we're going to do this using some apple cider so you may have seen some of my videos before where I've done like jams or jellies and the jams I typically do those are done with fruit and so our jellies I usually do with an apple juice or in this case an apple cider so I want to make sure that I mix this up really well because there's quite a bit of spice mixture in the bottom and that's what's going to give it the apple pie flavoring so we need three cups of this and if you don't have a blender no worries you can do this on the stovetop the only difference is you're going to want to take your habaneros so I just have them kind of roughly chopped they're the blenders gonna do the rest to work as far as you know chopping up really fine almost emulsifying them so if you're gonna do it on the stovetop I would put those in a food processor and get them chopped up real fine other than that your ingredients will stay the same and you'll just do it on the stovetop like you would any other jelly okay so in goes our apple cider I've got probably three to four habaneros that I chopped up I'm going to put in and then I'm also going to put in one package of pectin so I'm using this sure gel and this is just the original so I have not tried this particular recipe with like the low sugar so I'm not sure how that would work you can try it though okay so at this stage I've got my sugar here but at this stage with this blender I'm gonna go ahead and replace the lid and then I just want to make sure that I have this set to the jam setting I hit start and then in about 20 or 25 minutes it's gonna ask me to add in the sugar okay so our blender just beeped and as you can see it says add so this is the step where we're gonna take the lid off and I'm going to add in three cups of sugar this is a really easy recipe it's three cups sugar 3 cups of the apple cider couple habaneros and in your packet of pectin so then we just replace the lid and it's a start again all right so our blender just beeped again it's letting us know it's all finished so I'm just gonna take my blender pitcher off we're gonna push this aside and then I've already got oh three half pints and some pints here we'll see that I've sterilized so this is another thing that I love about making jams and jellies in my blender is I don't have to skim anything I don't have to ladle anything so that usually helps to keep me from burning rice a little bit hey you know if you like the idea of the apple pie but you don't like habaneros you can always leave the habaneros out so I hope you guys give this one a try it's super easy especially if you've never done jelly at all before if you find a recipe that starts with fruit juice like I said I think it's really really simple it's a great place to start so give it a try let me know I got a little bit left over oh one other thing before I say I'll see you next time is I'm gonna be making a ham on Friday with this we're going to do like a spicy apple flavored ham so be looking for that but anyway I thank you so much for watching I'll see you next time bye [Music]", "g_EfnBMho2Q": "have you heard of the um cider and apple cake well just up the road we've got a little shop called cedric's which is famous for its cider and apple cake i believe that even the queen has had one um sent to her i know that people in the u.s get it posted to them and um it's very famous it's um it's just up the road here anyway in fact well this isn't that recipe okay what are you going to say to me what have i done wrong now nothing i'm doing it's all right i haven't been drinking hurry well anyway this is my version of the cake okay it's very simple as you can imagine i've tried so many different versions of this and um i think this could be the final version you like you and jackie liked all of my versions didn't you and that was the important thing in fact but this is how it all started jackie and i were talking and she said you know what i fancy some cider and apple cake she said have you tried it and i went no i wonder if the shops open maybe we could get some and i said how about i make some cider and apple cake what actually good idea she said so this is how it all started in fact so my version what you need this is very simple all you need is some cider you can use um flat or um you know sparkling or scrumpy it doesn't really matter so we start off with some self-raising flour which is sifted and i've put it in here then you want to add now this is the um these are the dry ingredients so we'll keep them separate so she can find the little spoon that i need here i've got mixed spice okay so we just need oops sorry about that just chuck that in there there you go and then you also want this is like a comedy sketch you want a little bit of um a pinch of cinnamon all right so just stir that in like so you want three eggs all right so bear with me while i break these up have you tried that cider and apple cake no no well this is apple and cider cake slightly different in fact so chuck all three eggs in there i've used large eggs into that oh and don't forget to put the oven on and the oven is on 180 degrees get your tin ready which i've got back there and then you just want to beat this like so i'm just trying to remember what i've got to put in here demerara sugar put that all in there because i've made so many versions i'm getting confused which version this is i want to stir the wet ingredients like so next you want the cider i'm running out of space here i need a bigger kitchen so we want about 150 degrees degrees 150 milliliters of degrees [Laughter] right let me concentrate 150 of these now i would suggest you put the cider in here first because you're going to be using this again there you go you want to add that in slowly in with the wet mixture just give it a stir this is dead simple honestly this is the sparkling one and then we want some sunflower oil we want 75 let me just find out where i am 75 of this that's just over 75 so i use most of that a bit more there you go add that in a little bit more in here there you go and then you want to add the wet ingredients to the dry which you've prepared and i hope i've got everything that i was going to put in not getting confused with which recipe this is and then start gradually stirring it all in give it a good whisk if you've got a machine which i haven't anymore you could use that i must get one and just chuck it all in there you go that's all of that in there and then just keep stirring it in so it is quite runny okay stir everything in there the lamps will come out there we are [Music] there okay and then i've prepared the tin i'm gonna pop that in there and you just want to literally just pour it all in like so there we go and then to finish off we're going to well this is my version anyway i don't know if this is how it's supposed to be or not i don't know i'm going to finish off with some um i've got these gullah apples in fact with redskins so you just literally want to decorate it going around i've used two apples although we probably won't need to use all two apples in fact and just literally go around in a circle like so let me just um that's better and then we'll pop it in the oven now i've also prepared some stewed cider stewed apples in fact so i will show you how that's going to be made in a minute nearly there i'm going to use all these up you could try soaking these in a little bit of cider before you start i have done that in previous recipes and it's worked very well but i haven't done it with this one in fact because i've used a lot of cider in the um in this recipe let's just finish off in the center there you go like so all right that is it there we go so this is going to go in the oven so while that's baking i'll show you how to make the stewed cider apples all right there it is i'll be there in a minute so just pop that in there make sure it comes out nice and clean which it is coming out there you go it's ready well i hope that after today's um adventure you enjoy your cake i must admit that i made several versions and um i think my cottage was starting to smell like a brewery actually i don't know if you could smell it when you walked in but um there we go enjoy it we'll see you next week i'll ever think of something else let me know how the cake comes out and i'll carry on won't i i will carry on um making more versions in fact until i'm happy with them okay thanks mike bye you", "qt0HUwKcvtg": "hey youtubers Steven here how's everybody doing well brewing up a couple more cider experiments today and drinking the last bottle of my apple pie moonshine cider Cheers 17 but we need to get started with this today's cider recipe caramel apple you know like the caramel apples you get in the carnivals and the fairs and what have you why not I mean the sky is the limit so far the recipes have been turning out so I like caramel apples why not so let's see I'm going to use 6 litres of apple juice I'm going to use 2 litres of words we're gonna steep 400 grams of crystal ball 60 and had them crush it for me and we're gonna steep it for about 30 minutes I'm gonna get the water up to temperature and then I'll probably back sweeten with a little bit of stevia because caramel is supposed to have some sweetness to it so I'm still at the stage meeting how many teaspoons or tablespoons of stevia I'm gonna add to this so right now I'm not going to are I'm kinda on the fence mother 4 or 7 but I think seven would be too much maybe six we'll figure it out when the time comes all right let's get their water up to temperature and we'll steep sand grains already we're almost up to temperature I was shooting for 156 degrees Fahrenheit okay so don't mind the time where I actually got a too hot before I put my grains in we're gonna steep the grains for 30 minutes it's crystal malt 60 400 grams like I said we're just gonna let that steep in there any glutinous that happen to fall off I'm just gonna put a cover on it I'm gonna set my timer for 30 minutes there we go we'll steep the grains and we'll give them a quick little rinse and we'll come back oh and I have three liters of water in my pot I suppose that would be important to know and I've reached my 156 so we'll be back all right you folks there we go 30 minutes perfect timing oh yeah that just sounded silly steamie alright so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna turn the stove off my temperatures have been fluctuating between a hundred and 70 Fahrenheit and 145 you know so with only three liters of water that's it's actually kind of hard so I'm just going to pinch this off are you gonna stay all right I'm just gonna pinch that off like I did will let the grains drain out and I'm gonna heat up some water will give it just a little rinse because I don't want too much water in this right then we're gonna get this on a boil for 20 minutes we'll let it cool and then we'll come back with when we're ready for all the rest of the fireworks all right so I've got two litres of worked my boil was a little aggressive I had to add two and a half cups of water beautiful thing about the wife's new pot it actually has all the the leaders and standard sizes in there like quartz so absolutely fantastic for doing them winds blowing my back door open a little bit give this a little stir now with this one I I'm gonna add stevia to it as well I know you're probably thinking stevia is a bad thing but it comes from a cleanse just ground up so definitely better than aspartame but well these are only experiments right so I'm going to put in five tablespoons as well because caramel should be sweet right two three four five no little stir you notice that I haven't added any brown sugar to the ship well I don't know how much sugar the crystal malt 60 is going to add to this so we're gonna do it in steps gonna get a gravity reading then we'll see how much sugar and need to add to it I don't think I need to film that pretty straightforward I'm gonna do it in probably half cup intervals depending on how far off it is they don't give you the totals when I come back all right look at the color might be kind of hard to see see if the camera will focus me my hand will stop moving anyways you get the hint someone wanted me to save him a sample in the house so I was semi right I didn't think the crystal malt would add that much sugar to it I ended up adding two cups of brown sugar and that brought me up to one point oh seven Oh funny how these two experiments I hit my numbers bang on that I was looking for but I don't know here's my Nottingham ale yeast you know one of the dogs trying to push open the back door she thinks there's somebody here just me Daisy kind of oh all right no yeast is in get her cover on our airlock and I'll see you in two seconds hey everybody we're back I was in such a rush thinking about you know what I was gonna say and everything I didn't even think I pulled it over to the fridge cracked the top anyways I've really been busy today and I've got a lot more that I want to do tomorrow I gotta stop looking at this lens my eyes are all buggy from being outside all day today I put up the trellis for my hops and I put four strings down for each plant there's a lot of work it looks pretty good right now though but let's get back to this review my caramel apple hard cider yeah it's a nice color I have to look there we go so it's a little darker than the other hard ciders those of you who were watching Jake's cast there last Saturday this is it it actually carbonated a little bit so far today with the nottingham ale yeast it's not a heavy carbonation and I'm actually loving it the downfall it's been taking about a month month and a half well let's check my calendar alright so uh April 12th is when I bottled it and this is six weeks now so this little carbonation and it does have predominantly apple of course because it's all apple juice and in them with the grains that I steep to add to it so there is a little little hint of sweetness I don't know if I'd really call it the caramel that I could smell but so let's give this a try cheers everybody seventeen hmm the Carmel is rate there I was aiming for something you know like the caramel apples you know you make it Halloween or you could get at the carnivals but not quite that sweet and I'm really really pleased with this I'm not quite sure if any it's a little more caramel or if it's just right you know I don't have the most sensitive taste buds in the world so I definitely could not be a beer judge but Jake didn't say whether it should have more caramel or or it's too much but I certainly love these these these are delicious I only have a few more and I'm trying to save them but I will definitely be making more of this just like the other hard cider the the recipes I can't believe how good these are so cheers everyone seventeen hope you have a great week and happy home brew Wednesday since I'm posting this on Wednesday as you can see I just finished my thumbnail here behind me for the video so I'm gonna enjoy this put my clips together and you'll be singing this later on so Cheers have a great week", "5k9MsL8SJFk": "oh it's a lovely sunny day hey everyone it's a lovely sunny day welcome back to dubious engineering we're going to engineer up hard apple cider this is really easy i've got here a four pack of tesco's apple juice this is from concentrate if it's 100 pure juice um i have here a bag of alcotec 48 classic turbo yeast and i also have here a bag of sugar and this is silver spoon caster sugar then we have a demi-john which has been cleaned disinfected beautifully and a little bubbler and a cork what we're going to do is we're going to put probably about half a bag of sugar these apple juices some water in order to drop the concentration of the apple juice a little bit and then we're going to chuck in a couple of tablespoons of alcotec yeast now we're going to wait wait about a week as soon as it's stopped bubbling then we're going to decount it into some plastic bottles some old coke bottles with a little bit of sugar and as soon as they're clear we should have apple cider and we should be able to drink it and that'll be the fun bit it should be slightly carbonated so it won't be completely flat anyway let's get on with it keep watching see how we do [Music] [Music] uh [Music] so here we are back with the cider about a week down the road an interesting thing has happened it's stopped bubbling there's still water in there the co2 just isn't flowing anymore it still looks a little bit like misty orange juice but it's starting to clear up a little bit about 20 degrees still in here so a comfortable 20 degrees and the rough cider is just starting to clear hopefully you can see it's just a little bit clear at the top here still slightly hazy at the bottom and actually if you lift up and i'm going to do this very carefully if you lift up this jug you'll see there's just a little bit of white at the bottom of it that's clearly sediment that's the yeast and various other things that have just gotten heavier and fallen to the bottom the water trap has stopped bubbling um there's absolutely no activity going on anymore there using a siphon with a filter on the bottom of it this is um this is just basically like a little u-bend effectively and so what we're going to do is we're going to pop that in here this is a one and a half liter bottle another one and a half liter bottle and a one liter bottle so that's four and a half liters uh we won't be um pumping the sediment into those bottles we'll make sure that the sediment stays in the bottom of this glass bottle before we start that what i need to do is prime these bottles here so in order to prime them i'm just going to put again caster sugar i'm just going to where there you go if there is a little bit of yeast left over in the cider um that will also convert to alcohol but at the same time it will add a little bit of carbon dioxide into these bottles because i want my cider to be ever so slightly lively i want to unscrew the top and here it goes and then drink it let's go ahead and decant some of this cider into those jars okay carefully does it now we don't want to disturb the sediment at the bottom too much so we're just going to get that in there there it is and we can move that down there we go right i'll be right back here they are and uh need to just mix that mix that sugar in so the next couple of days i will just uh give give these guys a little bit of a shake and you'll feel them just start to pressurize ever so slightly three bottles of white lightning to drink in the park on the swings and slides with our mates [Laughter] we should probably taste test what we've got it certainly smells right anyway there's a little bit left in the bottom of this bottle here i'm gonna see if i can encourage it out and um we'll pop it in a glass and have a little taste test she's a wee bit misty but uh and not cold enough certainly got that cider smell to it and um smells like an apple fart but um probably will get them after drinking too much of this stuff yeah yeah that's good and strong that's really good and strong [Laughter] this is going to be good all right well let's uh leave them out in the shed for five days they should clear up even more and then stick one in the fridge overnight and see what happens when we drink it so it's time to test the cider it still looks like sort of frothy pea um there's no sediment at the bottom of the bottle adding the priming sugar has not created any extra gas i can tell that by squeezing the bottle it's still quite flat i didn't use a hydrometer to check where we are with the cider before i made it so this is non-scientific now what i do have is one of these it's a little breath alcohol um meter now what i'll do is i'll just turn it on so um stupidly it tends to use the battery when it's in standby mode so i just pop a little piece of paper in there to stop it from using its battery when it's in standby mode once 20 seconds is up you then blow into the into the tube on the front of it and it'll tell you what kind of alcohol content you have on your breath i don't think it's very well calibrated but it certainly gives you an indication as to how much alcohol you've got on your breath if anything at all so the plan ultimately is to drink all of this run this test and see what it gives us but before we do that we need to check that this reads zero first all right we've got a green light and zero zero zero on the meter these are the fun tests right let's go ahead and pour ourselves there's a little bit of pressure in there not a lot let's go ahead and pour ourselves a pint of the good stuff well first of all taste test cheers and beers everybody cheers insiders yeah it's quite drinkable it it is it's quite drinkable um it tastes like cider i haven't had anything to eat since it's working clearly i've only had two mouthfuls i haven't had anything to eat um since lunchtime um so so running on a bit of an empty tummy i mean my tummy is not exactly a small tummy let's um let's fire up the meter again and let's see we're coming up to the half pint uh mark clearly you know the the the alcohol will be um in and around your mouth and on your breath so apparently you need to wait 30 minutes before you before you test yourself but it would be interesting just to see if we get something more than a green light and zero zero zero yeah it's definitely got something so what it's doing now is it's analyzing and what we got 0.58 that's actually quite that's actually quite a high reading clearly the meter is is showing when there's no alcohol present and the meter is showing when there's alcohol present um but i don't believe we're going to get a particularly well calibrated reading as it stands at the moment i'll go ahead smash in the rest of that pint um and then we'll um then we'll wait 20 minutes and and we'll see what the meter says i'll be right back five four three here we go let's do the test okay let me show you where we get okay 0.36 we've managed to blow a green i'm pretty sure with two pints we'll get to point seven two shall we see if we can squeeze two whole points out of this plastic ball see you in another 20 minutes i guess um cool it's got it's got a gentle sort of punch to it a gentle hit to it which is clearly the alcohol does it taste like apple juice now no because apple juice is sweet this doesn't taste sweet it has got just a hint of sour to it all right okay it's flat it's flat what i probably should have done what i probably should have done what i probably should have done is use a hydraulic and then i could have calculated how much alcohol was in here good night stupid idiot how do you how do you how do you explain and this is this is probably the hardest thing i think i've done on camera can i describe a cider to you eventually i'm going to get there it's flat which isn't a bad thing because it goes down really easy when it's flat i think if it was a bit lively you probably wouldn't want to drink it quite so quickly and at the moment i must admit i'm actually and clearly i've enjoyed drinking it because i'm drinking it reasonably quickly um it's just got an element of sour to it very slightly but not in an offensive way i'll tell you this for nothing i've stumbled across a good bit of fun here this is clearly a good bit of fun the demijohn jar was very kindly donated to me by my very good friends simon and hayley thank you very much uh the bubbler on the top the the gas trap was and the cork was very kindly donated to me by my mate pete thank you very much pete really appreciate it and here we have cider that works smells like apple farts it smells a bit like apple and it smells a bit like a mildly sour apple mini mini milky silent apple um six to eight percent i will say this has turned out my calibrated tongue and my not so calibrated brain at the moment i would say this this is rocking a about six to eight percent so uh ladies and gentlemen absolute success um two pints of beer that i that you know from from your local pub unless it's like you know the strongest stuff on tap won't have the same effect that this does this is i've actually i've genuinely had to slow down a little bit i think three points of this and i would be really quite quite good end result we've made another one because ultimately it works it does exactly what it says on the tin as long as nothing goes wrong with my internals tomorrow and i'm not spending an awful lot of time on the loo um and if i am trust me i i either won't publish this video or i will come back and tell you not to do this um yeah genuinely this this this uh this works really really well so i was doing the math earlier five quid five quid for five liters well four and a half let's say so five quid for four and a half liters of cider what does that mean well one meter is approximately two points that's 50p a pint and this stuff for some people this stuff is close to rocket fuel it's stronger than beer okay so here's the scale beer this cider wine whiskey etc etc what's above whiskey i don't know but i'm not joking this absolutely puts a smile on your face there's another brew on the go i had to it just made sense i've got a feeling this this could be a very good way forward so i'm one and three quarters of a pipe in the meter is about to beep oh yeah we got a red light now 0.64 so um so basically then i haven't even i haven't even finished two pints it's strong there's no doubt in my mind earlier i was guessing it in a region of six to eight and it's borderline borderline rocket fuel it is magnificent as always thanks ever so much for watching don't forget give us good old thumbs up have a wonderful week and weekend and we'll see you in the next one cheers and beers people take care bye for now cheers people take care have a wonderful weekend bye for now i've done it there's a massive old city block oh", "VMRYZb3YHRY": "all right this is a video of how I make my heart apple cider day and a half ago I went to the local cider mill and purchased two six gallon carboys full of fresh pressed cider and I brought it home and I siphoned about a half gallon out of each carboy to make room for the sugar and enjoying drink the fresh the fresh cider has a natural yeast in it that I really don't want in my sight or so what I do is the first thing I do is I take and I add a quarter teaspoon of potassium metabisulfite to each container and let it sit for about 24 to 30 hours to evaporate out and that way I know all the natural occurring yeast in the apples is dead so I can start and use my champagne yeast just it just it takes about a quarter teaspoon per sixth gallons of her five and a half gallons that I have left of the cider to make sure that it's I'm ready to use commercial yeast all right so now the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to siphon off about a gallon out of each container I do it individually into a sterilized pot make sure it is sanitized all your equipment before you start any project like this but I'm going to start by a siphoning off a gallon of the cider into the pot and then I'll be adding my sugar and then mixing it back in so I can get everything totally dissolved easily basically the only ingredients that I use for making a cider is I use brown sugar which actually gives it a really nice palance's flavor finish when you drink it and I use just twice sugar to provide the yeast something to ferment into alcohol first thing I'll do is I'll weigh out two pounds of the on sugar all right here it's the two pounds of brown sugar I like the way it out it kind of helps me keep the taste in the same year after year but to show your content of the Apple is a little different too so you will get different flavors so first and I'll take this and I will edit to the gallon of cider that I siphoned out and dissolve that stir that in well I'm sure has been stirred in and Facebook totally dissolved next thing I'll do is I'll weigh out the white sugar and add that we have the four pounds of white sugar that I'm going to add next and this is very six gallon patch that I add as much now I'm going to slowly stirring this once you try to get that all dissolved in the town the liquid before adding it back to the carboy and I make sure that everything is dissolved and you're going to wind up a lot of sugar laying on the bottom at the end x2 what I'm going to do is I take a nice eyghon that sugar mixture back into the carboy seems to be the easiest way to get it back in there now with all that sugar back in the carboy what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my back into my spoon and I'm going to stir it up and mix it up real good and then next I'm gonna take a hydrometer reading - just to check the bricks before I get going to see if I have to get any more sugar all right so everybody mixed up now what I do is I use a wine thief to go in earring and grab a sample and I drop the hydrometer in it just to verify my bricks looks like I'm at about a 18 I want to get that up a little bit higher so I'll be adding a little bit more sugar but I got another half a pound of sugar here I'm going to slowly I'm going to add to the mixture and stir in and then I'll take another reading and see if it's where I want it if not I'll yeah a little bit more taking another reading in this patch right now is looks like it will should ferment out at about a 10 percent alcohol level which I'll go for on this on the next one I'll be shooting for about a 15% but it seems that this year the sugar content of the apples is quite a bit lower than it has been in the past so I've had to add more sugar so I'll see how it turns out this first batch I'm going to be trying this a red star premium curve a yeast see how that comes out I should for men out to ten twelve percent so try that and what you do with you start by getting a cup of quarter cup of water that's at about one hundred and eight degrees and you put the yeast in let it sit for a couple of minutes to activate before you add it to the cider and as you can see this is about fifteen minutes later the yeast is starting to foeman's all activated so now what are they doing I'm gonna pour it into the carboy try to get all of that there and the last thing you do is throw in an airlock and then I'll fill that with water and we'll go on to the next batch here we are starting the second batch and slightly outside to show your footage and start the process all over again the second batch is done this one I had to put a couple extra pounds of sugar in they get the bricks up a little bit higher so and get some higher alcohol content okay this patch I'm going to be using a champagne yeast that should allow it to go up to about fourteen fifteen percent so I'm going to mix it out with the warm water and just get it to the back so here we have a two batches 12 gallons of hard apple cider started as you can see the first batch of the rain is starting to ferment on a movement going on and the other one I guess dated the East T so that want to be a while but one thing yeah we want to be sure to do when you're preventing any kind of liquid is to put it in a container I've used a cool it here just in case it blows out and runs over so you don't have the fluid all over the place so now this will have to sit for about two weeks for the primary fermentation and then I'll be racking it off into the secondary ferment or let it sit for a couple months to settle out and clear thanks for watching please subscribe", "pVq6cRWEvT8": "oh did I have the camera on the whole time today we're gonna make some black cherry apple cider it's a hybrid this is actually gonna be a really easy recipe most ciders are so I'm gonna take this opportunity to answer a couple of questions that I've had because that cider video I made kind of blew up one of the questions I got was what's the alcohol content of the cider when it's finished this one's gonna be about 6% let's see what it was one of the other questions Oh a really good one I didn't realize so many people from around the world we're gonna be watching the video where you can't get this product this is apple juice concentrate and it comes frozen here in the States but there's even places around in the United States that can't get this and I use this in the last recipe when the cider is finished fermenting I mix it with this to boost the sugar content and also the flavor right before bottling but the sugar that the yeast is using to bottle carbonate the cider is actually from this apple juice concentrate but since lots of you can't find it I have a really easy solution let's get started this is a really easy recipe so I'm cooking dinner while I make it let's get going [Music] told you it was easy so now we're just gonna take this cider and put it into a dark place that's basically stable room temperature for one month now here's another question I get all the time my cider stop bubbling after three or four days is it done no it is definitely not done even though it looks like it's finished there may not be any more bubbles or anything happening after a few days you still want to give it a full month because there's a lot of invisible chemistry that's happening inside that jug the flavors maturing the fermentation is finishing up and also you're letting your cider clear so you need to give it that time give it that full month in a dark place to let it finish out I got a perfect opportunity to answer one other question that I've gotten several times what happens if my brew froths up and clogs up the airlock the cherry juice had a lot of pulp in it and the pulp will mix with the yeast and cause a really foamy head at the top of the brew and that can push its way up into the airlock and clog it and fill it full of junk and all that kind of stuff so what do you do in that circumstance here's what I'm talking about there it is it's just pushing its way into the airlock this is the sediment from the cherry juice this is the yeast so the sediment is actually sitting on top so it's getting for stuff like that look at all that activity so what are you doing this circumstance well simple you just sanitize your hands sanitize the outside of the airlock take it off wash it out and stick it back on the main thing is to just be clean while you're doing it ideally you don't want to open up your fermentation not at all it increases the likelihood of some sort of contamination either there are bacteria or a bug flying in there or whatever but there's really no alternative if you know something like this is likely to happen in a brew you can do a blow-off tube it gives you the opportunity to not have to worry about cleaning that out and opening up your brew these are actually designed there's a tube in the middle where you can actually just poke a hose on top of that tube and stick that into a glass of water and that acts as your airlock this is what I'm talking about where it goes in it comes down to a cup so if this one were to blow off it would just go into this cup and I wouldn't have to reopen it to clean it I would just change out the cup of water now you know just take it off and clean it or put a blow-off tube under or if you really want to be smart leave a larger air gap one eternity later it's bottling day all right so you remember that juice that we saved that we had left over because we poured some out of the big jug and then we had a little bit of cherry juice left over this ends up being about 48 ounces and so what we're gonna do now is we're just gonna pour this into a pot and boil it down to about 12 ounces and that's gonna take the place of our apple juice concentrate we're basically just gonna make our own [Music] while this is heating up let's go ahead and answer a couple more viewer questions that I get all the time can I just refrigerate my cider do I have to pasteurize it no you don't have to pasteurize it you can just drop it in the fridge and that will knock the yeast down into dormancy so they're basically not fermenting very much it's a very very low-level fermentation that happens in the fridge so instead of having a couple of days you have a month or maybe a little bit more before you really need to drink that cider or pasteurize it any longer than that and you're risk turning those bottles into bottle bombs because they'll they'll eventually get over carbonated so keep that in mind but if you have to store your cider in a room temperature or hot environment if it's not gonna be under refrigeration you definitely need to pasteurize another question I get is can I use other juices of course you can ferment anything with nipples I mean you can milk anything with nipples I have nipples Greg could you milk me not nipples you can ferment just about anything with sugar so any kind of fruit juice you want to do you can probably do with this recipe just make sure it doesn't have preservatives in it another question I get is why is my cider so cloudy two reasons number one did you remember to use the picnic enzyme that I recommended no well it's probably pectin haze it's better to go ahead and get the effect again zine to make sure that your cider will drop nice and clear and when I say clear I mean clear long way to go the other reason your cider might be cloudy is because you're not siphoning it properly using an auto siphon takes a little bit of practice to make sure that you don't kick up the yeast at the bottom of the jug and you know fluff it up into your cider cuz if you do that then it's gonna be a little bit cloudy I'll show you what I mean when we get ready to bottle another question I get about every week is can I use bread yeast you can it's not gonna taste very good bread yeast is designed to work very hot and very fast and it also leaves a really yeasty flavor that's okay in bread but if you take a gulp of your cider and it's all a yeasty and you know tastes like bread that's not very good but if you use wine yeast or champagne yeast or cider yeast those are designed to ferment much cleaner and to work better with fruit sugars I highly recommend that you consider using some proper yeast they're not expensive the packets of yeast I get are like $1 or $2 you can get them from a home brew shop you can get them on Amazon I'll put the links for some really good ones that I like and that I use all the time down in the video description check them out and you'll see how cheap they are one other thing those packets of yeast they do five gallons of cider or wine or whatever that's 20 liters you don't need to use a whole packet in one of these one gallon jugs you only need to use a fit of a packet basically like a half a teaspoon not a lot because as that yeast starts to eat sugar it reproduces it multiplies inside the cider so eventually it'll colonize that cider at the the rate that it can support you don't have to go crazy with putting the east end so save some money and just make those packets last for five gallons looks like we've cooked it down by about 75% so I'm gonna turn off the fire let that cool down for a minute and then measure the measure of the volume to see if we hit the target looks like we're slightly under 12 ounces I'm gonna call that good so my juice concentrate is cool now you want to make sure that you cool that down you don't want to add it hot because the heat might kill the yeast that's suspended in your cider and you need that suspended yeast not a lot you need a little bit in there that's alive to carbonate those bottles [Music] [Music] if you've never siphoned your cider if you've always poured it stop doing that you really need to use a siphon because if you pour it one you're just transferring all the cookie grows sediment the yeast crap from the bottom into your bottles and really you can do so much better with the flavor and the appearance if you don't do that the other thing is you don't want to oxygenate it if it's splashes and gets all bubbly and stuff you're oxygenating it and that can really lead to another off flavor which is kind of skunky similar to light exposure so siphon if you've never used one of these basically it's just a tube with a one-way valve on it and a little plunger Deeley plug your hose onto there then we're going to drop this end into our cider and this end into our bottling bucket and you just that starts the flow of the liquid and we're keeping it tilted a little bit so we can get the last little dregs down here you always want whatever you're siphoning from to be higher up than where it's siphoning to gravity is the only factor for siphoning so [Music] [Music] so now that the bottling is done we're gonna leave these out at room temperature for several days until this coke bottle starts getting super firm just like a brand new unopened soda that may take anywhere from three to seven to eight or nine days it just kind of depends on how much yeast you have mixed into suspension and actually the room temperature also matters quite a lot if it's really hot this can go faster so keep that in mind be flexible that's what the test bottles for trust the test bottle when this is firm chances are your bottles are ready is that sexy guy back there mmm one last little thing all you need to do is get an ice chest and toss your bottles in there and it doesn't have to be one of these plastic ones you can use a Styrofoam ice chest and do the exact same thing it'll contain any spills or any breakage or anything and it'll also keep the temperature nice and stable if the room where the bottles are gonna be stored is really hot or really cold or fluctuates in temperature with an ice chest you don't have to worry about that they fall this thing is about as hard as a bullet it is ready to go several people have asked in comments whether or not you passed your eyes here your plastic bottle no I just stick it in the fridge one of the biggest problems when you're pasteurizing is not knowing exactly what temperature the cider is in the bottles so we shoot for a hundred and eighty degrees in our pot of water but how do you know that the cider inside to a hundred and sixty-five degrees because that's where it has to get in order to kill the east to prevent the bottles from continuing to ferment that sugar I'm gonna fill this bottle with room-temperature water I'm gonna stick that down in my pot with my bottles that need to be past your eyes and throw a thermometer in it and when the thermometer inside this bottle reads 165 then I'll know we're good and I'm gonna restate the warning for this when you are pasteurizing bottles you're taking pressurized glass bottles and putting them into very hot water the potential for catastrophic failure for the bottles to explode or the caps to pop off or whatever is very real so you need to be careful once the water is up to 180 degrees turn the heat off then put the bottles in and then put a lid on you don't want to pick up glass trust me I've only had maybe three or four bottles pop but I've never had like glass shoot across the house or anything it just pops it there's a lot of cleanup but the glass really stays in there because the water kind of catches it and slows it down be careful turn the heat off after you get the get the water up to 180 put your bottles in lid on and then walk away from it for about 10 minutes [Music] oh did I have a camera on the whole time cool all right so there you go it happens to everybody that sucks the good news is looks like most of the explosion yeah it's just the site are all down in here so there you go happens to everybody be safe [Laughter] [Music] [Music] all right so here's the cider it's all finished as you can see it's got a fantastic color to it smells amazing you can smell the tart cherry you can smell the apple in there honestly I think it came out fantastic but if you want to see the tasting you need to stay tuned I'm gonna do a tasting video with George and Jessie and I'll post a

and then we shake it okay that's our mess report in the glass but we're not done yet remember this is an apple pie flow where the flow part ice cream on top okay beautiful now we stick a cinnamon stick in here mm-hmm and then I said with a little bit of cinnamon on top you see that you see the cinnamon coming from the heavens hallelujah okay and there you have it the apple pie flow delicious

moonshine Eli is not gonna drink any cuz he's just a kid but me and his mom eat hard definitely gonna drink a lot this recipe is really easy we're going to start by just pouring a 64-ounce apple juice into the pot I'm gonna help your cake it's really heavy great job it's okay but next we're going to pour a 64 ounce apple cider and then [Music] okay next we're gonna pour in some pumpkin pie spice one teaspoon just dump that in it then we're gonna put in 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup sugar last thing is we're gonna put in four cinnamon sticks so that's all for now we're gonna turn it to saute and slowly stir it while the sugar dissolves once you have all the sugar mixed in you're gonna throw the lid on and cook it for 45 minutes on high pressure you cook this for 45 minutes and now we've let it just naturally release for 25 minutes so we're gonna put this over your foot and let that rest come out okay so the button just drop now we're gonna take off the lid and this part it's very important okay now we have the lid off we're gonna hit cancel because we don't want it to keep warm and it's gonna take a long time but we need to let this cool down to room temperature before we put our ever clearing it because Everclear is such a high proof that it can catch on fire so we have to let that cool down before we do anything else looks like we are ready to add our alcohol so we're gonna do 2 cups of Everclear this is 120 proof in California you can't get more than 150 so if you can find that use that five 120 and then this is a kissed caramel smirnoff vodka so we're doing at a cup and a half of this two cups everything all right nice and slow now we need to mix it up okay just realize the fan was on so we turn that off hopefully it's a little bit quieter now well we've got our Bach in there we've got our Everclear in there we've got everything ready to go now it's time to serve you're ready okay so we're just going to scoop it out like this into a mason jar you can add some more cinnamon sticks into the jar if you want put the lid on it's ready to go and that is our instant pot apple pie and moonshine so easy a pocket good before we go let's take a little test taste

going to be showing you how to make a 1 gallon batch of hard cider for this recipe I'll be using a gallon of cider that I picked up at the local grocery store now it's important to make sure that this cider does not contain any preservatives if there are any preservatives it will inhibit fermentation and you will not be able to make a hard cider the next ingredient that we need is yeast I picked up nottingham ale yeast for this cider i got this at a local homebrew shop for just a couple of bucks the next thing we need is yeast nutrient i like to use this to give the yeast all the nutrients that they need so they can flourish and have a strong fermentation the first step we're making a hard cider is to make sure that you clean and sanitize all of your equipment properly I mixed up a gallon of no-rinse sanitizer I used star scent it's about a quarter ounce to one gallon of sanitizer and then I'll soak all of my equipment the fermenter the airlock the hydrometer test cylinder everything gets soaked for about 2 minutes in the sanitizing solution it does not need to be rinsed this reduces the risk of contamination during fermentation which would ruin our batch of cider ok now that we have all of our equipment clean and sanitized we can go ahead and take a hydrometer reading the hydrometer reading will give us an idea of how much sugar is in our cider so we know what kind of alcohol we can produce after fermentation to take the hydrometer reading I'm gonna go ahead and open up my cider and fill the test sounder and place the hydrometer into the cider give it a slight spin and wait for it to come to a stop it's a little hard to see on camera but the specific gravity of this cider is 1.04 8 now i'll document this number on my cider log so once fermentation has ended we can take a final gravity reading and then calculate an accurate alcohol by volume of the cider all right so now that we have our hydrometer reading the next step is to start adding ingredients to the fermenter for this batch I'll be using a 1 gallon glass carboy alright the first ingredient I'll be adding to the carboy is a yeast nutrient the instructions say one teaspoon per gallon and the next ingredient will be the cider I like to pour the cider over the nutrient so it mixes by itself all right the last ingredient we'll be adding to the carboy is the yeast now this package of nottingham yeast is good for up to six gallons i'm going to go ahead and add about a quarter of the package now the last step is to place the airlock on to the carboy now I fill the airlock with some of the sanitizing solution that way if anything gets into the solution in the airlock it will already be sanitized and it reduces the possibility of contamination all right so that's all there is to preparing a gallon of cider for fermentation the next thing we want to do is place the carboy into a cool room at about 65 degrees and wait for fermentation to begin fermentation should start within about 12 hours and you'll start to see some bubbles come up on the surface so it has been about eight hours since I pitched the yeast and as you can see cruising our foam has began to develop on the surface of the cider this is a good indicator that fermentation is beginning I'll check back later tonight and see how fermentation is going okay so it's been about 24 hours since I pitched the East and as you can see there are bubbles starting to come out of the airlock and if you look at the side of the carboy you'll notice all the bubbles of co2 rushing to the surface they're being produced by the yeast in the process of fermentation you'll also notice that the foam that was on top of the cider is now dissolved this tends to happen with cider so don't be alarmed if you don't have any now this cider will continue to ferment over the next week to two weeks depending on the amount of sugar that was in your original juice the type of yeast used and the temperature that you're fermenting I'll be making a follow-up video so make sure that you subscribe and give me a thumbs up on this video if you've enjoyed it if you have any questions go ahead and drop them in the comment section below I'd be happy to

turkey deep-dish apple pie is essential for Thanksgiving something that you can't rush which is I think one reason I like it my pie dough is nice and cold it was resting for a couple of hours start with one disc at a time and roll out to about an eighth of an inch thickness I go with the rolling pin I just throw the flour that's something a pastry chef showed me to make a nice even sprinkling I will put this on a parchment lined baking sheet and I'll fill this in the fridge while I wait the other one will transfer this the same way to the first one I'm using pink lady apples I really like them for baking because they hold their shape really well and they have good sweet tart balance how thin you want to slice is up to you I like to go pretty thin about an eighth of an inch now I'm gonna add my sweetener and spices so I'm just gonna toss with my hands and the sugar is going to start to draw out some of the liquid from the apples and that's what I want so I let these master raid at least one hour and up to three one of the keys to this apple pie is that it has reduced unfiltered apple cider in it it creates such like a deep apple flavor I always put reduced apple cider in my apple pies its cooled off a little bit this gets tossed in with the apples and now it's time to assemble I have a 9 inch deep dish pie plate I took these out of the fridge a few minutes ago the most important thing here is to press it really firmly into the pie plate I'm just going to use a scissors to trim the edge a little bit I want about a 1 inch overhang before I put the apples in a quick egg wash around the sides all of these go in every last one I'm not forgetting this time to dot the top with butter and that milk is a bake since as even more flavor to the pie here's our top crust I'd rate this over top I want to trim this smaller than the bottom crust so there's about a half inch overhang I'm just going to take the bottom crust and fold it over the top crust and if you need to you can give it a little extra egg to help it adhere I use my thumb and my thumb and forefinger on the other hand and just go kind of the width of my thumb all the way around now final egg wash over the whole surface this is Demerara sugar one of the final steps to cut slits in the pie this will let steam escape and it helps those juices concentrate as it bakes I have brown crust on the bottom the apples are tender they didn't fall apart two beautiful deep dish apple pies I hope this pie makes its way to your Thanksgiving repertoire it will definitely be on my table", "pVYgjAKk8p0": "hey

have anymore and it's one of my favorite hard ciders it's really good it has a decent alcohol percentage but it's apple pie yeah but I strap match I have a high strap matches it's a Hulk Hogan in WCW had strapped matches with Ric Flair yeah yeah but they didn't call it a strap match for summary and they called it like I don't know if it was actually like it's on paper it's what it was but when he pronounced it he called it an apple pie strap match and it was supposed to be like in the Himalayas like some deadly strap match they happened like they built it up to be this big special thing and then the match came and it was just a strap match like it was there was nothing different one didn't you just call it a strap match which is kind of a gaming a little bit I understand they like strapon match or something like that strap on me but if you ever had a strap match they suck it suck big time I've had I've had four or five of them when we did our wrestling and even use straps we used rope that is not fun yeah I know people are just gonna be like let's go to town on this thing but there they are not that fun to do they hurt a lot but they're good they're good it's an easy way to get people to care about your match by just whipping it out of each other and again it sounds like 50 shades of grey but it's not it's fit to change great how was that by the way to do I did not watch the movie oh ok I think such as unfortunate ago no that was Chris oh I thought you were gonna hurt eres no no she hates not resetting everything that I had yeah chris said he didn't like it he said that there needed to be more tits because I guess like she owes it a few times like more tits and he said less muff cuz apparently she wasn't taking care of what was down there she probably had one of those cuz Hollywood has those like waves for your buff him no she did I think she did nudity but and they she did what kara what industry does that there's one industry Oh like like Game of Thrones like I'm Game of Thrones you'll never see a clean shave and check on there I think it's because it hides the vagina a little bit they have like the hair in the way so that we can get away with it like guys at the rated X or something I think I don't know if it's rated X but I think it's just not going to make it onto onto their type of TV Shane from the walking dead was on and they asked him on Conan and they they talked about like fake sex scenes on TV and how it's so it's so and demoralizing the women they're only allowed to show guys asses on TV they can't show women s is you show a woman asks in your trouble yeah his nap likes a set let's sex he'll like show me show me some chick but I really don't want to see it a whole bunch of man but I don't care down as long as it's 5050 all this kind of shames buddy's got a nice butt yeah it has to be a nice clean but oh no what if it's walking dead though they're gonna have like poop and it's gonna be like Harry I want authentic walking dead like where Maggie's walking around like Maggie Glenn are gonna go and Glenn's like your head still smell like a dead dog and she's like yeah it goes Oh God imagine that though none of

yes that's just reeked of I would not want to have sex ever again I'm honestly surprised that they haven't died of some kind of disease other than big well that was an episode that the sum of the zombies got infected with some sort of disease and lay and that that made them like even if the zombies didn't bite you if they got within your proximity they could give you the disease I camera was called and said it's a real disease like a lot of watched a lot of like history channel and AMC and stuff where they do the specials where people say like what's the dead leaves outcome of a zombie apocalypse actually hit and has nothing to do with the zombies it's the amount of disease that is carried from dead people like just bunch of dead people like in a city you should not be there you should get out immediately because all those types of diseases are gonna pop up and just kill everybody yeah hopefully yeah it's going there when they turn their zombie anyway and then got Maggie and her poopy but imagine that it's just like it's like dripping down I don't want to imagine poopy but we've had this discussion before hello it all comes around full circle full circle all right this smells really bad it does smell exactly like apple pie with a cross it cinnamon in here it smells like cinnamon in here it's like its crust and everything that's weird I am gonna guy oh god oh god oh god now we drink we pour son of a [ __ ] that tastes like rotten apples I see the cider in there I taste it but there is some him to something I don't like and it's I think it's like rotting app

insides just feel weird mix and cry it makes my insides crying so just imagine that sad faces on all my organs well I bought it for a reason just because of how weird the name was just apple pie I never would have associated even though it is Apple's like apple cider but apple pie cider I'll talk about chug challenge there you go oh I can do it what are you gonna do it it only gets gross after

on so now all right but there you go guys this is me Julian hard phata apple pie phata that dusty road and depth all day and we will see you on the next three years right let da wrecklesseating", "QDslqTVEJXY": "[Music] like many funny-sounding fruit desserts take slumps betty's or grunts Apple Pandowdy is an old-school New England classic as the great dinosaur once sang Apple Pandowdy makes your eyes light up in your time you say howdy it's similar to a skillet pie but during baking the crust is pressed into the filling so that the juices flood over the top and caramelize in the oven I mean how many desserts do you know that purposefully mess up the top and that is a process called doubting now the big question is why did they dowdy in the beginning well the answer is a lot of pie dough was very very tough it was tender as we make it today so they had to do something to actually make it edible that's a good reason and we're going to start with an all butter pie crust there's no shortening and it's not only going to taste better but the shortening would have made it too flaky and too tender hmm so I've got three tablespoons of ice water and a tablespoon of sour cream just gonna mix these together now our dry ingredients we're gonna do all this in the food processor we've got 2/3 cup of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of sugar and a half a teaspoon of salt and then I'm going to let this run for just a few seconds until it's well blended so easy in the food processor now I've got 6 tablespoons of unsalted butter really well chilled now I'm gonna pulse this about 6 maybe up to 8 pulses until that butter has really worked in and starts to look a little bit like saying so far this is just like making pie down pretty much pretty much and I want to show you the texture of this there are few pieces in here of butter about the size of large Peas so those aren't too big those aren't too bigger they're gonna continue breaking down more as we add our sour cream mixture so we'll go ahead and pour this right in about three to six pulses should bring all this together you can see that there's no dry flour anywhere in there and although it looks like a scattered mess at this point that's okay it'll come together very quickly I'm putting it out to about a four inch circle and this is going to go into the fridge at least an hour all we need to do now is wrap it tightly in plastic into the fridge it goes we have well chilled pie dough and now it's time to roll it out now I did let this sit out for about five minutes on the countertop it's going to be much easier to roll out and I'm gonna roll this out to a ten inch circle and I'm a little bit large so is the dough story my life so we'll go ahead and squish it in just a little bit and there we go we want to cut this into two and a half inch squares the easiest way to do this is to go right down the middle each side and then the same this way and it's dowdy so you don't have to worry about it being perfect I'm gonna go ahead and place this on here here's a little pieces weight doesn't make it a lot easier when you don't have to worry about it being perfect you're just cutting into little cobble squares exactly we're gonna cover these pieces a little bit of plastic wrap and this is going to go back into the fridge just soak and chill again about thirty minutes [Music] high dose still in the fridge time to make our apple filling now you know our go-to for Apple baking is usually granny smith apples they're fine they're just a little too sour and they retain their shape a little too much a little too much crunch all right so we're going with Golden Delicious lovely lovely flavor and they have almost a buttery flavor to them this is two and a half pounds of Golden Delicious apples of course we peeled and cored them these are half-inch slices so these are going to cook down perfectly if you've got a quarter cup of packed light brown sugar and we loved a little touch of molasses that brown sugar adds we have a half a teaspoon of cinnamon not a lot and a quarter teaspoon of salt I'm just gonna toss this until it's coated with that cinnamon and sugar and wait the pie dough later now it's a pan dowdy let's go over to our pan we're using a 10-inch skillet here because we're gonna pre cook the apples I've got three tablespoons of unsalted butter it's just melting over medium heat I'll go ahead and add the apple mixture we that's a full pan looks good I'm gonna put the lid on we're gonna let this cook for about ten minutes and during that time the apples will start to soften I'll go in there a couple of times and stir it they'll also start giving off their juice now this is 3/4 cup of apple cider got a tablespoon of cornstarch because we want this to thicken and two teaspoons of lemon juice well go ahead and whisk this all together we're gonna go ahead and pour this right into our skillet now I just want to bring this back up to the simmer we're gonna let this simmer until that mixture starts to thicken that's only gonna take two minutes isn't that one of the prettiest things you've ever seen in your entire life Elle's amazing smells like fall it's apple cinnamon autumnal so I've slid it off heat I'm just taking my spatula and flattening the top a little bit we're ready to put our pie dough right on top what I like to do is just go right around the sides there is no rhyme or reason I like it yes me too messy on purpose and now we're gonna finish it off with a little egg wash whole egg beaten lightly just brush the top now we have a little cinnamon sugar a tablespoon of sugar and a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon mmm that goes right on top this is going to go into a 400-degree oven you'll see a lot of bubbling around the edges some nice color on the duct it'll stay in there for 15 minutes [Music] it is time to dowdy mm-hmm Hugh says a very very technical way to dowdy here you take a spoon and you smush down in the middle until some of the juices run over that Center smooshing that's the technical term absolutely you do it maybe four times around the edge we're gonna put this back in the oven again still 400 we're gonna leave that in there until you see it's really nice and caramelized on the top that's about another 15 minutes all right [Music] Oh smells good Apple Pandowdy you can see as it bakes a second time it kind of Riemann's itself and it puffs back up beautiful golden color of course we cannot eat this right now that's a lava hot so we're gonna let this cool down 20 minutes and then we'll eat the Pandowdy all right 20 minutes I think it's safe it's downright gorgeous absolutely let's dish up a nice big portion here and make sure that you get some of that Apple and of course some of the beautiful shingles on top and lots of really flavorful sauce of course may I put some ice cream on yours thank you I'm gonna put it right on the apples perfect oh so it could melt right in there oh no good well something about the vanilla ice cream on the top I mean that's just gilding the lily those apples the cinnamon I'm just gonna say the whole kitchen smells like cinnamon right now oh that's good well I love how the juices went over the dough you just can't get that with a regular pie dough and the apple texture really really good I mean they've broken down just a little bit but they're not soupy at all still have some of their texture I don't know about you but my tummy saying what is Dinah Shore howdy howdy your eyes are lighting up as well to make this easy old-school New England apple dessert start by making a simple pie dough using a food processor cut chilled butter into all-purpose flour then add some water along with a little sour cream for the filling use Golden Delicious apples and cook them with brown sugar and a 10-inch skillet along with some cider and cornstarch to help make the sauce top the apples with squares of dough sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and bake it right in the skillet for 30 minutes stopping halfway through - dowdy that crust down into the juices served with vanilla ice cream and there you have it from Cook's Country a terrific skillet recipe for Apple

video for you it took me like three or four months to record this you're gonna see me with a beard you're gonna see me without a beard the cider as you can tell from the description of this video is delicious and it's zero sugar so i cannot wait to show you the most simple way to make a high alcohol zero sugar delicious tasting cider that's what we're doing today [Music] there's going to be a lot of technique but really at the end of the day is just a good quality cider and some yeast let's do this we can get very very complicated with this cider it's technically a wine so we can make it clear and we can really dial down the sparkling we can even age it we can add hops and we can oak it i'm going to show you just simple yeast into a bottle and making it sparkling what we're going to get is we're going to get a very dry cider with high alcohol very low if not no sugar and we're going to get some bubbles okay so two major rules of making cider one sanitize everything i've got two types of sanitizer and this is a chlorine-based sanitizer i'll use either one of these lately i've been using this one and having really good results with it but sanitizing is rule number one because if you get some foreign yeast or bacteria it's going to turn this sour and not in a good way rule number two going to want to keep notes because let's say we bottled this up and we take two months to make this we're not going to remember exactly what our measurements were a month ago or two months ago so every single batch that i make whether it's good or whether it's bad gets lots and lots of notes first thing first we're going to need a cultivated yeast so our goal is to turn all the sugar in this cider into alcohol thus making it ketogenic and that's going to be called a dry cider so we want this perfectly dry the best yeast to use is going to be champagne yeast so pasteurized cider is gonna work fine i like to get the stuff with the sediment on the bottom and bonus points if you can find one in one of these now these are called a demijohn or a carboy this is a one gallon carboy so i have a total of three gallons and a three gallon demijohn or carboy right here and i'm going to be doing the first fermentation we're going to be doing two fermentations here okay we're going to be doing our first fermentation where the yeast turns the sugar into alcohol and then we're going to be doing a second fermentation where we make it bubbly so let's get started on our first fermentation and that's simply by just adding the uh cider into our sanitized demijohn here now we're gonna stop right here we're not gonna fill all the way up to the top because we want a little bit of room because when this yeast starts to activate it's gonna create a bunch of foam and we need that area for this to breathe without having that foam come out through our filter or our little bubbler right here remember double check that all of this is sanitized you don't want to open this up and see you have some mold growing on the bottom of here you're going to have to throw away this whole thing okay so get the appropriate size stopper with a hole in the middle we're going to pop that guy into there we're going to get ready to put it on here keep these because what we're going to do is after our first fermentation we're going to rack it which means we're just going to take the fermented wine or cider and we're going to put it back into these bottles and we're going to let them sit and settle out so take these clean them out put them over to the side and don't throw them away don't forget to keep the bottle caps too now at this point it's time to cut open our yeast and we're going to dump our full yeast packet into here now this is enough yeast to make five gallons of cider but i'm going to go ahead and i'm just going to put the whole thing in there and all that's going to do is just make this start a little bit quicker all right now that we have the yeast inside of our fermentation container we're going to go ahead and we're going to put the air lock on now air locks they come in a couple varieties these are the two that i like i usually go with this guy when i'm using the big three gallon carboy here so we have our champagne yeast our date and the type of apple cider and this was a sonoma coast apple and we are going to put our batch number at the top so this is now i'm going to do one more test and for you guys you aren't going to need to do this feel free to do it though if you want to go out and buy it but we are going to use a little cylinder of our cider in here to test the sugar content because i want to be able to know what the alcohol level is at the end of this so we need to do two things we need to take a beginning measurement and an ending measurement now like i said if you're using champagne yeast you can just trust that at the end there's going to be no sugar left but i'm going to verify for you guys on camera here by using a hydrometer this is a hydrometer and this is going to tell me what the specific gravity of and the potential sugar and the potential alcohol by volume so i'm going to go ahead and take that measurement real quick okay so our original potential alcohol percentage is 6.5 so 6.5 potential alcohol in here if all the sugar gets fermented out so now there's nothing to do but wait we're just gonna go ahead and put this into a dark safe location i'm just gonna throw it underneath my counter here and i'll show you what it looks like when the yeast starts bubbling check that out so this is 24 hours after we added the yeast you can see that it's completely taken over here it's made all these bubbles up here and our bubbler or our air lock yep it's bubbling away telling me that there is co2 being produced as the yeast is eating our sugar and turning it into alcohol and gas the co2 so we'll be done in about a week to 10 days and how you know you're done is when this thing stops bubbling that's when all of your champagne yeast has turned all the sugar into alcohol okay so here we are 17 days later and as you can see it's completely stopped bubbling so that tells me that all the sugar in here has been eaten by our yeast and we've gotten what alcohol we can out of this so uh after i saw that it stopped bubbling i kind of let it go for another day or so just made sure that the ferment wasn't stalled and sometimes it'll stop like momentarily then it'll start back up again a lot of times if you have a fluctuation in like really cold to a really hot day or something like that but that's not the case this ferment is done so now we're going to rack it okay so what we got here is just a simple siphon and i'm literally just using a piece of like quarter inch tubing and the goal is um in racking to take the main ferment here and then put it into new clean containers that don't have all the sediment um at the bottom and the sediment is just dead yeast and little particles falling out of solution here all right so we got everything racked um this is gonna cleaned out and ready for a new batch uh now it's on to testing the alcohol content we have a original potential alcohol of 6.5 and then on here we'll go ahead and say that is 0.2 percent potential alcohol by volume so that means we have a alcohol percentage of six point three percent and that's going to lead to a super low carb cider okay so we've successfully racked our cider and it's almost done right now we're gonna put this away in a dark cool spot we've got caps on it nice and tight everything's sanitized inside of here it's just our fermented cider and what we want to do is kind of just let it sit and settle out we're going to do that for about a week okay so it has been about two weeks and these ciders have been sitting right now you can kind of see that there is a gradation and you can see it really good on the top one up there where it's starting to get clear up here and it's hazier down here pretty much if you let this sit for like three months this thing would get clear on its own and arguably it's the best way um you want to age your cider a little bit so all the haziness goes away and that i think is the best way to do it uh the some of the best cider sits in this stage right here racked on a little bit of yeast for about a year and one year old cider tastes i think the best now you can see the sediment down here is starting to accumulate as it drops out from solution now i like to do my cider a little bit hazy and that's what we're going to be doing in this video so we are going to actually start bottling this cider today and i'm going to show you how to do it we're going to add a little bit of sugar i'm going to add a little bit of yeast and we're going to pop it in a bottle put a top on it call it good and in a week after that those bottles will be ready to drink here are our choices for bottles we have a 750 milliliter champagne bottle this is a 22 ounce bottle um this is actually what we're going to be using today and this is a beer bottle now which one would you choose i recommend going with the beer bottles that's because the bigger you go the higher the pressure so if you're just starting out and you don't know what ratios you don't know how your cider is going to react you don't want to create a bomb in your closet or in your fridge so start small because if one of these blow up it's no big deal but if these blow up you've got a problem so i'm gonna go ahead and pick the 22 ounce only because i got a ton of these bottles donated to me from my neighbor who works at bootcraft and boochcraft makes a hard kombucha and they ferment in bottle so i know these bottles are tough what i need to do right now is remove these labels and i need to sanitize these bottles and sanitize everything i'm going to be working with including my sink where i'm going to dry my bottles any tubes the capper all that stuff has to get sanitized i'll be using a heat gun a little bit wd-40 to get these labels off and i'll be back with you when we are ready to start making our sugar syrup for the second fermentation we've got some sugar here and that is four tablespoons per gallon is the ratio that i like to use with champagne yeast to create the perfect amount of bubbles not too much that it blows up but also not too little that it's just like still like drinking apple juice or something like that so that's perfect we're going to use a little bit of leftover champagne yeast and pour that evenly to kind of split it up amongst these guys here and we're going to split this up here too we're going to try to do that very accurately by using just a little bit of a measuring cup here and a funnel remember everything has to get sanitized so let me go ahead and add our yeast and our sugar into this and the amount of yeast that we're adding to this is kind of arbitrary to be honest with you you want to make sure that you've got enough in there that it doesn't take weeks for this thing to kick off but you don't want to add too much that you add a yeasty flavor to gently mix the yeast and sugar together but not to the point where you are stirring up the yeast that has settled out of solution here be very careful not to stir up what's on the bottom just enough that you're sure that the sugar has gotten mixed up okay it's time to start bottling now i like using one of these crates because i will take all the bottles out i'll set them here flip this thing over and i'll set these uh one gallon carboys on top of here and i'll use the gravity from the higher carboy to fill up the bottle kind of just like pulling a siphon and i'm just using like simple like i think this is like quarter inch or three inch tube and then like this little bottling mechanism that when you push it down it dispenses outsider and when you let it up it shuts the flow off and helps keep a siphon all of this very cheap i think it was like six bucks let's go ahead get all these bottles out and get these things on top of this and remember we moved all this very gently so we didn't disturb that bottom layer of yeast we don't want that ending up in the bottle now i went ahead and i filled this thing up with water i did that so that i don't have to put my mouth on here and i can start to siphon really quickly i'm gonna dump out what's in here and we'll be able to pull a siphon after that you see we've got a nice flow going now i wanna stop right about here so right at the edge of the neck is where i'm filling these up to these need to be cleaned and recycled i'm going to save the notes and i'm going to put them in my notebook to make sure that i remember what everything is going on here and i'm gonna throw some labels on these but this is what three gallons of fermented cider gets us so let's go ahead and start capping these off because these things the yeast is starting to react with the sugar and it is ready to get put in storage so let's get after it and these are oxygen barrier cap make sure you sanitize it before you put it on here just like that it's good to go so let's run through this let's go ahead and cap all these last one voila just like that now it's going to be about two weeks i say the longer you leave it the better these are going to get now just store them upright you can keep them in your cupboard don't let them get too hot because it will cook the juice inside here and you'll get like a cooked like apple pie kind of taste but not in a good way go ahead label all this take diligent notes put it into storage let it sit for a year pop it open and you will be thanking me later guys this video took a long time to make just because it takes forever to make cider but it's well worth it i wasn't able to find a decent cider video on the internet which is why i made this so i hope you like it and if you do and share this with someone you know that would love it as always guys keep it keto stay healthy peace [Music] [Music] you", "9msxXYfvOvs": "full on fall autumn as it is and what is the best thing to do use apples it's fun to go apple picking to a natural orchard or to go to your farmer's market and find some great apples they're ripe they're delicious and it's always best to use something that's in season that is local if you can get it because it tastes the best it hasn't traveled halfway across who knows where to get there i'm making apple pie this pie is a little bit of a special pie in the sense that this is the pie i made it's been five years ago on the rachel ray show when i co-hosted with her for one day it was this thing that they did for a dream job for a day i got it and i made this pie on the show so i actually do love this pie it's a caramel apple pie and i'm using a mixture of apples i always like to use some granny smith or something that's really tart and crunchy crisp and then i also like to use like a honey crisp that's a little bit on the sweeter side but still maintains that good crisp texture so to par them i always start by just cutting them in quarters and then i cut out that core this is also kind of what i do if i'm going to make like applesauce or something and then i'm going to sit and just you could use an apple peeler if you wanted i honestly am just used to cutting them kind of like this and getting all that peel off now you do what you do you do it feel safe to you if you're not used to cutting apples please don't and please don't hurt yourself so when you get them mostly peeled i just cut them up into slightly smaller i like kind of slices and you can do smaller ones but remember as they bake they really do get softer and they cook down so you don't need to quite worry so much about small small pieces so i'm gonna keep peeling coring slicing and we're getting enough apples to make an apple pie the apples are all done you can see there's nice pieces they taste delicious don't worry i tasted a few i'm putting them all in here to a dutch oven i'm gonna actually par-cook them so sometimes apple pies they are so dense they are so big that it's a good idea to actually pre-cook them slightly on the stove and that gets them going so then they shrink and lose some of that moisture on the stove instead of in the oven and it kind of just works better and it works better for a pie so i'm putting some brown sugar in there that really amps up the flavor i'm gonna add the juice of a lemon that acidity just it really brightens everything up it brings out all those flavors especially in the apples i'm going to squeeze that around the whole thing don't want to skimp out on that and then i'm going to add a little bit of calvados if you don't know what calvidos is leave it out it's an apple liqueur so it kind of just like amps up that flavor again i really like to just pump up the flavor whenever i can then i'm just gonna add a little bit of salt did you notice i really didn't actually put that much sugar in there that's because you don't need to apples are sweet so it just brings out some of that sweetness but we're also gonna add some caramel later so i'm gonna take this over the stove we're gonna cook it a little bit we're gonna set these on and we're gonna bring them up so they start cooking it's kind of extremely simple and there's really no right or wrong way to do this i'm just going to stir in some of that sugar just so it coats all the apples that lemon juice gets all over it will take a few minutes but then the sugar's going to draw out some of those juices the salt will and also the heat is going to start actually really helping them to cook so i'm going to sit here i'm just going to let it come up to cooking so you can see it and then we'll be making apple pie you are getting the real way that i bake at home i forgot to put the butter in so we are going to add some butter as it's cooking too you can already see that it's just starting to melt together i'm starting to hear a slight sizzle i don't know if you can hear it but i'm gonna continue to let it cook just until the apples turn tender it's gonna be probably in that eight to ten minute range this has now cooked and it has cooled down completely to room temperature you could even pop it in the fridge you don't want to put it really hot into your cold pie shell because it's going to melt the butter and all that time you took to create such a good pie shell because we're all making homemade pie shells now right if you didn't see my video check out my video because pie shells should be made at home because you can do it they're easy i promise anyway to now thicken this up because you can see there's some extra liquid down in there see that but it has a lot of flavor in it it has a lot of sweet in it so we're going to add some corn starch a lot of pies are thickened with either corn starch with flour the old ones are thickened with tapioca the thing is it doesn't really matter you just want to know the right amount of what to put in and again i'm just going to remind you where's this recipe in the description apparently there's sometimes confusion where it's at in the description so i'm going to stir in that cornstarch i like to stir in cornstarch to something that's more cool like these apples you don't want to stir it in hot because that can make it kind of get um oh gloppy and kind of just not mix in well so we have that in there i of course want to add some cinnamon because it's folly all right i can say that when they're cinnamon i don't say y'all ever so i'm sorry to you southerners who say it with such beauty and elegance i don't but it's fall and i just feel like when you're adding cinnamon you just have to now i'm not overly spiciness because a lot of flavor is coming from the caramel i ho make my caramel because you get so much more flavor because you can get it a little bit look how dark that is so it's getting a lot of those molasses notes those deep caramely flavors it's not just sweet it has that slight almost bitter edge so it really offsets some of the sweetness of it i love that i had this affinity for obsessions with caramel who doesn't caramel oh there's so many notes in it and it's so good so i'm gonna mix that caramel into those apples that obviously is why we didn't overly sweeten them before because we have all this caramel sauce in there now if you think it's kind of looking broken or the caramel is kind of don't worry that's all going to cook out when it is in the oven so before i do that i have my pie shell i did not crimp the edges i left about an inch overhang because i want to do you know what we're just going to kind of go all out on this and i'm doing a lattice pie crust so for a lattice you make two recipes of pie dough because you're making your pie dough right okay good and then you're just going to take one roll it out like this into a big circle and make long strips just using a pizza cutter and the thing is the thicker you make them like you can see mine are about an inch they're easier it sounds so lazy but they're easier to actually put on the pie when they're a little bit thicker whoops sometimes it comes with you and it just you know you could go really small little lattices if you wanted to but guys why why make more work for yourself than you need to there's no reason a lattice is going to be gorgeous no matter what so i'm going to finish just cutting these up i just want them to be ready because once your pie dough is out of the fridge you just want to work not like fast but a little bit quicker so you can just get everything put together so i'm going to put in these beautiful apples do they not look so good you can see that caramelly color in that liquid now the one thing i do as i'm doing this i make sure you get all the apple pieces in there first because what is this again it's apple pie so obviously you want all the apples in there you can have we're going to pour them all in there now i kind of rate my my liquids it's thickened with that or it will be with all that cornstarch but as you can see right now that liquid is up to about the top so i don't want to put more of that liquid in there because that is now all the liquid you need and it will get thick don't worry it tastes delicious there's nothing raw so you can taste it and now we're just going to do that lattice part so we have our shell we have that overhang for the lattice i just like to take a piece i usually start with one of the longer pieces kind of offset the center the center would be right beside that and then i'm going to do the same thing going crossways on it look at that and guys let us just add such like a oh it's just good and i'm going to keep working doing that and you kind of just do that cross hatch pattern and so as you put one down you lay it across where you need to and then you might need to lift one up follow it down and so you're going in and out doing like a basket weave on it kind of it sounds i get it it can sound complicated and it can sound time consuming but as you can see these bigger pieces really make it so it's not that much work so i'm going to finish this up no need for you to get bored here and then we'll put it in the oven i have all the lattice laid on i'm going around just evening up some of my lattice pieces to match my pie crust because then that will make it easier to fold together so it's just a little bit easier to kind of get all these ends out and done i totally get that lattices are not something you're going to do on a daily basis don't get me wrong and honestly when i did this hello i was on a tv show and thought we were doing a lattice but once in a while it's fun to go the extra effort and make something homemade like this even if it looks more homemade the cozy homemade look good so i'm going to take these pieces and i'm just going to fold it all under it's gonna be a really thick sturdy edge but that's what i want because that's gonna make so that extra gloppiness that we had in that caramel and that liquid of the pie isn't just gonna spill over which i don't want and you know what it just gives it a really nice look when you can have a nice sturdy crust too so i have all of that folded under i do a little bit flour here if you you could probably leave it not crimp it crimping it does help it hold together i think just a little bit better it's kind of a messy crimp in the sense that when it's this thick and you have those lattices it can kind of be hard to crimp so don't feel bad you could also take the back of a fork and just push it down over you know around the pie and kind of make that look too i mean the idea of crimping on a lattice is just that you're kind of pushing that lattice into the pie crust to create it a little bit more of a good finished solid edge so all done not perfect but guys it's pretty good so now of course just uh let's what do they say gilda lily so just to add a little bit of extra i'm taking a little bit of water nothing much here and i'm just going to put this over the top because i'm gonna sprinkle some sugar and i really want it to stick to my dough otherwise the dough is kind of you know dry right now to the touch so a little bit of water is just gonna go a long way all you need sprinkle sugar it just adds that nice crispy kind of crackly shiny top to the crust you don't need to go crazy with it but it's just pretty and then i always bake them on these pie baking like pans it's nonstick and then also it can't catches any drips and then the scraps don't throw them out put cinnamon sugar on them and bake them that's what my mom always did they're like delicious little cookies so we're gonna put right into a preheated oven it's gonna bake for a long time you want it bubbling in the center you want to pull it out let it cool forever and enjoy some pie because who doesn't want pie i want pie this has fully baked how did i know it was fully baked it started bubbling all throughout the pie and i mean even in the center here it was bubbling that lets you know the cornstarch is fully activated another way is look at this it is a glass pie tin why are we using a glass pie plate because then you can see the bottom that beautiful golden brown crispy crust it is baked throughout so i let it cool then after i took it out because there's no way i can cut it for you when it is bubbling hot so now that it has sat i can cut it and guys when you have a good crust oh my goodness look at how beautifully that cuts and since it's fully cooled that thickener has really tightened up inside and so you're able to make a good cut you know i'm gonna be honest it takes a leap of face faith to cut this on camera why because guys you never know how that piece is gonna come out especially the first one but cutting two pieces helps it usually come out a little bit better i'm going to check one more time here in the corners because that's where you usually kind of don't get down in and cut we're going to pray lord let this come out good and then we're going to pull it out oh that's good that's that's a good piece of pack this is what i love about a good pie it's thick enough that it's holding together it's soft enough that the pieces come out you can see the bottom and see how crispy it is it's not as soggy bottom as they would say on the british baking show they always say that i got a fork and i got some ice cream cause i'm not gonna have apple pie without some ice cream no usually i would make it i didn't went to the local soft serve like hello not going to say no to that and now we're going to have some caramel apple pie alamo because i just feel so extra right now i don't care this pie takes a few extra steps you got the caramel you don't have to home make it i highly suggest it so you get that deeper flavor you got kip sitting here wanting it because he knows how good it is and then mixed with that little bit of ice cream nice this is fall in the perfect apple pie i hope you make it i hope you share it around it's my favorite pie it's worth making it tell me what you think let's all go out pick some apples and make some pie and it's on my website do you have a website check it out wiseguide.com apple pie you", "4xrQm31ZN84": "[Music] so today we're gonna make some apple pie moonshine and to get started we got our usual bottle of Costco vodka just open and tested last night we got two bottles of regular apple juice which are 1.9 liters so just under 1/2 gallon and we got some spiced apple cider this stuff here is also available pretty much anywhere it's just under half gallon as well so in total we're gonna end up with about two gallons of stuff so what we have for our spices that we're gonna add in is we have three cinnamon sticks one nutmeg and I don't know probably a tablespoon and a half of cloves so we'll bust this up and and add it with the cloves and we're going to use that in a thing used for making tea so we'll get some stuff busted up and get started so they get the nut big these things are pretty hard so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a grater I got and so views about half of it and I'll open up my tea dispenser as you can see we end up with quite a bit more better clothes in there this just makes the rest of our job so much easier because we don't have to filter things out so near as much so we got it ready to go so let's start pouring stuff in so we'll start getting our juices in here [Music] Oh sohal using three cinnamon sticks you can use five six ten however many you want not a really big deal and our spice mix I'll throw that in there and let her come to a boil and then we'll keep it close to a boil or just under it for about 20 minutes thirty minutes and then we'll shut it off another steep or couple hours to cool off the room temperature and then we'll add her alcohol so I'll see you in a bit so we're getting close to boiling here one thing I forgot to mention is half a cup of brown sugar this is just golden brown sugar usually I try to use the darker stuff a little more flavored but we'll drop that in and and stir it in while we're weightless to finish boiling and as the schools have been started every five minutes or so just to even keep going all right so this is boiling pretty good enough it's just a light boil so I'm going to turn it down halfway or so and it's going to simmer for half an hour leave it at that and then we'll take it off and we'll chill it for a couple hours even we put it I just leave it on the counter said it doesn't cool off too fast want to get as much flavor out of the cinnamon and nutmeg and cloves as we can and then we'll add our alcohol don't add the alcohol before all right so we got our stuff done it's cooled off it's about room temperature now so we're going to scoop on our tea diffuser and we'll get the cinnamon sticks out later when I hear it so anyways I'm going to use it's a little over 3/4 of a bottle of vodka here so I'm just gonna add the whole bottle and we'll see how it turns out hopefully it's not too strong so then total this she is gonna give us about seven liters of apple pie stuff should do the trick on a Saturday night so just remember don't ever add the alcohol when I talk is if you do when your your stuff is blending all you're going to do is boil all your alcohol off so we'll have a little bit of a taste here and see how we are you're gonna see chunks and in this stuff here and what that is is that's actually even nutmeg I don't worry about it you can strain it out if you really want but yeah it's all up to you oh [ __ ] yeah that might have been a bit much vodka but anyway it'll do and yeah so we'll bottle her up and get busy so we bottled everything up and as you can see we started with these three and we added the better part of a bottle of vodka and we ended up with our three jugs plus a one quart or one liter jar so we're out about half a liter or or two cups from what we started with so that's just what boiled off while it was on the stove cooking but as you can see we got we got an ample supply of apple pie moonshine to drink and give away and I guess if you work it out you can go to different websites online and figure out the percentage this one here is between the 12 and 15 percent so yeah enjoy and have a good weekend", "SMQl-3AeoVc": "hey everybody today I'm gonna show you how to make some apple pie the drink okay so you need your box of red hots like we used to get one who's kids or if you can't find them like I couldn't I use these these Brock's cinnamon drops okay then you gonna need one gallon of pure apple juice not apple cider know that stuff 100 percent pure juice and you're gonna need you some Everclear grain alcohol please don't use rubbing alcohol because of kid yeah first thing you do is you take out a cup and a quarter of the apple juice what I did was I poured it in me a glass and drank it it was delicious okay so there's the cup and the quarter of Apple to use taken out just like so and now we're gonna add our Everclear we're gonna add 1 cup of Everclear back into the container and we're gonna add 1/4 of cup of the Red Hots if you cannot find a box of Red Hots if you can and they're not the big ones just a regular sized box of Red Hots just that's the perfect amount to put in there ok all right now I'm gonna add the Red Hots here I used a dilly whopper to put her in there I couldn't there you go I couldn't find anything else so I'll just use my cannon bang to put the Red Hots in there now folks we have to wait for two months I made this on May first okay and here it is July 1st okay so here I'm capping it up I wrote the date on there and we got to wait till July first gets here you know I'm say it now you can't add more Everclear it makes it much stronger so beware of that okay all right now here we go two months later just took it out of the refrigerator and you can see it's turned into a beautiful peach color now at 7:00 114 oh yeah baby now I got to tell you folks I'm gonna pour me a shot of this here and I and I don't know if you ever tried this or not but to pour a shot out of a gallon container ain't the easiest thing to do but my wife is outside so and I hope if I spill some it does not damage my tabletop okay that's how strong it is that gives you some kind of hint so let me go over and get some paper ties and get this mess cleaned up okay oh yeah baby now we're gonna clean it up here she'll never know it happened so I don't know if I've told you guys or not but I don't drink but I had to make this shot for you cuz this drink is awesome you can make this and it will last in your refrigerator for a long time because all it is is apple juice red hots and what is it stuff called Everclear yeah so I'm gonna I'm gonna take this shot here for you and my wife's outside work it into gardens so she don't know about this plus it's during the daytime oh boy you know what I mean I here we go cheers to all you drinkers huh smooth now let me tell you if you make this drink I only put a cup of Everclear in it you can put two cups in there if you want and it will be deadly one cup you can serve shots and folks can drink it one shot or two make and still drive but folks you got to be careful when you're drinking alcohol act like an adult do not drink and drive ever if you make this for your friends they will love it okay", "GW1U-VD4Pe4": "a nice welcome to seasonal sweets and sweets I'm amber John and today we are continuing our fall theme and we are reviewing woodchucks fall harvest just like apple pie hard cider and for dessert we have apple spice doughnuts they're big yeah um we had some would check in the past quite a few this is a new one for us though I'm kind of excited yeah woodchuck has a few seasonal releases that they have throughout the year and they seemed to change every single year we had a pumpkin one before we had the pumpkin one last year and we had the winter flavored one which I liked I don't I did yeah I'm actually I like that a lot the winter kind but this is the fall kind is so it says serve cold got that put it in the freezer SideReel what's a call goose no condensation condensation thank you um so yeah it's five percent alcohol by volume like I think all their ciders are ya it says the fall harvest brings farmers and communities together to celebrate another year of fruitful looking for so funny fruitful labor it's a time of shorter days cooler night so long already great apples this slider has a complex and elegant character full of apple cinnamon and nutmeg balanced with a this sounds like a debits it says and balanced out with the hint of American white oak a true taste of the season in that season is fall it's fall so what mixing what do we think of the label I don't know yet I haven't really given it good look so they're little would check on here holding an apple and its price there with shucks also names beavers sure um there's a apple tree bushels of apples it's fine it's pretty him it looks like an apple picking look so yeah it looks the same as the orchard is the word you're looking for yes um it look it looks like the same label only with a apple tree in the back yeah it might even always have that probably now thank you and a half ish maybe a three maybe it three its average but its place to look at just like apple pie is what it says yeah I love that I really difficult with Chuck label they aren't lying we also where I think we're both fans of the stubby little bottle [ __ ] not weighing of the shape of the woods are today yeah it's different than your average bottle it differentiates no okay I can already smell how apple pie e it is really really now you don't have to worry about it anything like a head on a hard cider obviously smells like carbonated apple pie hey yeah so it's a pale tan color me feel Napoli but they all smile happily don't they let me there's this different to you well a slider a cyber smells or I'm cider tastes like apples the same way that wine user sleeps usually ciders to me tend to be more like sour apple yeah I always think of it's sort of like a rotten apple smell not not like an off-putting smell like a mushy apples now I mean i'ma get in privacy my like a candy apples so I close my eyes I can maybe picture the wafting smell of an apple pie on a window frame see I'm getting more like green jolly rancher or that well it's very like like you can not only punches you the face I already kind of Tate dreamed somewhere between a green jolly rancher and a packet of baked apple flavor quaker instant oatmeal it's quite specific there all right let's see you mix with chief champagne that's about it good taste cheap champagne yes yes we we love her he loves oh whoa that it's not cool well I thought it would be this is a roller coaster right that was not I was not anticipating still changing nutmeg men definite baked apple foot definitely this is kind of fun I mean it cuz you're not here you smell on your leg off so maybe it's another sour apple ish kind of cider but this is something different yeah this is this is definitely and every oh god how'd they do that that's what I want to do they fit real apple pie flavor into this tiny model I mean really yeah so it has some never like usual apple spice [ __ ] major apple spice yeah and it's nice but the first thing you taste just tastes like regular would check I think we've said this before there's about which I thank you sneaking the first sip tastes like regular regular woodchuck hard cider but then oh god yeah it's easy changes oh my god it really hits you and it's kind of amazing cuz that's consistent sometimes I feel like with these kind of fun flavored seasonal kind of things i like the first sips I'm like oh it's something really pumped me or something really fun but then it loses it after a while but three sips in I have not lost the interesting apple pie spice flavor yeah it really um we're so totally surprised by this yeah whenever it sits on your tongue it develops into this really nice um a spicy flavor that is really reminiscent of a apple dessert really be I mean if you have a hankering for pie but you don't have the means to get it pick this up instead and you might feel like that's a suitable alternative idle time being I was a little skeptical that this would just taste like wood chuck with cinnamon and it doesn't it you know he's like no aliens Oh God well developed flavors and I think it's that nutmeg that I'm really I really taste that good it's really coming down so this has ingredients on it which hard ciders do it says less than 1% of natural flavor caramel color so sad sulphites lightly carbonated and naturally gluten-free ah this literally all it says hmm sounds terrible why are we drinking this why what's wrong with that besides the sulfites all right some caramel tell well we were just talking about cheap champagne less than one less than ninety percent soften I know it's like a puppy in here yeah so this is kind of in the algo pop range of yeah it's kind of kind of more like a soda at the slow sip though I feel like it's kind of similar to serve champagne were like you can't ask does elytte mmm it's not very well carbonated though actually yeah it's borderline still um first of all they have a bite to it that makes them hard to drink like really quickly yeah it definitely has good flavors so let's go ahead and give this a raid oh my god it's still happening I so surprising every time it's great this is more like it feels more like a Joan sarah than it does like we're having a headset yeah like right now if you if you like didn't tell me what I was drinking and you're like surprises Apple pop I look up yeah you wouldn't you wouldn't necessarily think of it you think yeah it's not but it's not overly sweet also I just want to say that no it's not not a really sweet so for a that whoa let's just write it as a as all right side a give me in the four and a half um okay I did this because of the flavor and what they were able to do with it at least it's not more run-of-the-mill I like that a little bit of a surprise meant at least me I like sort of more traditional ciders signers with a little bit more or in this fight there's a little bit more drawing this to them made a little more traditionally yeah this is gonna drive side I'm gonna give this a 3 out of 5 but this is definitely a leg go out and try it that's okay this is worth having at whatever Halloween fall harvest party whatever you're gonna have a party who has closed um people who don't celebrate Halloween yes I guess so um so yeah it's definitely give it a try gluten-free you try me and if ya especially yeah if you're gluten people out there this is a nice alternative so you don't the feel awkward at me already what everyone else is true yes if you pumpkin beer yeah and what's nice is that because you are gluten free then this would be nice to change things up from a normal hard ciders witches or if you just like work early drinks sometimes it's a nice flavor profile so you do not gonna feel like like gross through yes there also seems to be a weird amount of like legitimacy from having a would check oh I remember in college like I felt better about drinking this than i did like the other cheekier that happened to be around right or like a smirnoff ice which sometimes I kind of between would check I felt more sophisticated color yeah it has more than generous did the first time I Raven him across woodchuck was at someone's random halloween party was a sophomore or maybe a junior oh alright anyway we're doing alright whatever what does goes any further I say let's see what to say yeah alright donuts Kevin is it okay yeah we're bad you're the apple spice donuts that we made these are baked a low closer so the other take it on video babies yes so this is made with a relatively simple donut batter which will link in the description you've done a pan to make these mm-hmm so yes some flour sugar some spices of it then you add a half cup of apple cider yeah and now this is um that's a milk to right and and so by bikes by apple cider I'm that word at least here always conative Cana Tate's a apple juice that is not filtered it is opaque in charge made from pressed apples rather than juice apples sometimes that's worth mention because a lot of people say apple cider it may engage it yeah it may think something with juice or cider you know in the UK just means something with alcohol in it okay we're talking I'll go yes we're talking about a sweet side yeah so so it's okay as Ned Flanders on the Simpson said um clearing yellow wait Cleary God clearing yella you got juice their fellow opaque and brown your insider town so anyway he put a half cup of that the better anyway I remember it so nope some eggs then we we typed it into much better itself a little um more liquidy than you might think it should be because we made but dunce the past baked doughnuts that we're not this um runny of a better I guess but it worked out so then at the very end after we baked them you bake them for about we might those for 14 minutes it took about 14 minutes the recipe says tender came to 10 0 8 to 10 yeah that's the sleep slow for my oven anyway that's typically all this work so then then what I'm then you brush them with butter and you roll them in cinnamon and sugar and while brown sugar white sugar and cinnamon all right hey let's tradi hmm they're really late um I really like the topping mm-hmm I think it gets a little something but now I do wish the Apple came there's a little bit more but I think about eating it maybe I'll taste I think this this batter is bland enough that the apple cider shows through maybe you can adjust the recipe maybe a little less milk and a little bit more apple cider um I think that would be great I don't know they're they're real fluffy which is good they are the texture actually it's really nice um and when you like dip them in the topping it gives it a nice like heaviness um we're not having this but um their whites to eat I like the texture I don't know I'm trying to say but tone in it huh anyway they're good now remember their big donuts so they're not exactly like the dermis to have the story but what's nice is that even though they're baked they're different like it's like a recipe that's trying to be different rather than just the same as a fried doughnut only bake so that makes them like like something creative to try it makes it something worth eating while baked doughnuts normally like that wish I had a real doughnut you know I'm Sam you know like this these are nice hmm you should be an awesome treat to bring to your party or for breakfast free breakfast party hmm hmm ladies having a quest having a wedding shower for the fall or whatever I don't know yes no no yeah you also want you donuts all right i mean it's funny but I felt like the perfect shower to me what would you rate them hmm I think I'm probably the solid three and a half out of five I completely agree um this this Joe feels like it's really made for recipe like this thing sometimes we've made them before they catch is like pancakes almost like but these don't is these taste for the texture was off I think we baked them just enough and I like that they have a little like they're moist they're they're not like rubbery if you want to see more of a dinner recipes we did most of those in the spring season yeah we lost strawberry doughnuts we have two different strawberry kinds of doughnuts when we were so so on both look anyway these are great yeah giant recipes in the description alright so until next time tell your friends and we'll see you next week happy fall yeah", "La38oQjdyPw": "[Music] [Applause] hi there Craig here today we're going to make a hard apple cider okay so this is something that some of us have already done with cranberry juice and grape juice we've made in mate brew this is basically the same idea but it's called hard apple cider or hard cider it's actually found out how popular it is on YouTube when I went around looking to see do a little research make sure I have my facts straight a lot of people are making this now a lot of people do it from you know just by going out and getting a whole crapload of apples pressing them and getting the juice out of them and then you can use the skins from the apples to create a yeast because the skins from organic apples actually have the yeast you know bacteria on them so you can use those to actually activate the the brew just by putting the skins in but it's a it's a hit and miss thing if you happen to mistakenly wash the apples you wash off the the yeast spores and it won't work so we're just going to use regular baker's yeast okay I've got three cans of 100% pure apple juice made from concentrate and there's no preservatives in it the only other thing is a sorbic acid which is vitamin C okay on water alright so I've got the three cans of juice now I'm gonna do this on a small scale right now and if I like the results I might do a five gallon batch which would require probably about 23 of these cans these were 99 cents each it's one of the other reasons why I chose them because if I do want to do a larger batch doesn't gonna cost me you know 23 dollars plus the sugar so I've got the three cans of juice 1 litre each I've got a sanitized 4 liter jug to put this in okay because you need a room at the top I have an airlock fitted to a lid I have a whole crapload of sugar here at a measuring cup these are all sanitized I have a hydrometer which is sanitized have scissors and I have a can opener which is sat it's an ax ties Daz well so we're ready to go here so what are we gonna do well let's let's move on here let's take off the the airlock sanitized hope you can see everything here and we're gonna do here I think I'm probably just gonna I don't actually have like a you know a can opener like that I sort of have to rely on this thing I'm just gonna put a cut there I'm gonna cut here and then I'm just going to use the end of it here to make the hole bigger that's how we do it in this house now I don't know whether I'm gonna be able to pour this without spilling it whoops so we're gonna use the bottle here we go whoa okay so pouring the apple juice right into the container we're gonna use to ferment this in you with me so far can you handle this is this too much I can I can back up there's one make sure your cans of of apple juice are not cold you don't want them refrigerated and if you store them in the basement like I did it's too cold you need them to have to you need them to be room temperature I actually warmed them up even a little bit more I put them under some warm water for a little while you don't want them to be any hotter than any warmer than you know 85 degrees or whatever but on the on the back of this package a yeast it does tell you how to activate the yeast and it says to put it in a quarter cup of 100 degree water with a little bit of sugar if you want to try that that's up to you I didn't bother trying to keep things simple here but I've never done that before the other thing I need to talk to you about is a nutrient just in case there's not enough now this is this is pure apple juice but just in case there's not enough nutrient in the juice I'm gonna add a yeast nutrient now I have one that I've purchased which comes in the form of a powder but if you don't have access to that or are we here okay then what you're gonna have to do is create one and the way you do that is you put some raisins or some dates or both in a pot maybe a half a cup of water or a cup of water probably half a cup would be better I don't know just judge it and boil them up crush him same as what we did in the what I did in the in the inmate brew video don't go look for that video and you'll see what I did you just you just need some real fruit in here now this is a hundred percent apple juice so that's probably fine but I'm gonna play it safe and use just a tiny bit of yeast nutrient here you can try it without doing this so I'm I'm pretty sure it would work fine I didn't sanitize a spoon a little spoon to use for this here we are I'm just gonna take and sanitize this little spoon okay I'll just go in and get some of these here this is an eighth of a teaspoon okay I'm positive that'll be just fine probably too much but it won't hurt it won't hurt anything all right so that goes in and then I'm gonna I'm gonna start with I'm going to start with a cup of sugar this is corn sugar there's about a cup now I do have a sanitized thermometer so why don't we a thermometer hydrometer here that's there the hydrometer and the little tubing here tube thing here is sanitized so what I'm gonna do is use my funnel which has been sanitized as well and I'm gonna carefully pour some of this into here and we're just gonna see what the specific gravity is without whoops without anything added that's one point zero four two so you got about the strength of a beer here alcohol wise sure I've got the lid handy here so let's try this is probably gonna be wet now hmm anyway so I'll probably clog up on me but anyway let's uh slowly get this in there [Applause] okay so there we have a cup of sugar we're gonna shake that around and all this shaking is good for it because it puts oxygen in solution to help the yeast okay so we're just going to look and see if there's anything gonna sink at the bottom and then we're gonna do another hydrometer test okay little bit of sugar on the funnel it doesn't matter and very interesting now let's see what we've got one point zero six two I don't have my calculator with me here so I can't do the the math just a sec just I'm going to grab my other hydrometer here hydrometer has alcohol potential alcohol readings on it so one point zero six two turns out to be approximately nine percent alcohol what do you what do you think I think we're gonna drop in another another cup [Music] [Applause] [Music] separate the men from the mice on this one here we go okay now we've got one point zero eight zero so this isn't exactly gonna be yeah you know yeah that's that's great it's gonna be very strong but that's what I just want to experiment see what happens now finally we throw in our yeast something tells me not to put in the entire package because this is a lot of yeast for a little thing like this so I don't know Oh what the heck there once again I'm gonna give it a good shake and I'm gonna shake this and I'm gonna leave it for a few minutes and then I'm gonna shake it again okay so I'm gonna leave this for a few minutes we'll come back in a couple seconds we'll shake it again we'll finish this off okay here we are um it's been about ten minutes let's just see yeah there's still some yeast particles in there they'll uh they'll set up and if by tomorrow this isn't hasn't started yet I'll put this lid back on and I'll give it another shake but I'm reasonably sure with all that sugar in there in the East nutrient that we're not gonna have any trouble so let's take this off and put on the airlock apparatus nice and tight and we need some water and I always forget to get something to water in it with nowhere we go there you have it hard apple cider you can't get much easier than that I mean you could you could just buy it in a container like this and then just take some out and add the things to it but I couldn't find this type of apple juice in a large container like this where I shop so you know I just went with these tins but no no bother I mean it's it's gonna work and you can experiment with different yeasts you can use your favorite beer yeast at ale yeast you can use a champagne yeast that will suck more of the sugar out of it and you'll end up with the more a drier product unless sweetness to it the reason I'm doing it with just regular baker's yeast is because this can be found in the market the same with these okay and so this is something that anybody can do now I don't advocate underage drinking please do not go beyond your local laws only do this if you're of age I don't want to be responsible for any accidents please and again if you can't find the yeast nutrient which this isn't available in the supermarket get some raisins now raisins they have to be they don't have they can't have any sulfite on them sometimes they spray sulfite similar to the metabisulfite solution we use for sanitizing sometimes they spray some of that on the raisins to preserve them so I don't know how you can tell I the bag that I bought is I still here yeah sometimes I buy much on these on the ingredients it just says raisins and sugar so it doesn't mention sulfite so I assume let's assume they don't have me so get some raisins about a handful and if you can find dates we still got the dates you up there up there either or I use both because what the heck and just put them in a boat a cup of water in a pot and a little saucepan and just boil them up and as you're boiling them not boiling them up take a fork and just crush them get all the juices out of them and things out of them okay and then when you've got about half a cup of water left you know it's gonna reduce a little bit you'll see the water is all yellow and has the color of the raisins and the dates then just pour them through a sieve into your into your your apple cider or your apple juice but make sure it's not boiling hot when you do that make sure it's cooled down so you don't kill anything and that's that will help your your nutrient I have done this several times and it works like a charm okay it's just easier for me to get a hold of this stuff because I can but if you can't then that's what you do okay I do have a in mate brewing video down on my list somewhere it's not that too far shouldn't be too far down actually maybe I'll just put a link to it on the screen here so you can go and watch that it does have a similar process to this but using the raisins and dates for yeast nutrient so that's all thanks a lot for watching just one of another big chain of videos that I'm gonna put out check out my website Craig fairway

nearly apple pie oh my goodness please give it a try and you'll have health benefits unbelievable it also curves your appetite it's going to help with weight loss girls get it down I love it", "m1FHy1ljFrs": "[Music] the [Music]", "20XirhANhdQ": "kids tired of apple juice stick around [Music] all right here we go easy hard easy hard yeah why not easy hard apple cider I got two and a half gallons of juice here it's just juice and added vitamin C so you know nothing else has been done though it's been pasteurized but we'll be able to ferment this just fine and then if we want to boost it up a little bit I got some brown sugar here so let's let's put the juice in and we'll take it gravity reading and see see what's going to be with the juice alone [Applause] you can see why I'm normally on the other side of the camera I think we're gonna do this within five minutes I'm open that's how you get ants all right and then this is a spiced one so I figured we'll try a half a gallon of that in there and see see what that does that one's actually cloudy the other ones are pretty clear oh oh my goodness all kinds of neat stuff come out the bottom of that I should shut that up first yeah looks like it's all out of here all right so let's give this a quick stir I don't know that it matters all that much juice is probably what its gonna be and then let's take a reading everything has already been sanitized so don't worry about contamination here let's see what we got alright sure that'll drip on the floor eventually yeah 10:42 oh and I thought it comes around yeah 1042 1044 so I think definitely gonna give it a little more heat all right so let's put about I gotta write about three pounds here let's put about I don't know anything we got two and a half gallons of juice trying to get about two and a half pounds of brown sugar in there hope this dissolves without having to be warmed up because that won't be good [Applause] that's probably about two and a half yeah whatever it's not exact science all right see what we got here yeah kind of hard to stir it let's give it some power [Music] [Applause] [Music] smells good oh boy so like apple pie I'm gonna use I'm gonna use an ale yeast that's so four which tends to leave a little bit of sweetness so I might not have the back sweetness all right yeah there's no i'll hear any granules down there so we were at watt 10:42 with just the juice let's see what what the juice plus some brown sugar got us to you definitely floating higher all right see what we got oh I've been a little more than I wanted yeah we're at 1070 I call that 1076 so 1076 f gonna be right around 9% or so I don't have you that'll be pretty good all right I never set a timer I guess I should have done that if I was gonna see if I could do this in five minutes or not but all right a little bit of stars' and here said everything else has been sanitized already but that's it inoculate this with some yeast I'm gonna put the whole thing in there it's only two and a half gallons but is 1076 all right well don't know if we made it in five minutes or not but it certainly didn't take long so really easy simple smart outsider and I'll probably post this video before I taste it but anyway will will definitely come back and see what it tastes like and we'll go from there so make yourself some cider Cheers all right well this is still sitting here I wonder I think I missed something all right let's open the second yeast nutrient you know normally when you're making a beer you got plenty of proteins and stuff in there for the yeast to eat and well this doesn't have any of that this is just this is just apple juice and some sugar it's not really much to they'll eat at but they need a little boost something else to keep them healthy while they're eating that so anyway this is uh just a yeast nutrient it's a tablespoon per gallon so we're just gonna do three I'm sorry teaspoon not tablespoon not that I probably would hurt anything so all right there we go yeah I got all done and still had something left on the counter figure all that ain't good so all right we'll start us up put it back in fermenter a lid back on and and get it going so there you go Cheers [Music]", "uZv8mNR7qBM": "sup y'all it's like you just make them purchase my mouth alright so since I posted about it last night everybody's been asking me how am I making the apple pie Drake the first time I had this stuff was about a year ago and the when I first started drinking I was like man this is delicious yes can I have another glass and everyone's like where oh man slow down what you just drank is really really potent and I found out after two glasses in the yeah I was kicking my butt pretty good so I did some research look around a bunch of different websites there's no one way to make this stuff honestly everybody's got this idea or that idea and some people use this some people use that it's not rocket science you just kind of go with it so I kind of cobbled together what I thought were the best ideas that everyone had and come up with I wouldn't say this is my own recipe but you know this is how I make the stuff well you'll need are about two cups of brown sugar a one-pound box which is exactly 2 cups will cost you about a dollar 30 you'll need a cup of white sugar I already had the white sugar so I don't know exactly how much it cost but seriously shouldn't cost more than a couple bucks you'll need eight cinnamon sticks these cost about six dollars and they can come in either this plastic tube or in a white tin can you'll need one gallon of apple juice you'll buy these in half gallon containers for about five dollars each I try to avoid the concentrate you'll also need one gallon of fresh apple cider this typically cost about six dollars lastly the stars of the show you'll need about 400 milliliters of 190-proof Everclear you'll probably have to buy this in the 750 milliliter bottle for $16 and you'll need another 750 milliliters of spiced rum this will also cost you about $16 this will total about $58 and raw ingredients lastly you'll need a big ol pot which hopefully you already own and won't cost you any more turn on your biggest burner at its highest setting and put your big-ass pot on it pour in your apple cider and your apple juice here's a protip hang onto this plastic judge that the apple juice came in you'll need them later I like to check the height of the liquid with a wooden spoon we want to boil away about half the water and - dries it in the process so we want to reduce by half let's add some sugar and spice you'll put in about one cup of white sugar or two if you like it's super sweet you know mix it to taste add two cups or the entire box of brown sugar it'll be packed from being in the box so break it up a bit now you'll need about 8 cinnamon sticks take a note of how tightly curled they are as they boil the unroll which tells us that they're giving up their flavor as it heats up feel free to sample it it'll taste like heaven in your face hole now until it gets up to a full boil you'll want to start frequently I've found that the sugar tends to caramelize down at the bottom of the pot if you leave it alone so you know mix it up every 10-15 minutes what you got a good boil going reduce the temperature to about medium-high so you get a nice slow boil add about 2 to 3 hours of cinnamon 6 should have unrolled now as you can see it's reduced by about half of its original volume you'll turn off the heat let it cool off go ahead and fish out those cinnamon sticks now - once it's cooled off it's time to ruin that amazing aroma of apple pie with poison I use about 400 milliliters of Everclear and since I can only buy it in the 750 bottle it means I have to pour in a bit more than half of it and pouring the rest of your spiced rum entire bottle hey remember that amazing room about my pie that was in the air congratulations it now smells like napalm death this is normal do not be alarmed and remember those plastic jugs I asked you to hang on to now it's time to fill them up I've found that the easiest method is to pour the stuff into a pitcher and then pour that into the jugs if you and MacGyver can figure out a better method more power to you you might notice that the steam is coming out of it awfully quick that's the sign that I didn't let it cool off enough before I added the alcohol and started bottling it too much heat can really honestly kill the alcohol which makes this entire endeavor kind of pointless so make sure you let it cool off considerably and this method I'm using produces right about five quarts you'll want to put these in your refrigerator after a week the taste of alcohol will uh pretty much cry uncle to the apple flavor no tastes really good after two weeks though it tastes amazing you won't notice the alcohol at all but it's still there powerful Hellas hell I would actually wager you know and I don't really way of measuring this but I'd guess it's right around 120 proof it honestly could be even higher proof I don't know what I do know is that a single you know Red Solo Cup worth or blue whatever who cares about the color a single plastic cup worth of stuff is all you need to have a good night two cups and you will be plenty plowed when you're done you're gonna have a nice cloudy mixture you'll want to shake it up before serving it unless you like it looking a little pulpy I kind of do it kind of gives it an organic look but yeah it's really really shockingly good stuff I don't see any reason why you'd want to make it only in October I I'm making this stuff for a party coming up soon and it's just a coincidence that's happening in autumn all time etc it's good year-round leave it in the fridge for at least a week though for it to really reach its full flavor full taste now the first batch of this stuff that I made seemed to weaken after about 16 days in the fridge I don't know if it actually did or not I just know when we drank it after had been in there for ten days it was very powerful the batch from 16 days then seemed to be weaker I'm not an expert at stuff but hey maybe you are if you know a better method of making a stuff or you know anyway I can improve it because I would love to make a perfect batch let me know in the comments I guess at this point I'm supposed to ask you to like and share this video but who cares if you mix I'll let me know invite me out", "hw3fSqv0iwg": "hey there i am brian and welcome to episode 90 of first time cooking this this week uh well uh uh let me tell you what it is first it's that apple pie cider you saw in the the title but the reason i'm not doing a full production of this episode is is a is a mainly because of how how short it it is to to make and and what and what happened uh well during uh the making of it uh i will tell you uh what i mean by that area in just a minute this this this recipe as far as the the amounts of the ingredients is good for about nine servings or so and all you need is a four cups of apple juice four cups apple cider three four cups white sugar and two cinnamon sticks all you basically you have to do is just uh mix everything in a in a large large pot bring it to boil and then to take it off heat and then then let it cool completely and that's basically all there was to it so i saw no reason to have a cooking segment of just just uh that and but uh i made the mistake of of getting apple cider vinegar yeah you could probably tell uh uh uh it just did not uh work out too well i can uh still smell it i uh made it like let's see what time is it now about four hours ago and i can just still smell that uh that cider vinegar don't make my mistake get regular apple cider not the vinegar kind and i i did not bother uh getting the actual thing and then do it all over so i don't have anything to show for and i've already dumped out uh what i have made so you're gonna have to try to uh for yourself and see uh how does that taste and um that's uh pretty much it i uh apologize uh for the lack of uh the production uh but i i uh uh i hope you uh understand the reason of why so until next time see ya", "kg3XCCtNOVk": "hey guys welcome back to h-cubed has gone to pot and tonight for your viewing pleasure I give you instant pot apple pie moonshine let's get into it alright so first off we're gonna add 64 ounces of apple juice you know I got a rep migrated by you girl and also we're gonna add 64 ounces of apple cider to the juice we're gonna add 3/4 of a cup of white sugar 3/4 of a cup of light brown sugar and also a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice toss in four whole cinnamon sticks egg a brad star you are then going to saute just long enough for the sugars to melt before we pressure cook for 45 minutes 3:28 a.m let your pot naturally release for around twenty minutes just to walk in those flavors before you let the rest of the pressure out now you're gonna want to go ahead and fish out all of your cinnamon stick carcasses girl I was actually a little shocked at how they just fell apart and you want to let it completely cool before you add in your alcohol so living in southwest Colorado as I do I just stepped the [ __ ] on the porch and filed it with snow and now that our juice is chilled to room temperature we're gonna add a cup and a half of caramel vodka and a cup and a half of Everclear and as a little storytime bonuses I thought I would tell you guys that my great grandmother used to actually sell moonshine out of a false bottom baby carriage with my grandfather in it and baby you know my guys had thought of some cute little pint jars and throw some ribbon on it can't be half-stepping when I'm taking people my moonshine the stuff was honestly yummy got rave reviews thank you guys so much for tuning in until next time TTFN [ __ ]", "Zg9CpmL9XFo": "Yello okay well this cameras working so gentlemen all right no I haven't made a video in a long time because I haven't had much to say anyway I was thinking here since I've been making my wintertime mix for what I don't know if you know if this is commonplace around the country or whatever but you've heard of apple pie moonshine it tastes like apple pie to a degree it's made with Everclear a lot of people use Everclear which is a pure grain whiskey basically a moonshine and I don't know what's happened over the years with the taste of moonshine and I haven't made it with that in a long time but I remember from my 20s that moonshine wasn't that awful bad you know it had a pretty neutral taste and I decided this year that I wasn't gonna make a whole bunch of uh we're gonna here I wasn't going to make a whole bunch of you know the apple pie drink but I do like it in the cold weather a sipping drink like kind of like a brandy except it you don't do shots of it of course if you wanna you can but I don't and I bought some of this ghost tree moonshine and it said apple pie on it and it looked a little bit thin but you know it's a hundred proof and I figured okay you know I can do I can touch it up a little bit and I did touch it up and I did have a little taste of this stuff as it comes out of the bottle there or that mason jar and I'll tell you what a diesel fuel would taste a hell of a lot better very very awful tasting and and can't get rid of the goddamn case so anyway I made a couple of jars of the apple pie the way I make it with a cinnamon sticks in it you know and the apple cider and the apple juice and so forth so anyway I'm going back to my old recipe and I thought for the holidays here Christmas time and yeah I say Christmas even though I'm not religious but dammit uh I've celebrated Christmas all my life that's what we'll call it right Joey damn right he agrees with me all right so anyway let me give you the the kraut recipe here all right enough of green stop it what I do is I make I make a few mason jars I get these cheap mason jars at the dollar store I think for a case of them for a case of it's only about seven bucks or something like that and these hold two cups or for my metric friends 500 milliliters and basically I get one cup of apple juice and one spiced cider one cup of spiced cider and I will put two spoons eeep spoons of brown sugar in here and one heat spoon of regular white refined sugar and then I'll bring this to a simmer just get it hot enough to where everything melts in it then I take it off after everything's melted and then I add vanilla extract which I add two teaspoons of vanilla and that gives it the that gives it the ala mode apple pie a la mode you know you get that vanilla ice cream flavor and then I also use one teaspoon of almond extract and then basically I let let this cool down let it cool down all the way and then I will add 1/2 a cup of vodka and a half a cup of Picardy rum and mix that in there and after that once it's mixed up I'll fill these two mason jars up and I will put two cinnamon sticks into each one and the longer the cinnamon sticks stay in there the the better the flavor will get usually after 24 hours it's real drinkable it tastes real good it'll give you a nice warm feeling the that's good even drops oh this stuff is good a lot of recipes call for for boiling the cinnamon sticks and you know don't don't boil the alcohol because you'll burn all the alcohol off wait until everything's cooled down and make seven so anyway you can always expand on that recipe you know if you want to make more this is you know for the single guys out there that want to make this for themselves you know you can double up on it have a little bit more but it's a great wintertime keep warm thing that you know you like having a shot of it or whatever I usually carry a little flask around with me and you know if I'm out on the bike riding for a long time and I get cold and cooled down I'll I'll take just a little sip of it you know like I said this it's not really for for slugging it down like you would whiskey shot or anything like that so anyway give it a try I hope you know some of you guys might like that it's it's a good good drink good for keeping warm and feeling feeling nice and cozy during the cool times so I don't know if I'll make any more videos I probably won't for for a while just not much going on and I'm not interested in the the drama on YouTube and you know basically they've taken all the fun out of making videos anyway so I wish everybody a Merry Christmas and for those of you that don't call it Christmas well have a happy damn holiday and have a great new year be careful a lot of amateur drinkers out there on New Year's that you know if you can possibly do it stay put until New Year's stay you know when you can get sobered up a little bit there gonna be a lot of DUIs given out and you don't need a DUI so enjoy the new year but do it do it the right way in either case I hope and wish you all well be good", "cIRYc4eVRJc": "guys this drink is literally like drinking apple pie it is so good classy cocktail alright let's get into the recipe for this cocktail you'll need apple

today i have another keto donut recipe for you guys so i'm curious what's your favorite donut because mine is an apple fritter although i do love maple bars and i love those old-fashioned donuts too those are really good i just love all donuts but today i'm going to show you how to make one of my favorite donuts and that's the apple fritter we're going to be making keto apple fritters now before we get into this i know what you're thinking you're probably like apples are not keto and i know they aren't so we're actually going to be using something else instead of apples to make it an apple fritter we're going to be using zucchini believe it or not and if you're no stranger to the keto world you've probably seen other recipes that use zucchini in place of apples and if you're trying to make like an apple pie or like some sort of like apple turnover and it really works well i mean zucchini once you peel it it looks very similar to diced up apples and they have a neutral flavor so you could flavor it with some apple extract so that it ends up tasting like an apple and it works really well in this recipe and you won't even know the difference that you're actually eating zucchini instead of an apple now before we get started with this recipe don't forget to subscribe to my channel and make sure you hit the notification bell so you get notified every time i post a new recipe and if you're interested in other donut videos well click up here because i have a donut playlist for you guys so let's start with our zucchini first so i'm going to be using two zucchinis here you want to peel them up first just to get rid of that tough outer skin and then dice them up into really small chunks now after i diced up one i actually realized that probably one is plenty i don't really like to go overboard because i like more donut than i do apple in my apple fritters we're gonna add this to a small bowl and add a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice the lemon actually just helps brighten up the fritter plus it kind of mimics that sort of tartness that granny smith apples have [Music] we're going to set that aside and move on to our donut batter so in a medium bowl we're going to add in two cups of almond flour and then you're going to add in a half of a cup of whey protein powder and the protein powder that i always like to use is by perfect keto i love this stuff i use it all the time in my keto baking and i like using their products just because they're clean it has clean ingredients and lots of healthy fats in it they're actually who sponsored today's video so a big shout out to perfect keto if you guys are interested in trying their whey protein powders i'll have a good discount listed down below for you you'll also need three tablespoons of monk fruit blend sweetener or you could use a sweetener of your choice two and a half teaspoons of baking powder two teaspoons of xanthan gum one teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of cinnamon whisk that together until it's combined and then we're going to add in our wet ingredients so you're going to need a half of a cup of melted butter a half a cup of nut milk i'm going to be using macadamia nut milk a quarter cup of sour cream and a quarter cup of water you'll also need one egg we're going to mix this together until it's combined and then we're going to stir in our zucchini apples [Music] next comes the fun part and that's to fry these guys up so i have a skillet here and i'm going to pour in around 2 cups of avocado oil you could use whatever oil you want you just need to make sure it has a higher smoke point so lard works really good you could use duck fat but i'm going to be using avocado oil and then we're just going to plop down some of our apple fritter mixture you could use a cookie scoop or you could use a spoon and just plop it down in there it gives it that really irregular shape that's characteristic of an apple fritter cook them for around three or four minutes on each side just make sure you watch them so that they don't burn i have the heat set to around like medium close to medium high heat flip them when they start to brown on the underside and continue cooking once they're done take them out and let them sit on a paper towel just to catch up any additional leftover oil repeat that with your remaining batter and then we're going to make up the glaze to go on top so the keto glaze that we're going to put on top you want to start with a small bowl and we're going to add a half a cup of powdered erythritol three tablespoons of heavy cream and two teaspoons of vanilla extract and another option is to add a little bit of melted butter to this i've added around two tablespoons of melted butter before and it really makes a buttery keto apple fritter it's really good but today i'm just gonna stick with the heavy cream the vanilla and the confectioner's erythritol we're going to mix this together until it's smooth you can even add it into the microwave to get it a little bit more melty and drippy and then just drizzle all over your keto apple fritters these are so great i love them in the morning with a cup of coffee it's just like one of the best breakfasts you could ask for so if you guys are missing apple fritters on the keto diet you definitely need to make this recipe thanks again to perfect keto for sponsoring this video make sure you check out my other donut videos down below and thanks for watching guys don't forget to subscribe have a good one [Music] bye", "L5S2IbDB0EY": "moonshine apple pie 2016 for Christmas we start off with some fresh pressed apple cider actually use two gallons of that and this was a gallon jug of moonshine we had to buy a gallon and split half of it with a friend in order to get it at a decent price so I started with a half gallon jug I guess about here and we've used that much to have a gallon jug of shine yeah got a beat on it and then we put in some special seasoning and spices and later something nine quart jars of apple pie make the seasoning spice is what we did was took two gallons of cider a little apple pie spice a little nutmeg brown sugar cinnamon sticks brought it all to a boil and got it nice and syrupy and then we let that sir cool and then we took that syrup set it aside let it cool to room temperature and we took their liquor and we measured five ounces of liquor and every jar that's pure liquor now we're talking 190 proof put five ounces in each jar filled it up with the juice put it in the fridge and then a little whatever we've got left I put together this here pie that do a good job try to that we're gonna put it in the oven and that'll be our Apple pad it goes with apple pie moonshine apple pie bye", "5pLG2yw11nI": "we're making a drink today it's Friday we like fridays i tried drinks and i saw on pinterest every Friday and then I decide if they're good or not and if they're good then I finish them and if they're not they get sent to my husband the drink we're trying today is called a sparkling apple pie cocktail I thought this drink looked beautiful and classy in its wine glass and you know it's just we've reached that part of the season where it's time to say goodbye to the ghostly creepy things and hello to the autumn leaves and pumpkin and apple things and cranberries that's the season we're in now so we're gonna embrace it I trace this drink back to the kitchen is my playground Tracy I think this looks delightful I'm glad the kitchen is your playground and today you're making the kitchen my playground this is that see how this the internet crazy to make this drink we're going to rim our wine glass with honey and cinnamon and sugar and I'm loving this drink already we're gonna add apple cider cinnamon schnapps I don't have cinnamon shops but i do have firewall like any good hostess will be using fireball whiskey in our drink today I think it's tasty we're gonna shake it up we're gonna pour it into our beautiful wine glass we're going to pop our champagne bottles look how tiny and cute it is they sell these in little individual packages you know just in case you want to celebrate by yourself and then we're gonna top our drink off with our shipping with the twist off oh it's a twist-off oh that is so much less anxiety driven cheers to me there's something I can really appreciate about the honey that's dripping down the side losing with cinnamon and sugar it's really pretty it's really beautiful in pictures they think a lot of people just pin things that have something using over the tops like overflowing with deliciousness I don't want to touch it but I like the look of that wow that's very different than anything we've had before I don't like it I like the honey it does taste like a sparkling apple pie who would have thought that that could be a thing a sparkling apple pie and yet here it is in my hand tasting exactly just like that this is the kind of cook option that you bring with you to your mother's house when she's notorious for serving apple pie and you don't like apple pie so instead you're like you know what mom I'm gonna go ahead and skip the apple pie I'm gonna I'm just gonna make one of my concoctions but stay all of ice cream for me the only thing this is missing mmm I am definitely gonna recommend the sparkling apple pie cocktail to you this weekend it was not hard to make at all this as long as you have the ingredients it would be a pain to go by at all but worth it definitely worth it enjoy your weekend cheers to all of us", "WK0dv2onoAQ": "[Music] and welcome back

want notifications to come to your email of what I do an upload please click the bell it's a little notification bell so that way you'll be sure to never miss a new cocktail video now that we're done with all the business end let's start making a drink with him so I'm on a roll my last video was all about making a summertime Aperol spritz into more of a fall flavored beverage well today I'm staying on that track today I'm taking another classic cocktail and giving it a full makeover if you will now I love these cocktails the classic version of them and I like doing different variations so I was pretty excited to make a fall version of this drink and what we're doing today is we are making an apple pie Moscow Mule you heard that right apple pie and the Moscow Mule it's got to be good right also I leveled the Kentucky mule which is basically the same ingredients as a Moscow Mule but interchanging bourbon so today I'm putting my own twist and I'm making apple pie Moscow Mule and also what's more far than Apple's I guess you could say pumpkins but apples are a big fall staple so why not have an apple drink themed cocktail so now less talking more drinking let's get started this drink is very easy can be made just like that and I'm about to show you how so I've got a Moscow Mule ma betel nut filled with ice there you go next up I'm gonna take two ounces of good apple cider not apple juice there's a difference apple cider as you can see is a little cloudier it has cinnamon and clove and spices in it I really love the Trader Joe's version but if you have one that you love feel free to use it so we're gonna do two ounces of apple cider you can already like smell the pie vibe going on with just the apple cider alone so now we've got that and now for the fun part instead of using vodka I'm using apple pie moonshine now you could use apple flavored vodka they do have them out there but I just thought like moonshine would be way more fun and more like warming on one of those chilly fall nights so let's get ahead go ahead and put in 2 ounces of apple pie moonshine and this stuff does pack a kick so just know that you were forewarned quick 2 ounces there we go now after that we're gonna add the classic newel ingredient ginger beer so this is where it stays on course with the normal Moscow Mule and we're just gonna fill the glass up which in your bear up to the top that's about it and I'm gonna stir really lightly just to combine everything so that all the flavors are melded and you don't just get a layer ginger than a layer of apple so there you go little cop next we're gonna garnish with a cinnamon stick so this will let people know that there's some cinnamon spice going on and a cute little slice of apple and there you go you have an apple pie Moscow Mule this is gonna be perfect for watching football cuddling on the couch with your boo or even just because it's Tuesday afternoon who knows but I'm sure you're going to enjoy it so let's give this a try oh it feels good and it does taste like liquid apple pie and you would think that the ginger would overpower everything but it just adds like one more layer of warmth and depth and really kind of gives this drink a good like hit of spice so I highly recommend if you love Moscow mules then you are going to love the apple pie version so here's to fall and here's to good times and good drinks cheers everybody [Music]", "5nslwW8z-_A": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you", "WjI0exCE2dU": "hi I'm Keeley also known as Kelly and I'm feeling also known as Alex welcome to our corner of the Shire we will show you how to bring middle-earth into your daily life to keep you a happy Hobbit welcome to this episode of happy hobby today I'm going to show you how to make home brewed hard apple cider now we all know that hobbits love their food but they also have a great passion for the brewing of ails this cider is also wonderful because instead of cane sugar I'm going to be using honey which is going to give it a little bit more of a meat taste so you know the dwarves in your life are going to go crazy for it I'm sure men will like it too and else probably won't even be able to turn it down which I'm counting on because this cider is going to be served at my next Hobbit party to start with I've already sanitized all the utensils that I'm good mean for brewing including this five gallon food grade brew bucket now yeasts can be found everywhere in our environment and the important part of the sanitization process is that you are trying to prevent wildlings from entering your group because it can alter its flavor sometimes for the better but oftentimes for worse and it's just a wild card that you know most people who brew at home don't really want to deal with so you make sure you sanitize everything that's going to be touching your liquid what I'm going to do first is start my yeast so what I've done is I've taken some of the apple juice and heated it up now you don't want it to get over 100 degrees because that will kill the yeast which are actually microorganisms the yeast are going to consume the sugar in the fruit juice and the byproduct of that process is is alcohol and so that's how the chemical process of it works so I'm going to add these to my apple juice and then stir it up that I'm going to let them sit while I do the rest of the brewing process so that this way I know that the yeast is active and it's starting to do its thing if you're not brewing for a large group of people an alternative is to take a one gallon jug like this and pour out a cover to of of the juice and brew straight in the bottle the benefit of that is that it's glass and clear and you can actually wash the fermentation process happening the only thing you'll need to do is create a stopper for the top so that the gas can be let out in increments but if you are interested in trying different recipes and experimenting I think that getting a one gallon bucket or container is the way to go because then you don't have a massive amount of cider if it doesn't go well I've had our 5 gallons of apple juice sitting out in the Sun all day so that they'll get nice and warm you don't want them too hot because that will damage the yeast but if they're warm it's easier for the process to start especially when you're adding honey you can make alcohol without adding sugar honey but by adding this it's going to increase the alcohol content and make it more of a cider so I'm adding two pounds of honey I've also had this sitting out in the Sun so as you can tell it's nice and like we poohbear would be jealous so it Bjorn actually wonder poohbear knows the owner of the or nose poo they might be relatives I don't think the phrase Bjorn knows poo is allowed I'm stirring up the mixture after I've added the honey and I'm gonna add the second everything about honey sometimes I buy it from the farmers market and I just eat it with a spoon this is kind of difficult for me right now to restrain myself maybe I'm part bear or a lot there most recipes want you to use unpasteurized apple apple juice but that's really difficult to find and so we may do with pasteurized apple juice and if you're going to use pasteurized is best to use cold pasteurized but I have no idea how this was pasteurized because I don't know the dude who made it so I'm just going to see what happens and I'm going to do it like this so now it's time to add the yeast mixture this is just yeast mixed with apple juice that was warmed up a little bit and I'm going to add it and this will start the fermentation process usually takes about two weeks for the fermentation process to occur and you should let it sit at least another week after that so you can in theory have home brewed cider in under three weeks so it's mixed up unfortunately I don't have something long enough to touch the bottom and I don't have sanitary fingers so now you put on the airtight lid which is anyone who sell a wine episode knows isn't exactly my best friend more this is gonna be a repeat opposite style okay everyone knows flashback episodes oh yeah they're everyone's favorite you guys just saw it didn't happen okay so this is how you put a little on you put it down on the ground and use your palms and you snap it into place I really hope that all the Hobbit to come to your party including the horse appreciate what you've done all that's left is to put in the airlock which will help you monitor help the gas get out and help you monitor the brewing process then agitate this as much as you can there you see gas is already escaping then you want to store this in a cool dry place a dark place preferably usually around 60 degrees and let it sit there for the duration of the time that you're brewing and when you're done well you have a party hope you learned something thanks for watching kids adults orbs elves men hobbits works Eric I goblins and hello it's dope given that this is apple juice I don't think that's appropriate awkward adults it's better be some good whoa that's floating in their pasties when in doubt just make stuff up I saw some sediment in our cider and I don't want it in the final product so I'm just trying to put on this coffee filter maybe it won't work and we won't use any of this punished but if it does you'll learn the new happy Hobbit secret this is called Julie completely forgot that you can't just like pour it up so you can eat it or drink it rather and so she's trying to come up with alternate means several minutes later after dogs try to drink no you guys you alcoholic you you I hope you've enjoyed this episode and that you've learned a little bit about brewing and maybe are excited to try it yourself because as you can see and as our ancestors knew it's very very simple so please drink responsibly which means drinking with dwarven supervision but if the doors are all passed out present alban supervision good nope wizard supervision honey all over me hobbled using my hair Bilbo mane that's what I heard I hope you've enjoyed this episode and that you learned a thing or two about brewing and remember always drink we drink with farts ha ha ha ha but why is the rum gone yeah Thorin okay dr. Pacey go is a pictures so soon all right welcome to this episode of happy table today I'm gonna teach you how to make home out okay welcome to this episode of happy profit today I'm gonna be showing we're going to try to take off your finger welcome to this episode of happy Hobbit today I'm going to be showing you how to make hard apple cider now I'm brewing this because I happened to have a special birthday coming up where I'm leaving one decade and entering the next which is kind of a scary thing so nothing to make it easier than a little you know little something golden and delicious oh my god you look like you're dying look at her she's a drunk a honey dry clean oh he popped also apparently want to try some cider hello sweeties how kind of all wrinkly and treating that man she likes me better they're a hater come on go beer and sadness go back you think they're in dual we'll want some I already told him cuz last time about the wine he was like oh I hope you're making some more he took all four bottles and left me one he's not getting this this is for my holiday party guess what he's not vited someone's getting a little racial here hobbit party Noel to me about racial well what are you hobbit chores oh no you know not to ask that question if you know anything about housing or but you know you don't ask what race we are it's rude you can't just come up to someone and ask what race they are", "YD19Bz7C_MU": "lay German fellow alcohol enthusiast welcome today we're looking at old smokey moonshine apple pie now moonshine has a long history in America and is known by many names including White Lightning white liquor Mountain Dew didn't know that one chopped hooch homebrew and shiny sheeni no shiny shiny shiny suni anyways white whiskey and mash liquor moonshine was especially important to the Appalachian area the moonshine most likely entered the Appalachian region in the late 18th century to early 1800s Scotch Irish immigrants from the Providence of Ulster North Ireland brought their recipe for uske baare Gaelic for water of light busca bah I think that's how you say it again I want to know I should get that printed somewhere I love that story about the Tim Flynn again again water of life the settlers made their whiskey without aging it and this is the same recipe that became traditional in the Appalachian area on the side note D Irish Scottish areas that lived in the Appalachia as what a term hillbilly came from again the a typical stereotypical Americans just always again have a idea that every Scot Irish Papa the name William they're for Billy they lived in the Hills and the names were Billy I eat Hill Billy so that's where that comes from further stealing from Wikipedia moonshine was originally a slang term for high proof distilled spirits usually produced illegally without government authorization which is what government anyways in recent years however moonshine has been legalized in various countries and has become a commercial product legal in the United States since 2010 moonshine is defined as a clear on which key typically made with corn mash as its main ingredient the stuff they sell today is not the moonshine of legend it's because again that stuff was almost pure alcohol the what 100 and 90-proof is the high as you can go it was essentially these guys are just making pure alcohol and selling it there is no distilling no and essentially now they have to abide by the law now it's far less strong and it's again more flavorless stuff it's just a type of whiskey now essentially so it's a nonage whiskey is the big difference old smokey is the moonshine I've been drinking the most especially the pumpkin pie flavor they make many other flavors well-liked and again they break this up they make a hundred proof stuff which I haven't seen good old white lightning peaches which I wonder if I can cook with those peaches saying with the strawberries that make a really good pie or blend it anyways and then some you know seasonal stuff original Harley Davidson chocolate cherries mixing in flavors 60 to 100 proof the apple pie a fruit punch which I've tried before on this channel lemon drop strawberry orange I want to try peach blackberry apple pie my pumpkin pie which I need suck up on margarita that just seems redundant Mountain Java margarita again pina colada and getting stuck in the rain [ __ ] a shine nog well that's interesting a sweet tea sweet Thai sea butterscotch lemon tea shine they're just making up words now butter pecan blackberry cobbler grape ooh luau some beach and oatmeal cookie oh come on who oatmeal cookies are evil Buckeye and real-deal which actually looks to have ooh I love dill brine so anyways that might be interesting anyways but yeah so a lot of different flavors I haven't seen all of these but again these down here our very low alcohol content but high in flavor now early on when I started seeing moonshines for sale like cherry strawberry so I assume because traditional moonshine you can make and they usually do make using whatever fruit they have again it says usually it's corn mesh but I've seen them do it with strawberries and various fruits essentially they can make it out anything because again you make alcohol out of anything that molds are ferments so I assume maybe they're making moonshine a strawberry but no they make a traditional whiskey out of the cornmeal whatever they corn mash rather and whatever they have and then they flavor it after the fact they don't flavor it while the fermenting it or using the flavor of the or using said flavor rather to ferment so that was a bit of a disappointment but today anyways we are trying there apple pie and what's more American than apple pie well turning into alcohol and getting drunk off it merica we're still trying to figure out how to turn baseball into an alcohol and we're here sorry that was a bit long of a intro because again moonshine is one of those things were always heard about in myth and legend and backward backwater places backwater back road places well moonshine in the East in the West here they especially in the Indian reservations they have a lot of home brew guys that doing bathtubs and stuff but it's not called moonshine but still anyways that's a whole nother story altogether so today we are trying as we see here lovely lovely and us how to focus for some reason apple pie moonshine and I thought well first I thought I'll do it in the espa\u00f1a shot glass just be ironic but let's do the traditional America route 66 because again what's more American than route 66 and apple pie again turning into alcohol again you can't turn route 66 in the Apple into alcohol they've tried but again before I've tried fruit punch that's what this one was and that was pretty good not as fruitful as I thought it might have been too bad the labels off on that one man that's filled to the brim but I wonder how much alcohol that had because then this has 35 even though the website said it was in the 40 this is 35 and the pumpkin pie that I love so much right here all smoky is a 20% alcohol so this extremely weak but extremely flavorful there again you mix this with cream soda you have one damn good drink light drink good drink so this is gonna spill a lot cuz that's it you know what let's go with plan a shall we now it's too late anyways so here we go gently let's smell it slightly off apple juice is what it smells like like apple juice but there's something else there I can know that smell of something else but it's off-putting hmm yeah it's um I know it's the whiskey that they mixed in with the Apple or what have you look what fell from my hand it was but it's slightly just bad apple juice mixed with something that your brain tells you no feet kind of feed smelling huh interesting like bad feet smell anyways so but yeah here's to uh still figuring out how to turn baseball into alcohol here's to the American Way here we go sweet okay goes in the initial taste is two layered bottom bulk is sweet apple taste apple jam Fig Newton apple jam kind of that layer stuff so that kind of in them Trina Fig Newton that kind of thing anyways on top of it is this just warmth that's just very light on top as it comes and that goes up through your nose a little bit but it's very like very mild the bulk of it goes right down your throat this sweet Fig Newton apple pie taste goes down tart is what you taste so like you have the apple sweet taste but there's a little bit of tart taste that's why I'm thinking Fig Newton because there's me fig new annoys a little tart taste on the end of it and I raised my P cuz I'm classy anyway but yeah so the aftertaste is Apple tarnish that's an interesting phrase Apple tardes is that like a doctor who villain made out of apple crates anyways but yeah I know you have an apple tart aftertaste is what you get so that's extremely good for was it 35% again that's was it 40 proof 70 proof excuse me so again that's 35 for comparison our standard whiskey here which is Bushmills is 40 proof which is then Wayman you were where are you 70 proof no that's 40% alcohol scuse me scuse me so 30 35 40 only 5% more alcohol and this and this went down smooth as a baby's behind I guess I was trying to think something clever that didn't sound bet but yeah again that went down amazingly smooth and tasted amazing I'm sold that's not too bad again my first recommendation on that is to mix it with well fireball or catch fire this is 30 percent alcohol so again this is candy like cinnamon bears candy cinnamon sweet mix that with this sweet apple pie taste and you'll probably get diabetes but it'll be delicious diabetes Wow RA slurring anyways that's really good I'm actually surprised because again the fruit punch wasn't that great tasting but that was pretty good now I have one more let me see if I can get it here here is I bought the white lightning which is kind of their standard imitation of moonshine the traditional moonshine and it's a hundred proof so this is going to be knock your socks off is what it's supposed to be and again I found out the highest possible alcohol is every clear 190 so interesting interesting sorry was all that aside that was extremely good I'm amazed and surprised by that that's actually really good tasting it's actually unlike most flavored alcohol it actually lives up to what it's supposed to taste like so I need to figure out a new place to do this rather than my dirty kitchen oh well whatever no one's watching if you are watching take a shot of that like button yeah drink it down throw the shot glass at the Bell I don't know I'm not clever enough to come up with something anyways do whatever you want I suggest maybe get a drink or two and relax have a nice day but thanks for watching see you next time merica [ __ ] yeah we turn all symbols into alcohol merica [ __ ] yeah drinking drunk off American spirit actually works it's a dream that we all share the hangovers tomorrow [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] yeah I can't write a song man I should just list all the flavors hold on apple pie [ __ ] yeah blackberry [ __ ] yeah peach [ __ ] yeah anyway strawberry mango margarita [ __ ] yeah Mountain Java", "xteECcFo6Qw": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hot apple pie now when it gets cold out there is nothing better than either spiced cider or a hot toddy to warm you up as a matter of fact I had one last night and it's delicious we wanted to do a very simple version here and so we're gonna combine just three ingredients this is an easy one you can do at home any time first foremost we're gonna grab some cinnamon cordial now this is one of those time for quality ingredients to really make a difference in a drink all right strongly recommend trying to make this at home if you've got the time instead of using powdered cinnamon you just grab a few cinnamon sticks you buy them at the store boil with water until they take on that nice dark color and then mix it with equal parts sugar and what that's going to do is it's not only going to give us a little bit of sweetness to take the rough edges off of our base spirit but it's also gonna bring in the spice that allows you to really flavor up the cider that you're adding without having to buy whole mess of spices so instead of the typical clove nutmeg cardamom allspice you can just go straight to the cinnamon and keep it nice and smooth and flavorful all right next we're gonna add our whiskey this is a hundred percent corn whiskey aside from being absolutely delicious and making a fantastic toddy it also comes in a really cool encampment [Music] that's but not least you want a good hot cider we're just gonna pour that right in go and for aromatics we can take one last cinnamon stick rind it over the top now if you're doing this at home one thing you can do I love this is to just take your cinnamon stick and use it to stir the drink yourself and as you enjoy it all that flavor is gonna come in and really warm it up and that's the hot apple pie [Applause] [Music]", "wFQJoPOjAqM": "[Music] what's going on everybody welcome to chop and brew I am chip Walton last episode of chop and brew we showed you how to make hard cider at home using fresh pressed apple juice in this episode we're stepping it up a notch and we're showing you how to make ice cider for those of you don't know ice cider is a rich and decadent dessert drink made by freezing either apple cider or actual apples slowly thawing them to collect a high gravity and concentrated must and then fermenting that our guide through the process of making ice ciders our good friend Jeremy Olson he's won numerous awards for his eyesight errs and has traveled to Quebec which is the motherland of ice cider to learn from the professionals about how they make ice cider and bring that process back to his home ice cider II real quick before we get the episode roll and I want to give a quick shout out to just a few of the world wide network of choppin brew patreon patrons this week I'm looking at you Andy Carter Bayley o Kittel Frederik Valen hang and Julian chill your ongoing support keeps the party going for chop and brew if you want to join them patreon.com slash chop and brew get some cool rewards get some cool bonus stuff and just help us keep this going but it is now time for the ice cider [Music] we're here with Jeremy Olson dr. Jeremy Olson this year are you a doctor of ice cider not yet but if someone offers that degree maybe we'll have to look into that a couple years down the road I think dr. Jeremy Olson were in Minneapolis he's a member of the st. Paul home brewers Club and he has some pretty sick credentials that justifies him schooling us on ice cider tell us tell me about some of your awards sure I've been making I Center for the last several years I've won first round I'm first round NHC and also second round the NHC two years ago I got a first-place medal there won best to show the Minnesota State Fair last two years in a row for my ice cider and a couple other regional competitions as well so it's been a it's been a fun ride the last couple of years learning the style and entering in competitions and and drinking it as well he's invited me over to start the process of an ice cider in his basement we've got a couple of commercial examples we're gonna for dessert we're gonna drink some of these gold and other metal award-winning your gold in 2015 you said was your first know the first year I made nice cider man it turned out well I got good feedback from the club entered it in one Gold at national upper conference so so tell me a bit cow the process is it difficult sure it's not difficult it's just time consuming and you have to have a little bit of space you know freezer space and in time just to let this happen so the basic process of an ice cider think of it as an iced wine except you're making it with with cider obviously instead of grapes and so my basic process is freezing solid apple juice I get fresh juice for our local orchards here and the twin cities freeze it solid then you let it just slowly thaw my basement runs about 55 degrees right now in the winter so I let it thaw 8 gallons 9 gallons and take me about 12 to 16 hours to thought it'll look like snow cone in the middle to speed how you slept over all the color will dry up that's all the sugar and the flavor that's that's being thought off first and you want to get a really nice concentrated run off and that's what you're going to ferment and so what you're doing is you're removing by this process you're removing all of the water essentially or most of the water leaving you with the concentrated apple sugar mixture so starting with 8 gallons I'll end up with a gallon and a half to 2 gallons of runoff I shoot for a certain gravity of at least 30 bricks 30 to 35 bricks is a good starting point for for your fermentation you can see some of that concentrated juices melted melted away I thought ah and now it's just gonna be juices and sugars melting off of the water leaving ice behind it's kind of a big center block of ice that will remain in in the container here so it's kind of like when you're running off a match as far as a homebrew analogy the volume you need to be a little less strict on it's more about hitting a number correct of fermentable yeah correct you know you can't shoot my volume you have to shoot by by your sugar content if you start at less than 30 bricks it's not gonna be a nice delicious thick cider and you're not gonna have enough sugar left over when you stop fermentation so you you want you want to shoot by gravity if you have kind of a lower gravity cider like what I did early this spring I'm sorry early this fall it was certain grounds only 1038 so I didn't get as much grabbed yeah for that there's much runoff of that and the char like 43.9 bricks versus later in the falls are called by satyrs 1048 so I'm just going to be able to get more volume from that the key is you can't push it you can't try and get a little bit more dilute and hopefully you're gonna make it through because it's not gonna turn out the same in the end you get what you get you get what you get yes you get what the apples give you and then you said a couple of times you've kind of let it thaw completely after getting what you were gonna use just to experiment tell me about what's left behind in that siggy to 7 gal yeah yeah you know big like I slushy just left over a big solid chunk of ice that's left over and my I used my mash tuns as a bottom outlet and what I let it thaw completely once and I think the gravity was about 10 10 to 10 15 so there's very little sugar left of that beer blowing yeah you're really extracting all the sugar and the apple flavor out of it to use for your fermentation so what kind of yeast and like what kind of massaging does this take to happen i I use when I need 71b as my go-to I've experimented with a couple other as well I know a lot of the Quebec Center makers where this style originated in the late 1990s use champagne yeast so you want a white wine yeast that's going to be able to ferment something that's high beer use just won't they won't start it's it's too concentrated for the beer yeast so a nice white wine east fermented cool fermented log so you get all of the nice apple flavors fruit flavors that come from this and not a lot of the alcohol flavors that could come from the yeast so at that point is it similar to doing a mead as far as the timing what you're looking for even the aging or does this kind of come together quicker than a mead might I think a lot of respects is this firm it's very similar to most of my meats as well I found with ice cider I can just do a single nutrient addition at the beginning at some firm a toe hit it with a minute of oxygen pitch my yeast make sure you always start your yeast if you're using the dry yeast use go firm to rehydrate your yeast because you want healthy yeast but it's gonna be a long slow fermentation so I haven't done staggered nutrient additions like I do with my meats and they turn to that cider so it turned out really well so and you said I'm mistakingly assumed earlier this was a centuries-old tradition this is 1990s 1990s and Quebec sort of a domain niche is one of the first orchards and Satre east to starting style so so relatively new style there are a few us center makers that are starting to do this but primarily these are coming out of Canada they're different based on the style of I Centreville that we can talk about a little bit as we drink a couple of these commercial examples but really you want that really just nice rich deep apple which we get out of this for sure you uncorked it and it instantly just like fill this whole area mm-hmm rich apple yeah you sometimes get a little bit of that cooked apple apple pie not in the apple pie spice but just kind of that apple pie cooked flavors from it sometimes a little bit of caramel or the dried fruits from it what do you definitely not want from it and you have ones you've had what you don't so you don't want this to smell like alcohol because it's supposed to be just think of this as a sweet dessert drink okay so you don't want to smell like alcohol you don't want it to smell like just raw apples and some some tend not to have a lot of aroma when we met right later maybe we won't have as much the Roman can vary but it needs to be a kind of that just really clean fermentation characteristics as well so you don't want to get green apple so you know aldehyde out of this you don't want to get yeah alko I think alcohol be the big thing is it shouldn't be a booze bomb if it's done that you'd fermented it too long it's not it's not an apple all right it's not a nice wine anymore and I said the ABV range I don't think we throw that out there yet it's no 9 to 9 to 12 you have many of the quacks Quebec styles are 10 to 11% you can do less if you make a sparkling especially if you're going to kind of naturally carbonate it in the bottle it's obviously gonna be a little bit less ABV but tender lumber sense a good starting point so for those of you doing the math of starting grabbed me in any gravity that you're in a spear ending gravity really honestly should not go below ten fifty to go below ten fifty there's not enough residual sugar it's gonna be thin it's gonna be alcoholic it's not going to be this really Pleasant rich complex drink that we have here and I absurdly asked earlier might you have to back sweeten your eyes cider sure well obviously you could if you want to but really with the final gravity with 1050 plus yeah so so with good for slow fermentation you're east may just stop and eyeball that point and if you're used to stop my recommendation is to let it be don't try and reap itch because then if you get a new healthy yeasts that start going it's going to go well below where you want it to be so I generally follow mine starting at about a month out see where it's at check the gravity and check my taste and honestly I stopped mine based on taste more than the gravity and it's never gonna go too low we might be ready for a second example but tell me the process of this one versus our second sample sure this one from domain age is a nice area that they make primarily for some restaurants in Quebec can I sell their store as well which is where I bought it this one uses northern spy golden russet and McIntosh apples as their apple varieties here and this variety is gonna be juice that's frozen naturally outside and then they thought in the exact same process that I what are the clock cryo this is called cryo concentration I'll concentrate crown concentration is yours concentrating the sugars in the juice through freeze and then thought process and then the next one we're back with another example here so this one was made very different correct so this is from a different side and Quebec do Manoa pardon my french so this is called cryo extraction and this variety of Ice Center is made by leaving the apples to freeze solid whether on the tree or picked in just in totes and then they're crushed and pressed well frozen what month would this happen well January February when they're solid so then doesn't leave them on the Cortland apples in particular all right natori no one for staying on the tree they'll stay on the tree after the after a freeze and they can just pick them off the tree and below zero weather and oppress them other apples can be picked and you're stored until they're frozen and and by doing it this way they can control the sugar content very carefully the colder that the Apple is when they press the more sugar less water they'll get that warm up a little bit there's me a little bit more available water when they proximately a little bit lower sugar content this is so different yes this tastes so the first thing we notice right is it's darker this is distinctly darker example that we had Canton just like so much like it's this weird mixture of brown sugar and green great yeah it's just like not even all that Apple you know it's not as sweet I definitely get a much sweeter aroma to it I agree that kind of that that brown sugar almost kinda like a candy and not a girl's candy a good candy won't ever go into it you know we drink this it's not as thick you know the mouthfeel business thick is that for a sample that we had I think that's actually just a cider cider ii difference and not a style difference because in reality much the juice is this collective is ferment to the same so this is just a style difference this to have I get a little bit more of the tannins in the acidity from the sample than I do from from the first sample one of the keys and Center making is that balance between alcohol acidity and tannin so those are the kind of three basic things that you want to you know to balance well I'm a sweetness when you picking your Apple blend you don't want to do a blend that's all crabapples because you can get so much acidity in 10 once it's concentrated it's not going to be a very drinkable drink and you don't want a lot of pure you know bitter sharps or you know lower cider apples because you can get so much you know the tannins in there as well that it's not going to be a good drinkable Center you can't I've never needed to but you could adjust your cider after fermentation if you needed a little acidity or tannin to it to help balance it or you know if you want to balance the sweetness a little bit cut down on that you could add some acidity or tannins but it's not necessary and I never needed to do that why call that I don't know that's where this place nice are they started they made it so now it's cold I mean you know it's cool to make a lot of cider threes naturally there's a lot of orchards there so they like their apples on their centers and now it's ice cider is actually a protected domain name for this type of cider from Quebec and there's very specific guidelines of how these need to be made to qualify as a nice cider the guidelines are very there's not a lot it's pretty straightforward it's basically that the orchard that girl's a apples needs to produce the cider it needs to be naturally cold for so frozen you know in the winter you can't save apples till summer and then put it in a big industrial freezer you can't back sweeten or add other sugars she can't you can't add sugars ahead of time for the fermentation between ice cider and maple syrup I think I could live in a little poutine as well on the side for it so we're here with the first and the older of the two dr. Olsen ice ciders mm-hmm this was my 2015 the first I Center ever made and this is the one that won first place and the final round of the national hunger conference all the way not quite all the way not Center maker of the Year Oh still close yeah yeah it was a it was a good year is it a category all to itself or do you just win the cider category there you have the best there's to the standard ciders are like new world cider English cider French cider the new world Perry and traditional pears so kind of like more of mr. standard setters different styles then there's a specialty cider category which is your New England siders ciders with fruit apple wine ice cider spiders with herbs and spices and specialty Center which powers everything else that you might want to throw out cider so apple wine is different because that's usually adding a lot of extra sugar and our freeze like freeze distillation after you may have your fried nation and then you freeze it correct so that's gonna be a much thinner body higher alcohol versus the the ice cider which is this really complex depth of flavor the larger body it's got a nice acidity it does this one I feel like we've kind of gone back into like sweet balance with acidity balance with a little tart yeah not quite as Brown sugary dessert E as our second Quebec sample this one I get more of as kind of an upfront apple flavor and character to it I agree this one this one definitely is more acidity than to Quebec styles that we tried I don't get a lot of tannins there's just kind of a hint of lemon here yeah so spatulas us just a single run of the crowd concentration so it was about eight gallons I got about a gallon and a half out of it so this is like one of 15 bottles or something I think this is actually my very last bottle I have of this so it was this is the night to open it when's the last time you tasted this badge casually Pride 2015 sometime this is really like yeah shortly after winning you're like let's have one well right I think I tasted it like you know in the process and make you know making sure that the bottles were good I actually found this one downstairs I was gathering our samples to try for here I didn't know that it was there and so yeah I mean I really haven't tried this in two years and it's aged really well I wish I would have saved more bottles but you know so be it let's taste 2017 right now so we're on the last sample 2017 bestest show at the Minnesota State Fair which in itself is saying a lot because Minnesota loves it to me the deciders we've got great honey and apples and a lot of great meat makers and cider makers in this area so yeah and I remember I so I judged the best of show at the State Fair and we kind of go in order only kind of crisscross and we throw ones off that we know aren't gonna make it and the whole time I was just kind of like I know I know this is gonna make it like this was beautiful so tell us the difference in your mind between this and it's cousin share two years earlier absolutely this it's the exact same process that I use this I still used 71b for my yeast fermented cold and slow and then you'll let it clear and bottle afterwards but this one's smelling it there's a lot more Apple character some upfront it's kind of everything ear like yeah Apple the sweet the acid is just so much better without being offensive I think this one has a little bit more residual sweetness that balances out the acidity of this whereas the 2015 maybe the age is playing a role in that in terms of losing a little bit of sweetness I felt the acidity to be a little bit more up front this one is a little bit more balanced and that regarde in terms of the acidity man this is good this one tastes sorry this takes really damn good actually I'm glad this is uh this is held up as well so this last year at homebrew con in our backyard Minneapolis you gave kind of a presentation on this what was the response from the crowd what did you kind of hammer home is kind of like your main takeaway absolutely so I think my big take home points on this is your starting gravity in your final gravity and that's where it really really really makes the difference is you have to have a high starting ground so I say 30 to 35 bricks you can go higher as high as your yeast will tolerate you could go so if you start your run off you forget about it it's over dad it goes faster than you anticipated you check it and your run off is that 25 bricks which I've done before yeah that's too low don't do it this is not going to make a good eye sight because there will not be enough residual sweetness left over if that does happen freeze it again just do a second process also I've done that in the past it works really well there's no there's no arm to that then the second thing is is is stopping it at a high enough ground you want I promise you the ground needs to be 1050 to 1060 the Quebec guidelines are 130 milligrams I'm sorry 130 grams a residual sugar per litre that equals out to about 1050 in terms of specific gravity on your fermented product I think even if you need to stop it with chemical correct so uh I think I don't have to check my notes this year the 2017 I actually did stop myself I did it and put it in my freezer at 30 degrees to stop fermentation because it was getting there I was really happy with the way it tasted where it was I didn't want it to go any further so where our combination bees ferment to taste let your let your taste buds and your mouth be the guy because that's going to really let you know where this is supposed to be but keep an eye on the numbers and you know don't try and get more alcohol out of it because they will thin it out if you're brewing to make as much as possible this is not the style for you if you're making with something if you want to make something that's really interesting and unique and special and you take the time you can live with yourself of losing that kind of volume in terms of your starting product to your ending product this is something for you one other thing in terms of cider making it's a little bit different this often times when you get your fresh juice with cider making you'll sulphide it let it sit for a day and pitcher east don't sulk like this before you freeze it because you will concentrate all the sulfites into your run off and I've done that and then I've had actually this this year I learned this I'd learned this lesson last fall when I got my ride off and it literally did not I pitched it three times it did not take off I didn't have a bubble of fermentation because I had so many sulfites in there the yeast were inactivated so I bubbled some co2 through it for a couple minutes to blow off all the sulfur we push my yeast and it took off yeah absolutely just yeah bubble co2 you blow off the sulfites or alcohol sulfur and then you can start over so the shirt contents hi it's really cold for your run ops so there's no need to sulfite this at all so now I don't add any sulfites until I'm done and bottling which just helps with stability in the bottle Jeremy is gonna hook us up with a couple of recipes some tips maybe a little slideshow action mm-hmm from last year's homebrew con ma'am this I really appreciate you broke out some some gems so uh it's awfully next spring you'll bring some over here and I'll try some URIs better huh probably too late well next year 2019 yeah stay tuned good bye can get a bucket freezing outside you can do it really oh I should ask that and this surprise should have been way too early right now here's your question for the end of the episode to do this with the store-bought cider that you would do have regular cider Indian summer or what have you um you can for sure I've done that I do that once actually for to help I said it for my takut and NHC hmm because you're going after the sugar right so you so store work store-bought stuff is fine this line is just not pasteurized with any sore base or anything like that so if you can get unpasteurized or UV pasteurized juice India's summer works great the one time I did it didn't have quite the complexity and depth that I've gotten out of this but it was very good it was a good xcited for sure and again though you got to start with a lot yeah yeah absolutely you have you willin the budgets got to be there you got to cider budgets got to be on point yeah you gotta be willing to part with all that water that you don't need to make a good say all right let us know how your experiences go with the ice cider thanks Jeremy I'm Cheers empty I'm gonna go back to those other [Music] hello everybody and welcome to chop and brew I am chip Walton in this episode I make myself laugh sometimes I think well the curls probably drawn because I was like late afternoon and so they are all happen we're sleeping cuts we never happened out of four o'clock said oh never I know right absolutely we should just cut to that alright and then I'll just appear like all right stick your tongue to that I might lose my left foot over it Wow you'll get diabetes much quicker if you drink this and then I had maple syrup every day I know if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen and don't fight it he's a doctor yeah I wind holy moly it's a long talking pathway is right but it's I think it's good cuz you unlike a lot of people who all end up doing this with can like I mean you just kept it going you're like boom boom boom boom boom boom you know so then we had a point for each new sandal to but I was like it's so straight for I think there's not a lot to it put the kids to bed Jeremy's about to get crazy that's up all right dude someone said too sweet huh they did they're like where's my kombucha this is not a dry English cider this is really sweet what are you getting out of this one we're drinking sorry you're doing all the talking I'm like you're drinking the whole sample here mmm so there's there's two Center categories and the BJCP guidelines there's standard there's the standard ciders which are actually put this up in Laurie stop oh [Music] so I bubbled some co2 through it for a couple minutes to blow off all the sulfur we push my yeast and it took off that'll either make the bloopers are just not let me double-check the BJCP salla guideline to", "iF7k4c8MWKo": "hey everyone welcome to traveling vineyard world headquarters today we are having a little bit of fun with some fall flavors so today we're going to make a fun wine cocktail it's called our apple pies sparkler and I have the instructions and ingredients right here this is available to all of our wine guides you guys can craft this out of your tasting room but if you're not a lying bag and you're watching this feel free to reach out to your wine guide or get in touch with us so that we can give you this amazing recipe for a really fun wine cocktail that's great for a crowd great for you on your own so here are the ingredients the first ingredient is we're gonna use 1 cup of sparkling cider you're gonna use a cup of Moscato 6 ounces of vanilla vodka 1/4 of a cup of cinnamon sugar which I have right here in this little bowl and then some apple slices and cinnamon sticks for garnish so that is the recipe for a crowd but if you want to make it I'll show you how you can make just one serving so it's really really simple the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna wet the rim of my glass with an apple which actually works really really well to rim the glass with cinnamon sugar the other thing that I've used in the past to rim a glass is some caramel so whether it's a caramel sauce or if you melt down some caramel caramel I never really know which one it is but you can add those and use that as the rim everything sticks really well so I'm just gonna run the rim of the glass through this cinnamon sugar right here until the rim of the glass is coated and I can smell it from here it's such an awesome fall flavor I know some of us are mourning the loss of summer but with a fall comes some amazing flavors that I love to cook with and bake with and it also pairs really really well with wine and by the way I have three different types of apples here you can use almost any type of type of Apple that you would like if you wanted a little more tart try it granny smith some of your sweeter apples like a McIntosh also work really really well for this so then the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my little shot glass and for two ounces of Nilla vodka right into my glass so very simple step 1 and then step 2 is that I'm gonna add about halfway in the glass with a sparkling cider so this is the stuff that I always used to drink my parents would drink champagne before I was 21 I always have so much fun at New Year's Eve with some of this sparkling cider so you're just gonna fill your glass up about half way with that and then you're gonna top off the glass with one of our traveling vineyard wines today I have Smurfs which is a Moscow tell if a demi-sec so one of our sweeter wines and this one in particular it's from South Africa but I have a couple other options that you have any of these on hand you can definitely use them in this recipe as well so we have caballero de luna we have pasado blonde which would be awesome in this and then if you like it a little bit less sweet try it out with pebble which is our V Aigner and it's gonna be a little bit more on the acidic or the tart side if you like a less sweet that bridge so then I'm just gonna top off the rest of this glass wit smirk and you'll be good to go and then what I'm gonna do now is just garnish with an apple right there and a cinnamon stick it's so simple so easy and really so delicious so it's one of our brand new recipes available through Samal adji so if you're looking to host a tasting this is the perfect time to do it because your wine guide can provide you

see all of my apples behind me I'm going to show you some clips from our time at the orchard we had a really great time thankfully the weather wasn't too hot if we had gone the week before like we had planned it would have been in the 90s but when we went this week it was just perfect you can see in my kitchen I have all of my pressure cookers out my food processor and my Vitamix everything is out because I have an entire bushel of apples to process so we're gonna make a lot of Apple things today now I'm not gonna do everything but I just wanted to show you some really basic but fun and very family-friendly recipes for Apple I'm gonna show you how to make apple sauce of course apple butter some apple cider apple muffins and then freezer apple pie pop-tarts and these are going to be a special treat for my father-in-law apple pie is his favorite I actually have an entire video from Father's Day where I show you how to make apple pie from scratch we made it from my father-in-law so I will link that down below but today what we're going to be doing is making pop-tarts so that we're gonna keep some for ourselves and then give him a bunch so that he can take out a Apple Pie whenever he wants to and enjoy some yummy apple pie and then I'm not sure yet if we're gonna do more I might make apple fritters if if I don't get them to them today then you can find a recipe and video and everything on the blog I will also link I have a post it's just this program life.com slash apple - recipes but I will link it down below to where you can find 50 different Apple recipes so make sure you go check that out and save it if you need some of what to make with apples in your house [Music] all right well good put it in the back [Music] we've had a great day honestly I'm super thankful that we came today and not when we were planning on coming last week because last week it's just me than II's and today it's like mid 70s and it still feels really really hot hey Luke hi so we got some Red Delicious Granny Smith and Luke has a super tiny one size of my eyeball mm-hmm so we've had a really great day and I'm excited to take all these apples home and make some delicious things with them Josiah what do you want to make with the apples you wanna make Papa and apple pie you want to make some applesauce apple pie I'm gonna turn you around show you give you a peek like at my different instant pots and I also have a meal tea pressure cooker if you ever have any questions about anything you can totally ask me down in the comments I also have everything linked up in my Amazon shop reviews on my blog and all of that kind of thing so don't hesitate to ask if you see me use something and you have a question about it or you're just looking for a recommendation so this is my Vitamix we're going to use this to make some apple cider and I'll show you it's super super easy this is my meal thie pressure cooker and it's a lot like an instant pot but it's meal tea brand and I actually have a review and a giveaway of this coming up hopefully next week so make sure you're on the lookout for that and then here is my quiz and our food processor this is what I'm actually going to make my pie dough and I highly recommend this it's a 14 cup food processor I use it for a lot of different things and then I have my instant pot Max and this right here is my this is a duo plus but this is my instant pot my 8 quart so I'm gonna make applesauce in that one because I'm gonna make the most amount of applesauce and then this is the ultra instant pot ultra this is my favorite model it's super useful it has a lot of really great features if you want to see a review between the ultra and then the duo which is the 7 in one this is the 10 in 1 I will link that down below holidays are coming up as well as Black Friday deals and you want to know which instant pot to get and then I have an immersion blender and this is what I'm gonna use for not only my apple butter but also my apple sauce the last little thing I'm going to show you is this I'm sure you've seen these before whenever you have a bunch of apples you're processing whether you're making apple sauce or apple pie or whatever this is really really handy to have around this will actually core your apple peel your Apple and slice your Apple all at the same time these are the apples that we got we got Red Delicious we got Granny Smith and we got Winesap apples so we're gonna make we're gonna focus on the Granny Smith for the pie and then probably the Winesap and the Winesap and the Red Delicious a combination of those for the apple butters and the applesauce sound good Jen yeah well order back the apple cider Wooldridge to a mix of all three I was told at an orchard one time that apple cider is best with several different varieties so we'll use a little bit of all three for our apple cider okay [Music] don't hold back take me on me try [Music] so I can't seem to get we were golden turning [Music] I thought you could see it too through our hands it slipped away we we're never here to stay we were so wild [Applause] we were just kidding gave you the mess [Applause] and I was asking of you was to never break it [Applause] [Music] every night I spend with you don't you painted [Music] we were so okay the first thing that I'm gonna make is the apple pie filling for our pop-tarts and I just have several granny smith apples in there I really didn't keep count maybe like four or five now my drizzle in some maple syrup pour in about a half a cup 1/4 cup of water you really don't need a lot because your apples are gonna give off a lot of liquid as they cook and then just sprinkle them with some cinnamon and then let them cook for two minutes on high pressure and you want to make sure you quick release that pressure otherwise you will end up with an apple sauce instead of apple pie filling let's make apple butter next because that takes a while and so for the Alpha butter I'm probably just going to use mostly these wine saps and then throw in some resolution Red Delicious as well I haven't said this yet but I'm saving all of my cores and peels because I'm going to make apple cider vinegar it's really easy to do I'll link the instructions down below [Music] tell me yours gay you tell me your Wie but I know strong and what you think [Music] it's okay so the next thing is ready to go I have my instant pot this is a six quart pot and it's probably just a little over halfway full of apples and I'm gonna add more cinnamon this time because this is going to be the apple butter and I want it to be super cinnamony and then some nutmeg as well this one isn't apple pie this one's apple butter and then I added about a half a cup of water you really only need to add enough to help it get to pressure because like I said before it's going to give off a lot of liquid we're gonna cook these for a lot longer because we want them to be very very soft and then after we cook them under pressure we're going to let them simmer and saute for a little bit longer and get off some more of that liquid so that we do have a really thick and spreadable apple butter [Music] say your friend [Music] thank you break this we're gonna make apple cider but we don't peel the apples for our apple cider we're gonna peel them for applesauce so what you need to do for apple cider is cut the poor off okay so look Molly look at mama I'm gonna show you how to do it okay you just cut around the poor like this and then you're left with the cork and these pieces can go in the right a mix your poor goes in here [Music] we'll come to honey yes and [Music] I'll follow [Music] Mountain we come to [Music] honey [Music] honey okay so it took a little while but I filled up my 8 quart with apples to make apple sauce I'm gonna pour in about a cup of water and I'm going to cook these for 10 minutes on high pressure and then just my own sauce will be done I don't typically add any kind of sweetener to the apple sauce because really I think it's sweet enough on its own and then here is my apple butter so you can see really I'm probably not going to need to use the blender much and I blended up a little bit to kind of get those peels and everything incorporated a little bit better but it's super soft it's a little too runny right now so I'm going to turn it on to saute and just let some of that liquid simmer off so probably let it saut\u00e9 between 30 to 45 minutes so I got through probably two-thirds of the way through the box this is my apple pie pop tart filling so I'll be able to make these whenever I'm ready to roll out my stuff I've got my jars here with all my peels and cores so that's going to become apple cider vinegar and then I think I might just try to pass on some of the peels in core see if anybody else near me wants to have them so they can make their own - hey guys well I'm back in my kitchen and to continue processing my apples I did most of the work that I videoed the other day on Saturday Sunday I pretty much took the day off to clean my house clean my kitchen and go to Costco you know like all the important weekend things and now I'm back at it so the last thing that I'm going to show you on this youtube video is making apple pie pop tart so I showed you on Saturday about making the mix so that's what this is right here and then I have my pie dough right here so I just went ahead it's been in the fridge since Saturday so it's pretty hard so it needs to be malleable so I just took it out and I'm gonna let it sit out for between 45 minutes to an hour just until I'm able to roll it out and I'll show you the process of making the apple pie pork tart apple pie pop-tarts it's actually a pretty easy process and I'm going to bake them and then put them right into the freezer and right now I have both my pressure cookers going behind me so I'm just trying to take advantage of a quiet moment while my kids are outside playing and I'm making lunch to finish up the rest of this Apple work your smile just really doing nothingness think about you on the highway it's alway 466 and we keep on driving we just do what you wanna do yeah no nothing's complicate it with you [Music] I'm crazy it's just the way that I get every time with you you left it takes me to heaven I just wanna make you repeat it and

back at it again and tonight as you can see I'm chilling a bottle at Jack Daniels I'm not just any bottle of Jack Daniels we got some of that Jack Daniels winner Jack Tennessee cider and um I've heard some good things about this now this is not nothing new this this particular flavor been out for years now I think about four or five years has been out but they usually only come out with it around holidays Christmas time Thanksgiving you know and it says that it's made with their original Jack Daniels number seven everybody knows about that that's pretty much legendary know about Jack Daniels that says that it's supposed to be served warm okay that's different supposed to be served warm when it's cold it's definitely cold outside and it says share with friends and family so guess what that's exactly what we want to do we are going to take a straight shot warm and put in the microwave for quick 10-15 seconds we're gonna take that and we're actually gonna make one of the signature drinks for this particular dream and we gonna let you know what it tastes like so without further ado gonna crack this baby open that you know it's a work gig is a work game for your family for your loved ones for your significant other and you know we're gonna see is it something enjoyable something that we should be add to our collection could be but we gonna see now we got it open must say this is a beautiful bottle really is mmm definitely a really potent apple cider smell I can smell a little bit of whiskey but smell more apple cider than the whiskey mmm I'm gonna take some I'm gonna taste a little bit of it right off the bottom while we warm it up just to see and it tastes like has a really good smell to really good smells hmm I must say I like that I like that that's real good that goes down so smooth it's ridiculous that goes down Ruiz knew much alcohol is exactly okay there's only 15% alcohol so not that strong not that much alcohol in it so you don't want to mix this with anything really okay we still want to do a signature drink for it but this is this is good I mean you can just you can pry kill this whole bottle by yourself easy hmm that's good now after I've tasted it I definitely get I can definitely taste the the whiskey more than the apple cider smelling it you can you can barely smell the whiskey as you smell more apple cider than anything but that were tasting it I'm like okay is there it's not strong at all not strong eyes it's definitely not your traditional Jack Daniels but it's smooth as I don't know what that spike is only 30% alcohol but it's really smooth it has a really good taste to it I like it but let's warm it up for just a quick couple seconds just to see what that tastes like all right all right we back and I just like I said I just putting the white in the microwave for a quick 10 15 seconds definitely brings out more aroma to it more definitely does let's taste cheese hmm oh yeah that's good warm that is a great experience for me [Music] mmm it's smooth going down that apple cider just dances on your tongue this is some good this is pretty good this is really good now if you really try to get messed up this may not get you there because like I said it's not that strong to me but it's really good it's a really good drink this is it's definitely a drink bet fellas you know for your lay you want to get it for your lady you and your lady up just chill and sip on this in front of the fireplace or in front of the Christmas tree under the mistletoe all that good stuff your lady you definitely love this

really just trying to get totally wasted this may not get you there that you maybe it's gonna get you a regular bottle of um Oh number seven it maybe mix it with some Jack Daniels Apple I don't know but um if you just want something smooth to drink like I said in front of the fireplace with your lady maybe you want to watch the kids open up Christmas presents this is a nice something to have you know but now what we're gonna do is you're gonna do one of the signature drinks that's actually on the website and it's called the warm apple pie and it's not that many ingredients to it I'm gonna put it up on the screen so you'd be able to see it but all it is is just two ounces of winner Jack three ounces of chai tea half an ounce of maple syrup and a slice of lemon that's it that's really it is some whipped cream if you want to make it look pretty and sexy you know but we're gonna do that we're gonna see what it tastes like all right be back now and as you can see I've already got my Jack Daniels and I've already got my chai tea premix it's nice and warm you see a piping hot it's that steam coming up y'all god y'all y'all gotta try this warm this is amazing warm it really is but before we before we pour that in the glass ingredients says to squeeze one slice of lemon in the cup so we're gonna do that and because I love lemon so much then you want to add two tea in the Jack Daniels hmm good and we actually need 1/2 ounce of maple syrup and I don't know if you want to use pancakes herbs or whatever but it costs to meet me sir so I'm trying to stick to the script oh we got a half ounce of maple syrup looks good I wish I can smell this this smells amazing mix him up this smells so good this is probably good - got cold trying to get rid of I can just tell and gonna top it off with some whipped cream mmm that's amazing look at that y'all ladies and gentlemen this is the warm apple pie this looks green to family good times and love cheese oh my gosh y'all this really tastes

just with a jacket I would give it I would give it an eight I would give it an eight the only reason why I'm not giving it a nine or ten is because it's not as strong as I thought it would be it's not

welcome to the bear river homestead in today's episode I'm going to be showing you how to make apple pie pancake syrup this is one of my absolute favorite recipes everybody loves it my kid my kids adore it they use it on pancakes french toast in their oatmeal it's just such a versatile product to have in the pantry it's super simple to make even the beginning canner can handle this with no problems and it's also a really great way to use up apple scraps right now we're dehydrating apple chips and I'll be doing another video on that here in a couple days but we have a lot of leftover peels and cores and instead of just throwing them away we actually cook them down and make apple cider which I then turn into my apple pie pancake syrup so what you're going to need first up is about five pounds of apples that you've peeled and cored reserved those peels and then you're going to need a large pot enough big enough to hold all of your pills and cores and be covered completely with water and that's what you're going to cook down into your juice you will also need around four quart-size mason jars and a water bath canner because the juice is acidic we will only need two water bath cannon do be sure to double-check your canning times for your local altitude I'm canning at 7,000 feet so my times are going to be drastically different than for the vast majority of y'all okay I will be back in just a minute to show you what our pills and course look like once they have been cooked down alright so in our pot we have the peels and cores from about five pounds worth of apples we filled the pot up with water just enough to cover the pills and cores we're gonna let it boil down until everything is nice and soft the cores will get soft you can tell that the liquid has turned into this nice apple juice apple cider color once that's done we're gonna strain the liquid off the peels of course are going to go to the chickens and then we're going to use the liquid that will now be apple cider to cook down in Taurus okay so I have strained off the peels and the course and that's given us about a gallon of what is now apple cider I'm going to go ahead and add that to the pan and remember we are adding equal parts apple cider and sugar we've got our cider on the stove I've added the sugar now it's just coming to a simmer so we're going to go ahead and add about half a tablespoon of cinnamon you can add more or less depending on your taste and we're gonna add about a test of vanilla I'm gonna give that a good stir you want to cook this down for about 20 to 30 minutes but remember because of the natural pectin in Apple's as well as the amount of sugar that's in this syrup if you cook it too long you're gonna wind up with apple jelly we will be back when this is ready to go into the jars all right so our syrup has been cooking down for about 20 minutes and it is ready to go into the jars I have a couple of quart sized jars that have already been heated up always be sure to put hot ingredients into hot jars where your jars can crack and I am going to leave a half-inch headspace in each jar do be extra careful when you're doing this this is hot sugar and if you get it on you it will stick alright we're almost there all right I'll remove the funnel always always always be sure you have a clean wet rag and wipe the rim really well any food particles or liquids that remain on the rim can prevent your lid from sealing properly so you'll place a clean lid in the center place the ring on and tighten just until a fingertip tight and then we'll put this in the canner we're gonna process these for 25 minutes but I am at 7,000 feet if you are around 1,000 feet in altitude you would process for 10 minutes but before you do any canning be sure to double check the canning times for your altitudes we will be back as soon as these guys have processed and I'll show you the finished product alright so we are here with our finished product I got four quarts of syrup out of this batch now this will be good on the shelf for up to a year but before using do be sure to check the lids make sure they're still silk properly that's it for today

this again I like to use Delicious apple so the best is sweet and delicious before they call Delicious apples this is old-fashioned apple pie many kinds of other prize we can make which I'm gonna make our apple for next week or so okay I do remember buying this all the rest of us Alisa I bet meeting fight chicken there when I was a little girl I love that place so much and said they would have a it happens you know things pose down you know it was a family one place a child I'm somebody's places I'm not a rabbit without swear I some of my text I'm doing on these places so we always remember that we're going to add in one cup of dragon dated sugar okay yeah I remember comments like it was yesterday I'm really really thinking then which is sugar together and what we're going to do now is I want to add in cinnamon I'm adding in two teaspoonfuls of cinnamon okay delicious once it's done I always say apples and cinnamon somebody's they always seem to work together as a team so this is you know only something I'm also adding in two tablespoons of all-purpose flour I have my oven up to 360 degrees oven it's different some ovens say 350 it's a 340 so yeah you can't let me oven now we're gonna mix it together I'm gonna add in my lemon juice it's gonna give it a little flavor also a little lemon juice and if you mix together okay there's a little bit of lemon juice no more than a quarter teaspoon of lemon juice together and then we're going to do now is we're going to put it into the pie crust we're gonna practice for about 60 minutes want to make sure the pipe closes even it's very important anything sneaking away from me there we go cuz it's gotta be attractive also could taste good but also gotta be trapped them there you go now much too many apples will stop I don't think it's gonna be too many family let me know it's too many I don't wanna put too many apples in there we have a problem that's a good last time that it started going do it across we don't want that happen I think it's gonna be more than enough a bit more okay now I just want to get this pie crust so it looks nice so it's presentable once it's done get this around the center you have targets those good old days Oh even my husband remembers Giger's going there for you know site or whatever and they're always wonderful on Thanksgiving all right okay I'm gonna put a couple slits here there we go we're gonna pop this in the oven to cook I'm cooking at a 360 for about 60 minutes and here we have a delicious one from homemade apple pie oh it's so clean it was so yummy that and this is on of godless and also fall season is definitely upon us and I remember growing up going to Gaga's you know I always have the fried chicken from Deborah way to home country kitchen have a great day and please subscribe to a wonderful youtube channel", "iIA3p66SyFk": "hello walk up in ten farms Country Kitchen I'll thanks for welcoming me Nicki varmint hello you know what it's fall that means flannel shirts that's right little children thanks girl legs it's cold in the cabin it is now as we see before us Apple's I know are you going here I put something on Facebook the other day you made a pie it was so pretty head to take a picture of it yeah whose recipe my grandma's Solomon's got my Solomon my dad's mom now she did a little something extra she did not just apples pecans we took it a step further you did cuz you always add great things I didn't put butterscotch busy nose down I would think God we want to put some raisins mm-hmm good idea now as we move and progress and do more and more stuff ourselves and have more stuff setting on our shelves that we reduced such as our beautiful lard yes and let me tell you what is there anything that makes better apple pie crust then pull my lord no is this is the best crust I've ever made what is it that makes it I mean what's the point if he knows different it was just it came together better and it wasn't crumbly it was perfect and it tastes delicious we got our own honey yay which we're gonna add to the apple pie this time of year we're thinking about apples we were looking for ideas last week we went shopping we got some apple cider I mix something up it is no problem at all it's not brain surgery it's very simple stuff and you're going to have you a wonderful warm drink when it's cold like this to take the chill off at Manny it was cold this boss one thing I do want to say to our viewers they're not of yours they're our friends and extended family our country kitchen cooks sometimes don't you wish that you spent a little more time with your game parents maybe you're gonna park Alec arena's listening to his stories learning a few more Greek words with your grandmother they pulled you in right and said let's do this so it's time to understand that with Tim farms Country Kitchen it's a show about preserving traditions food traditions in America and saving those things forever right those memories are so important from your parents get those recipes from your parents and your grandparents while you still have them you know what someday you're going to think back you want to protect that legacy for your children past those things down in a wonderful to know that grandma Solomon had a recipe here she didn't write it down we just kind of throws it together let's throw some together all right wait how you start we're gonna start with apples we got some granny smith apples here we just proved our apple tree down in the yard that's our next project I think we got to get some folks from UK to come talk about us these extension office folks are great UK people are great last week they came out and looked at our critters we know we're going to shake her in now great resource and a lot of times you can look up the on their website all right so how many apples you're gonna put in this is for one pie this is for one pie and I have a kind of a thinner pie you'll see my pie pans a little smaller it's not like the bunch up but I'm you can do is however thick you want how many apples I did seven that seems like a good number for me now another thing you can do and put up and we have not done this but Miss Helen did this member was Helen to made fried apple pies also good she put up her own filling it's a jar is ready to go we need do something with her again she was so sweet i see why i made the best fried apple pies ever and all that stuff i'm referring to let's go and talk about it right now well we got a minute if you haven't seen our stuff before we have quite an online library of recipes at tim farmers country kitchen calm how to's all sorts of fun stuff and doing it yourself once you get done with that go over to Tim farmers country kitchen facebook page and like it see what we're doing where we're going it's a lot of fun to talk with you guys and share recipes and thoughts and so on and so forth fall is upon us don't you love fall I do I love that beautiful i love cooking in the fall yeah we can bake and not even worry about eating house up and our bees have been very busy I've been watching them come and go they've been packing stuff in every day where it's fairly warm they're still packing stuff in and a little while we're going to check in with Allen the B dude and see what he's got going on we're gonna take a look at our bees see what they're doing because i like my honey I know you do so much stuff you use it out I have it every day in my coffee local area well that's pretty local when it's you know 50 yards from the house all right what's the next part mrs. farmer all right this is what she really did measure and I always like well how much of that how much of that she would put and i believe about a half a cup of flour mmm so what'd he do that now back in the day that's all they did was cook all day long and they didn't measure they just made stuff they've done it I mean he didn't go to s\u00f8ren by pies you made by all right maybe pies everything safes yeah think of the past yeah sugar huh I'm just gonna put a minute what do you think about quarter of a cup service probably hey that was exactly a quarter recorder of a cup all right gotta have a little bit salt for the Salton everything maybe half teaspoon couple shakes all spies gotta put some allspice most part I know so much allspice reason what is it appalling what's going on it is about half a teaspoon or so that's right she didn't measure can't measure guy use your hands when your grandma what's this cinnamon 'cimmanon yes all right if you want to stir that around right all right all right some people just throw their apples in and throw this mixture on top and I can't like to mix it mm-hmm all right now we could get our special chopper and I love about this you know that's a great thing about the stuff that we used to look for it antique places or flea markets then I used to ignore now we look for the old kitchen stuff it's the best thing ever that know how much conscious that's about a half a cup of books so this was her deal she's like pecans in her this is something little extra to put in there something different give it a little then we took it one step further you know how when you have in the fall we eat more oatmeal and you put out a certain reasons and things like that I start thinking why not raisins and why not honey yeah I didn't do any better scratch pieces even though I was thought about it that wouldn't have heard anything with it I like you're raising ID in your honey how about we stick with it you know it probably gonna be good i don't know i love my butterscotch pieces all right this is your secret ingredient which i think is gonna be wonderful we're gonna put those apples and raisins now if you don't like raisins so we meas is my sister's college wheelies I think that's well mixed I do too hi Jeff how good a job you did risk oh boy you're great you didn't 11 oh good mixer I know what now we got to make pie dough and stuff and finish it out right at a loss to let's clean this up before we go to the next step Alan's coming over to check my fall honey situation now obviously the bees have to have enough to get them through the winter right but if they have enough on that top box there's nothing there for us we'll take that yeah would you take some fall how are you give it so we leave some for the bees and we get some for us yes it's what they live on let's check with Alan see how our bees really what's nice message for me let's make us some awesome pie dough all right now I keep it must end this is large this is just isn't any large this is our Lord look at this now that look at that look at that we rendered this down it smells good fairly quickly and we still got that light of color look at that plug that scream nicely how many skeet you look put three that is not anyway processed bleached that's just pure Laurel I do that and then let's put some sugar in there I'm sweet up your dough yeah I just look just a little hit there but I'm gonna do about a cup and a half of flour in this I think that's gonna get us as our pie shell are paya plates actually kind of little so shouldn't even much I was always fascinated by this part okay so and this lard is so wonderful I mean it's not chunky and see how it's just mixing right in listen that's the best consistency yes does it make a difference put a little water in there for me if you would okay say when smooth it won't keep adding little bit okay a little bit more okay that might be good instead of looking at the amount of water that we're not measuring look at the consistency right the dough like you like it I don't like the texture of this dough it's really good all right we're gonna break it in half because I'm gonna use half for the bottom then we'll need have for the top later it's just I'm telling you this lard makes the vasa dough and I'm ever doesn't break it doesn't crumble I've never had dull work this good it's almost like I bought it at the store it's so perfect you know now they're saying lard in his purest form it's hard healthy omega-3 type stuff you're just so good and so easily done beautiful no nice here's a guy have more sugar Oh sugar tits pie I like to sugar up the it's a pie it's a pad that's right no we'll take this wonderful make sure we made now this may seem simple you may say okay they'll just make an apple pie but you know what this isn't any apple pie this is grandma's song with a twist she would loved she's a loved your twist okay now before you put your special ingredient I'm gonna do what she used to do she took a whole lemon good i got i love these old lemon for the holes in it yes cuz it gets rid of the seeds with this all over I have lemon juice in there gives us little target yeah you should take a half a stick of water cuz it's good for you oh yeah we're not telling you this the only way it can be done this is just the way we read we're not saying this is the only way because there is no only way you can do it eighteen thousand different ways this is just our way we're following the instincts that we have when it comes to cooking you know it's good with butter honey Wow usually I to just stuck it in like this with more sugar but i like i like your idea to hold that yeah how could this hurt doesn't make it good we're gonna use fresh honey Oh that'll be terrible it's gonna be that surely won't be any good hey what quarter of a cup at least listen you did more than that trying to stop yeah here going to run your finger across if it was too good to waste mm-hmm YUM wow nice need to make a top let's cover this baby up and cook it all right clarkey smells good I'm telling you the lard and if you want to have fun in your backyard you can go to your butcher and ask for pork trimmings or pork fat you can render your own Lord look back on our recipe of rendering lard it's not really a recipe but in the process you can have it in your own kitchen so good it's going to excel air holes here that's beautiful and another last thing that she used to do you want to make me top look pretty she take a little bit whipping cream I maybe have not even a tablespoon here and we're gonna add just the egg white and she always put this on the top some people just put egg white some people have their own that gives a nice glaze on top she did with the cream so and I'm just gonna use my hands you can use a little brush of your honor just kind of move this around out there thanking me hug you miss room is it got wait an hour and that's what she put on her pies and I think maybe sprinkle wait Miami delivered a little more sugar on top just in case all right Debbie olyphant we don't want you sure now awful and we're ready to put this in the oven now I have an idea while that's baking we got a little bit of time to talk to Alan and again show the process of slinging what you have to do to get your own hoodie right here in a cabin yeah we got to clean this up first for bringing me stuff in I thought mean up real quick so smell like heaven yes it does apple pie it's ready all right let's get that out Oh perfect well I was taking pictures and put them on our recent Brown Kendrick it's on Facebook page the other day now as if the house could smell anymore fall ashore a Polly this right here smells like potpourri when it's cooking Kentucky orchard Evans orchard makes this house on fire and we're going to start off with a port that is four cups in Bangladesh and there's about a quart now this is just a little reminder it is fall let's put about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar light or dark it doesn't matter we're gonna put some cinnamon sticks three quarters with teaspoon okay this is a course place and let's go half on the nothing okay all right now what do we end up with oh I don't know what is this nor your honey more fall honey I'd say let's go 2 tbsp fall honey turtle legs hmm call an alerts apple pie I'm scooting this over here al careful you please cut me a piece of that oh well I'm telling you what that is the perfect crust right there means it is watches you dislodge that perfect piece of yo the guy yummy follow me oh yeah all right you know what you share this is here hmm I see how your race that looks like that might be the perfect piece of apple pie idea I like the honey and the raisins good job still tart they just got the sweet and you get that little crunch from the pecans Wow I only had some cider oh wait now might be able to hook you up you get it to a nice little simmer serve it warm now you can run this through a strainer I like my chunky all right here cinnamon stick okay already in there now wow that's good I'm Adam it's really good nice and hot mm-hmm Wow of course that's really really hot I'd like to spore the whole thing down i know i'm really happy cuz everything turned out so great but I'm also kind of sad because you know what time it is what time is it it's time to discuss the fact that it's actually all about good times good friends good eats good eats see you next week on Tim farmers country kitchen you", "CRZa2sJL5uU": "apple-pie on the rocks homegirl you want try this one check this out okay delicious cream some corn star okay now let's make our brown sugar come behind it with a cinnamon oats or a little bit of cinnamon so we're doing a little mix I know it's kind of look like somewhat a cop-a-feel Breaking Bad which is totally legal even though it looks the way look okay rim on line in that corn star for that brown sugar cinnamon mix you get you get you get this apple pie thingy going on here put that down ice in the glass is all done in the glass pretty straightforward vanilla vodka come behind that put some cinnamon whiskey okay or some cinnamon schnapps if that's all you could find apple juice okay I may be a garnish with a cinnamon stick now I wonder if that stick could be converted into a straw I don't know but we're going to go where no man has gone before we're going to use our filling stick as a straw and guess what it works okay you Rico all right people say everything's been discovered lies gentlemen straw stick [Music]", "pMYCsPg6ozY": "okay so we're up in the household here not ready but worth login anyways we gotta get the [ __ ] out of everybody here shop John's making this moonshine stuff [Music] what are you doing John so I'm getting everything ready for the shot oh man the shot words yeah look at that that's a cheese seven so here's your ingredients so you guys are gonna need you're gonna need a gallon of apple juice you're gonna need ever clear now if you're a Minnesota resident you live in the liberal state that cannot buy us in Minnesota you're gonna need cinnamon sticks sliders right you're awesome around sugar you're gonna need white sugar you're gonna need cider do not buy the apple cider in the clear jug like the apple juice cuz that is not real cider so the other thing you're gonna need is a big pot you're gonna be reducing over two gallons of liquid I'm filming myself from two different angles here hey we got some here all right Oh hold on first thing I'm gonna do is get our cinnamon sticks no the recipe calls for four cinnamon sticks but I like five right I like a little bit more cinnamon to it one Oh your GoPro just shut off dude just hit the back just hit the head and five and I like the bigger sticks because yeah next we're gonna do our gallon of apple juice okay now here comes our gallon apple juice into our big pot next you're gonna do your gallon of cider all right now we've got a honey bear cider okay that's one half yellow you can already see how much this is filling up the pot so that's why it's very important to have a nice large pot otherwise you're not going to be able to accomplish this kind of reducing so remember just for everybody's sake we have one gallon apple cider one gallon of apple juice five cinnamon sticks four if you don't like that taste so much and now we're gonna add our sugar I like brown sugar so we're gonna do a full cup of brown sugar and I like brown sugar to have some of the best memories at the strip club leather brown sugar [Laughter] so John's Metro light brown sugar I love it I'm a white sugar kind of guy not me no be careful as you dip your brown sugar and your liquid because the brown sugar the tendency has a tendency to splash you don't want your brown sugar you know squirting everywhere oh hey I like my brown sugar you're squirting everywhere just being real so here we are we're at a perfect simmer now this is where we want to let it sit for the next hour as it reduces so here's a 10-page I'm going to stick this in look at that temp kid just climb like rpms in that wild all right so you can see here where we're starting to level off here at about 200 degrees so we got Johnson here he's about to take the stuff off hey guys so we've been we've been simmering for an hour now okay that's that's all you need just simmer for an hour we've reduced quite a bit you can see we've actually dropped you can see I roll it's probably hard to make out we've dropped a full two inches on where we started from the full gallon amount okay that's all from reducing we're gonna take this off the heat you want to check this to get it below 170 we're still at 210 degrees see that needle Klieman starting to get steady there it is right at 160 okay we've let it cool off enough okay alcohol burns off at 175 so 160 degrees we're ready to go and pour in our alcohol and that will also cool it down as well because this this alcohol is room temperature okay so we're gonna pour this in this is half of a 175 this is point 875 leader okay that's poured in now stir it up a little bit let it cool off and then we're gonna put in some mason jars for disposal for everyone else to enjoy okay so as you can see we have filled up these mason jars full of this delicious apple crisp apple pie booze this is gonna be the best episode I think that ever was not really actually", "gJjTPtkG_H0": "hey is it too early to get slurped if you have to ask you already know the answer but today we're making apple pie the drink not the dessert in a large stock pot we're adding two cups of brown sugar 2 cups of white sugar 10 cinnamon sticks 1 gallon of apple cider and a half gallon of apple juice bring that concoction up to a boil while that's heating up give it a stir every now and again to help dissolve those sugars once boiling reduce that heat and let it simmer for about an hour make sure that you stir occasionally after that time is up remove it from the heat and let it cool down to room temperature for alcohol will be responsible and use 75 percent everclear but not too responsible as we're cashing this entire bottle and for some added flavor we'll add a half bottle of apple whiskey in reality you should use whatever alcohol you think will be delicious we'll be storing these in mason jars and for additional flavor we'll be throwing in some cinnamon sticks start filling up the jars and at this time i'd like to issue a warning we thought this would be tasty reheated as an apple cider but the alcohol steams up and you just end up gassing yourself every time you go for a drink i'd also like to say always drink responsibly and never drink and drive once filled you should let these sit for about a week before consuming this will ensure all that flavor is incorporated so here after about a week we've had our apple pie moonshine sit i got my buddy max here max is getting married max is our first ever guest star aditi eats beats after dark awesome we're gonna see what max thinks here you go cheers buddy congrats [Music] oh that's good a lot of cinnamon sandwiches you're right there's a lot of cinnamon brown sugar brown sugar warms you up a little bit it's nice oh it's pretty good what do you give it out of 10 out of 10. give it a 8.9 8.9 out of 10. that's pretty dang good it's pretty dang good thanks so much for watching beats after dark congrats max this was awesome try this at home this is great thank you so much for watching and we'll see you next time sorry about the blurry camera work at the end but we're just simulating what you're going to see after a few glasses but thanks so much for watching like the video comment all that jazz but we appreciate every one of you thanks for the support and we'll see you next time", "W-BNO-bJtAM": "okay guys I am so sorry that I didn't make a better intro anyway hey guys and today I'm going to be showing you guys how to make this apple pie punch juice we're heading to the grocery store okay guys so first I started off with a glass of ice and we're gonna use this peat pear neck time and a green apple and ginger ale or Canada and this apple cider which is a hundred percent that was like okay so first I am going to use this apple cider import halfway through the glass okay so now we're gonna use ginger ale Canada drawing and fill it up to the like right here and now we're gonna use this sweet peach nectar pear nectar keeps a peach and just put a little tiny bit in it because it's very sweet and it tastes delicious now with this voila", "lfGVMtmQrX8": "okay so it's time to see how this one's gonna taste that's up next hello everyone this is Joe Wayne with edge of nowhere farm and we're coming to here today it is very very early middle of November 2019 so if you've been following along with us we've been taking our apple harvest actually from back in June of this year and turning it into what you see here this is our apple cider wine so we've had a little bit of a hiatus because we actually moved so you'll see my background has changed if you've been following along with us and we're in a different house so we've actually had a little bit of a delay and getting this out had a lot of you guys asking for the next couple steps so we wanted to go ahead and get that done today right now we have a completely finished five gallon container of apple cider wine so again I said we're in the middle of November right now we're at about five o'clock in the morning because we've got a lot of things to do today in order to figure out what we want to do to finish this one so now because of the time we've had this in this container now for a few months we have reacted a couple times which basically just means we've pulled it off of the remaining Lee's or haze that was at the bottom of the wine itself and that you can see it's cleared up really really nicely it's easy very very clear wine the color looks a lot like apple juice which is kind of nice we really like that amber kind of color but I guess apple juice or beer or cider but ultimately what we wanted to do today is we wanted to try a little bit of this and then determine whether or not we need to back sweeten so first let's talk about the tools that we're going to be using today one thing we know for sure we are gonna de gas this wine so in order to do that we've got this little degassing arm here that we have in our Amazon shop by the way everything that we have here you can find in our Amazon shop I'll leave a link in the description but we've got a degassing wand here I've got a cordless drill to use that we have a potassium sorbate well about that in a minute Camden tablets a glass vessel to hold liquid in we have a wine beef we like the glass ones we have a hydrometer for testing our specific gravity and I do have a wine glass so first thing we're gonna do is we're actually going to talk a little bit about the wine and how we know it's finished obviously when you're looking at this one you can really kind of see that it's finished you've lost all the haziness you know it's been sitting in here for four or five months now so we know that it's finished we also did a test we reracked it again last night we got a little bit of hazy one at the very very bottom of it so we know that it's done we also tested it with the hydrometer so we do know that we're seeing at point nine nine point nine nine zero which means that it is completely finished so as far as taste at this point this wine is really ready to go in the bottle once it's degassed however Lori and I like our wines a little off dry so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take a little bit of wine see if I can do my best at describing what this tastes like I don't need much because it's 5:00 in the morning I'm not much of a day drinker but you can see the speaker works really good and then the wine itself so if Lori wants to slide in a little bit closer you can see a very very clear nice and sparkly beautiful beautiful white wine let's see what this tastes like mmm very very good most of the apples we use are a little bit tart there's a tiny bit of tart in there very very little you can tell it's a finished wine I'm not getting that real yeasty kind of flavor that you get with one that's not finished there's almost a little bit of sweetness in the aftertaste the smell it smells a lot like you can kind of get that fruity sort of smell at this point I think we really probably could just go with straight bottling this wine Lori and I have both tried this since last night and we're thinking we want just a little bit more sweetness we didn't add any tannin to this wine so it doesn't have any tannins so there's it's not bitter at all it's got a very very crisp clean finish however we do like it just a smidge sweeter than this more off dry than anything and one note on dryness this is definitely not super dry now it's dry in the sense that there is no sugar in here but it doesn't have that real kind of dry aftertaste definitely no bitterness at all and that slightly tart taste it's very very good it's a fantastic tasting wine so you could go with just this and call it done however Lori and I have decided that we want just a little bit of sweetness in there so we're gonna go ahead and walk you through the steps now of how to back sweeten this and you can make it whatever sweetness level you want because we're adding sugar back in as confident as we are that there's no yeast in here they're probably still is and Lori and I unfortunately because I think anybody who's made their own wine has run into this we've definitely had wine restart fermentation in the bottle not a fun pain wouldn't suggest it so because of that we tend to be overly cautious at this point when we decide to back sweeten that we're gonna make sure we kill off any remaining yeast and inhibit any yeast that might still be left over so what we're gonna do is we're gonna use two ingredients to make sure that we will not restart fermentation the two ingredients we're going to be using would be potassium metabisulfite we're gonna actually use Camdon tablets because it's very easy to measure we have just over five gallons of wine here so we're gonna use five of these Camdon tablets to kill off any remaining yeast second thing we're going to use is potassium sorbate so potassium sorbate is really designed to inhibit any remaining yeast that survives the potassium metabisulfite it'll stop that yeast from actually reproducing so any sugar in there any little yeast guys that are still left in there this will stop them from reproducing and blowing your corks right off your wine bottle so we're gonna be using these two things and then of course what we're gonna do to mix these is we're gonna actually go ahead and use our degassing wand and the cordless drill to get in there and actually mix these in and do acet at the same time let's go ahead and measure these out get them into the bottle and then we'll show you how to d'cach\u00e9 your wine I've actually already gone ahead and crushed up the Camden tablets just take two spoons you can crush those pretty easy so I've got essentially five Camden tablets here so this was ready to go in second thing would be the potassium sorbate so I like these little containers for storage makes it easy to store one thing that we do know we do know that we have a little over five gallons there's a line right here that shows your five gallon mark here in this big mouth bubbler that would be almost three teaspoons we're gonna go ahead and add these in that's ready to go I'm gonna remove my airlock slide that back on the gas or that we have has basically a little bung on here so all you need to do is just slide this into the container the bung sits right there and then I've got my drill on low and let's go ahead and see how we're doing now that we've got the slow mixing done we've got the ingredients mixed in now what we need to do is kick this up a notch so I've got my drill on high let's go ahead and see how much gas we still have left in here [Music] I'd say there's a bit more gas in there what's going hit this a couple more times okay so now that's the reason why you de gas your wine so if you look at that now obviously we know that that's not yeast that's coming through there that's actually all the gas that's left over from that fermentation process so as clear as that looked there was still a tremendous amount of gas in there so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna let this settle I'm gonna hit this a couple more times just to make sure I get as much gas out of there as possible obviously we have all of our ingredients completely mixed in there at this point so I'm gonna do this a couple more times and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna cut and actually show you how we're gonna go ahead and get this Sweden because you can't just pour straight-up sugar in here to back suite near one so here we are it's about six hours later almost seven hours later but we're about midday we do know that we want to get the back sweetening done here this evening so while we have time for this to cool we're going to go ahead and make the syrup for sweetening our wine so we do actually have two wines that we're working with here the today the one we're not going to be talking about is a cranapple wine so we do have that that we're gonna be back sweetening as well so I'm using a little more of this than we typically would for the five gallon batch of apple wine that we're working with today either way what I have here is I have six cups of just basic white sugar so I'm gonna pour that into here and then what we're gonna do to actually make the syrup is we're gonna take half as much water if I had three cups of water added it back into the sugar and before he wants to slide in a little bit closer we're gonna go ahead and get the stove turned on and we do pretty much want to bring this up to a boil so a simple syrup would typically be one part sugar in one part water but all we really need to do at this point is just get the sugar dissolved into the water see what this looks like once it's finally there's a little bit of bubbling on top clears up a really really good there's no graininess at all in this so we know that we've got a nice clean liquid in here that sugar is fully dissolved which will allow this to easily mix into the wine and not get any like sediment from the sugar itself settling to the bottom of the wine so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna leave this alone let it cool off really really well for the rest of this afternoon and then when we come back - yeah we're gonna sweeten that wine here we are back again it's about 3:30 in the afternoon so this has actually been off gassing all the sulfur that's created from the potassium metabisulfite so at this point 10 plus hours later we're ready to go ahead and back sweeten so I have our syrup right here it's cooled off quite a bit and you can see from a color standpoint it's pretty clear there's a little bit of a haze on the top which is okay we'll get through that but we're gonna start out with about half a cup we want to keep our specific specific gravity way way down so we're at 0.99 zero now so what we're gonna do is add about half a cup of sweetener at a time my guess is we probably won't go above half a cup of the sugar or the syrup so we're gonna go ahead and add that now now before I do that I do want to point out we did talk a little bit about what we were going to be using as far as tools today one of the things I mentioned was actually a wine thief however because we have a spigot we won't need to use a wine thief in order to fill our vessel to test our specific gravity so obviously if you don't have this you would use a wine thief because we don't we're not gonna have to do that so what I'm gonna do now we're going to go ahead and add the sweetener we're gonna start with 1/2 a cup okay so we got half a cup of sweetener in there now what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take my drill again and I've got on the low setting this time because we're not trying to dig ass I just want to stir let's keep that on the lower setting that should be good enough so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna let that settle just a little bit and then we're gonna do the most important thing which is give it a taste okay that's really really good still nice and dry like that little tiny touch of sweetness it's the right spot I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have the boss try this see what she thinks boss taste test approved so we're not gonna add any more sugar to this one we're just fine so now what we need to do is determine our specific gravity for our final record because we do keep records of every single reading to make sure that we can try to duplicate it as often as possible so now we're gonna do is we're gonna fill this vessel up what's nice about this spicket makes it very very easy to go ahead and fill now one of the things you'll notice as I start to fill this is we're gonna get a little bit of foam however if I do my job right when it came to degassing it should dissipate very very quickly and so you can see it is so there we go you can see the color just a beautiful in fact it looks like beer so it's a very beautiful well I guess it kind of looks like saturda it but ultimately you can see just a beautiful yellow slightly amber color now we're gonna do is get our hydrometer test our specific gravity and see what we're gonna finish at 0.99 for which is perfect so we came up just a couple digits there but 0.99 four is really what we're shooting for we wanted to stay below one to have a good dry wine a little bit of back sweetening there but just where we wanted that to finish out so that's it for back sweetening to what we're going to do is we're going to let this sit we've got a closet that we keep our wines that are finishing in we're gonna let this sit for a week we just want to ensure that we don't kick-start fermentation again so we're just gonna keep an eye on make sure we don't have any bubbling at all this will settle anything that any hard particles that might still be in there we'll go ahead and settle down to the bottom and then we'll be able to bring this back out and bottle it but that is the next episode so just one I thank you for joining us today if you haven't done so already subscribe to the channel questions or comments leave

can farm on the edge of nowhere so can you so we've got this got brought up [Music] do over [Music] you", "xn1uURPM_RY": "so Ryan's taking me into his world to show me how angry orchard makes their hard cider I mean I get a first-hand look into his passion these are actually old apple trees off the farm that's so cool this is the coolest dang thing this is all yours to play with and have fun with Wow yeah it's great love it one of the great parts of this job is being able to educate drinkers on what cider is and what it can be where it comes from this is where it starts yeah this is where we press fruit well tip the apples into a sorter and this allows us to do a visual inspection so we can pick out any bad apples can we do a little demonstration like right now and I think really we're gonna do that yeah they're perfect where's the batter wait here what about that one yeah you could toss that one we want to pull apples like this out yeah that'll go to the Kendall's is that already have fermented like that's a good thing can I do this yeah but that'll take your arm off so watch out ha ha this is serious man ok maybe I'll let you take it I'm here so after we do a visual inspection you go through this tunnel so this washes the apples so they're ready to go up this elevator and go into the mill and you'll hear them in a second they're gonna start to get ground up it smells good already once it goes to the press that will squeeze all the juice out you can see the juice dropping out right here oh my gosh look at that go excellent vintage wouldn't you say it's the pump yep so send into the cellar for fermentation can we go see yeah solutely I'm gonna follow this Wow look at that is that where all the cider goes yeah so ferment this and in a couple weeks we'll have a finished cider now do you um yeah we got to taste it for quality right you want to go to the tasting room and try some stuff let's do that yeah all right thanks look at this place okay so what do we have here my friend so these are all angry orchard ciders different flavors of hard ciders we who knew this one is crisp which is our flagship cider it's got a little bit of sweetness and a little bit of mouths puckering drying tannin so this is it the moment of truth this is the one that crazed your famous Crisp Apple yep I get to experience not only the fruits of my labor but the fruits of Ryan's passion as well Wow I like that okay so now what about this book it's called the old fashioned molded after a traditional old-fashioned cocktail cherries are in there that's delicious this last one is called dear Brittany we age it in old cognac barrels oh that's dang good wow what an experience to see the euphoria in Ryan's eyes while he took me through the steps of making hard cider it's the same dedication that I feel about building treehouses this enthusiasm for your craft is something we can all relate to regardless of what you're creating", "F3JnJVJdxfQ": "hi I'm Stephen without perturbing garden CA so today we're gonna make some hard apple cider so the first thing you'll need is Apple so we're gonna take some of these apples and bring them to the whiskey Tango brewery in this episode we're gonna go start to finish making hard apple cider so a couple weeks ago we collected apples from mr. Baker and mrs. Baker's yard they've got two apple trees there so this is the culmination of that tonight we're gonna bottle it before we do that we're gonna jump back and show you all the steps in bonus video what you'll see is a couple places you can click to jump to other parts of the video so if you've already completed a step feel free to click and that will bring you to the very next step of this process so as you can see there's plenty of apples left on this tree although we are a little bit late in the season lots of apples have fallen we won't really use these apples because they're they're a little bit damaged didn't concern our batch so this is apple tree one we're gonna take apples from this tree was actually pruned in the spring and is yielding much larger apples probably about 25% larger that's holding on to its apples quite a bit better than the one that was unpruned this is apple tree 2 and this one was unpruned this year and is yielding quite a few apples but they're quite a bit smaller and they are dropping a little bit faster the apple on the right the larger one is from apple tree 1 and from the left is apple tree 2 you can notice the size difference here and that has to do with proper pruning of the tree so we finished collecting the apples about half of that blue toad and a full 5 gallon pail the next thing I've done is I Prince the apples off just cool tap water to rinse them off and during that time you look for damage so these are the good ones and in the water and these are the ones that I pulled out you look for bird damage like or this looks quite splotchy and you know when you cut this one open and it doesn't look like a good flash I'm not going to use these ones because I don't have to here but these predominantly should be the good ones so as we go to the next stage which is juicing we'll actually we could be cutting them in half and you will be able to look for damage again just to make sure that we're not putting stuff that may be rotten into our hard apple cider now it's time to juice the apples so what you're gonna need is a sanitized primary fermenter a stir stick a juicer you can use an apple crusher and press as well but for those of us with limited space little juicers fit better on the shelf then you know the big press and the apples these are the apples we pick today but you can also use store-bought apples and all you need to really do with any of these apples is cut them quarter them put them in anaise this will fit down the chute quite a bit better and then what we're gonna do now is we're gonna turn this on and they're dropping some bits as you can see the juice comes out this boat right into the primary fermenter and the pulp comes out the backside you just need to make sure you're watching that so you don't end up with good overflowing and making a mess so that's your wife gives you crap does you know that'll happen so I'm gonna continue to do this the huge bucket of apples behind this I'm gonna get through that and then I'll show you the next stage so we were finally done juicing these these apples and it's kind of hard to tell what it looks like we got just over five liters what we wanted is to get enough juice to make neither 3.75 liters or 7.4 liters which is one gallon or two gallons because most recipes on the internet show for one gal one gallon recipes so with that phone broken down it looks like we ended up just about five so seven and a half liters so we're in pretty good shape here to make a two gallon batch we did have a lot of wastage lots of the apples we were probably about a week late on harvesting these apples but I mean at the end of the day you live you learn we got about a happy or two thirds of the apples we're good for for brewing the other the other third that's okay they'll make great compost so this these apples are awesome for the compost the apple mush all that if you're not going to use it to make a an applesauce or whatever this stuff is great for your compost high-sugar breaks down quickly it'll enrich just everything in that comp the next step here is Camden tablets these these are a sterilizer what it basically does is it puts a pause on the natural yeast in here doesn't quite sterilize them or kill them it doesn't some cases but for the most part it just puts it a pause and then tomorrow in 24 hours when we put our yeast in here that we want it will give that yeast kind of the edge up and what it'll do is that the yeast we want the champagne use we want will quite literally out-compete it so this is one to two tap this says one to two tablets per gallon if used as a sterilizer for wine must this is kind of a wine last year a lot of the mixture just stand for 24 hours still well and they're not used so we are going to crush these tablets so I'm gonna take two of them so just crush these between two candy and tablets between two spoons makes a nice fine powder make sure to get the rest of that with these and then just mix it in well it's important to mix that in well cuz it's sitting on that that pulp on the top and we want that in the liquid so that it can do its job so there's another way that you can actually sterilize this instead of the Kenda Camden tablets you can bring this to a kind of a simmer and olive oil but a simmer I basically pasteurize this material I'm choosing not to do that because I I'm a little worried that if I do that it will take some of the more delicate flavors out of these apples and as we saw earlier yet we don't have a lot of apples to spare so so we're not going to do a yeast start today so basically what a you start is is you take some of this product here you take a little bit of sugar a little bit of wine nutrient and you get it started in a in a separate container all that really allows us to use to get a good head start I don't think that'll be a problem here today so we're not going to do it so if you do want to do a hard apple cider from a commercially available apple cider not an alcoholic of course the preservatives in there can cause some issues the way that you want to get around that it simply is to do the the yeast starter that'll make sure that they've got a robust community able to kind of handle that and to get around the preservatives and kind of overcome the preservatives if you do that yeast starter and you're using a commercially available cider that has preservatives in it it'll overcome it it doesn't have preservatives it's still a good idea the reasons why we sterilize this and we used Camden tablets or we do a pasteurizing on this is the fact that there are there is yeast on on the apples on the outside of the apples there's yeast and that's just naturally occurring now if you wanted to go what I'm gonna call old school here you can just simply crush this up and let it start what you're gonna end up with is a pretty inconsistent product from batch to batch and lower alcohol content I want a more consistent product alcohol content is a nice added bonus but I want a more consistent product so I'm choosing to use the cabin tablets here we're going to come back in 24 hours once the captain tablets have had their their time to work then we'll add the yeast and begin the fermentation process what I'm gonna do is I'm going to cover this up and leave it exactly where it is then I'm gonna clean up because if I don't you know I'll get in trouble and we'll see you tomorrow so it's been 24 hours so the next step is to get the yeast in there so the Camden tablets have done their magic they've made this ready for the yeast so what you'll need in this step is a packet of champagne yeast champagne yeast works very very well for this if you go to your brewing store they might have a particular one that works well with apple cider but I mean champagne yeast will do exceptionally well it'll also need yeast nutrient although there's tons of sugar in here there's not a ton of nutrients for the yeast and the yeast nutrient you need one tablespoon so just clean tablespoon you'll need to sterilize and clean or your spoon again and then one of the recipes I found said one cup one dry measuring cup of brown sugar and one dry cup of white sugar should be fine for one gallon now I've got nearly two gallons in here but I'm only going to use one and one just because I don't want too sweet of a product and that's just personal taste you can do two and two if you've got two gallons but I don't see a need for that so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put in the sugar and then mix it around the brown sugar should bring a nice taste to this so tomorrow we're going to have to strain this and again so tomorrow I am gonna have to strain this there is quite a bit of pulp my juicer just worked a little bit too well if you get a maybe a finer mesh juicer then you'll get less pulp in this but then you'll probably get less juice as well you could use kind of a peck to lace which breaks down the cellular structure but I'm gonna try it without today why not I got more than I was expecting so so we got the sugar mixed in so now it's time for the East nutrient yeast nutrient just basically provides the the stuff that you Sneed outside of sugar in order to procreate well yes I did say procreate it's one tablespoon so that's again a dry dry measurement and you just kind of level it off in the bag and then again sprinkle that in we're saving the yeast for last I wanna make sure that it is nice and clipped up so that you don't end up with moisture getting in there again another mix I'm choosing to leave this in the primary fermenter for another day just a lot of the yeast some some time with some oxygen to really get going in here I didn't do the the starter so this will list us know most recipes call for about three-quarters of a packet for one gallon but you don't need that so just sprinkle it in and a light stir after this I'm gonna leave this for 24 hours and then we'll put it in the carboy so it's day three so this has been fermenting actively for 24 hours so in this step what you'll need is a funnel a bit of kind of this cheesecloth filtering stuff and what I've done is I've actually cut this to about a quarter folded it a couple of times and put it into the funnel and that's to help get some of the pulp out because this the juicer that we used was a little little excess of the other things you'll need it's some sterile water and a bung with an airlock on it and that's for the second step here so we're just gonna use the tap to filter the must because this is now called must it's an active brewing and it we're gonna filter into this nice clean three gallon carboy so what ended up happening is that juicer that I have works really well most of what ended up in the primary fermenter was a very pulpy apple to slash sauce so what I ended up doing the cheesecloth was working tousle and I required a little bit of mechanical force so I jury-rigged myself a little press so I used a fine mesh strainer and just a corresponding Bowl that fit into it and slowly kind of press that in there got to give credit where credit is due this is completely my wife's idea no need for an apple press when you can go into the kitchen and find stuff that works it takes a little bit longer but regardless so I have what I'm gonna say it's about two gallons of juice and the yeast should be working in there just fine so what I'm gonna do is I'm not overly concerned with like a strong heavy flavor I actually prefer a little bit of a lighter flavor so I'm gonna take bottled water I'm actually gonna top that up a little bit closer to the top so that we end up with a less headspace in the carboy and the reason why I use bottled water is twofold number one the most important one is chlorine there is no chlorine in this this particular water the other thing is the water we have here in alberta is very hard and that does come out in the taste of whether it's a hard apple cider or wine or beer I just find it comes through the taste and comes through very sharply having those those molecules in there so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fill this up [Music] so should take about four of them my buddy pickles just came down can't see her but she's standing under the camera she thinks I'm nuts sitting here talking to myself you can't fill this I saw on the internet you can fill this with things like vodka and the stout but I don't see why I'm sure for the extra sugar that we've added we'll end up with a little bit of PG 18 product anyways so I don't I don't see they need some good vodka now what's next this is an airlock so what you want is again sterile water you fill this up to the line there's a faint line on all of these what this airlock does is it prevents oxygen from coming back down but the carbon dioxide can escape and the water acts as kind of a barrier well along the carbon dioxide to escape will won't let the oxygen in which will sour it so I'm just gonna like this too a lot to make sure that I get a good solid lock press R in there nice and tight and we should see very shortly this starting to bubble away so next we're gonna leave it for 15 days you can check the specific gravity or you can do the bubble count so we've now let this ferment for two weeks and fermentation is basically ceased that doesn't mean that there is an active yeast in here it just means that it's it's done this current phase so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna carefully plunge this down and citement so now transfer this into the primary fermenter from which I'll do the bottle if you do have a sediment problem or you've sized up a lot of sediment you're gonna rack it let it rest for a day or two in the racket again that'll help you clear it out what I have here is a resealable pressurize continue to have to make sure that these are our pressure rated so what I've done is I've actually bought these from the liquor store consumed what was in and then continue to reuse it for my own brew every once in a while you will have to replace the seal some people recommend every time what I do is I flip it on the side to side and every once in a while I do replace it I have clean and sanitized these containers earlier today and what I'll do now is I'll bottle it into these I don't think you'll require any extra sugar because that will do have quite a bit of sugar and I did add a little bit of sugar earlier in this process do you have my bottling tube here what this is is a tube that has a plug on here hit the bottom it will release let's go to glass end bat after you move this hard snuggly fits and to the tap component of the primary fermenter you can also use a suction method where you suck it down you create that suction and as the bottle fills you make sure that it comes higher than the water column within the container this way you don't have to do that you simply lift the tube and it stops the flow so I get a couple of bottles ready in a row and what I do is I open this tab you just watch for it to come up the bottle and it usually doesn't take that long to do it's easier if the bottom of the bottle is flat some little pin could touch it so before it hits the top you switch it out you just move to the next one so seal this up making sure that the the plunger is centered and we'll come back at Christmas when this has had some time to age and for the flavors to develop and taste it so over the next two weeks it should carbonate and if you are quite eager to get into it for Thanksgiving you can I am just gonna wait until Christmas when my family is in town to enjoy this just a note about the bottles you can take off the labels fairly easily on these bottles some of the other bottles require a little bit more effort to to remove and all I do for those is I actually take a knife and soak the bottle in hot water and part of the cleaner and remove it with a knife later just take the knife in that attack it and if you have any of the residual glue you can use Google on it and it works quite well but these these beer bottles I've gotten a little bit lazy and not remove the label it's gonna finish up bottling these and we'll come back in a second thank you very much for joining me I appreciate it very much if you like this video please subscribe or join us at Facebook at www.hp.com/support urban garden have a great day [Music]", "NUvvlgpKzyo": "[Music] stick with me because I'm gonna teach you a very simple and inexpensive way to make hard cider thanks for joining me I hope you enjoy this section of my brewing series today we're going to talk about how to make dirt-cheap really good hard cider and I'm going to show you real simple way to do it now before we get into that if this the first time you're at my channel I do a variety of different stories but all my stories always have a positive message that help you get ahead a little in life so this will show you how to save a little money and make a little healthier alcohol if there's such thing is a healthy alcohol right but it'll also it's just fun to brew if you haven't tried it this is the simplest and easy way to brew one thing I do want to say is even if you don't drink alcohol brewing is still a lot of fun and it's a very useful skill for self-sufficiency you can use this to make vinegar you can convert alcohol to vinegar you can also use this to make alcohol for a car and antiseptic so just because we're watching this brewing video and you don't drink doesn't mean you can't find this useful you can find lots of uses for alcohol so enjoy this here we go so before we really begin I'm going to use these containers these glass gallon jars because I like the wide mouth because you can put your whole hand in here and clean it it's a lot easier to clean than the traditional neck and then these screw right on top so these what I think or I think the pear was about 25 dollars altogether and it comes with the bubblers and the the lids I like it a lot so first thing you're going to do is sterilize these puppies and how we're going to do that is we're gonna put this this one step no runs cleanser in some water and then dunk the jars in you can use about as hot as what you can stand let's skip it this now if you don't have this you can use soap and water it usually turns out just fine but this is a lot easier just that stuff air dry so I'm going to do that and we'll be back we're in do one tablespoon here per gallon so this thing will probably I probably put about two gallons in so we'll put two scoops and you want to sterilize because if there's stray kinds of bacteria they're wrong kind of yeast it'll make your brew taste funny so it's just a good thing to do so everything here has been sterilized dried and then refilled so I am using Champagne East I love champagne I like the taste it comes out with but you can use different kind of yeast to get different flavors if you want sweeter flavors there's some British eats that are good for that so the thing about this though is when you buy this packet it is for five gallons and I'm only making one at a time so I had to cut this five ways now you can weigh it out but I don't really have a scale that's working for that so I know that this package still has three uses left I've already used two of them so what I do is I just cut them up you know and in the even looking rows and that's pretty good your your yeast doesn't have to be exact but you can't like double it or something or you'll probably blow up the bottle so you just got to be careful on how that's done now the other thing about yeast is you'll get much much better start if you put it in warm water and mix it before you throw it in your batch the temperature has to be between the package says for you international folks 38:41 Celsius for if you're in the u.s. between 100 105 now I don't have a thermometer so what I do is I know that's about shower temperature when I put my finger in it it doesn't bar in as shower temperature we're good to go and then when hands are all sterilized I dip them in that stuff so I can touch every and so I'm gonna heat this water up to about my best guess of room temperature and that's it now you can completely ignore all these steps you can just take the water in the yeast and throw it in and not heat up water but it'll take a much slower start so you just have to be careful with that okay I'm gonna do this for a rapid start so we can drink it within five to six days so I'm gonna start with a gallon a muscleman cider now I like this because it's a hundred percent juice and I know some people are gonna watching this this is that GMO or is that it's not organic juice or whatever and I love these people because it's like I'm only going to destroy my liver with the finest gluten free organic grass-fed it's like you know you're drinking booze you get to you throw that card out the window now what you do want to get any anything will do as long it's about a hundred percent cider but you're trying to avoid it if it is made with potassium sorbate that will slow your yeast down considerably you can still brew with it but it takes like six to seven times longer what happens is the potassium sorbate will block the yeast from growing now the yeast that you put in will can still do his job and eat and poop alcohol but the poly sorb the potassium sorbate stops that process so if you have to you can use it but it's not going to be like a six-day brew if you use it it's gonna take weeks the best thing to do is try to get the natural stuff if you go to something in season like an apple farm you know if it's in season you buy the fresh pressed cider you need to have to put yeast in it it's there's natural yeast in there that'll work but you know you can only do that a month or two of the years so most the time you're just making it out of stuff and Plus this was about five dollars you know to make this would be a gallon of hard cider I would imagine that would cost more in twenty bucks probably so we're gonna save a little money doing it this way I've added the yeast in warm water to the bottom then I put in a cup of brown sugar to one gallon so there's some brown sugar you can use white but I think Brown tastes better now the problem with this is you want to leave about two fingers in your container of oxygen and you set your bubbler up so the water is right at the right line if you don't like the one to the left here I didn't leave enough room so it's actually bubbling up my cider it's not so good when that happens you have to put a towel around it the other thing to remember is it's important to brew at somewhere between 72 to 78 degrees I have to use this pad because I live in cold weather so I'll link that in the description it's a heating pad that just keeps it steady it helps it brew way better so this is the vessel I'm going to transfer the hard cider into and is an also a one gallon jug and the reason I do this is because if you look at the bottom you will see the yeast cake there and you really don't want to drink that so I'm gonna scoop this out and actually put it in here and I like the nozzle because it's high enough up that even if this forms a little yeast cake in here you can it won't clog it up now like I said there is still gas coming off so if you don't drink like a cup or two you could blow up the glass no there's no venting on this so make sure that you know you you drink it when at least a portion of it pretty soon if you put it in so what I'm gonna use is the reason we use the wide mouth glass here so you can get a ladle in and we're gonna move it over a ladle at a time now if you had a they do sell like a siphon hose this is the cheapest way to do it they do to have like siphon wands if you want to put it in bottles I wasn't gonna bottle any of this it's kind of a pain this is a fast easy down and dirty way to do it the reason we're labeling instead of just picking it up and pouring it is to not disturb the yeast cake on the bottom and we're gonna leave about the last inch of the alcohol on the bottom because that's where all the congeners are and those are the things that give you hangovers so I'm going to leave the heavier alcohols up in here and it's kind of like the easy way to decant it now you can also do it through a cheesecloth or a strainer I kind of like the raw cider this tastes like drinking apple juice or apple cider where it's not so clear and purified you put a clarifier in here if you want but I find them gross because they're mainly made up of seashells and nasty stuff so I'm going the more natural the better yes I know I'm drinking alcohol oh not really allowed to say anything the funny thing is I really don't drink much I make this because I just enjoy brewing I end up giving all of it away practically I'll have a class and that'll be about it so we'll clip back here in a second I'll show you at the end all right so the hard cider is done I left about two fingers that includes a yeast cake I might take one more dip out of that one more ladle I don't give you almost a gallon you're a little light on a gallon I leave us some air so it doesn't blow out and I'll just cap this up and we'll try some now a tip here though don't throw the yeast cake down the drain bad idea what I do is I rinse this out and I just go throw it in the yard it is you know it's basically biomatter go throw it in the garden just don't throw that too much of the alcohol in the garden try to get the east so there you go one more thing I want to say here is once you put this in a frigerator it'll really slow down the yeast growth now it will keep going and eventually this won't taste as good or it'll start getting more and more alcohol so my advice is to drink this within a few days you know try to try to schedule this so you make it and then you know maybe you have some friends over the weekend or you and your family drink this one thing I want to talk about though is I recommended earlier but I can't tell you how much better it is to have a wide-mouthed jar for these it's easier to clean it's easier to you know Lael stuff out of it's just simpler like this this is my ghetto prison hooch this was just a free bottle of wine right this came in of wine bottle and although the bottle was free it was awesome it's much more difficult to clean and it's hard to decant you're gonna end up getting a bunch of yeast cake you have to use like cheesecloth and filter it so if you're going for a low budget sure you use the free stuff if you have a choice I think I paid somewhere like 20 3 or 4 bucks for both of these on Amazon and if you consider that you can make a gallon of hard cider yourself um and a few gallons you've paid for the whole setup when you're going to save a lot of money compared to just going and buying it in the store so there you go I will link all that in the description below of all the brewing tools I used so this is the hard cider in the Christmas glass yeah yeah I came out really good Wow that's pretty darn good I think you guys will like that one I hope that inspired you to finally try to go out and brew it's really as simple as hitting some cider throwing in some sugar throw it in some yeast making sure you know you put a bubbler or a balloon on it and you're good to go that's it so I'm um I'm very excited the thing about this though is YouTube doesn't like me showing people how to make alcohol and usually D monetize these so you might have to find it over it library or speech eventually or over here I'm also on d2 for steam it and mines in  shoot I'm on all the alternative platforms if you're over there please come on over and say hi and also um a lot of my

oatmeal and the other thing you use are the ingredients for an apple pie so i like to for my breakfast make oatmeal and i use two cups of water i would normally use one cup of oatmeal but today i'm only going to use a half a cup of oatmeal then i'm going to substitute for the remaining grain i'm going to use a third a cup of wheat that makes a wheat oatmeal or wheat porridge a third of a cup i you can experiment with the the flour won't need is you need don't need as much flour for water ratio okay also you can use an apple because it's the fall we have a lot of apples you can put some sugar in it because you like to have that in your apple pie and you can put a little cinnamon and nutmeg in it if you want i like to put some fat in the apple pie crust i have some coconut oil that i've been using up and this looks like pretty good stuff so um i've got the water boiling i'm going to put it in it's going to cook in one minute i'm going to hit pause here just so i um can use my hands while i put the ingredients in okay okay there it is that's the um apple pie cooking good thing about this pie is that you can cook in one minute or you can cook it in um two or three minutes it really doesn't matter how long you do it and it's not that sensitive to the ingredients you can put in a little bit more of any one ingredient that you like um and the pie still comes out fine okay thanks", "xeKQk3ku8yo": "hello and welcome to a very special edition of cooking with a new legend Chuck's alone because do I got some for you today and I'm going to tell you what it will make you absolutely [ __ ] stagger we're making apple pie moonshine and I'm telling you what this is such a mild beverage that you can even serve this at your church sociable that's how mild this is I'm going to teach you how to make it it's actually a punch but they call it apple pie moonshine I got the recipe from a very good friend of mine his name's Larry I appreciate it Larry I Love You Man you know I'll just look forward to singing with your brother but anyway let me get on with this now I reduce this recipe because I'm making no six quarts of this this year will probably yield you about I don't know two quarts and a half or something like that I did the math but I reduced all the ingredients why we're going to start off with first is we're going to start off with a little bit of apple cider right here we're just going to put it in the pie there's your apple cider that's 32 ounces of apple cider then what we're going to do here is we're going to do another 32 ounces of apple juice this is just apple juice that's all it is right there there ain't no pranks no kiddin nothing with that because I found out if you screw a man's alcohol that's gonna whip your ass and I'm going to tell you what we got our sugar right here we got this is 3/8 of a cup of sugar don't ask me how in the hell I came to 3/8 of a cup I could've fired a 3/8 cup anywhere I look but [ __ ] it I went ahead and decided this was 3/8 so that's what it is that's just regular pure white cane sugar now we got actually this is a half of a one and a quarter cup of brown sugar dark brown sugar once again I couldn't find the right man of cups but I just estimated it doesn't matter nobody's going to care anyway then what we got here is we got to sediment sticks just throw them in there oh you have your Grandpa's fans that's probably about the size of his old scribbled up dick but anyway I'm with the cooking because this here is a cooking show but we got what's called apple pie spice I mean this smells good I mean and I know for a fact you're going to use a half a tablespoon so right there a half a tablespoon in that okay now what we're going to do there is we're going to put this lid back on because that [ __ ] right there is expensive for the amount of weight that that is it weighs all it costs almost more than silver so I'm telling you we're going to come over here to the stove now we're going to put the stove on we're going to put this stove on and we're going to bring this to a boil and I'm going to use my trusty whisk here to stir it around and get it going all right we're going to go ahead and we're just going to get this year going right here we're going to get that going I mean I'm going to tell you what this smells as good this smells as good as grandma's house this smells as good as grandma's house is going to ever [ __ ] get with that apple pie spice right there that's the take it and then later on we're going to add the corn liquor white lightning and moonshine we're going to kick this on [ __ ] up we're going to get them where you can enjoy it get a buzz on I'll tell you right now the only thing you should ever drive when you're drunk is your old lady that's the only thing you need to drive when you're drunk is your only but anyway don't drink and drive a motorized vehicle motorcycle hell don't even get on your horse and you're drunk just don't drink and drive anything that's my only advice to you because when you drink and drive you might the life you save might be somebody else's and if you drink a dragon you're basically your [ __ ] but anyway I'm back to cooking now I got time going all that right here but anyway you bring this up to a boil that's no good right there you bring this up to a boil and then you want to let it cool down you want to set the room temperature now I know that there's some [ __ ] out there it's going to take you can cheat on this recipe and it was before the fact that I got very intelligent friends out there that's going to try this recipe I wouldn't even give you this advice but if you try to put your alcohol your corn liquor moonshine white lightning in that son-of-a-bitch while it's hot or while it's cooking you're going to destroy the alcohol contents going to evaporate and that ain't going to be nothing but a expensive punch right there that ain't going to have no no effect on you you won't be able to stagger down stagger fall down make it a side yourself embarrass yourself and do what drunks do now I'll occasionally sip on this because I like to be in total control myself and anyone that knows me when I'm sober because the last thing I need to do is get drunk because it's like my personality magnetites a million billion zillion times and I'd be all over the place like a [ __ ] pinball but anyway I'm going to come back later I got to go up to the woods and I got to see somebody about getting a little bit of corn liquor but when this is is cooked when it cools down I'll be back with the corn liquor and I'll be putting it in there and the best thing to do with this is after you had that corn liquor it's stored in a cool dry place and let it set up for a couple weeks and that's when it's the best but anyway I'm here my pot of coal and then I got a [ __ ] go I got to stir that [ __ ] and believe me it's going to be good I'm going to give them a little you over here I get him sloppy ass drunk because I know his wife she's down in Charleston and the best Ida plays when the old lady ain't home because you can have some fun then man and I'm going to I'm going to teach him all my bad habit so that he grows up and he can be just like me but anyway we gotta go now goes doesn't start the boil I still got a ride up to the woods and I got to get me some moonshine hopefully then hopefully I will get shot but anyway I'll see you up at the spill in a little bit and I'm telling you right now and also I just want to add this before I go if you need the ingredients on how to properly make this I suggest you rewind the [ __ ] and watch it again that's the only thing I got to say in special shout-out to my friend Jeff I'm telling you at your age man he should be getting drunk and [ __ ] win they're not playing video games and your boyfriend in New Jersey but anyway that's it for right now I'll be back later bye oh god I'm back I'm back he gave me five gallons of it right there Lord five dollars that's a lot right there but what you're going to do is once you get done following that and you let it set the room temperature like I did you're going to add it into this right there that's roughly uh twelve ounces of it right there that's all he gets because that's what strong stuff right there then what you're gonna do is you gotta mix it you got to mix it in there man that's some strong stuff right there I can smell it and that's good and then I'm going to go ahead you're going to put two seven sticks out at the bottom of it then hopefully I can hold on now I got to find a way to do this where I ain't going to spill everything all over the place put a little bit in there a little bit in here the rest of it in there and there it is apple pie moonshine like I told you this is something you can take to your church on a sociable you could set it down in front of everybody let them get a little bit of snort on there let them drink let them have a good time I got to be five gallons off loving and I'll tell you what he wants his [ __ ] job back he told me said this jug right here it's been in my family since I forget what the [ __ ] he said but it's been in his family since 1897 he wants some [ __ ] back and said when you get down with the five gallons that I better ran you off go ahead and bring me back my damn job so I can fill it but anyway I was asked if I would actually drink this I made it this is a good [ __ ] right here I got the recipe from a friend Larry and and this is just that's some good [ __ ] sipping sipping shine right there but anyway deafness right here I'm telling you it's hitting me already but damn it I like it it's good ain't nothing like hittin your moonshine drunk God and remember if you got to drink the only thing you need to drive us her but anyway I don't like being seen on camera and toxicated this [ __ ] hits you quick about ready go [ __ ] down so I'm going to tell y'all right now whip you up a bro get you some damn moonshine add this punch right here if you can't find real moonshine then you can substitute it with Everclear but anyway that's a nice drink right there I think I'm just going to go ahead and have me another sip but anyway that's it enjoy it have a good time and remember the only thing you need to drive is her when you're drunk bye", "vfzamJfDBWM": "hi everyone my name is leah and welcome to the kitchen today we're going to be starting a new segment on the channel that i like to call thirsty thursday where we'll feature homemade cocktails and mixed drinks as well as other home brewed beers and hard cider to kick things off i'm going to invite jean into the kitchen and he's going to show us what we're doing today [Music] thanks leah today we're going to be making a homemade homebrew hard apple cider this will actually be a three-part video series so you want to make sure you're subscribing to my youtube channel so you're up to date on each video the first part we're going to make actually make the cider and go over the process of warming it adding sugar and getting it pitching the yeast and putting it in the carb way to let it ferment for the first two weeks the second part we're going to transfer it from one carbohydrate to the other if you don't know what a carboy is we'll be going over that and we're going to in this video actually add fruit to make it a blueberry hard cider the third part the best part bottling and enjoying so let's get started [Music] first let's go over the ingredients and some of the equipment you will need for ingredients it's rather simple a gallon of your favorite apple juice or apple cider now make sure that it is pasteurized but without preservatives today we're going to be using mont's apple juice and if we read the label it is pasteurized but it only has ascorbic acid which is basically vitamin c so this one will be fine after that we need a packaging yeast you can use an ale yeast that you would use for beer or today we're going to be using a wine use premier block from red star i like adding cinnamon sticks for the extra flavor and a cup of brown sugar the brown sugar and the cinnamon is totally optional but the cinnamon will add flavor and spice and the brown sugar is going to add a little bit to that alcohol and percentage at the end now let's go over the equipment that we need for today first we need a large pot and a slotted spoon once we've finished preparing our cider we're going to need a one gallon class carboy you can get this as a jug of juice at the store or i bought mine from any local homebrew store once we have the cider in here we're also going to need a blow-off tube and a rubber stopper and later we're going to replace this with an airlock i will also be using a hydrometer a thermometer a hydrometer test tube and a mini auto siphon the first step to making cider is to clean and sanitize everything that is going to touch our cider i can't stress this enough if there's any bacteria you run the risk of basically ruining an entire batch of delicious cider and i know we wouldn't want to do that for cleaning i use versatile oxiclean this is perfect and it cleans every piece of equipment once we finish cleaning we're going to rinse that thoroughly because we don't want any residue left from there we're going to use star sand we're going to mix the star sand with distilled water at the appropriate ratio listed on the bottom to sanitize our equipment with star sand it is a non-rinse solution so you do not need the rinse once you've sanitized the equipment first we will begin by using oxiclean versatile to clean all of our equipment that will be touching the cider be sure to scrub well with a brewing dedicated sponge and rinse thoroughly as we do not want any of the oxiclean residue to be left behind [Music] next we will use star sand to sanitize all of our equipment mix according to the star sand bottle with distilled water allow the proper contact time of at least 30 seconds on all of the equipment do not rinse the star sand and remember don't fear the foam now that we're done cleaning and sanitizing it's time for the fun part making our cider pour a half gallon of apple juice or cider into a pot next add one cup of brown sugar turn on the stove to medium heat and stir to dissolve the brown sugar [Music] once the sugar is fully dissolved in the decider turn off the heat and use the auto-siphon to transfer the juice to the carboy [Music] next add one cinnamon stick and let steep in the warm juice top off the carboy with the rest of the juice until you reach the one gallon mark on the carb way then insert the thermometer to ensure that the cider is cooled to below 90 degrees fahrenheit before pitching the yeast before we add our yeast we want to take a hydrometer rating to get our original gravity with our original gravity and our final gravity we will be able to calculate our abd fill your tube to the 100 milliliter mark to take a hydrometer reading once the cider has cooled pitch the yeast into the cider most yeast packs can make up to 5 gallons so half of the pack is plenty put the cap on the carboy and shake the cider gently to distribute the yeast then add the rubber stopper and food grade tubing to allow for any blow-off during fermentation now we're going to place our cider in a room-temperature dark place for two weeks and let the yeast do its magic so be sure to stay tuned for part two when we transfer the cider into the secondary fermentation if you liked this video please be sure to give it a

teach you how to make\ndelicious home-cooked dishes to share with your friends and family. Today we're making this\ninsanely indulgent apple pies. The perfect balance of\nsweetness and acidity. Like bursts in your mouth and\nyou're like, ah, oh my gosh, what's happening? I'm in love, thank you. This is the best thing\never so let's get started. I'm using my all-time\nfavorite pie crust recipe. I just doubled it for two discs because I need one for the bottom and one for the lattice on top. You can click up here\nfor the full how-to video all the ins and outs\neverything you need to know. I also have that full recipe\nin the blog post as well so you can click on that\nin the description below. - Is basically 300 grams\nof all purpose flour, a quarter cup of sugar or 50 grams. Into the bowl of your food processor along with a quarter teaspoon of salt whiz it up and then you add in one cup of unsalted butter\nat room temperature. That's 226 grams if you're counting. Whiz, whiz, whiz and\nthen we're gonna add in one quarter cup of ice water in a drizzle along with two tablespoons of vodka. Don't worry, it'll burn off. Whiz it a couple of times until you get a rough shaggy dough. Pop it onto the pastry mart, work it over just three or four times and then you're gonna have your disk that you can wrap in plastic and chill. It is that easy. Okay, this needs to go\nback into the fridge so it's nice and cold while\nwe work on our filling in you go. To make the apple pie\nfilling for your apple pie. You can do two things, you can make it pop it into that pastry or you can make it cook\nit all the way down and save it for later. This is delicious on\nany number of desserts eaten by the spoonful,\ntopping for ice cream, you name it. Let me know in the comments what you put apple pie\nfilling on, really tasty. Just gotta put that out there. Okay to make our apple pie filling we need three pounds of apples that you love. Personally, I like Honey Crisp apples but they're like super expensive. So you could use like your favorite Gala apple, your favorite. Whatever you want as long as it is not Red Delicious because those are the\nmost disgusting fruit I have ever seen in my life. All right, back to business, three pounds of apples. We'd appeal them get the\nflesh off and chop them up. So let's get started. If you have children with clean hands, this is a perfect activity for them as long as they don't cut themselves. Keep these in a bowl while we peel. This amount of filling will\nmake a regular nine inch pie. If you have a deep dish pie or maybe a 10 inch or go\nahead and add an extra 50% or you could even double it and have a little bit of\napple pie filling for later. Apple Pie is one of my favorite desserts and my mom used to make it all the time but it was like her version of\na French macaron for me. Where it was kind of\nimpossible to get it right or to meet her own expectations. She was almost annoyed that her pie crust wasn't flaky enough. This apple pie is nice and flaky, however. (upbeat music) Alright rounding the corner. Okay, the apples have been peeled, thank goodness. So in case you're not an\napple flush cutter offer, just go ahead and chop away from the core, hopefully not getting too much of it. Give extra pieces you\ncan just flick them off. And same goes for any extra skin that you\nneglected to remove. So we're just making a nice little like one inch dices basically with our apple a little bigger, smaller doesn't matter. And you will continue this process until all of your apples\nhave just the cores left. Last Apple. Oh my gosh I thought I was done. Right now I need about a\nquarter of a cup of lemon juice. Right here, the acidity will\nreally wake up the apples give you a nice contrast to the sweetness. And I wanna zest half of a lemon. So a good thing. I didn't finish juicing it right. So let's get zest off. This is not the ideal way to zest a lemon, but it'll work. Save this for a minute and then add in. Give us a quick toss. Now we're gonna add in two\nthirds of a cup of sugar. That's one third and two thirds. Yes, that's a lot of sugar, but it's a pie people. (laughs) All right, toss us one more time. I'm using my clean hands. Okay, we're gonna set this aside and do some skillet work now. These need to get washed. Placing one quarter of\na cup of unsalted butter onto a large skillet and let it get nice and melted. Once your butter is all\nmelted and delicious, it's time to add in the apples, carefully. We're gonna cook these\napples on medium high for maybe two to three minutes. We want them to start really\nreleasing their juices. So Cook on medium high and then move them around occasionally. So you can see a ton of juices\nare coming out right now all the juices will be a reduced and form almost a caramel. It's gonna be amazing. Reducing to medium low right now and I'm adding in half\na teaspoon of cinnamon. Get in there you, give the apples a toss. That reserved lemon zest\ngoes in there too now, and this is somewhat optional, but I'm gonna be adding in\na little grate of nutmeg. Look how pretty that is the inside of a nutmeg nut. To this one last twirl around the pan and we're gonna cover this and let it cook for about\nseven or eight minutes. You can stir it once or twice but it's really just gonna be reducing softening up the apples and becoming more delicious, okay. Give it that time. (upbeat music) The apple pie fillings been cooking for about five or so minutes. So I'm gonna sprinkle in\nmy corn starch right now and then mix it up. Don't worry about the lumps\nthey'll all get dissolved. After that corn starch has worked in a bit you can close it back up, it'll continue cooking and thickening up and gaining\nall that delicious flavor. Why did I use this heavy,\nheavy cast-iron pan. Carefully separate your\napples from the juices use a lighter pan unless you're strong. And oh my God, it's like 30 pounds or something. When you cook your apples down if you're baking them in the pie crust, you want them to be at this point, softened but when you take a bite, it still has a lot of mouthfeel it's not like a mushy apple. You know making applesauce here. If you're making the apple pie filling go ahead and just continue\nto cook it down a bit. You don't have to separate\nthe juices or anything, because they'll thicken up as you cook the apples down. One, two, three. These juices are gonna go back on the pan at medium low heat, we wanna thicken them up just a bit so that our pie isn't like a runny mess we cut into it basically. But by the by do you see\nthis beautiful color? Look at all that cinnamon, apple, this is like I go drink this plane or maybe you could add some rum to it. Bourbon, let me know in the comments how to turn this an apple pie cocktail, oh my God, that's genius. Okay, just cook it until\nyou see it thicken up a bit. You don't wanna make it\ninto like a thick caramel. It's more of a sauce. And we're doing this\nover a medium low heat. Right now we're just\nletting some of the water reduce out of the liquid, so it's really more concentrated flavor. You can see the steam coming up. That's the water. Right now we can transfer\nthose apple pieces back into our bowl. These juices thickened up really nicely. You can see here, it's taking a while for them to, you know, cover their tracks so to speak. We're gonna pour this over our apples. Oh my gosh, this pan. (laughing) I kept telling myself like, oh, I'll get back in shape. When the kids get heavier,\nwhich they're doing. Course get to lift them up all the time. But I don't know, hasn't helped everything. Mix this caramel in with the apples. And if you cook your apples\ndown long enough, initially, it's apple pie filling. So set this aside to cool down we want to be really\nclose to room temperature. So this could actually\ngo hang out in the fridge and make some friends, while we work on our pie crust. I'll be right back. Back to our chilled pie\ndough, I'm very excited. You can see all the beautiful little\npieces of butter in here. That's exactly how it should be. Let's give this a nice liberal sprinkling of\nflour, this goes on here. More flour spread it around, move it around. Our goal is not happening stick using a pastry mart helps because you can\nkinda like move them around flour is your friend here, all right. And now we're gonna start in the center and move out. Then change the direction\nof your rolling pin as well. And then after a couple of roles, you're going to like lift your butt up, sprinkle some more flour,\njust keep it moving. It's like a shark. It can't stay still it has to keep moving. I go over all of this in my how to make pie crust\nrecipe that we talked about, but that video keeps going\non for a no bake pie crust talking about blind baking. You know how to get things to\nhold their shape in the oven. Okay, 'cause I glasses\nis so slick and slippery. It's like Washington politician. (laughing) I'm ready for my talk radio here. Okay, sprinkle, sprinkle,\nchange your directions. This is looking nice. You can still see the\nbutter coming through. It's a happy malleable high crust. Take a rolling pin and one final dusting of flour right there. And now we can just roll it up, transfer it to onto our pie dish. Before you start moving things around, make sure it's kinda more\ncentered to the notch. And then what I like to do is push in the pie dough, especially from those sides where you have like extra hanging off. That way you're not stretching it out. You're pushing it in and\nI find that shrinks less. (upbeat music) Okay, let's tap this up, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. We don't want wrinkles. We wanna have a nice even\nsurface to play with. And the last step is that we can just trim the excess, you can use scissors or a knife and overhang is fine. This gets set aside now. We can roll these up\nfor later, more flour. Now we're gonna rule out\nthat second batch of dough and cut it into strips for the lattice. You want your strips to be about, oh, maybe 11 inches long for a nine to 10 inch pie crust. A knife is totally fine for this or you can also use a pizza cutter. And your strips don't even have\nto be all the same thickness it could have a little bit of play in it. We can set these strips aside. Repeat the process with\nthe rest of your dough. If you're a responsible person and made one big disc\nlike I did not for this then you'd be done by now. If I need any extra dough, I have my scraps that I can\nroll out in an emergency but for now, I think we're ready to\nassemble, so excited. Filling has cooled down enough that I won't melt all the pastry, so let's add that in there. Look at this delicious filling, what? Catching the light, nice caramel color. Smooth out all that pie\nfilling smooth, smooth. This is important because\nwe're laying our lattice down and I don't wanna have any crazy divots. All righty then. Time to lay out our lattice, nice big overlapping pieces, you can leave as much\nspace in between the strips as you'd like. I'm going for maybe like\na quarter of an inch. You can go right to the\nedges if you want as well. It's always better to have more than less. Once your first layer is laid down. You're gonna flip up every other strip. Place another one in between and then the strips go back down. Lots of you probably\nalready have made a lattice but some of you haven't and\nso easy and fun to do really. Okay, one side has done,\ntime for the other. Very excited 'cause I thought\nI might not have enough dough and would have to use the scraps but the scraps will remain scraps. We're all done but what about the edge? Well, you can do whatever\nyou want for the edge, but I think it looks nicest when you fold everything underneath, which we have enough to do. We have enough space here. So you can cut off some excess you wanna keep maybe about an inch left of overhang. Don't worry if it's not\nlike perfect looking because no one's gonna notice. Okay, now let's fold underneath. So here, just lift and fold. (upbeat music) Okay, that looks pretty nice. We are so close to being done for the egg wash, one egg, splash of cream, a tablespoon\nif you're measuring. And now you wanna give\nit a really good whisk. So I like to be totally homogenous. No random egg white bits left there. That's it. Brush the egg wash on gently. I actually have a soft\nsable brush that I use because it really doesn't\nmush down the the pastry. It's very gentle. It's like a gentle kiss from your lover, but with egg wash instead. (laughing) Get all those corners. So hit those corners, the sides everywhere with the egg wash. If you miss any part of it, it'll be like you put sunscreen\non one part of your body and went and got a tan. It's like a bad white spot. So just take your time. Be in the moment. Listen to your favorite podcast and brush egg wash on all over gently. That likes just about right I think i got every little last bit for the cinnamon sugar and taking a quarter\ncup of granulated sugar. You could also use sanding sugar if you want it to be like\nextra sparkly crunchy. And then maybe half a teaspoon or less of cinnamon it gives you a nice--- I'll go for the full half teaspoon I'm living large. Evenly sprinkle it on. This is an optional\nstep but I just love it. (mumbles) There we go. Nice American desert. (laughing) I wasn't counting on her\nbeing sugar all over that. (laughing) Thanks goodness I was wearing glasses. So what's gonna happen is we're gonna attend to the pie crust. Get a length of tin foil and we're gonna wrap it around the pie. You can fold over just like\na little corner so it sticks. You can even give it a tear like that. Now gently, all is gentle fold the top so you're\nprotecting the edge of your pie, because this has to bake\nfor like an hour almost. so tempting the pie crusts like so makes a huge difference. It lets the edge cook\nreally nice and slow. And then the middle will be a nice and beautiful golden color. Cinnamon go into the oven\nat 400 degrees fear heat for about 30 minutes. You can give it a check if it's looking a little crispy, lower to 375 but if not,\njust keep baking it for 400 until the center is nice and golden. And by that point the insides really\nbubbling up and delicious. The pie filling is already basically done, so you don't have to do that much. It's really the pastry\nwe're worrying about. And this, by the way, was a deep dish. Big pie so heavy. I wanna take a moment just to appreciate that\nperfect scoop of ice cream. It's the most perfect scoop of ice cream I've ever made in my life. All right, I'm gonna\ntake a bite just for you. That is so good. It is the perfect, perfect balance of sweet and zingy. And has the right mouthfeel the apples are just cooked enough. They're not like falling apart, but they're not crunchy. They just like have a little bit of spring back in your mouth. And it's just like zingy\nsweet, perfectly spiced. You'll never have a\nstore bought pie again. They're almost like so\nlike sweet doll flat. Not like this baby. (laughing) If you like this recipe and I don't know how you can't, check out my playlist that has my perfect pie\ncrust recipe how to. All my favorite pies and you are gonna be baking\nup a storm I promise.

with pink powder and carolina gold sauce these beautiful apples came from gopher glen apple farm up in san luis obispo county at sea canyon my husband and i graduated decades ago and we've been returning every once in a while to get some apples for all sorts of recipes [Music] i had some pork tenderloins with a slathered with carolina gold barbecue sauce and then sprinkled it with the pig powder put in the refrigerator for about three to four hours pulled them out and sliced them down the middle didn't go all the way through kind of made a pocket and i stuffed the pockets with the apple pie filling for the fresh apples that i got and then wrapped them in bacon put them in the smoker but you can even put them in the oven pork pork and apple pie [Music] you have to give it a try see you next time", "3zcL__kzolU": "[Music] hello and welcome back to gay peas grub today we're making a one gallon batch of Mead and we're using apple cider as the base and apple cider meat it's called sizer so we're using apple cider that we pressed ourselves at an apple cider press party that a friend held so this cider is made up of a lot of different varieties of apples including some apples from our backyard Braeburn tree and a neighbor's unknown variety so having a mixture of different apples makes really the best cider it's not required but it is very tasty so we're gonna heat the apple cider up to about a hundred degrees and we've got a little over a gallon of apple cider in this pot and we're just gonna keep an eye on that and make sure it doesn't get too hot and then we're gonna add about a quart of honey and I'm using a knotweed honey for this particular batch but you can use any kind of unprocessed raw honey and we want to grab all that we can out of this jar and not leave any behind and what I like to do is get a turkey baster and just put some of that hot apple cider in there and swirl it around to get every last bit of honey out of the jar and that works really well and then we're gonna add some Peck tech enzymes so this is an optional ingredient and all you need is a half a teaspoon per gallon and it really helps to clarify the mead so if you don't use this your Mead might turn out a little bit cloudy or it might take a really long time to become clear but this is something I like to use if I'm using any kind of fruit juice for my mead so now we're gonna test the gravity and this is required at the beginning of your your mead so that you can make sure that you know what the alcohol percentage is gonna be at the end you also want to make sure you start with a certain gravity reading so most Meads start with about one point one gravity but we're gonna go a little bit higher than that because we have a pretty high alcohol tolerance for our yeast that we're going to be using so we need a little bit higher gravity reading to start with so it wasn't quite high enough that I wanted so I added a little bit more honey and we're gonna take another reading to make sure it was enough so we're sitting at about one point one two which is a pretty good reading so that should be just perfect so now we're gonna sanitize everything that's gonna be in contact with our mead and we use stars' and for that and you just add you can read the directions on the stars' and product but it's just a small amount mixed with water and that will last you a long time so I do my primary fermentation in a fermentation bucket and we're gonna bring our water kettle up to about 115 degrees to hydrate our yeast and then we're also going to use another optional product called go firm and this just helps the yeast get reactivated so a lot of not everyone uses this so it's definitely optional but it does help I think so we're gonna mix that go firm with the 115 degree water and we're gonna use 125 grams and then add our go firm it should dissolve pretty quickly once you stir it around for about a minute or so and we're gonna take the temperature and we want it to go down to about 104 degrees before we add our yeast and today we're gonna use a Lavin ICI 1118 yeast now there's it's shocking how many different yeasts there are but most people when you're making Mead use a wine or a champagne yeast and there's probably up to a hundred different varieties or strains of yeast so you just want to do a little bit of research before you select the one that you want because there's a lot of different requirements temperature requirements alcohol tolerances so just check that before you select you used to make sure that you have the right conditions for it so we let it sit for fifteen minutes and give it a stir and let it sit for five more minutes now we're gonna add this to our must so the must is the combination of the cider and the honey that we did and we're just gonna temper that yeast until it's about within 10 degrees of the must and then close up the lid and add an airlock and I like to fill the airlocks with a little bit of cheap vodka so that's the Costco Kirkland brand and that just helps keep out any oxygen from entering the fermentation bucket it's another optional thing you can do is check the pH a lot of people don't do this step because it's usually not a problem the ideal pH range for mead is between 3.7 and 4.6 but if it's slightly higher or slightly lower than that it's probably going to be okay but if it's too much lower or higher you're gonna run into some problems so if it's too low your Mead will just ferment really slowly or it just won't ferment at all and if it's too high it might ferment really fast which is not what you want if it's too low you can add potassium bicarbonate to increase it and if it's too high you can add tartaric acid to decrease it so 24 hours later what we're gonna want to do is sanitize all the things that were gonna be in contact with our Mead so that's the if you're using a pH meter you do that the we're gonna take another gravity reading and this white wand thing is a whisk that we're going to use to D gas and aerate the mead so I you want to do is take that and just whip it around in there you can use a low-speed drill if you want but just make sure it's a really low speed because you'll make a mess and spray meat everywhere if you don't so that just kind of releases the gas I'm taking another pH reading which is optional and I'm also doing another gravity reading to see if there's any fermentation that's that's taken place so once it starts fermenting the gravity reading will go down and we're also gonna do another optional thing is add yeast nutrients so what I'm using is form a dough which is an organic yeast nutrient you can also use for Meg k which is an inorganic nutrient so you just mix that into a little bit of the meat and then just stir it in I'm also checking the temperature we're gonna add that Mead that we use to take the gravity reading back in there and that's pretty much all we need to do and we're gonna do this and also at 48 hours 72 hours and again at the one-third sugar break and you can determine what the one-third sugar break is by using an online calculator and that's just when the yeast has consumed one third of the sugars that are in the mead so we're gonna close it back up and let it sit for another 24 hours and do this again and then at 8 weeks we should have pretty much completed our fermentation and you'll wanna about every week check the gravity reading and when you see no change in the gravity reading over the course of two weeks you're pretty much done fermenting and so at this point you can rack your Mead off of the primary fermentation bucket and into a glass carboy where you'll let it sit an age for a while and let all those dead yeasts fall to the bottom of the carboy before we do that again we're gonna sanitize everything that we're gonna be using with our stars' and solution and this is a racking cane that I am sanitizing right now and that's what we're gonna use to transfer the mead from the fermentation bucket into a carboy you can also use a siphon but the racking cane really does the best job to transfer those that liquid into the glass carboy and we've also got the tubing and sanity you sanitize the tubing as well because that's gonna be coming in contact with our mead and just swirl that that solution all around in the in the tubing to get that all sanitized and these are the little stoppers that are going to go on top of the car boys we're gonna take one more gravity reading before we do the racking you can see how much lower the gravity is since we started we started at about 1.2 and now we're down to almost 1.0 so this is a little bit tricky to keep the tubing inside of the glass carboy without it slipping out so I bought these red Clippy things that you can attach the tubing to I didn't have them when I did this video but I'll be showing those later on when I actually got them for Christmas this year and they really help a lot so if you if you don't have those you could use another person to hold the tubing into the carboy otherwise you're likely to make a mess which I have done several times in the past so those little red bag they come in different colors but those those things actually help quite a bit so you're just gonna pull that that racking cane out and back in until the mead starts to flow and then you just wait and watch it come out and you want to leave a little bit of headspace at the top of the carboy I actually didn't leave enough here but later on I will be adding some of that to some quart jars then we're gonna add our airlock the same one that we used in our fermentation bucket and you could see it's pretty cloudy so once you let that sit for a while it actually cleared up pretty nicely in one month all right it's been about a month since we got these rekt into the car boys and court jars so I put the extras into the court jars because it wasn't it wouldn't quite fit into the car boys and we need to leave some airspace at the top so I noticed that the meat and the quart jars actually cleared up a lot faster than those in the car boys and another thing I noticed so I've got two different batches here the one on the right you can tell is a lot darker then one on the left and that's because I used a not weed honey for this one and a wildflower honey for this one and I also use two different yeasts so I've got the V 1116 and this one and that you see 11 18 and this one and I started this one a week after the other one but it cleared up a lot lot faster so I don't know if you can tell from the video how much clearer it is compared to the other one so there's a lot of dead yeast here on the bottom of the carboy and the quart jars so we want to get that off and we're gonna rack these in to clean car boys and jars because we don't want to leave the meat on on that dead yeast for too long because it could inflict some unfavorable flavours into our meat so before we do our final racking here we are going to do a gravity reading and this should be our final gravity reading and this will tell us what percentage alcohol our meat is so this is just like we've done before there's an online calculator where you can enter your starting gravity and your ending gravity and it'll tell you what your alcohol percentage is and I'll put a link to that calculator in the description of this video all right let's see what we have so we're looking at right around point nine eight point nine nine so let's plug that into our calculator and see what we come up with all right let's get this meat wrapped into a new jar so I got one of these little doohickeys here I think I showed a screenshot of one of these I got these for Christmas so this will really help give us a helping hand shoot just the wrong size no bits thought it was the wrong size there for a second this is the first time I'm using this so this will hold the tubing in place so it doesn't slip out I highly recommend using one of these unless you have two people one to hold this because this slips out really easily as you might have seen earlier in the video so we just pull it out yes there's a little black rubber section on the bottom of the siphon so that it doesn't it stops it from selecting up the dead yeasts that are on the bottom so I've got this all the way touching the bottom and one way when it gets almost done I'm gonna just tilt it very slowly to get oh the last bit out of it that I can I still got the mead that's in this this little guy here so when I go ahead and dump that back in here and I'm just gonna save a little bit in there so that I could give it a taste so I'm expecting this to be really dry I prefer a dry need to a sweet one but if you if it turns out to dry you can always back sweeten it with with some honey I'm just gonna grab a glass here give it a try pretty tasty it's definitely not a sweet one it's it's pretty dry it's got a very high alcohol content I could tell it is pretty good pretty happy with that all right I'm gonna go ahead and do the other one and at this point you can actually bottle this because it is pretty clear it seems to be done fermenting you can also guarantee that you stop fermenting by adding some various ingredients to it but I like to keep mine as natural as possible so I usually don't add anything to stop the fermentation I just that's one of the reasons why I let it keep it in in these carboys for so long just to make sure totally sure that it's completely done fermenting so we don't have any bottles exploding but if you don't if you don't want to risk that and bottle it now I would recommend adding I think they're called Camden tablets there's a couple other things that you can add to make sure it stops fermenting but at this point we're pretty much done with our Mead I'm just gonna let it sit in these carboys just to age a little bit about I'll probably give it another two months in the car boys and then I'll bottle those like I did the ones in the court jars so that's pretty much all it is to making Mead I hope you enjoyed it and learn something and give it a try yourself thanks for watching and we'll talk to you again soon if you enjoyed this video please like and subscribe you can also find me on Instagram Twitter and Facebook", "qj1Ms8jnY7Q": "hey hey guys how's it going welcome to this week's version of homebrew weekly nice to be here and today we're actually gonna we're gonna brew up something I got a parcel the other day from a fellow whose name is Marko but Marko thank you so much he sent me a few things actually and I've mentioned him before this time he sent me he sent me this and bring it up to the camera so we can maybe avoid the reflections of the of the light but though it it is it's an apple cider kit but by mangrove Jack's and you can probably zoom in or pause this if you want or I'll show a picture of it on the screen if this one isn't clear enough you can read all that by pausing the video if you want so now I have not really done one of these before and I haven't read the instructions there's a very simple version of the instructions on the back here basically you you had the fruit concentrate put that in there I think you add some sugar water and leave it for to ferment and pretty Eastin of course but I'm gonna break into this thing because I believe there's instructions inside and the yeast isn't here - so let's brew this I've got some sanitizer I've got my fermenter all cleaned and ready to go and we're ready to be sanitized and let's let's make this cider [Music] [Applause] okay so I wasn't sure what to expect here so I did it off-camera but by cutting the top of this off what we're left with is I can't I can't tip it too far but there's juice in there there's one half of it does it look a little a little divider in there and I'm 1/2 this is the juice the apple juice concentrate and on the other side there's these pouches with well there's the yeast and I will hold that up to the camera so you can see what kind it is okay and so there's that we have this thing whatever it is a little package of something let's see sweetener okay I bet you that goes in later but we'll see put that there come on there's a clearing package this is a it's probably apple cider flavoring oh no it's not clearing plate clearing agent it's lavery okay so that's there and then we have some more detailed instructions so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna read these I'm not gonna bore you with it I'll read these over and then I'll come back and we'll I'll show you what we're gonna do okay oh and by the way I have a small glass of homemade red wine to accompany this procedure it's probably not the right type of glass but I had it handy so I just grabbed it Cheers okay well this is pretty simple very simple actually so the first thing they tell me to do is sanitize everything that they recommend their sanitizer but I have stars' and so I just use that so I've done that got my fermenter here and my stir stick thing and the lids over there with an airlock so what they want me to do this is you can do this with a child can do this you pour the mmm smells good you pour the apple cider or the apple juice concentrate into there now that's an experienced home brewer I am going to do something that they didn't say to do they just say the squeeze out squeeze out the rest of it okay I'm gonna you know I'm gonna get some water into here okay I've got a sanitized hose back here I'm gonna just get some hot water I've also boiled I've boiled a kettle full of water because they need I don't want to put the boiling water here okay so to get too hot to handle it you just rinse it out with a little bit of that that's fine sorry for my back yeah see there we go and then we just dumped that see did you I don't know if you saw the color of that but that contained quite a bit of the stuff so there now we're done with that we'll keep that around so we can know what we did and then well just for that a bit it's the mix the water in and then they want a kilogram of dextrose or table sugar I chose dextrose because I have it a kilogram now I didn't weigh this because my scale the battery's dead so this is 700 grams right here in this line and I just put it up to here that's gonna be about a kilogram I mean it might be a little bit more but that'll just give it an extra little kick but yeah I'm gonna say that's about a kilogram maybe a touch more if I was to do this to it it would probably be just right so we'll throw that in there suppose if you wanted to you could put more in but I'm not gonna do that because I'd rather swallow the recipe the way they want me to okay and then we're gonna stir and then we're gonna add this boiling water which I just boiled they say three liters or three quarts so I just filled up the kettle looks like work you can sort of see it from the bottom there I'll just pull it out see there so stirring it I can't I'm looking at my monitor I think stored it I slosh it around a bit all right I'm gonna say that that is dissolved they want 23 litres of water now I'm gonna use cold water this has been sanitized this hose and I'm gonna use cold water and I'm gonna hope they want the temperature somewhere between I think it says 16 and 28 Celsius so on here I've got Fahrenheit we're gonna we're gonna aim for around 75 because if I think 20 is about 7223 is about 1 676 so 2376 yes I'm gonna I'm gonna go for about 75 degrees all right so while we're waiting for this we that wasn't a fruit fly was it geez it's that time of year there we're almost there feels like it's gonna be okay if it's a little warm it doesn't matter because 28 Celsius is it's almost 90 it's instantly how it's in the 80s so it won't matter if it's I might even put the hot you know what I'm gonna turn on some hot water now because it's getting a little cold 23 mm here we go I didn't have time to reach back here and turn those off it got up there real quick just a hair below 23 that's no problem give it a stir all right so i sanitized this thing here it's got stains stain from the wine that I use it for and I'm not gonna sanitize this because I'm not gonna put this back okay I'll drink it tell you what it tastes like also there's a sweetening package here I assume this is not fermentable okay so I'm not worried about adding it now it's not going to affect the gravity so we'll add it after but they say to add the whole thing if you want it sweet add half of it if you want it semi sweet and don't add any of it if you want it dry I'm gonna add half because I'm not a big fan of sweet but I also don't want it to be too dry so that's what I'll put about half of it in so let's get this out do it with the with the hydrometer in there so that you know how much to put in yeah a little bit more it's pretty clear a little bit more there we go she's floating so that's good now I'm gonna take this reading let me put it down and we'll just spin that just for the heck of it okay this is almost impossible but anyway okay it reads one point zero four four and then when I spin it around a little bit the alcohol qahal potential excuse me potential reading says six so it'll probably be about five and a half percent they say five point two I put a little extra sugar in so five and a half five points you somewhere in there perfect okay I'll taste it so that we can get an idea what it tastes like before it goes through it tastes like apple juice without the bitterness you know how sometimes the apple juice you buy has a sort of a bitter very nice that's gonna be good okay so this thing this is the the other thing that comes with it is this I mentioned it before you do not add this yet this is a flavoring package apple cider flavoring yes they call it the essence and instructions but I'm assuming that's the same because this is the sweetener that we're going to add half of salt hmm I'll just I'll just sort of eyeball it does it look like that's some sort of non fermentable sweetener so I don't know I'll just hold on to this half and I'll let this half go and how's that sound that's a boat I'd say maybe a ditch more I don't mind things yep that there I'm gonna stop there well not under I don't want it to be too sweet because that just gives me a headache so there that goes in and then the yeast no they don't say we're to stir it or not so yep you say stir so we'll put this in and stir this is awesome now we're gonna stir that then we're gonna put our lid with our airlock and that is it the only thing left to do at the end when this is fermented for six days is add this thing and then wait 24 hours and then bottle it and when we bottle it they want us to carbonate it so I'm gonna be using I I could buy carbonation drops and I might just do that I do have some Grolsch flip-top bottles then you put three in each of those boom Bob's your uncle this is thing on a little bit star sat in there from when I sanitized I did a live brew once recently a live winemaking and I snap the lid on I put the airlock I had all set up and then I got a Skype message from a friend who was what in the chat room telling me well they're asking about the yeast what do you add yeast to this I'm like um yeah you do add the yeast actually if of course you do yeah so I you know I just said well we you know now that we've tried out the lid we know that it fits we'll add our yeast chitin so I have problems with my microphone during that so it was a little distracting but anyway there's that and what I have got I keep the little thing in here if I can find it it's the medicine thing and I just put a little a little sanity xur in that just to top this up bubbles bubbles trailer park boys Ricky calm down all right for all you trailer park boys fans there we go it's not that on did I say Bob's your uncle already I think I did so there's that that's how that works so thank you now I don't have much else to say except I have some people to thank some of these might be repeats because I want to overlap just in case I don't forget somebody I want to think when you pronounce this name you don't know you dardo you dardo thank you I don't want to mispronounce your name thank you very much I put it on the bottom the screen thank you so much for your contribution Roger L rod our dough's last name starts the D by the way but I didn't think there'd be too many things like that around Roger L thank you so much sir thank you very much these might be repeats Jarnell thank you sir thank you very much Kevin a thank you I think these are getting in the repeats by dental care thank you sir and Christopher s and I think I didn't miss anybody however if I did if you do if you sent me a contribution me a gift please and I haven't mentioned your name please email me at Craig tube mail at gmail.com somehow let me know if I've forgot to mention your name I try to keep track of this best I can but you know I got so much stuff going on in an email and whatnot that it's sometimes I miss things so let me know if I missed your name okay don't be afraid I don't want to miss anybody so that's that whoops well you know we spilt my wine Cheers mmm good stuff okay so like I said in two weeks we'll be bottling it and I'll do some of that on camera why not it's been a while since i bottled anything i homeboy that's gonna be a fun I so hated bottling beer when I was bottling it it was it was just one of the not the highlight of my day I just don't like doing it's monotonous repetitive and you know it's no fun pegging is definitely a lifesaver I can keg a beer in ten minutes and you know what if the beers gonna be drank within a week which so around here a lot of times it is because my son drinks it too and I have neighbors that I share it with as well so a keg can last a keg can can be gone in about a week I don't sanitize anything I cleaned my keg thoroughly with hot water and I cleaned the sinus hot or the the siphoning apparatus with hot water and I just put the beer in there it's not gonna sit for long enough to get infected plus it's going to be in the fridge so if you're one of those people who kegs a beer and it goes down pretty quick not too worried about sanitizing for the if you're gonna leave your beer in there for two weeks month you know something like that definitely sanitize it definitely sanitize it but when you're having a party let's say Saturday nights coming around and you've got guests coming you got a keg there you know that cake is gonna blow off on one in one night or two nights don't even bother sanitizing it just put the beer in there and there you go so that's just me all right well that's it for this week that's really all I wanted to do and I'm gonna get myself another glass of wine and go sit down and watch some youtube hope you guys had a great week and weekend it was Canada Day on Saturday here and I know July 4th is coming up for you u.s. people so great weekend hope you had lots of fun and we're safe and I'll see you real soon I'll see you next Friday on my broadcast and on the next video which is coming up very soon all right guys thanks a lot for the support thanks for watching we'll see you Cheers 17", "Ai7_mDTvlgc": "alright I'm gonna make some apple pie moonshine today my wife decided she wanted to record this so I'm going to take you through it the ingredients you're going to need is one gallon of apple juice one gallon of apple cider two cups of brown sugar 2 cups of white sugar and I did three ounces of cinnamon sticks and some vanilla schnapps I do it different every time I'm just winging it so I'll just add this to taste and some cinnamon schnapps I'm not sure if I'm going to use this or not but we'll see and this is for me and we have a half gallon of shine you can use green alcohol you can use Everclear or if you know somebody with homemade shine you can use shine alright we're gonna use this turkey fryer to do it in I got this as a gift but we smoked all our turkeys so I thought I could make better use of it and we have to get some liquid in it first before we start up the flame so we don't burn the pot I'll start with some of the apple juice [Music] and then we'll start up the flame right after that turn the gas on and we're gonna adjust the flame we're going to add the rest of the ingredients we have another yeah we got a gallon with apple cider and two cups of white sugar two cups of brown sugar and then I'll stir that up a little bit three ounces of cinnamon and then you let this come to a boil once it comes to a boil you can simmer it for about 15 to 20 minutes [Music] in about five minutes now it's a pretty good oil going at about 180 degrees I've stirred it occasionally just to keep them from sticking to the bottom of the pan everything looks good I'm gonna turn the flame down now and leave it on here for probably another 15 minutes it's been about 15 minutes and it's between 180 and 200 degrees I've turned the flame off and I'm gonna stir it one more time and now I'm gonna let it cool down because you do not want to add your alcohol until it has cooled down or the alcohol will cook out okay it's been about ten minutes and we're only down to about 145 degrees and I don't have the patience for this kind of stuff so what I did is I made a bucket here I put some ice in it and I'm just gonna set this right on the ice let it cool down a little quicker hopefully ice up ten to fifteen minutes now I got it to a little bit over 50 degrees and now I'm gonna add half gallon of shine and I had a half bottle of vanilla schnapps laying around so I'm gonna try that this time about a half bottle there okay I'm gonna stir everything mixed good and then I'm gonna taste it and see how it is oh that's good okay I'm gonna add a little bit of cinnamon just cuz it's here yeah a little more that should be good stir that up please one more time ah perfect figure out what I was gonna say all right we're all done with the last step I didn't wait for my wife to record because I started tasting too much the only step that I left out was I strained the pot through cheesecloth to get any debris out I put two cinnamon sticks in each court and the whole batch got about 11 plus courts all together and that's it all right we're all done thanks for watching", "lpxwCsC3QtQ": "hi i'm brian i'm darica and you're watching CS bruce and today we are trying an apple cider now before anyone goes looking for this recipe i don't think we actually made this one on camera okay this is just a basic apple cider made from probably the juice that comes in the one gallon jug that i literally popped the cap on threw in some bread yeast put an airlock on it and let it go that's it no added sugar no added anything just to get an idea of what apple cider could come out like at its simplest will we do a video on that most likely now I haven't tried this one we don't know what this one tastes like it was bottled on November 28 2018 today is March 4th 2020 so that means this is about 15 months old yeah 15 months or so it ended with a 5% ABV right so you know this is just straight-up juice it also is quite cloudy and we pulled this one out because we wanted people to see that even a cloudy beverage could still be good see there was a little tiny bit of carbonation in there that's mildly concerning but not really that big of a deal it wasn't meant to be sparkling that's why I'm saying and I'm just gonna pour some off I know a lot of people make their cider sparkling and you totally can this one is but not intentionally so it's a good thing that we bottle in swing tops because we didn't have to worry about that so it kept a little bit of a carbonation going be totally honest oddness to it but I'm definitely getting the the sweet apple it's like sweet spiced apple though and I don't remember if we spiced this I don't believe so I'm gonna go right in for a taste otherwise it makes me think that it was a spiced juice no no I this was not spiced we wouldn't we would have notated it on the label okay um so this is just straight-up apple juice but it is carbonated which is gonna make this a little bit more interesting than it would have been before I don't recommend carbonating this way because it's uncontrollable but it seems like maybe we bottled it a little early I might have done it on purpose they don't remember this yeah this is good if you've ever purchased carbonated apples hard cider this will be better Martinelli's isn't that what is Cobb but that's not alcoholic I know but that's what it reminds me is like martinelli yeah it really does it's sweet but just sweet enough it's carbonated just a little bit so it tickles your tongue wow this is really really good I do not recommend doing it this way though because that bottle could have exploded on us but it's at 5% I can't imagine that it would have fermented all that much there might have been just a little bit left to go and it did it or maybe I bottle carved it and didn't realize might have because we were doing lots of stuff back then and we didn't take sediments so it's entirely possible I meant this to be carved so see that I didn't even know what I had this is awesome I'm drinking this okay I hate to use the words awesome and good here's what it is it's got the right amount of sweetness for something of this type it doesn't taste like a beer a lot of hard ciders when they're dry and carb you can taste more like a beer and if you have beer in your mind when you taste it you'll go oh this is great this is sweet hard cider okay it came out I'm gonna guess it's probably a 1022 1025 sweetness it's somewhere in that level it's not super sweet it's just sweet I think the carbonation is making you feel like it's sweeter than it actually - it might actually have been more dry and the carbonation is making me think it's sweeter but it all in all of all the hard ciders I have ever had and I mean like you're angry orchards and stuff like that keep in mind I used to be gluten free so I didn't drink beer we lived off of hard ciders for years we drank hard ciders to the point that we loved them and it was just became this thing then we started brewing and I wanted to always capture that angry there's one type of angry orchard that we loved that was just sweet enough just carbonate enough to had just enough apple flavor it was lovely in the end this tastes a lot like that angry orchard that we just really fell in love with and to me that's awesome that means when we do a video on this hopefully we can reproduce this exact effect this would be a great beverage to have completely on its own think like a hot summer day and you just want to relax and drink something nice and refreshing this would be any time you'd reach for a beer you can reach for this and it falls it's very similar it's about the same ABV about 5% you can probably drink quite a bit of this before having any serious issues from being drunk it's wow it just it's really incredible I can imagine if this was oKed or spiced a little it could be even different so you could there's a lot of ways to them for a lot of ways to vary this and make different interesting recipes from it but um I'm probably gonna finish the rest of this bottle so as always thanks for watching guys have a good day", "buiOIb4D3Bo": "[Music] this is going to be an apple cobbler but i'm going to caramelize the apples with some cider so the the for the bank of ireland open farm weekend the the farms that we're featuring are longmeadow with their cider and vinegars and apple juices we've got um our mass cider company so the triton family with their with their ciders and their apples and then we've got acton house and the best family oats which are whites i'm using white speedy cooked oats on that but first thing i'll do is um the base for the cobbler so cobbler's pretty much just a it's a apple or fruit any kind of fruit um cooked and then you top it with essentially a scone mix so in here nice hot pan and i'm just going to over the bottom just some sugar to make a caramel and then what i want to do is just get that really really nicely caramelized so you don't need to touch it if you start moving it it won't melt for you so just uh just let it just you can see they're just coming around the edges bring that around you could just do studios but i quite like doing this because it it helps the the bromley out while they are my bromley to hold its shape so some sometimes you cook them and they're a wee bit mushy there's nothing wrong with that so i'm going to use the um the blossom burst from longmeadow cider so it's quite a sweet cider so you've made the caramel and then what we're going to do now is make a cider caramel so just add the cider to that and then we just want to cook that down really to a really thick syrup i'll take a couple of minutes uh and then we'll add our apples and they'll not take long and while i'm waiting for that to happen so i was going to put a wee bit of vanilla into that too just a bit of vanilla paste like when you add um caramel you got a nice caramel to start off with and then add cider to that you get a absolutely beautiful beautiful smell so in here i've got butter and sugar that are rubbed together um butter and flour sorry and sugar and then if you get hold of my two seconds sorry we're gonna add a tablespoonful of bacon powder to this so quite a lot of bacon powder but we're gonna get these to puff up for us and then the oats so this is a these these are white soaps but they're they're growing in bass farm which is actin house which is open for the bank of ireland open farm weekend so it's uh oats are just part of our tradition they're fabulous so um they've sustained us for centuries so they're and now they're what they're a super food now okay so that's um that's that i'm going to make a well in the center of that crack in an egg and then i've got 100 mls of buttermilk here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to take some of the um the madden's mellow cider i make that up to 100 mils my glasses are in my head but i'm sure that's 100 miles it looks like 100 mils right so cider buttermilk mix that all around and you just want that to make that into like a nice sort of thick really just a like a scone next to give it a good mix around and then what we're going to do is we're nothing fancy with this dessert a cobbler is literally i think you know it's cobbled together so we're just going to pick that over to the side this uh car this cider with the caramel i just want to take that down for really like another two minutes just to just to make it into a nice syrup and then we're going to get our apples into that all right tastes two minutes so using the brownley apple county arma pga status brown the apple i always find that too that whenever i cook with these that they're anytime i use cooking apples in england or something they're never as sweety and they're just they're they're full of our marine which is a good thing that's what makes them lovely and crisp and beautiful so we just want to take this right down just to really take a nice thick syrup and then that will that's going to be our nice fruity bit in here so they'll not take long once this is down to a certain point the uh we've got our lovely apple syrup so you can see that there it's nearly starting to caramelize again and then just add the apples if you want to put something else into this you could i've done this with um apples and plums apples and pears um apples and black currants blackberries when they're in season so any any fruit that you have in the freezer works really well with this so we'll just let those um cook down for a wee minute just to just take them down and then we'll top our deer cobbler right so our apples are caramelized there just to get you know so we'll just put those into our dish just lightly buttered dish and then we've just just pat them down you see the way they hold their shapes if you want uh and if you just take big dollops of the of the uh the cobbler mix and just so that's the cobbler with the with our butter and our sugar egg um and then the oats from um from best farm acton house there we are just nice big i want to leave gaps in there because what will happen is then well that'll sort of spread out a bit because there's quite a bit of bacon powder in that that'll spread out and a wee bit but then you get nice pokes of a bubbly apple coming through so that's that there okay so i'm going to do a custards cobblers in the oven so we're going to do a custard a cider custard so i have uh got some egg yolks here some sugar a little bit of corn flour just crust that off and then we've got some of the blossom burst cider so it's going to be a cider custard and some cream and just let that just let that scald really and then just twist the egg yolks and the corn flour together so this is the first time i did this custard i was doing a demo with um i'm using long metal cider i just sort of came out of nowhere i thought i'm just going to do a cider custard so this is uh i was with papa and catherine from longmeadow so we we came up with this i come up with this side and we all liked it and that was and we've been making it ever since so that's uh let that just scald and uh and then whenever that's hot well this doesn't take long it's not like one of those big long convoluted custards it's just a nice the corn flour will thicken it quite quickly cream is scalded so just pour the half of it cream and cider rather we're having for over give this a good whisk just tempering it together then [Applause] this back in again and then just give this a whisk and it will all come together beautifully so you want to keep whisking it or keep stirring it because if you don't you'll end up with a cider flavored scrambled eggs so that is not something that we want here all right so they'll be left like they're not nice so it's really quick here's the ones that once cornflour comes up and then you've got your eggs to help thicken it as well that's our custard knife so i'm just going to set that aside actually and wait for the wait for the cobbler to cook and then we're good to go okay so the cobbler's ready so that's our cider caramelized apples and then we've got the um the cobbler topping has the um the oats from bass farm at acton house and then we've got our custard using the long metal berry burst so i'm just going to take a wee bit out here just take a nice bit of this so this is a nice fluffy kind of spongy scone and we've got our caramelized apples there now just take a big dollop of the custard the cider custard here so that's our apple cobbler using our ma bromley apples we've got cider we've got caramelized with longmeadow berry burst cedar we've got the madame madden's mellow cedar from our mass cedar company and the topping and we've got the oats from best farm there so that's that smells great you", "rwEwVflru_g": "all right well there's still a little bit of snow on the trees we're gonna make some Applejack today mmm delicious [Music] so Applejack what is it and why do we do it Applejack is basically where you make hard apple cider and then you freeze concentrated by letting it freeze draining off the liquid that doesn't freeze because it's full of alcohol and then discarding the water ice and you do that two or three times and what ends up happening is you get a much higher alcohol content but you also get really strong flavors and a really tasty little drink now here's the one warning let's say you turn this into hard apple cider and then you freeze it and you turn it into Applejack if you drank this whole gallon of hard apple cider and let's say six percent six and a half percent alcohol you would probably have the worst hangover of your life oh no never been how we did the same goes for Applejack because it's concentrated now all of the methanol and the fusel oil x' and things that are normally discarded during normal heat distillation they're still in there and you may be asking yourself is that toxic is it dangerous well no it's not any more dangerous than drinking an entire gallon of hard apple cider not advisable but it's not gonna kill you where did Applejack come from back in colonial times when Apple farmers would have a lot of apple cider pressed and ready to go it would be in barrels the yeast that was naturally on the apples would ferment the juice so you'd end up with hard cider but then when comes rolling around so your barrels freeze up so you pop open the top of your barrel and there's this big ring of ice around the inside and then this pool of really dark Sider and smells great really strong really sweet and very rich and so when the colonial guys figured this out they would you know dip something right out of the center and start drinking it let me tell you it tastes really good it's ridiculously smooth and super delicious but that's a problem because it's so concentrated and it's not heat distilled so all the bad stuff that can give you a hangover is still in it the Colonials dubbed a term specific for the hangover that you get when you drink too much Applejack it's called Apple palsy never forget this when I found you you were so slobbering quick you couldn't buy brandy it's awful just think of the worst hangover that you've ever had and then magnify that by two or three times because the worst hangover you've ever had didn't have that much didn't have that much sugar didn't have that much methanol all the things that can really add to a really bad time Applejack is not a guzzler it's a sipper little shot glass and trust me I've never had a hangover on it because I only have maybe two shots of it and I just I just enjoy them like a brandy or at cognac or whatever rich people do since I'm not a rich people this is what I'm gonna make it's delicious and it's it's totally worth it so let's get started you're gonna dump out about two quarts of your apple juice so that you have room for all the sugar we're gonna add so you're just gonna go get some dark brown sugar and we're but about three cups of it into a bowl for some of our juice into that bowl so that we can stir it together and easily pour that into the jug and then top it back up with juice add our yeast some hectic enzyme to help clear it and some yeast nutrient to keep the fermentation healthy throw the airlock on and put it away until it finishes fermenting the juice itself has an alcohol potential of around six to six and a half percent the amount of sugar that we're adding is gonna bring it up to about fourteen percent I tended to go for around fourteen or fifteen percent alcohol the last time I made Applejack and made the initial fermentation go up to about eighteen and a half percent alcohol after all the freezing processes the Applejack came out really syrupy it was not very good so I tend to go to around fourteen or fifteen percent alcohol in the initial fermentation you get a bunch better product all right so now that we've got the three cups of brown sugar mixed in we've got the yeast nutrient and the pec t'k enzyme and it's air-locked and we've got it topped up with juice as high as we can get the yeast in there I'm using some of the distillers active dry yeast I'm using that because it's got a very high alcohol tolerance and so won't crap out when the sugar content is so high so we're gonna put this into a dark area and let it ferment and do its thing until it's completely dried out so the Applejack has finished fermenting out it actually went down further than I've had anything ferment out before this went down to 0.995 so super dry and it's got a nice amber color not too dark from the sugar and it is super super dry it actually makes a pretty decent apple wine so if you wanted to just degassed this and bottle it you'd be doing something really tasty for being just a bottled apple juice with some sugar in it this is actually really surprisingly good it's very tart still really Apple II the flavor is gonna be really intense when we finally finish freeze distilling this so mmm yeah some aged on that maybe a year or two in a bottle and that would be a pretty decent wine but I'm impatient and I also want it to be a whole lot stronger so we're gonna Jack it it doesn't sound right we're going to freeze distill it so we've got our bottling bucket and since I'm going to freeze this I'm not worried about contamination so I'll just dump this right back in the wine is bone-dry so you want to add some sweetness and flavor with a can of apple juice concentrate and siphon your apple wine into mix it so now that you've got all of your super strong apple wine and the concentrated apple juice together I'm going to bottle it into some empty water bottles and then chuck it in the freezer for a couple of days [Music] it's all about sanitation and safety folks because this is going to get concentrated several times over and over it's gonna be pretty close to whiskey strength I know that sounds hard to believe especially with a freezer but it actually is gonna work because my space is really limited I mean the freezer is jam-packed there's just no other room I'll sanitize those bottles before I actually start to drain them that way any sort of contamination that may be on the outside from the frozen meats and so forth is not gonna go into our final product there's not really too much to worry about with oxidation and normal like home brewing levels of Sanitation because this is all gonna get super concentrated and frozen so before it ever has any chance to grow anything or you know for any funky flavors to develop it's gonna change drastically so we don't really have to worry too much about that all right so we're just gonna let that chill for two days and then we'll drain it and do it again and then again and then again and then again until it won't freeze anymore [Music] all right so we're finally done with our Applejack for all that work this is all I got left your question might be is all that work worth it for this tiny little bit the answer is yes okay so you remember what I said about this being full of methanol and fusil oils if you drink too much you're gonna have the worst hangover you have ever had contemplate this on the tree of wool [Music] you remember the term Apple palsy it's a thing so let's give it a taste and find out what kind of flavors we've got going on lots of Apple and you can smell the molasses from the brown sugar it smells almost like it's got a little bit of spice to it it's it's there's a lot of layers here it's really rich Wow lots of Honey character to it and tons of fruit tons of Apple right up front it's very boozy it's it's gonna punch you in the face it's pretty good [Music] yeah definitely worth it it's a really good little thing I mean it's super smooth there is no bite to it whatsoever it's got you know the warming that you can feel going down into your chest and into your arms it's crazy smooth and that's I think the problem with it if you don't know ahead of time that there are some serious consequences to drinking a lot of this you could end up drinking a lot of it because it's so good it's got the sweetness and the appley flavor almost of like eating a piece of apple pie then the the smoothness and the alcohol is really tempting so if you just you've want to drink more of it you just have to limit yourself to two shot glasses and don't drink any more than that you know but is it worth it absolutely so I hope you enjoyed that I hope you learned something and if you have any questions go ahead and post them down in the comment section if you learned anything if you

i've been trawling through youtube looking for an old favorite apple pie moonshine i found one so i'm going to give it a go and i'll show you the results of how i get on with this one and here's the ingredients there's loads and loads of recipes out there online to do with this george from barley and hops has just uploaded a video on apple pie moonshine so i thought i'd just use his as a guidance very simple i've scaled it down to do a small batch so i've got double concentrated apple juice in the jug there 500 milliliters of that with 500 milliliters of water as well 150 grams of soft brown sugar 40 grams of white granulated sugar one star on ease three clothes and a stick and a bit of cinnamon there we go super easy so i've got everything ready i just need to hope that i've converted the recipe down to the right quantities for this batch let's find out right so it's all been bunged into the pot it's just come up to the boil as you can see so i shall now turn that down to a simmer like they recommend for at least half an hour just to get the flavors of the dried spices to come out and you always see when people do it online they mention how nice it smells so um i'm gonna be on that bandwagon as well and say oh my god that is just unbelievable it's just like a cooking apple in the oven that you could drink i mean it is oh fantastic at the moment but i should calm down i'll calm down i'll let it just simmer away and do its thing and then i will be back later and here we are back with the apple pie moonshine so what i had um in that pot earlier let it simmer for about 40 odd minutes took it off the heat let it completely cool down and then i strained it into the damage on what i've also added into this now is a liter of about four was it 72 abv and that was a neutral spirit that i just distilled a while back so it was about it's about a 50 50 mix in here at the moment from the wash and the spirits um bring it down to i think about 35 abv it doesn't it doesn't smell them it i'm not getting many defined aromas coming off of that but what i do have oh hello is a sample um pretty much anything you make like this when you're infusing it will take about a month um to marry mature whatever all the flavors together this is no different apparently so this first ever apple pie moonshine tasting okay [Music] oh oh i'm not happy with that i'm disappointed oh do you know why i'm disappointed it's because i've never made it before and it is brilliant why haven't i made this before oh my word that is brilliant oh that is i actually thought i possibly used too much sugar in this one but the um the brown sugar soft brown sugar really has helped that apple and there's just a oh just a complete tang of the apple because the apple was double concentrated and um yeah that's that is amazing oh i can't wait to make any more this this was going to be given out for christmas presents to a few uh close friends um yeah and i think i might have to be making a bit more for myself now quite a bit more but anyway that's thank you very much thank you very much internet and all those people that have developed such a simple um simple recipe oh i'm blown away with that well i must admit i do quite like um like the sweet liqueurs and stuff so that is a right hat that's right at my street that is yeah that's my i do quite like um mold wine so this um i don't know if this would be um any different slightly warmed up and obviously not heated up to the point you're gonna evaporate the alcohol but even so that is that is good very good so i shall bottle this up and label it up and then hopefully it's going to stay on the shelf without um some more tasting going on uh but i should keep myself busy um with the um doing another video i suspect so there we go until next time keep on shining you", "90osVFMvKVg": "[Music] all right i have got to show you what was a big hit at our pie party so we have our cute little printable bottle wraps on mason jars these

sometimes we're happy that we tried them and sometimes not so happy today we are going to try something I saw called the apple cider sangria way to combine the sweet beautiful feelings of autumn with a well known alcoholic beverage the sangria the only problem I see with this drink is that I don't like apple cider I don't really like apple flavored things but I'm just hoping I changed my mind because the drink is pretty so maybe I'll like it after I make an entire picture of it you might be asking yourself Kat why don't you just make a small glass of it and to that I say hey look pal I saw the ingredients I and I can't do the math I can't break it down maybe I should have made a word problem out of this for my daughter to solve which it gets home from school today because I don't do math your mother's apple cider sangria recipe calls for one bottle of wine two and a half cups of fresh apple cider one cup of club soda 1/2 a cup of brandy and three Honeycrisp apples your mother only wants one glass of the drink how many apples does she slice I sure as hell don't know it says it's extra smooth shall I try it I don't like brandy apple bottom jeans boots with the bear it's pretty I think that looks like fall it looks like a little Apple mud puddle mellowed and aged oak a cold soccer game you're watching junior run out there maybe you've got a thermos of this I think it's fine I think it's good if you like apple juice you'll like this I I'm getting hung up on the apple taste which we already knew but it was just so pretty I thought because it's pretty that I would like it more and I'm still I'm not a huge fan of the Apple taste but it's I could finish this slowly good slowly finish this happy Friday to you and to you and to you bye", "97GmI9rp3lU": "before we take our apples to the cider mill next week but I'd use up some more to make this apple pie filling this has no sugar at all just maple syrup in it and instead of the water since we had some cider from last year that was in the freezer and we thought it I used cider instead of the water for the thickening other than that it's pretty much the way it's that I'll show you how I cut it up over here but I peeled a variety of apples peeled the by hand because my apple peeler thing was not working I put them in the water with a little bit of citric acid powder in it which kept them nice and white I'm cutting them into chunks it was about 18 I think I used gotta use 20 apples and then this is that mixture of cornstarch and cider instead of water spinner man and nutmeg I will pour this over over these chopped up apples and then I'm going to use my inste pot but on the slow cooker setting and it's supposed to cook for 3 and 1/2 hours stirring it once every hour now I'm going to stir there's an extra large instant pot by the way and again I'm just having on the crock pot sitting I'm going to stir the apples here with that cider sauce that's thickened cider sauce cinnamon and nutmeg insider so that all the apples are coated and then I'll put it in the insta pot and check on it every hour you want to use the kind of apples here that don't turn to mush so I've used what I'll use so Fuji some Jonagold and some Jonathan's didn't want to use maple syrup you could use honey or brown sugar and that's it for now I and I have it set on slow cook for 3 hours in the 30 minutes after slow cooking for two hours remember it was opposed to be done at 3 and a half hours Caesar no we're close to done I may be putting it on low and cooking it all night might do that see what it looks like in another couple hours I guess but they're only partially done they're not crunchy anymore but they're definitely not cooked it tastes okay I did add another what did I add another 1/3 cup of brown sugar and I added 1/2 teaspoon salt it just tasted a little too blah but now it'll be good this ended up making seven pints of apple pie filling actually I turned five of them into more apple chutney I'm gonna make some more pie filling probably on Monday I had to I ended up having to think the crock-pot thing it just didn't work at all I had to put it on how to put this on sautee resin what I stick it on porridge or something had to really boil it good to get it thick so that when I make this next time I'm skipping the crock pot thing I'm gonna make it on the stove the same way I did the chutney but this ended up really good I think it'll be nice to have as a topping for ice cream yogurt waffles pancakes that sort of thing so I plan to do another six or seven pints of that next week before we take the rest of the apples to make cider out of and these are my marigolds in Michaelmas daisies", "ZxwTpWj9qns": "it's hard to pick a favorite fair fashion I love a matching t-shirt I love zubaz I love it when people come in all of their their local Minnesota gear my favorite beer at the fair is beer the top 10 specifically i think the mini donut beer is pretty charming no you know not really i'm a simple man simple means it could you know good grain belt or authorities to be fine for me but i also like a lot of craft beers that are out there now i have had a beer at the fear when i am not working you know i like any suitable minnesota flavored beer funny you should ask the perfect fruit fair combo to me would be an apple with just a hint of caramel in it well when you have to when you come up with a safe there beer you have to be the first one to have done it it's got to be top-notch quality is extremely important to me and so we tasted a whole lot of different flavor profiles things that you recognize from the fair things that you recognize from your daily lives here in Minnesota and it all kind of boiled together to come up with hi good gone you and your pathetic done done done yet hey my beef today we got pie caramel apple pie cider beer cheers tell us your job Jason thank you I don't think I get my places this one for being the runner up college I had to leave the table all right link if you're out this beer started out as a very caramel forward malty beer and then we added a significant amount of apple cider ran it through fermentation where the yeast took care of most of the hard work and then we add it back a little bit of cider use a couple different types of caramels and the aroma just explodes with caramel characteristic it's very cider forward and then caramel on the back end so BuzzFeed's got a list 17 delicious apple pie inspected inspired recipes for every occasion that's have a guy I think I 1818 hair we got it we're gonna have 28 amend it 18 I'm you know somebody that can get that done you", "QF28wH_BPFY": "hey do former Dre back get it today it's another beautiful day here on the farm and it's actually morning right now and this is the first time ever when we are pressing cider during the day I'm actually skipping class today because we have to press cider and then we have to go finish planting of strawberries the reason we're pressing cider this morning is that tomorrow is Saturday we have another event to go to it's a fall festival and when you excited for that and we do have a little bit of cider left in the cooler but it won't be enough so we've got a press left three or four hundred gallons today so that's the plan 14 if you guys haven't already go ahead and hit that subscribe button like this video if you guys have any questions or comments leave them down below and you guys take him stay tuned for today's video don't forget to hit that little notification icon come Kai to come and see you guys three days a week Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays and you guys stay tuned for today's video before we get started to making the cider I want to talk a little bit up a little bit about our pasteurizer I've had a few questions as to how we patch on their cider but I'm gonna go ahead and get into detail about talking about that so this is our pasteurizer right here this is a site or sure it comes out of New York I believe in that area but the research was made at Cornell University and this is just it was specifically done and made for apple cider because the commercial apple cider guys they they use a flash pasteurization cider I gotta wash this Bucky because I'm rinsing it out right now so if I keep looking at that don't think i'ma anyways the researchers made strictly for apple cider because the commercial guys who press apple cider they flashed pasteurize it and flash pasteurization is where they heated up to 161 degrees for 3 seconds and then cool back down but with this past renders does right here him it processes the apple and kill processes the cider and it kills the bacteria while the cider it's still cold and one thing that is very important whenever the cider is still cold that pectin inside the juice doesn't break down and we still get the amazing flavor amazing taste and the quality that we want and for our customers to enjoy our apple cider and this cider press or the packs edge right here this one right here the one we have to pasteurize a hundred gallons an hour and they have two or three different levels or different you know this one's the smallest one they have where there's a hundred gallons an hour they have a bigger one that does 350 gallons an hour and then they have a big one to the biggest one out there that makes I think 500 gallons an hour patch Rises but if you're gonna use a 500 gallon a narrow one you need a bigger press and there's some commercial Steiner guys who use it's called a belt press where the cider goes up and down it's pretty cool machine and then they also have a screw press which it shoots that goes through a lot of the sewage guys that comes from the lot of the sewage guys who clean up sujin stuff use that but then they made one specially for apple cider and then they also have a side by side press and a lot of the commercial guys use that side by side because it's very easy and we have the older racking cloth to just assistance all the information or I guess for my last videos and I want to show you guys today how it's exactly works here but this is probably the oldest cider press we have but in my opinion it is the best because last time we processed four and a half gallons per bushel and that that's just awesome yielding numbers you know this commercial guys are happy to get three gallons per bushel some of them only get two and a half gallons per bushel but we get in four and a half gallon so one I'm not complaining so my brother Brad dude Hughes he's the man in charge behind all this apple cider stuff we are mean Adrienne we do all the hard work and stuff but he I mean he took over doing all the paperwork and stuff and keeping that in line because we were respected we gotta have some plan we respect by the FDA and arts our kitchen the bakery and this facility here is inspected by the USDA and the health department so we're we're were state inspectors around our farm so whenever we you know go to different events and stuff we just show them our certification from the state and we're good to go so I my brother I do is actually doing some other stuff around the farm but he's in charge of this and he could talk more about you know the process of the cider and one thing about this pasteurizer it uses UV light to kill off the bacteria and one thing that a big misconception is about our cider is that people think that whenever we pasteurize it it doesn't permit it Firmin take anymore because whenever you press raw apple cider after week and a half to two weeks the cider firmance and then it turns to hard cider benefit if you leave it long enough to turn into vinegar but with this machine right here the cider stays about two to three weeks past dries and after a while then it'll still turn into a hard cider or into vinegar and with flash Pastor Dixon cider where they heated up and cool it back down the cider doesn't firm it anymore because they broke down that pectin and once the pectin is broken down it's just it's it's not very ideal either continue doing it so that's why one of the benefits that we have with our cider is that if we don't sell it we could put it in our vinegar tanks and then trance and vinegar but if you're using flash pasteurization then you couldn't you couldn't do that anymore so our forklift died and we got to use your skid steer so these are the bins of these are Golden Delicious let's just see that's the hail damage there and not too bad a good cider apple so we got the Red Delicious on here right now and what we do here we got this fancy lift we turn it on and it raises it and then you pick it up just like that then go ahead and close this part right here can you pull it so now I'm on the other side of the washer and we got to put use this it is just a fertilizer injector but you use it to put chlorine so that's ten parts per million chlorine in this bucket and for us the then our food safety requires a sanitized Apple before they go into the cider so we this our washer here has two rows of the ministries there and it puts on the chlorine so the applicant chlorinated and a ten parts per million is safe for the consumer so then it comes to here they get all nice and brushed and continue down the line [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you this is our last press of the day that is currently about three o'clock so we're gonna this is a sixty gallon tank we got here recently so it could be pressing cider a lot quicker so this isn't empty I'm gonna pass out addition of last present start cleaning up the floor here start cleaning up the sheets and we are currently at right here 277 gallons pressing fun together Network and that's another thing it's a 60 gallon tank that give or take 50 gallons right there so we do pretty good overall now it's time to clean it up and get get it going just super dry I mean there's probably there's like no moisture I mean it's super dry it's not even moist or anything and we're working on right now or a dude there he's a man with a plan we are working on making some kind of type of dog treats or something out of it cuz we just we usually just feed it to the cows but if we have less ways they equals more money in my pocket though it's we pressed four bins and this is one bin full of the apple cider pulp [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "YwzEQEtyuiU": "thanksgiving what a fantastic time food friends family you just can't beat it i love thanksgiving it's amazing so thanksgiving's gonna be a little weird this year but i think we can make it better with two good cocktails and what does any thanksgiving you'll need than apple pie and pecan pie [Music] [Applause] welcome to making drinks to drink where we make drinks to drink and with any thanksgiving you gotta have pecan pie and apple pie so we're gonna start off with apple pie this this drink is called apple pie on the rocks to make apple pie on the rocks you need an ounce of vodka quarter ounce of vanilla extract an ounce of cinnamon whiskey if you know some say fireball but i have this sinful 69 it is way better than fireball i highly recommend it four ounces of apple cider and a cinnamon stick let's get started so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to sugar the rim of this glass and i really don't know what you're supposed to use to sugar the room of a glass water vodka i don't know but i'm going to try some of this i'm going to add a little bit of cinnamon to that i'm going to get that rim nice and wet and then we're going to wet it with brown sugar kind of like that looks good don't want to let it go to waste okay so we need now the recipe called for vanilla vodka i didn't have any vanilla vodka so i'm just gonna wing it i tried i tried it out a couple different times kind of playing with the ratios seeing how much vanilla would make it good and i just i kind of settled on a quarter teaspoon you can play with it play with it on your tastes see how you like i mean there's no wrong answers as long as you got something else or just get an ounce of vanilla vodka and make your life a lot easier oh this stuff smells so good and then four ounces of apple cider now you can use apple juice if you want to cheat if you just if you can't find apple cider but get some apple cider it's going to be so much better than apple juice and you can also use ground cinnamon but [Music] i'm gonna grind it up myself and just guesstimate with it you know as as i say when you're when you're grinding up spices measure that [ __ ] with your heart and then like one big ice cube and all i had was big ice cubes so i'm gonna have to make a mess and break this one off [Music] good enough new shaking tins i haven't gotten quite used to them yet and a cinnamon stick for garnish and then you have apple pie on the rocks i don't know why it calls it apple pie on the rocks because there's no rocks it's just shaking who knows but let's see how it tastes that's good that tastes just like an apple pie holy [ __ ] i've i did smart with the with the cinnamon on the rim let's see just you get a little bit of the vanilla this the apple cider maybe a little bit too much apple cider to be honest i think it kind of overpowers a little bit of everything else i think if i ever make this again i probably might do maybe a little bit more of the vodka and cinnamon whiskey and a little bit less of the apple cider just to get a little bit more flavors coming at you but you get the brown sugar on the start the cinnamon that's good i highly recommend this one i might have to make this again just to try with different ratios we might have to play around with this one and see if we can't get this one right because it tastes like apple pie but it could be better i'm still going to drink all of it though this is why we make drinks to drink that's a good one but now let's make pecan pie on the rocks now this one i did the recipe you do make it with rocks so it's correct and this is more apple pie up but let's make pecan pie on the rocks okay pecan pie on the rocks to make pecan pie on the rocks you need an ounce of bourbon one and a half ounces of pecans praline liqueur and a half ounce of vodka or for me i'm just using 50 mls what is that is that a half an ounce and we'll find out get started and with making pecan pie on the rocks since it is thanksgiving i thought i'd be a little a little bit extra and what's thanksgiving without turkey so i'm using wild turkey masters keep it's a fantastic bourbon and i'm sure it's gonna make a fantastic cocktail one ounce of bourbon a little ex a little extra for posterity reasons one half ounces of pecans praline and then the comically small bottle of vodka courtesy of my father who flew in how much is this oh that's two ounces that's that's not a half ounce that's that's way too much i don't think i like tito's that'll do it and stir make sure it's nice and chilled and there you have pecan pie on the rocks let's see how it tastes okay i think i like that one better there's maybe if i used a better vodka or a vodka that i liked but it's really good i mean you definitely it definitely tastes like a pecan pie i'm getting again the pecans coming through the bourbon comes through um despite only being an ounce of it um i was actually kind of surprised on that i'd probably even go for maybe the wild turkey rare breed with that that higher proof bourbon i think that might give a little bit more extra punch just to because sometimes when you're dealing with family at thanksgiving you want a lot of alcohol but that's good probably added a little too much vodka but you need more alcohol it's thanksgiving i like this one this is both of these drinks i highly recommend both of these but now i'm going to try to remake this one i might forgo all the sugar rim but let's just see what we can come up with [Music] see if we can't because i love i love apple pie you can't get anything better than apple pie so let's let's experiment it's thanksgiving i have i have company over so i can make them a drink they can have some let's just see what happens okay we're gonna do let's do an ounce and a half of vodka oh i need my shaker good enough let's do ounce and a half of vodka quarter ounce vanilla an ounce and a half of the cinnamon whiskey and then three ounces of the apple cider let's see what that does i'm all out of ice so if this isn't good oh well golly how do you okay [Music] the bread in the oven around the oven i already got the butt out of the oven now it's your turn to get this bun out of the oven okay you know what i think we are gonna oh no we're not all my brown sugar is dissolved here's what we do huh oh we forgot the cinnamon that's okay there's some cinnamon in the bottom of that glass let's see how this one tastes yeah that's much better i highly recommend that one yep i'll put in the description below the original recipe and the new recipe go with the new one this one is this one is way better you get a lot more of the the cinnamon a little bit more of the the the apple cider is still there but you get a little bit more cinnamon a little bit more of the the punch of the vodka so you're adding more alcohol which is never a problem problem definitely this is a winner oh that's going to be good i cannot wait to make that for thanksgiving day maybe forget about thanksgiving because it's not as big as an extravagant as as it could have been but we're all trying to do

welcome to this episode of bake it up a notch this is part one of a four-part pie spectacular that we will be doing in conjunction with food 52 and my new book called the book on pie i'm so excited for episode one which is all about pie dough and pie crusts as always we're gonna tell you everything you need to know all the equipment everything you need to know about the ingredients all the different techniques and of course as always we're going to show you where things could go wrong and how to fix it so if you like past episodes of bake it up a notch and i know you're going to like this one that we're about to roll out here be sure to like and subscribe at the bottom of the screen so you can be notified when new episodes come up each month so let's get baking [Music] first up let's talk about the equipment that we need to make a great pie one of my favorite things about pie is that it really doesn't require many tools but there are tools that i have found will help you make a better end result and are worth talking about let's talk about rolling pins i'm a big believer that rolling pins are a personal preference so just because i use a certain kind of pin which for the record is this french style rolling pin no handles slightly tapered edges that's what i like to use because i really feel like you can get a good feel for the dough but if you prefer a rolling pin with handles like this one here this one has handles and ball bearings so that it the center rotates but the handles stay in place and some people really prefer the handled style pin the other kind of handled style pin doesn't rotate like this is still all one piece like the french style rolling pin but it does have handles so that is a little bit easier for some folks to use whatever feels right to you is what you should use just because it feels best to me doesn't mean it's going to feel best in your hands so i really do think that rolling pins are a personal preference i also added one of my favorite engraved rolling pins to this setup because i wanted to say that pie dough is really an amazing opportunity to be creative we're going to talk about that a lot more in the other parts of our pie spectacular but you can actually even use a pasta rolling pin that's meant to indent the pasta create ridges or a rolling pin that's engraved like this you would use for cookies you can also use that on certain types of pie dough and create sort of embossed effects which are very very cool next up one of my favorite tools of all time the bench scraper the bench scraper is just such a handy tool both for using in the kitchen but also for cleaning up i love when i'm throwing flour around when making pie that just a few quick swipes of that bench scraper are gonna clear off my whole workspace make it clean again in just a few moments so it is a go-to tool that i'm using all the time i also use it to chop my butter into little cubes get all the ingredients ready it's a great tool to have i also have here the pastry cutter this pastry cutter is a handle with metal ridges that go all the way down and that is something that you can use if you are not a person that has success mixing your pie dough by hand i love mixing my pie dough by hand i think it gives you the best feel of the dough i think it helps you get everything just right but for those of you that have hot hands naturally it can be a real struggle to mix pie dough by hand and that's when you can bring in the help of the pastry cutter to do the work that your hands are just too hot to do and if it's summer you can even throw this piece of equipment into the refrigerator or freezer and get it nice and cold before you get going making your pie dough a few other tools that i have i've got a pastry wheel here this one is fluted to make sort of a ridged effect at the edges can be used for cutouts for lattice just to trim your dough if you don't have a fluted one a regular old pizza cutter is also a pastry wheel and can be used to make straight edged lattice effects or straight edge cuts i also have a tool here called a dough tamper or a crust tamper and this is for press-in style crusts you absolutely do not need this tool you can just use your hands for pressing style crust or even the bottom of a small cup measure to help get into the corners and straighten the edges of your crumb crust or other press-in crust but i love this it has sort of a smaller edge for getting into small containers like maybe a mini muffin pan and then it also has this larger one larger side for using for larger more normal traditional size pie crust next up let's talk about this bad boy right here this giant jar that everyone who comes into my house thinks is candy but it is not candy these are pie weights these are ceramic pie weights which happen to be my favorite style of pie weight because i like how they retain heat you put these into a pie shell before par baking or blind baking to help weigh down the crust and we're going to talk about the logistics of that a little later but if you do not have these ceramic pie weights what you can use instead are dried beans or i love stella parks's method of using sugar which is something that if you're making pie you probably have on hand because you can reuse that sugar in baking recipes that is her method that is so great and works so well if you don't have pi weights at home finally the one of the most important things that you need your pie plates right what kind of pie plate do you choose how do you choose it what is your favorite pie plate again some of that comes down to personal preference but i do have two favorites i prefer ceramic and metal pie plates i like metal for its non-stick ability and also because it tends to bake very evenly metal's a bit thinner so you don't get kind of spots that bake more than others but i love ceramic for the way it conducts the heat and kind of holds on to the heat retains that heat it's not only great for serving a pie if you want it to be a touch warm if you're refreshing it but it's also great for ensuring that the sides and base of the crust are properly baked which is one of the most important things in my book that said if you're a beginning pie baker i do love to recommend trying with glass glass pie pans are especially great because you can see through them so if you're not sure if your pie is fully baked if you're not sure if that crust is brown enough you can just lift it right up and take a look so if you're just getting started i think that glass pie plates are great great choice a few other pieces of equipment that i don't have in front of me but that are equally important you can also use other pans other baking vessels other than pie plates i bake pies and cake pans spring form pans cast iron skillets if it is safe to go in the oven it is safe to bake a pie in so you know let that kind of guide you and create multiple options in terms of creativity and size shape and presentation and there's one other piece of equipment that isn't in front of me because it's in my oven where the pies are baking it's called a baking steel or if you don't have a baking seal you can also use a pizza stone to achieve a similar effect i like to use these when baking pie crust to help ensure a crisp golden brown bottom crust for me that is where it's at no soggy bottoms in this kitchen please and thank you so i love how that helps retain heat get it to the bottom of the crust and it also helps keep the oven temperature more consistent during baking which is really helpful for pies because they have much longer bake times so once you have all the brimlane now that we've talked about equipment it's time to talk about ingredients here's what you need to know the bulk of this episode is going to talk about classic pie dough which is a very simple basic pastry style dough that yields a tender flaky end result but there are lots of crust options which we'll talk about later in the episode but for this first part what we are talking about is that pastry style crust and what i really love about those pastry style crusts is that they actually only have a few ingredients and you can really make them so easily with so little components and really turn out a beautiful beautiful end result so the four components of a classic pie pastry are flour fat salt and water you can make pie doughs with almost any kind of flour but i'm usually referring to all purpose flour it has kind of a nice blend of being strong enough but still nice and tender i do use other flowers to make pie crust whole wheat semolina cornmeal rye flour spelt flour the possibilities are really endless but with those other varieties of flour you usually still need to use a little bit of all-purpose or you might end up with a denser more crumbly dough and all-purpose does a really good job of keeping it a little bit lighter so when you're using flour and choosing how to add flour into the recipe start with all purpose and then use that as a base to add some of those other ingredients now i said all purpose flour i didn't specify bleached or unbleached because i find that there's actually really a nominal difference if you use one or the other so whatever you have on hand you should be good to go for my basic pie crust recipe now when i'm talking about fat in pie dough i'm referring almost exclusively to butter i love an all-butter pie dough that's my pie crust recipe on food 52 because i love the flavor now the flavor of butter can't be beat with any other fat that you're going to use but other fats can be easier to handle so especially for beginning pie bakers butter can be one of the more challenging ingredients to work with other types of fat that you could use include shortening which has the highest melting point of any of the fats that i would recommend using for pie dough so because of that it's a lot easier to work with without risking it turning into kind of a melty runny mess another fat that is great to use is lard or other rendered animal fats you can also use chicken fat or bacon fat even but again those have a lower melting point so they can be a little more difficult to work with they do have an incredible flakiness so they they share that with both shortening and butter i've even made a peanut butter pie dough that uses peanut butter to replace some of the fat in the recipe and oil but some of these create naturally flakier crust while some create mealier crusts oil and peanut butter tend to make denser more crumbly mealy crust whereas shortening with its very high melting point can make a very flaky crust but it's lacking that flavor of butter so choosing the fat really depends on your personal preference and also what you have on hand if you want to make a pie today and all you have is shortening i say make a pie even if it's not my preferred fat it works great and again there's an element of personal preference here i happen to love butter because i love that flavor but i actually grew up making pies with a blend of butter and shortening with my grandma so it is possible to kind of tweak it and change it based on the result you're looking for and it's kind of just about knowing how those pieces work together the most important thing that you need to know for whatever fat you're using it should be cold as cold as you can get it is going to make the flakiest best end result our final two ingredients are salt and water now they're pretty self-explanatory salt to add a little bit of a flavor boost we don't want to bland crust we want to amplify the natural flavor of the fat that we're using and also make sure that it's a nice flavorful base for whatever filling we put inside and the water the ice water it could also be another liquid depending on what recipe you're using sometimes people like to use buttermilk or cream or milk in their pie dough as well but i just use water because i always have it and it's the easiest and it should be very cold and you want to add just enough to bring the dough together but not so much that it gets soft so i usually start with a nice big chilled thing of ice water and just use as much as i need to get to where i need to go there are also a couple of ingredients that are commonly added to pie dough that you won't see here there's sugar vinegar and vodka now all of these ingredients are added for different reasons some people add sugar to their pie crust because they just like the pie dough to be a little bit sweet one of my favorite things about pie dough is that it's not too sweet i like that the filling is sweet and the pie crust is not plus having a more generic recipe allows me to swap between sweet and savory much easier so i leave the sugar out of my pie dough but if you wanted to add it you could add up to one tablespoon for every single crust recipe you're making the other two ingredients vinegar and vodka are added to help inhibit gluten formation which helps to keep the dough more tender it also provides a nominal amount of hydration so you would want to add it first before you add the water or other liquid now i don't use these because i find that if you understand the the concepts of mixing pie dough you don't need any special ingredients to make it turn out great and i just like to keep it as simple as possible but if you find you're consistently struggling up to a tablespoon of vinegar or vodka in any pie crust recipe will help a little bit and help you have a more foolproof end result [Music] tell us about the butter see you guys later before we talk about mixing pie dough let's talk about the size of the fat inside the pie dough which again in my case is butter depending on what style of dough you're making you want that fat to be a different size and different sizes create different effects in the oven so i think it's really important to show them side by side and see what i'm talking about and these different methods so that later when you're breaking it down you know exactly what to look for there are five varieties of pie dough here they don't have water so they're not pie dough yet they're just the ingredients there's five varieties here and i have different names for these inside the book on pie i call them dough for decor mealy dough flaky dough extra flaky dough and ruff puff ruff puff we already talked about in one of the earlier episodes of bake it up and off where we talked about puff pastry and my rough puff pastry is done very much in the style of pie dough for that reason so check out that episode for more on that these other ones it's all about the size that the butter is mixed in so dough for decor the butter is mixed in almost entirely it makes sort of a crumbly meal mixture and the reason for that is that that's going to create an incredibly mealy flatter dough it'll still be tender but it'll hold impressions if you do decorative effects and it'll hold its shape better so this is the best kind of dough for things like cutouts or other kind of intricate effects and to make it i mix the butter in almost entirely i even sometimes do this in the food processor because that makes it go quicker and even easier the next dough is the mealy dough and for mealy dough we want our butter or other fat to be the size of peas this is the most common instruction that you'll see in pie dough recipes mix the butter until it's the size of peas and for me that creates a mealy dough so a dough that is still tender but a little bit more crumbly and a little bit more crisp than its flaky more airy counterparts the next dough is flaky dough this is my go-to my favorite and for this the butter should be about the size of walnut halves so bigger than a lot of classic pie dough recipes say we want to leave the butter in big enough pieces that when the fat hits the oven the moisture turns into steam it evaporates and turns into steam and it pushes the pie dough up creating this flaky effect that won't happen if your butter is mixed in more thoroughly so we want to leave them at least the size of walnut halves next we have my extra flaky dough now my extra flaky dough is mixed just slightly larger than walnut have so just leaving the pieces a little bit bigger and the reason for that is we enlist the help of a few folds now don't get scared off if you've watched my puff pastry video what we do for this is just roll it out fold it into quarters roll it out fold it into quarters two sets of folds that can be done back to back and what this does is it shingles the butter a little more evenly creating an incredibly flaky dough that's also a lot easier to handle this is my go-to dough when i'm doing things for photo shoots when i really want the pie to look amazing and in order to withstand those folds it has to has to has to be in slightly bigger pieces when you go to mix it otherwise it's going to get too incorporated and become too small as you make those folds and last but not least we have our rough puff which again we discussed in our puff pastry video and for this we just squish the butter one time we we don't mix it in any thoroughly we take each cube and press it flat and that's it and we want to leave those pieces nice and big for that same reason this undergoes more folds it takes four folds to make the rough puff pastry so we want to make sure that the butter is plenty big enough so that it can go through all those folds and still produce an incredibly flaky dough later so it's really important to understand these sizes so that when you mix your pie dough you know what you're looking for let's talk about mixing the pie dough i already said i like to do it by hand which is what i'm going to show you but the method is the same no matter what technique you choose to get there so to start we need some flour in our bowl i'm going to grab my scale i'm going to do a double crust recipe of pie dough which is just my single all butter pie dough recipe multiplied times two you can increase your pie dough recipe to make as many you know amounts of pie dough as you want i do find with my personal recipe any more than four at a time becomes very difficult to control the hydration and hydration is one of the biggest issues people have with pie dough so i would recommend never making more than four times at a time which could be two double crochet pies or four single cross pies maybe there aren't that many other people in the world that need to know exactly how much pie dough they can make at any given time because we have a lot of pie in this house at any given time all right we're going to do 300 grams which is two and a half cups of all-purpose flour and if you were using multiple flowers you know half of it might be all purpose half of it might be rye that kind of deal so inside the book on pie there are something like 50 crust recipes there are just so many possibilities that you can make work for you i forgot the salt be right back after you've got your flour we just need a hefty pinch of salt and i'm again i'm doing a double crust so i want to make sure that there's a good amount in there and sometimes i cheat and i even just use that little teaspoon to stir that salt in there now we can put our scale away because what we need next is our butter so i am going to cut this butter this is eight ounces of cold butter i'm gonna cut it into about half inch cubes i like to use my bench knife for this and actually one of my favorite parts of the bake it up a notch episode with my dad where we made biscuits he asked me how do i cube my butter and i loved that question because my pie dough recipe just says to cube it it doesn't tell you exactly how i like to do it so i like to cut each stick in half lengthwise then i rotate the stick over and cut it in half that way now that the whole stick is quartered you can just work down cutting it into cubes about half an inch [Music] i am using a european butter here and it's worth mentioning that at this point because european butters have a higher fat content than american butters american butters have a little bit more water in them they're both completely fine to use but the european butter can be a little trickier for first-time pie bakers because since it's higher in fat that means that it is also more prone to melting so you just want to be careful if at any point when you are making your pie dough you start to notice a shine on your hands like the butter is melting if it feels soft just throw the whole bowl at whatever stage you're in into the refrigerator the number one thing about pie dough is it wants to be cold at every stage cold ingredients cold tools cold water cold everything as much as you can i even tell people if you consistently struggle with pie dough put the whole bowl of flour into the freezer before you start start with it as cold as you can get it you won't be sorry now i'm going to toss the butter or the fat if you're not using butter i'm going to toss it with the flour so that each individual cube is coated fully all the way around this is really important and recipes don't always emphasize this enough if the butter is not coated in flour that's one of the ways that it can melt in the oven later so you want to make sure every time you touch it if you can see that bit of yellow that natural color coming through toss it again make sure it's coated and what i'm going to start doing is with my hands i'm just going to grab a cube in each hand and i'm going to press it firmly to kind of shingle it like that and i'm just going to toss it back into the dough so i'm going to keep doing that if you were using the pastry cutter you would just use that instead of your hands here and it doesn't shingle quite as well it more breaks the butter up so you can kind of get it into the smaller pieces then you can even go in a little bit with your hands and break them into smaller ones if you want and i'm basically just going to keep doing this my nieces call this squishing the butter it's a very technical term i'm going to keep squishing the butter and making sure that the squished pieces are coated in flour after i squish each piece flat once i'm going to return and start working with it a little more rubbing it through my fingers a little bit more thoroughly until i get it to the point that i want it and remember what those points are if i was using it for decor i would want it to be really small little pieces of fat if i'm using it for mealy about the size of peas for flaky about the size of walnut halves for extra flaky a little bigger than that and for rough puff pastry we would actually just stop right here at this point and as i said if at any point when you're working you start to struggle or it feels like it might be warm if you're thinking that it might be warm it is so just put it in the fridge five minutes freezer five minutes whatever you can manage if the butter gets warm at this stage while you're mixing it what actually is going to happen is it's just going to melt into your flour a little bit and combine with it almost like you're making a cookie dough and you're going to end up with a really crumbly much more mealy texture i know melee isn't the most appetizing word but it's really the best word to describe what i'm talking about which is still tender but it is not flaky and light and still crisp but not that flakiness not you know pieces kind of falling off as you take bites that kind of pie dough the other reason comes when it's time for it to hit the oven so we want that fat really cold inside the pastry so that when it hits a really intense heat of the oven during par baking blind baking or baking that that moisture evaporates out of the butter creating steam and that's what creates that tenderness that flakiness all those things that we love about pie dough so we want those ingredients to be nice and cold the butter must be cold but the water must be cold too because if the water isn't cold it's actually going to raise the temperature of the butter start to get it to the point where it might melt especially as you continue to work with it because even i who have cooler hands you know eventually that body heat is going to get in there and start kind of messing up the process so if you're a person who naturally has warmer hands cold ingredients are going to help you be able to mix it by hand and they're going to keep the dough the right consistency the whole time i think i'm going to mix this dough flaky so i went ahead and mixed it i've got kind of varying sizes but i've got my biggest pieces are about the size of walnut halves so now i'm going to make a well in the center of the bowl and i'm going to start adding my ice water let's talk about the water for a second i have so much to say the water in pie dough recipes is often listed as an as needed and i know that can be really frustrating because i'm also telling you that getting the hydration right is really really important but the reason that most recipes stay as needed is because every kind of flour even every brand of flour hydrates differently bleach versus unbleached rye versus whole wheat versus all-purpose all of those all absorb water differently so it makes it very difficult to guesstimate what is going to be the appropriate amount of water to add i can tell you for a double crust pie it's about a half a cup but you might need a little more you might need a little less so my preferred method of doing it is just by eye and by feel you want to add as much as you need to bring it together and not worry about the amount so much so i'm going to go ahead and start adding into the well and at first i'll add a good amount because i want to make sure that i've got enough to kind of start bringing it together but remember you can always add more at a certain point it gets harder to take it away so i'm going to just start at first tossing it i'm not going to stir i'm not going to need i'm just going to kind of toss this allows the water to distribute amongst the flour and amongst that fat just kind of starting the process of mixing and hydrating the flour without you know worrying about kneading it or mixing it so much that i start to verge on making it more tough you don't want to mix pie dough any more than you have to at this stage because a kneading action can really start to make it more tough after baking as i'm kind of breaking it up i also look for large pieces like this or like this that have become hydrated see they've started to clump together and i want to break those up a little bit as i'm kind of tossing because water really hides in those clumps you might think your dough is too dry and not realize that there's actually a good amount of water in some of those bigger pieces so again we want to make sure it's distributed throughout and once it's there once you get it to the point that that water that you the first addition of water is starting to become incorporated you can kind of group it together in the bowl and see you know how well it holds together and as you can see i've got a good amount of pieces that are falling down here so sometimes what i like to do is i like to take the part that has already come together just set it aside and only add water to the part that's left here because that just helps me control it a little bit more oh i got an ice cube in there we don't want that that allows us to control and only hydrate the part that is still dry rather than risking adding too much water and ending up with kind of a sticky dough and that's really what we're looking for here we're looking for the dough to come together we do not want it to be totally smooth that would be the sign of an overworked dough and we do not want it to be tacky or sticky or wet to the touch that would be a sign of a dough that's a little bit too wet and it's going to give you trouble when you go to roll it out actually too dry dough can give you a lot of trouble too and i've noticed that especially when people are using pie crust recipes from their grandmas or from their grandma's old cookbooks or recipe boxes a lot of old pie recipes kind of scare you away from adding too much water and that's rightfully so if you have too much water the crust will be very difficult to work with and it's going to end up very brittle it's not very enjoyable however it's a bit easier to save a too wet crust than it is to save a crust that is too dry so i always uh kind of caution that if you're kind of teetering and you're really not sure where you're at that you might want to err on the side of adding a little bit too much because we can always absorb that with a little bit of flour but when you leave the dough too dry it's very stiff and when you roll it out it tends to break it can be really really problematic so i'm getting to the point now where it's mostly come together i just have kind of a few dry pockets to me this part is a dry pocket because you can see that there's little bits kind of crumbly bits of flour that are not incorporated that just fall right off when i brush it you know that's a sign of under hydration sometimes when i get to this stage it is so close i do not want to add much water what i do is i dip my hand into the water and i just flick a few drops into the bowl that again helps us from accidentally pouring in you know a few tablespoons or whatever you're doing so i am now that i've got it i definitely have enough water i'm just going to knead it a few times gently in the bowl to help bring it together and then i'll take it out of the bowl and knead it here just to make sure and when i use the word need i'm using that word somewhat loosely because i really want to make sure that you're not kneading it like you would bread dough we're not trying to build strength we're just trying to get this to the point of being combined and that is what it should look like that is a perfect dough it's come together and it's uniform but you see there are still some variances in texture it's still sort of um you know rough it's not a smooth even all over dough and the way to tell if it's properly hydrated is it's fully come together i don't see any visible dry spots but also when i put my hand on it and press really firmly nothing comes up on my hand afterward that's a sign that it is not wet it is not sticky it is at the exact right level of hydration and that level of hydration is really really a sweet spot because if it's too wet it'll be hard to work with and if it's too dry it'll be hard to work with so you really want to focus on getting that right amount of water in every time it's going to make the dough more pliable and easier to handle as well if you wanted to mix your dough in the food processor you would follow all of these same guidelines just mixing the fat in by pulsing on your food processor until the fat is the right size it doesn't take very long and it's important to not let it go too far or you're going to end up with a very mealy much more crumbly dough so just a few pulses at that point i transfer it to a bowl and i add the water by hand that's important because in a food processor water tends to get trapped under the blade in the corners and you can end up with a really unevenly and over hydrated dough if you add that water in the food processor if you're not really careful so i still suggest adding the water by hand and my final little tidbit if you're a person with really warm hands or if you're ever at a place where you're making a lot of pies sometimes i use the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment to sort of shingle the butter for me now this works well but not as well as this method or the food processor it can kind of end up with bigger pieces or some unevenness so after you do that method with the stand mixer just check back on it maybe run your hands through it once make sure it's right and still add that water by hand so that you can control the hydration and get it just right after you've got your dough all done it needs to chill so since this is a double crust recipe of dough i'm going to cut it in half form it into one inch disks wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and it needs to chill for at least 30 minutes and preferably at least an hour and you can chill it up to overnight you can also wrap it in a double layer of plastic wrap and freeze it and it freezes really really well just thaw it in the fridge overnight before you're ready to use it again there are three stages at which i like to chill my pie dough that's not to say these are the only three stages at which you can chill it you should basically chill your pie dough any time it feels warm it feels soft it feels sticky throw that baby in the fridge but these are the three that i always every single time chill it at the first is right after mixing i form it into a disc about an inch thick wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate it i like to refrigerate it for an hour but you can refrigerate it for just 30 minutes if you were able to work quickly as long as it's nice and cold it should be good to go the second stage i like to chill at is after i've lined the pie plate but before i even finish those edges the reason for that is that there is kind of this issue of crust shrinking right a lot of people have that where they roll it out and as soon as they get it to the size that they want it immediately just comes back one of the reasons that that happens is when the dough is overworked when that gluten hasn't had enough time to relax yet and remember our yeast episode of bake it up a notch we want that gluten to be relaxed that's really what we want here so with the chilling it becomes relaxed and that way when we go to trim it it is already relaxed it doesn't relax after we trim it and risk being too small at the edge that is one of the biggest issues people just trim it really flush to the pie plate then they toss it in the fridge and when they come back it's even smaller than it was before so chilling it at this stage is really great remember if you're chilling it for longer than five or ten minutes you want to cover it directly with plastic wrap so that crust doesn't dry out and the final stage i like to chill a pie at is after it's fully assembled i like to chill it at this stage for at least 30 minutes before putting it into the oven and sometimes it even needs a little bit longer but this chill time is not so much about relaxing the gluten as it is about firming the fat we want that fat to be nice and cold when it hits the heat of the oven so that we create that steam effect we've talked so much about we get that nice flaky tender crispy dough so you want to chill it right after mixing you want to chill it after you've lined the pie plate and you want to chill it before baking so that you have the best pie possible when it comes out of the oven [Music] all right now that our dough has been nice and chilled we can roll it that first chilling point is really to firm that dough back up after mixing and also to help it relax to make it a little bit more pliable i'm going to start by lightly flouring my work surface now i grabbed a pretty decent handful of flour to say lightly flour because i have this tendency i like to put a decent amount of flour down at the beginning and then not have to apply it again as i roll but you don't want to use any more flour than you have to because that flour is going to incorporate into the dough as you work and using too much can actually make the dough a bit tough so i'm going to start by just flouring the surface and both sides of the dough pretty generously you can kind of rub it in like that helps make it a little more even across the surface if you want you can kind of flour your pin by just like running your flowery hand over it and i'm going to start by rolling now rolling is also something that kind of comes intuitively like the motion of it should feel good to you and right to you but the number one mistake that i see people doing is they kind of only roll one direction and that's like a really easy way to get it even in some parts and you know thicker in others so what we want to do i guess even doesn't really apply if it's even in some parts so what i suggest doing is starting in the middle and pushing up then returning to the middle applying pressure and pushing back what this does is it ensures that you're applying the pressure kind of in both directions but the other thing that you should do is not be afraid to move this pie dough i'm constantly picking it up flipping it over rotating it as i work that re-coats it with flour from the work surface to make sure it's not sticking and it also just ensures that by nature that fat isn't going to start melting and stick to your surface so come to the center and push out then come back to the center apply pressure and push towards you come back to the center and push out come back to the center and that can feel a little bit awkward at first but once you get the hang of it of course it goes much faster so it's just a really nice way to make sure that you're not if you just roll like this back and forth you're thinning out the center but not the edges and we want the edges to be especially thin because that's where we're going to be crimping and doing some of those decorative finishing effects so when i get it you know rolled out in one place then i'm going to rotate it that also helps to keep the shape round more round so right now obviously it looks a bit oblong but if i rotate it and now i spend a little bit of time rolling this way i get it back to a place of being more round another thing that you can do is just actually manhandle the dough a bit you don't want to touch it too much because of the heat of your hand but you can actually just kind of tug the dough in the direction that you want it if it's not even in some spot just bring some of it over and you can kind of make it more round just by you know handling it in that way i'm gonna keep rolling i usually tell people to pay more attention to the size than the thickness because pie dough recipes are formulated to fit in a standard pie plate so you're going to end up with the right thickness if your pie dough fits in the pie plate so rather than worrying is it a quarter of an inch thick or an eighth of an inch thick whatever it is just kind of focus on getting it wide enough that it will fit in the pie plate and the way i like to test that is by keeping my pie plate near me and turning it upside down making sure i have about two inches all the way around and you might need even more if you're dealing with a deep dish pie plate so i'm gonna give this just a tiny bit more just to make sure i've got plenty of room [Music] if you're too scared to just lift it up and toss it around like i'm doing when it gets bigger you can actually use the rolling pin to help you transfer it and rotate it to another direction so fear not also one of the added benefits of moving it a lot while you're rolling is that you're kind of encouraging it to shrink when you roll out the dough it's natural for a little bit of it to spring back just a smidge if it does it a lot that usually means it needs more relaxing time more fridge time but when you move it a lot you kind of are making you know you're letting it shrink the amount that it's going to so you can see if you actually need to roll it out more so i think i'm going to be good here i'm going to go ahead and roll it up onto the pin to do that i just start with the edges on either side and i just use my hand and i just kind of hold it in place as i roll it up like that then i bring my pie plate in and we just add kind of drape the far edge and then unfurl it just into the pie plate now this next phase is really important and not always described in books but now we need to make sure that it's fully covering the base and touching the edges of the pie plate so what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to lift it up and settle it into the pie crust and you can also do this with the help of your hand lifting it up and pressing lift and you're lifting it up because you're kind of trying to let the air that's between the crust and the pan escape so there's no air there and that we're just so we lift it up and press it down all the way around and then i usually like to go through with my finger and physically press firmer in that corner just to really make sure that pie is that pie crust is touching in those corners so that is how you line a pie plate at this stage i would usually chill it even if it's just for five minutes before proceeding to the next stage and you can chill it for even longer but remember that longer chill times you know 20 minutes 30 minutes even up to an hour you would want to cover this dough directly with plastic wrap as the dough sits in the fridge if it's exposed to air for too long it is going to dry out and even it can crack when you try to manipulate it crimp it do other things so it's important if you're going to chill it for any longer than a few minutes that you cover it directly in plastic wrap and once it's chilled we can complete our next stages in getting the edges ready for crimping singing about what we're doing we're gonna cut some i don't know once you have a chilled lined pie crust inside your pie pan it's time to trim it so what we want to do is we want to trim it so that there's just about between a half an inch and one inch of excess all the way around the dough and how much excess depends a little bit on your personal preference if you don't like a lot of crust at the edge i don't know who you are but if you don't like a lot of crust at the edge you might want to air towards a half an inch if you like a good amount of crust at the edge like me and some of the people in this room then you might want to go with closer to one inch so i'm going to use my scissors to trim it all the way around i just think scissors make a much easier job of this than trying to use a knife or a pastry cutter i'm going to save these pie scraps for a very important project that we're going to talk about a little later and you want to do this trimming whether you're doing a single crust or a double crust pie this first stage will be the same once you have trimmed it all the way around we are going to start folding the excess dough under itself and making that flush with the outside edge this is not something that every recipe tells you to do but i think it is so great to do for a couple of reasons one you're kind of building a crust you know wall of sorts more crust makes it a little bit easier to seal it to the pie plate and it makes it a lot easier to crimp because you're dealing with a little bit more crust at the edges so what i'm going to do is i'm going to lift it up at the edge and i'm going to fold it under and then once it's folded under i'm just going to press it firmly so that that edge is flush with the pie plate like that [Music] at this stage we have folded the excess under all around the edge of the crust and this crust is prepared for crimping it's also perfectly fine to chill this pie now and bake it just like this without doing any kind of decor to the edges and it would look great but what we're going to do is we're going to chill it again or if it's feeling cold enough you can go right into crimping and you can crimp with your fingers with utensils we're going to talk more about some ideas for that later so this is how you would prepare the edges for a single crust pie it's a little bit different for a double crust pie so i'm going to roll out the dough for that get some filling and we'll show you how it's different i've gone ahead and lined the pie plate leaving that excess all the way around and i've put my filling in now i'm going to roll out my top crust and we'll transfer it to the top of the filling and what we're going to do is we're sort of going to seal the top crust with the bottom crust this helps not only you know kind of making it look good before baking but it really helps it retain its structure during and even after baking sometimes the fillings in double crust fruit pies especially tend to shrink after baking if they were raw fruit before we're going to talk more about that in the fruit pie episode but it can also help kind of just create a stronger top crust so that even if something happens in the filling underside the crust maintains its beautiful beautiful shape it's important that it's wide enough at this point because if it's too thin you're going to struggle to get this sealing effect but you also don't want the top crust to be too thin it's a little easier to work with and i also like you know plenty of heft to a top crust so i can enjoy it as a crust lover i think that looks pretty good what we're going to do is we're going to roll it onto the pin bring our filled pie in so we're just going to unfurl it placing one edge on one side of the pie plate and then just unrolling our pin you can just pull it a little if you need to adjust it then what i like to do with a double crest pie is i like to run my hand a little bit around the filling that just sort of creates a little of that dome shape that i think is sort of you know an iconic pie thing once you've got that what we're going to do is we're going to press firmly with our fingers the top and the bottom crust together and we're not just pressing them together we're also trying to thin them out a little bit so we want not two pieces of thick dough we kind of want to make them into one piece of thinner dough all the way around so i'm really going to press firmly with my hands like this all the way around and i'm kind of working from the bottom and pressing the bottom one into the top all the way around all the way around if you get to a point where you don't have as much dough on the bottom maybe you don't press it as firmly with that top crust because you want to make sure you have an equal amount of dough now we're going to treat this excess amount of dough just like we did the first time we're going to use our scissors to trim away the excess leaving behind just about a half an inch sometimes when you trim away you'll only be trimming a piece of the top crust sometimes when you trim you'll only be trimming away a piece of the bottom crust you pressed it together all the way around so now we're just dealing with kind of one crust [Music] once we get the crust all the way around trimmed and ready to go we're going to do that same thing folding it under itself so it's important this time that what we're doing is we're folding the top crust under the bottom crust so it's really important to make sure we get it sealed so we're just gonna lift it up and fold it and i'm really trying to shove that crust down so that it makes contact with the pie plate down there once you've folded that edge under all the way around your double crust pie is ready to be baked or ready to be crimped decorated in its next stages so it's that same kind of concept of folding it under you just want to do it so that the top crust is folded under the bottom crust in addition to classic pies that are baked in pie plates single and double crust of course there are a million other pie options one of my favorites is the free-form pie the most common of which that is you know widely known is the galette so i love a galette i often use my rough puff or extra flaky dough to make it and the same is true for all free-form pies you can make free-form pies double-crossed they can be latticed they can have crimped edges there's really nothing you can do with a classic traditional pie that you can't do with a free-form pie and best of all it's very easy to get that bottom crust baked properly because it's in direct contact with a nice flat surface so in the oven it always bakes up crisp and golden and it has a really easy doneness trick built in whenever you're making a free-form pie you just want to shake the pie on the baking sheet if it moves from side to side that crust is baked and it is done and ready to go i love all free-form pies this is a nice cherry galette you can make absolutely any kind of freeform pie just remember you usually need a little less filling because by nature these pies are flatter because they don't have the walls of the pie pan to support it when any pie but especially free-form pies are properly baked you can pick them right up and they are so sturdy look at that ah little dance little pie dance don't try this at home but actually do because your crests are totally going to be able to handle it [Music] this is my every pie crust demonstration psa save your pie scraps guys save them save your pie scraps don't throw that stuff away you can save the tiniest bit of pie scrap and turn it into something delicious for now or you can save them sometimes i wrap little pieces and i put it in a bag in my freezer that's full of pie scraps and when i have enough i make something with them so always save your pie scraps such good buttery flaky work you've put into that dough and you can make so many fun things from it sometimes i use pie scraps to make decorative elements on a full pie like cut outs or little embellishments like a little braid something in that vein but you can also just make other components using your scraps sometimes i roll out dough into little pieces like this and all this is is pie dough with some fruit on top and i sprinkled it with some coarse sugar and baked it until it was golden and crisp a nice little portable hand pie alternative all made with scrap dough some other things i love to do with scrap dough are cut it into tiny little pieces and bake it separately i egg wash it and toss it with sugar and then i use it on top of a baked pie like streusel you can't usually put the pie crust juice on fillings before baking unless they're sturdy enough to support the weight but you can bake them separately like this and put it on a finished pie for some added crunch some added flair and a great way to use up your pie scraps then this is one of my other favorite ways to do it i just like to bake it almost into like little crackers or other vessels i baked these into little toast shaped ones because i like to mash avocado onto these like avocado toast but pie fide so the options are really really endless with your pie scraps they're just as endless as with the dough itself so save your pie scraps every time [Applause] let's talk about crimps one of my favorite parts of the pie process is decorating your dough it's so much fun so let's start with some really easy ones first get you started i call this one the fork chevron crimp and it's kind of just a step up from the classic fork crimp which would just be pressing your fork into the dough so what i'm going to do is i'm going to flour my fork a little bit i'm going to press it at an angle so that the the indentation closer to the edge of the pie plate is shorter than the indentation towards the center of the pie plate i'm going to press down and then i'm going to press again going the other way i'm just going to keep going around the pie alternating as i press and anytime you need to just flower those fork tines make it easier to press very quickly you have a very cute very easy little pie crust crimp crimps not only decorate your pie dough but they also help seal the pie dough to the pie plate so they really are so great for a variety of reasons beautiful let's do another this is another simple one to do that i use my scissors for so what we're going to do is we're going to just snip the dough at kind of a 45 degree angle leaving about half an inch between each piece and when we get back around to the other side you can actually leave it just like this but i like to sort of fan them out going opposite directions and this is actually based on a bread shaping technique that's done on baguettes called um epis that are sort of meant to look like stalks of wheat so just like that let's do some more this next one i call the classic finger crimp and for this one you're going to need both of your hands whichever hand is your dominant hand is going to be making sort of a v shape with these two fingers your thumb and pointer finger at the edge of the pie plate so if you're left-handed you would do it over here but i'm right-handed so i do it over here and your non-dominant hand is going to be pressing in and down so you're kind of pressing towards each other your dominant hand is making the shape and your non-dominant hand is going to make sealing it to the pie plate and i usually just kind of find where the last one ended and start right there the wider you leave your dominant hand the larger the crimp shape will be some people also do this instead of using their fingers they use their knuckle pressing like this that makes a little bit more of a rounded edge and this makes a little bit more of a pointy effect i really like that little bit of a point because it just stays a little bit sharper after baking so just like that this is one of my most used crimps i call it the rope crimp and a lot of people do this crimp one-handed using your forefinger and your thumb but i find that really difficult so i press the dough instead between my two pointer fingers of both hands it's just another example though there's no one right way to do things there are lots of ways i'm gonna kind of grab the dough between my fingers at an angle and press the dough between my fingers and wherever that last one ends i'm just gonna start the next one just like that this particular crimp is a combination of a fork crimp and a finger crimp and it's just also a reminder that most of these effects unless a specific effect specifies that it can't be done it can be done to either a single or a double crust pie so you can get creative and use these effects on lots of different creations so for this one what i'm going to do is that same finger crimp but i'm going to leave it a lot wider i'm going to leave space in between each crimp so i'm still just pushing kind of down with my non-dominant hand and making the shape with my dominant hand and then i'm going to go in between all of these ridges and press with a fork which is just really easy but it kind of adds another element of flair to a classic pie crust crimp so i'm just going to press with the fork all the way around just like that so cute [Music] let's talk about par baking because people don't understand it pie crust can be baked all on its own straight after you form it in the pie shell with filling just straight to the oven however many many many types of pie benefit from either par baking or blind baking and it's really a very simple process it's just a very misunderstood one so let's break it down so you know what to do if you ever want to par or blind bake your pie crust first of all a brief description of both of those par baking is when you partially bake a crust that is going to be returned to the oven again later to bake again blind baking is when you fully bake a crust because the filling that's going inside of it is not going to be baked again in the oven so the first process for both par or blind baking is the same the only difference is the amount of time they spend in the oven so i've got my crimped pie shell here already in a pie plate the first thing i'm going to do is grab a trusty fork and i'm going to dock the crust the inside of the crust all over with this fork i especially want to get up here at the edges because this is where that pie dough that we folded under is and it can be a little bit thicker and be prone to puffing up there so by poking holes in it like this what we're doing is we're reducing the amount that it is going to puff up by allowing kind of puncturing the dough so that when that steam happens it has somewhere to escape and don't worry about the appearance of this the holes pretty much fill in and largely disappear during the par and blind baking process you don't need to worry about having lots of tiny holes in your crust i learned a big pie originally from my grandma and my grandma actually said to me once when i was showing her this technique she said but isn't the filling gonna go through those holes in the bottom but because we're par baking at first no it is not if you just poked holes in it like this and then poured your filling in maybe it might have a problem but not if you do it like this so i'm doing it all over the sides and the base once i've got nice little holes all around my pie plate i'm going to cut a piece of parchment paper you can also use foil for this but i prefer parchment paper and it needs to be a little bit bigger than the pie plate and i'm going to kind of press the parchment into the pie plate a little it may not stay don't worry it will stay once we add our trusty pie weights now pie weights are the first area that is really misunderstood in par and blind baking you cannot just put pie weights in the base of the crust the pie weights need to come all the way up to the edge of the pie crust to where the crimp begins if they don't you're not weighing down that portion so people who struggle with the sides of their pie dough falling down having issues like that that's why it's happening either not enough chill time or not enough pie weights so i'm going to go ahead and pour this is my workout now with ceramic pie weights this is probably the equivalent of four sets three or four sets of ceramic pie weights they do not sell them in this quantity so if you're at home and you're thinking that that little pie weight set i have is not enough use your beans here get two or three pounds of beans that should be enough to fill your pie plate to the edge just like this this is what you need to ensure that it's fully weighted down and just think about it if you only weigh down the base there's nothing holding the sides in place and that's what you're doing with these weights you're holding the dough exactly where you want it to stay until the structure is set once the structure is set we can take these weights away and bake it until it's golden brown and exactly how we want it so i'm going to leave this here for a second just to show you i'm going to grab an already par baked and an already blind baked dough so you can see what they look like so the initial process of par or blind baking is exactly the same what we're going to do is once it's lined with these pie weights filled fully we're going to bake it in the oven for 15 to 17 minutes at 425 degrees if you have a baking steel or baking stone you want to enlist the help of that here too i usually put it on the lowest rack of the oven to again get some of that heat from the bottom of the oven to give its work to make sure we're getting a nice crisp bottom of our crust so after that initial 15 to 17 minutes you're going to remove the pie weights i usually just have a metal bowl right by the oven so i can make a quick transition and let those pi weights cool you're gonna return it to the oven for two to three minutes more or until that part where that was covered with pie weights previously appears dry it'll appear wet when you first take the pie weights out we want to just get it to the point that it's fully dried out to blind bake you would proceed with that same process except when you remove the pie weights you would bake for 10 to 12 minutes more until you start to see some visible browning on the bottom crust which we can see right here on this crust it started to brown even from the base another way that you can test to see if it's fully baked is actually by twisting it gently and lifting it out yes you can fully remove that from the pie plate and that way we know that it is fully baked look we can see right there it's baked it's nice and brown the same can actually be said of a par-baked crust you can kind of turn it around and see and sure enough we can get this one to come out too it's really important to consider par or blind baking because the amount of time it takes for the filling to bake is usually not enough time for the crust to bake too so by starting that process a little before we add the filling we can just kind of set ourselves up for the best pie success no soggy bottoms a nice crisp crust it's also another way that you can make things ahead because i know pies can feel like a longer process but par baking or blind baking can be done up to 24 hours before you want to finish and serve your pie so there's one other type of par baking that you can do i get questions about this a lot it's a little bit more finicky but i wanted to show you for that reason it's how to par bake a double crust pie so i'm going to go grab my pie crust out of the oven to show you what i'm talking about to par bake the crust for a double crust pie it's a little bit more finicky and it restricts what you can do at the edges but what you would do is you would line your pie plate allowing that excess half an inch to an inch to just hang over the edge of the pie plate you can see right here that the dough is actually extending over the lip of the pie plate that was intentional we want to do that because now that it's parbate we're going to trim that excess away then once you fill it and put your top crust on you can just seal the top crust to your par-baked bottom crust using a fork or some other crimping technique so what i'm going to do is i'm going to grab my trusty scissors again you have to do this while it's still warm to achieve the easiest cleanest effect if you let it cool it just becomes a little bit more brittle and harder to trim i do have an article about this on food 52 about the full steps of par baking a double crust pie so once it is trimmed now that pie crust is pretty much flush with the outside edge we can fill it put the second crust on top and crimp that top crust right to the par-baked base a lot of recipes benefit from par or blind baking but not every recipe is going to tell you to do it so it's just another skill that you yourself can kind of add to your baking tool kit so that you can add it whenever you want that crispier crust if you're still confused about par or blind baking just leave me some questions in the comments send me a dm on instagram i'd love to help you get to the bottom of it because this right here is going to be the key to so much pie success for you i promise there is a whole world of pie crust beyond classic pie pastry within classic pie pastry you can have all kinds of flavors chocolate different flowers spices citrus zest there are tons of options but you break out of that mold and there are even more for the pie crust phobic i remind you that there are so many things that you can do that don't even involve rolling the crust out if you don't want to a few of those examples are right here in front of me and there are a ton more ideas in my new pie book the book on pie so right here we have my nut crust which can be made with any style or not style there aren't styles of nuts any kind of nut pistachios which is what i made it with today almonds walnuts pecans and it bakes up crisp and toasty and just incredibly flavorful also bonus it's naturally gluten free also in the naturally gluten-free realm is my coconut macaroon crust this is also a great example of how you can make crusts of other favorite ideas another one i have in the book is based on haystack cookies similar thing my mom used to make with coconut but with chocolate and butterscotch and it firms up it doesn't require any baking nice and easy we have a classic crumb crust here which is made by grinding cookies or crackers or cereal or potato chips really anything you can think of into fine crumbs and combining them with butter and pressing them right into a pan then these two are such beauties but also very simple to make this is a phyllo dough crust made using just frozen phyllo dough that i thawed brushed with butter sprinkled with some sugar and layered best of all it creates this incredible ruffly effect beautiful texture that looks so great on pies but it is so easy to replicate and this one is a little fancier but so much fun this is a meringue pie crust and i actually got this idea from one of my mentors in the baking world rose lee v berenbaum who has it in her ice cream book and i loved the idea because it's this incredible marshmallowy texture when it bakes up that is so good with different kinds of cream based fillings i even have a pie in the book on pie called the eaten mess pie that i make just like an eaten mess custard with meringue and whipped cream and jelly so good so if you're thinking pie crust isn't for me i hate all the process of making it never fear there are so many ways that you can make a pie and make it just the way that you like it there are a number of mistakes that can happen in the world of pie dough and the first two sort of happen when mixing so let's talk about those first we mentioned it a little bit when i was doing the mixing by hand that the most common problem is hydration so this is a good example of a dough that is too dry and you can tell because even when i lifted it up it just started to fall apart you know it doesn't hold together but the other way that you can tell is really by these like dry little bits that was a big piece of butter but these dry little bits right in here it just is kind of a mess all it needs is a little more moisture but it's a lot harder to get that moisture incorporated once the dough is fully mixed so if you notice after chilling that the dough is too dry what you're going to do you still need to very lightly flour your surface but don't use too much because you're just going to make the dough drier we're going to try to roll it out just as thin as we can get it to try to give us a little more surface area we're not trying to roll it out like we're gonna put it in a pie crust and you'll see why for one thing look how it just like cracks it crumbles it's doing that because it's not hydrated properly so it's sticking to my rolling pin there's all kinds of problems so i'm just going to roll it out a little bit here i'm going to grab some cool water with my fingertips just dipping my fingertips into the water and i'm going to flick that water onto the pie dough a few times just to help hydrate it you might even flip it over and do a couple on this side too we're just incorporating a few drops of water now what we're going to do is fold it the same way i showed you for extra flaky dough or rough puff just fold it in quarters once you get it into that quarter you can kind of squish it back into a ball shape press it into a one inch thick disk and now it will be more properly hydrated after another round of chilling in the fridge and it should be good to go remember that this process does start to work the dough anytime you have to do this you are risking making the dough a little bit tougher so focus on that hydration right from the get go when you can the other problem that can happen during mixing is that the dough is too wet i'm gonna put a good amount of flour down here because i'm going to need it to fix this to wet dough you can see already trying to take it out of this plastic wrap that it is just a sticky mess stuck to my hand stuck to the plastic wrap i'm leaving so the way that you fix this is almost by doing what i told you not to do in rolling we're going to use so much flour we're going to basically use more flour than you normally would to roll out dough because we are trying to get that excess flour to absorb the excess moisture so what i'm going to do i'm going to roll the dough out keep flouring it generously or it will stick to your work surface and it will stick to your rolling pin get it to about a half an inch thick make sure it's nicely coated with flour on both sides then fold it in quarters if you feel like it still feels sticky to the touch you can even repeat the folding process but if you've incorporated enough flour you can just form it back into a disc wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and it's ready to chill again to use once it's relaxed a little there are more mistakes that can happen kind of during the baking stages so let's talk about those next the first is my number one pet peeve just not using enough pie weights that's all it takes for something to kind of slope down the sides here is an example i only put pie weights in the very bottom of this pie just in the bottom layer and as you can see only one side kind of really slumped down right here it's not where the others are but the whole top of the pie is uneven the crimps did not stay and part of the reason was the dough wasn't weighted well so once it hit the oven and it started to perform those flaky beautiful puffy bits it just kind of lost control some of it slid down some of it puffed up too much over here it's just kind of a mess if i had used those pie weights all the way up to the top this wouldn't happen we'd have a nice finished you can even see in this one which is an error still that we've you know it stayed where it's supposed to stay so use enough pie weights and you won't have this particular issue another issue that's so common especially if you have hot spots or an unpredictable oven is some of the crust getting a little too dark so you can see we have this nice beautiful brown crust over here and we've got some little foil guys over here they are just covering up a bit of the crust that got really dark so that it didn't continue to get any darker in the oven so that is something that you can do they also sell silicone kind of guards for the edges but i like the foil because you can just put it where you need to put it whenever you need to to help keep your crust a little more even and prevent mistakes like this from getting worse the final mistake is not chilling your pie dough enough i've said it a million times and i'll say it a million more pie dough likes to be cold the ingredients should be cold the equipment should be cold the dough itself should be nice and chilled when it hits the oven if it is not we rolled this one out and then put it right into the oven almost all a huge amount anyway of the fat ran out of this pie crust and you can see the evidence on the parchment paper and peeling it up it just it's stuck it's stuck to the sheet tray because the fat has run underneath and kind of fused it to the sheet tray but more importantly this crust which i don't know that i'll be able to pop out of the pie plate maybe i will i said when they're properly baked it should pop out but this one is properly baked and it is not popping out because it is incredibly brittle because all that fat ran out there is no richness no moisture oh yeah i cracked it but i need to crack it to show you look look how brittle that is it's just so when people tell me their crust is really tough a lot of times it's because this has happened that that fat has run out of the dough in the oven so if you've experienced repeatedly sort of a very tough hard to get your fork through brittle crust it can happen for either this reason not chilling it enough or your oven not being hot enough when it goes in if your oven isn't hot enough you don't have an oven thermometer at that nice high temperature some of the butter is going to melt out before the crust has a chance to set instead of creating that steam effect that happens when a really cold crust hits a really hot oven so yeah the other time that this sort of brittle fat melting out situation can happen is if the fat isn't fully coated in flour so remember again when you're mixing that dough that you're continuing to toss the cubes well in flour so that they are coated on all sides if just you know a raw piece of butter hits the oven of course it's going to want to melt but that flour sort of performs a protective sort of barrier so to avoid issues like this to keep your crust nice and flaky you want to make sure it's really really cold that your oven is really really hot and that all the pieces of butter are fully coated in flour and you're gonna have success and a nice tender crisp flaky crust not a tough brittle whatever this is [Music] thank you so much for joining me for this episode of bake it up a notch where we talked all things pie dough be sure to share your pies with me with hashtag bake it up a notch leave me some comments send me some dms let me know what kind of pies that you're making i've already forgotten the other thing i'm going to say here's my book our next episode is going to be all about custard pies so be sure to tune in next month to check it out don't forget to check out the book on pie and we'll see you next time here on bake it up a notch happy baking [Music]", "6vmhzeo9GG0": "we all love a cozy drink in the fall I especially love to have my own cozy drinks right at home yes it's fun going to a store and buying them but when you can make them at home it can be an extra-special gift when you have someone over three of my favorite drinks in the fall our spiced apple cider warm Earl Grey steamer and of course a deliciously spiced pumpkin latte you can't go wrong with any of these drinks and they are so different and unique each on their own and yet together they all have the same great flavors of fall I always know Falls coming when fresh apple cider start showing up in the stores I love to buy a local orchards of fresh apple cider as soon as I see it one of my favorite ways other than just drinking it straight from the jug is to make this warm spiced apple cider it's so simple and it's so much better than any mix that you buy just place some of the fresh apple cider right into a kettle that you can put on the stove I'm making this just for one person so I'm just using a small amount but if you can of course make any amount you want to this all you need to do is add some whole allspice berries and a small cinnamon stick in just a little bit of sugar you can of course adjust the sugar and spices to meet your specific light place that on the stove and let it come to a simmer and simmer it for about five to ten minutes just to make sure the cinnamon stick and berries release all their flavors once it's simmered just give it a little bit of a whisk to make sure all the sugars dissolved and then pour it right into a glass through a strainer just to remove those berries and cinnamon garnishing a drink just kind of as an extra special treat I love to make these quick and simple apple chips for this drink they are actually extremely good to eat on their own but when added to this drink they have a special player slice thinly one Apple I like to use a mandolin for this because it's the simplest way to make this than a slice but if you have great knife skills good for you and go for it place them on a parchment lined baking sheet and just sprinkle them with some sugar and [Music] make sure to turn them over and sprinkle both sides of the sugar and cinnamon place them in aloe about 225 degree oven and it will take about one and a half to two hours for them to really crisp it and about halfway through you want to make sure to flip them over so both sides are evenly dry once that's done just take them out let them cool and they are a great chip and the perfect garnish for this drink [Music] a steamer is something that you don't often think about when you're going through a coffee shop but every time I have one I think why don't I have this more often and at home they're even more simple to make all you need is melt tea and a little bit of flavoring place your milk into a kettle you can do this in the microwave too if you want it's just as simple for me to use the stove place it on the stove and let it come to a simmer you just want to make sure it starts to steam around the edges once it does place a good quality Earl Grey tea bag right inside of it and let it steep Earl Gray is one of those special teas it has a unique flavor and is really delicious when added with the flavoring let it steep for about five to ten minutes just to make sure all the tea releases its flavorings take the teabag out and pour this right into your cup to finish this I like to add one of my favorite syrups which is an English toffee syrup you can of course just use a simple syrup of sugar and water if that's what you like or vanilla syrup would work really well too that's all there is to an Earl Grey steamer now you're gonna wonder why you don't make these all the time thankfully you can we all know we're excited when we see pumpkin lattes in the coffee shops we kind of are out on pumpkin craze it seems like right now and I'm totally okay with that because fall and pumpkin well they're just perfect but I like to make my own pumpkin latte at home it's completely different than any one that you would buy so be prepared for it's a taste and the consistency is completely different but it is delicious to start just make sure that you've watched the pumpkin butter recipe that I have it is so simple and so quick and this is the perfect way to use it if you're not used to making espresso at home I have a simple easy espresso maker [Music] but you can use an extra strong coffee tube just through it extremely strong and use a small amount to your liking take a little bit of the pumpkin butter and a shot of espresso and put it in a small glass and whisk it together until it's completely incorporate it next you want to add on your steamed milk this is just bringing it to a simmer either on the stove or in the microwave and then we're gonna frost the milk just to finish it off on top I use one of these home for authors you can find them in any store they're relatively inexpensive if you have your own way of frothing your milk use it anyway we'll do [Music] a little bit of froth on top and finish it off with a sprinkling of cinnamon this is already smelling amazing can I think once you try it you will be amazed how the real pumpkin flavor really comes through which is something you don't think about when you buy a pumpkin latte these drinks are my favorite all fall long you can have people over and serve these and they are going to think they're in the most amazing coffee shop but they're simple enough that you can make them every day on your own enjoy these all fall along [Music] thanks for watching this video to see more videos that you might enjoy click over here or click down here and subscribe to our channel to see all the great new videos we come out with each week can't wait to see you again [Music]", "z3IO9mQ-wl4": "everyone welcome back it's later again today I'm doing a hard apple cider from a kit now this kit is by Brewers best it's called cider house select it's their apple cider brand and since I've never done cider before my first time I mean I've been brewing beer for years I started winemaking several years ago I've done needs now I've done siders and I've always wanted to try it so I happen to stumble across this kit at my local homebrew shop and I am going to give it a shot I'm not a big fan of kits I'll tell you that from my experience of the year will it be a beer kit or a wine kit you don't get the same quality result that you would get if you just put the sweat equity into it and make it from scratch and have full control over the process and the result is usually a much higher quality drink so but anyway I'm going to give it a shot I'm going to put this thing to its paces and I'll give you my opinion of it so for starters if you buy it this kit here you'll see on the box or the back of the bag it says you need to have two pounds of corn sugar or dextrose which is the same thing so my home brew shop also had here are two pounds one-pound bags times two of corn sugar so you'll have be able to print out these instructions from their website or your instructions inside the bag as well but just keep in mind you'll need this bag two pounds of corn sugar and probably about six gallons of treated water so here's my six and a half gallon carboy this with my sanitizer in there I did a video on sanitation for home brewing you can actually check that out for details as to what sanitizers you may have on hand or may want to buy but I'm using star Santa for this so now I'm going to drain us out of here and let this drip dry so let's open this kit and see what's inside there we go all right take a look at oh there's some juice yeah there's the juice and there's a side pouch here see let's take the step out of here and I'll flame on the table for y'all to see now it looks like you're in addition to the juice that's in the package there's some cider yeast right there it comes with some sweetener some apple cider flavoring not sure what that is and instructions so that's what's comes in the packet in a little side pouch in the front so when you cut the top off this thing it's going to expose the juice as well as a side pocket worth everything stuff in the side so next up here is to get a gallon of clean water in my case I have Lake Michigan water which is chlorinated so I had to use a water filter to dechlorinate it but it's one gallon of cleaned chlorinated water and get to a boil and then add the two pounds of corn sugar so go ahead just dump that in this one pound second pound there we go so start to dissolve it now I got to add that to my carboy now so I put my sanitized funnel in already I'll be funnelled exam okay next step is to add the the actual syrup of the cider concentrate it's going to pull it in now okay then it says to rinse the inside of the pouch with some cleaning water to get the remaining syrup and pour that into so I'll do that now - okay I poured some water in this thing swill up around to get the leftover syrup it's still stuck to the walls I'll mix it in there and it's going to pour that into there we go and then you going to add some more clean water dechlorinated water up to the six gallon mark on the carboy so let's do that all right I'm guessing that six gallons is right about there so that's a lot of cider now one thing I want to point out that's not in the instructions you can see there is a dark darker color down here and it's lighter as he go up well all that shirts up it's all still kind of neatly now at the bottom so what I'm going to do is shake up this this carboy and get a nice good even mixed together so it's all homogenous in there there we go that's a lot better so I definitely would recommend doing that now the next step is to wait until the temperature of the of the mix is below in a certain range which i think is between 68 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit this is a bright about 74 or 76 so its wealth and range and I'm ready to add my yeast so the next step now is to add the yeast now I was reading this package it's not just yeast it's yeast and yeast nutrient which is a good thing I was about to add my own yeast nutrient from my home brewing days in here to get a yeast and an extra kick but it comes with it so that's that's really nice so let's go ahead and add that in there and also it says it's optional is to add the sweetener now you pop me I'll be able to read this but you add this whole package in there to make it a sweet cider about half the packet to make it a medium sweet cider and do not add any to make a dry cider I made my choice dry it is and the next step there it is to put on your airlock so what I have here is my card boy cap with my top cap removed I'm going to work in one of these s-shaped airlocks in here filled to the max line with a star stand solution and there we go so let's go find a place for this thing to ferment and there it is sitting next my fireplace in my living room next to another fermenting batch of beer here actually and they're going to keep to our company for the next seven to ten days it's been almost two weeks probably about 13 days actually and I am ready to kick it so the Russian colour that's how it looks when it's done at this so it's been about three and a half weeks the first two weeks were the fermentation about a week and a half worth of carbonation and refrigeration so let's let's give this side our taste well here we go let's give it a taste first the smell yeah it's yeah umm the Roma it's not be really much of a Roma there at all is let's give it a taste we try it again well it's a little thin bodied umm pace a little bit watered down for like the flavor let me try that again for the flavor it's so it's a little weak because it's a little watered down but what I do taste there is pretty good it's got a nice tart finish to it it's a dry cider so it's nice a nice dry finish so it's got that going for it but good overall it's an okay cider it's a kit cider just like I said at the beginning of the home brewing video here or this cider brewing video that I'm not a big fan of kits would it be wine kits barricades and Elsa cider kids they all pretty much have the same flaws yeah it's convenient yeah it gets it into the Hobby so it's got that going for it if it's your first time doing it I'd say go ahead and give it a shot but personally for my palate I would rather have just gone to the store and bought some six-packs of some high-quality cider and called it a day and skip this whole this kit step here umm I have five and a half gallons of it here I'm going to finish it up I'm still going to drink it it's not that bad it's an OK cider but again my discerning palate I like better so I think in a future video I'm going to go ahead and try to do an actual cider from from scratch and see how that turns out but it's for a kids cider if it's the first time wanting to try give it a try see for yourself it's not that bad but it's also not that great so just keep that in mind as so so thanks for watching and stay tuned for some new videos coming up thanks for watching be sure to check out

in the instant pot [Music] hi everyone this is stephanie manley with copykat.com today I'm going to show you how to make a hard cider braised pork loin and I have a whole pork loin right here now all of this isn't going to go in the instant pot but what I wanted to do is show you how to prepare a pork loin and how you can get a couple of different cuts out of here and really save yourself some money so these often go on sale for about a dollar ninety-nine a pound or so or at least they do around me I live in Houston Texas and this last week at Costco this was a dollar ninety nine pound and then they took off like five bucks off of the whole pack so all of this meat was I don't know probably like 12 13 bucks so great deal so you want to know what you can do with it so this is the sirloin ends of the pork loin now this shouldn't be confused with a pork tenderloin or just the pork loin the weird actually can make to roast out of this and then you can make some loin chops so my into pot I know it's probably about this basic so I am just going to chop these into two different rows right here so this is a roast right here and this is the rib side of the pork loin and I'm also just going to chop off another piece of roast like this so you can get two roasts out of here and these if you've ever bought the boneless pork chops that's what you have right here you can see that this is a really nice very lean pork chop so whatever you want to do right here you can kind of just cut these up and serve these a pork chop simple just spread them and you can kind of spin and cook them like that in Missouri there is a fantastic circling sandwich that I've had and they take the the center loin and then they cut it horizontally then pound it up then and you have this big crispy pork cutlet that they actually serve as icon to sandwich bust so this is a great way to use this so again lots of different cuts and use out of the pork loin the look slide and get started on this recipe so this recipe has we are going to use one of our pork roast right here we're going to use onions right here so I had one large white onion chopped here Musil bit of garlic right here I'm going to use that cup and a half of hard cider right here and it's going to braise in there and a half small pepper I will show you how to cook that so the first thing we're going to do for the instant pot is we're going to heat a couple tablespoons of oil in here I'm just using a just a very neutral flavored oil I can't remember if this with canola or foreign oil so we're going to let this get hot then we're police go ahead and saute our onions and our garlic together so this recipe is going to take one and a half cups of hard cider so I'm going to go ahead and measure that out and let it get flat if you don't want to use hard cider you could use apple juice if you like or apple cider it's completely your choice so oil is heated up enough so I'm going to add in my onions I'm going to add in a pinch of salt with the onions just because I want them to release some of the water you'll get a much better caramelized flavor and I'm going to add in a couple tablespoons of garlic we're just going to cook these up until they become translucent so while my onions are sauteing I want to be sure and literally season the throats with salt and pepper so I'm just going to sprinkle on lots of salt and pepper here next thing I want to do is I want to go ahead and try to sear off this roast just a little bit so I'm just going to put it on the side and let it sit in there for a couple minutes on each side and when we get done we'll add in the hard cider and we'll start the cooking so my rose has been browning I've turned it on all sides next thing in the do is simply add my hard cider we're going to put the lid on and we're going to pressure cook this for fifty-five minutes on high so we will come back after we have done a quick release on this that's where when the time's up you just push the valve over to let it vent and we'll show you what this looks like so I hope you enjoyed this recipe and be sure to subscribe here on my channel on YouTube I have a whole instant pot playlist so there's lots of great recipes for you to try so I'm going to go ahead and try just a little bit of this pork roast right here hmm very nice and flavorful it's very moist you can catch just a little bit of the flavor of the onions it looks really nice I hope you give this recipe a try soon thanks for watching", "FxumCGKRZW0": "hello everybody and welcome to a special edition of drinkable alchemy you can hear me to the side as I'm Merlin and to the next me right here on the left is Emily Gimli son of Gloin we are alchemists and we explore the annals of alcoholic alchemy to see which ones are the tastiest and which ones may be deadly we haven't died yet so it hasn't been that disastrous but anyway to commemorate the holidays you might remember last year we made a special eggnog so this year we are going to be making apple pie moonshine so what kind of inspired you to bring this to us given what um it was actually my dad okay get me senior you found it he's like hey you should try to make this and I've been putting it off I put it off it was probably good like month at least I finally just ended up saying screw it and I made it and waited and waited because you gotta let it sit for about a week but it was aware of all the flavors and stuff no no this is good alright so he was happy with it cool but now that the testing phase is done we actually get to make it for real I know and we can actually try for the channel so this should be cool we're just gonna go over the basic ingredients and then directions and then we're gonna show you step by steps so alright what ingredients that we need one modified thing that we're gonna change in this there's always something modified yeah from what I first did only because we didn't really like the flavor of it or what had turned out hmm so we're gonna do four cups of apple cider and the modification for this next one is going to be three cups of apple juice and instead of four cups one cup of packed light brown sugar mm-hmm four cinnamon sticks five cardamom pods I hope I said that I don't know what that is so good all of them to start Anna Skye one teaspoon whole cloves 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg a 1 cup of whatever the highest proof grain alcohol you can behind it 1/2 cup of vodka and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract all right so those are the basic ingredients now we're gonna break this down step by step and we're gonna show you how to make this so let's begin alright so gimmies gonna kind of guide us through this and we're gonna start off by placing I guess we decided three cups of adil sizes four cups of the apple cider apple cider Diablo juice is warm or justic so four cups of apple cider you're gonna be putting them in here right into our little pot make sure that there's enough to obviously hold everything and luckily this is the biggest pot we had so making it work it'd be four cups of apple cider and this is local apple cider - mmm-hmm support locally if possible always encourage that I was a that was three I think we are professionals people haha I swear I didn't drink yes he totally swears we never drink on drinkable alchemy definitely not before either no together before or after only sometimes sometimes and if you don't well that's just magic right okay alright so next steps next up is the one we're adjusting right so that's gonna be three cups of apple juice three cups of apple juice I've got a feeling this is gonna be very sweet at Apple tea really just just kind of running on a conjecture there but I think it might be which you know I'm kind of glad because I love Apple and I'm surprised you're daring this because maybe not the biggest Apple fan I'm not but I do look apple pie hmm okay okay third that's three yes kept count that time what is next next we are going to do our 1 cup of packed light brown sugar that's one cup light brown sugar oh I guess there's a little bit of room for flexibility but we want to try to keep it as close to the amount as possible that is recommended so that I guess we get the desired flavor that's the idea right [Applause] he's doing a good job of keeping it mostly in there looks fairly good cup size spray compact yeah I gotta put that right in there do you have a spoon I do actually I'm clean the woods got a whisk it in there this is where it could get splash you [Music] stir it up already don't you come in there so far so so far we're stirring together are the APUs lighter the apple juice and our brown sugar that way it's not all clumped together kind of a little more what is next well next we have our cinnamon sticks that'll be four over so holes are holes all services or cinnamon sticks for it it so that was four cinnamon sticks people what is next five cardamom pods whatever the heck that is Pergamon pause okay that's how you say it all right huh very small five correct five one two three four five next next we have our two star and these pods to make it to make it more of a struggle that need be yes yes really you know to test alchemists like ourselves when were embarking on new experiments for our subscribers - what an interesting thing because how do you get that out of that now - the whole wide and give I put it back on yeah so we're befuddled by their logic as well as by our own and X 1 teaspoon of whole cloves looks like teaspoon sure go for it [Applause] next would be 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger you said half correct half teaspoon yes sir all right fair enough okay alrighty next we're gonna have another 1/2 teaspoon this time of ground and nutmeg spices you love don't make know that perfect for your holiday cheer yes Oh very well distributed huh well that's actually all the ingredients so we've got them in a large pot we've got to put them over on the stove here on medium to high heat come on stir this quick so stir everything up there so I see what you like to turn the heat on a lot sure we're gonna put that on seven for what mine is so keep it at a fairly high temperature yeah make sure it's all evenly combined and stir that's what they recommend which is pretty common I think for many things that involve liquid stirring things into them it's kind of basic for any kind of potion you kind of palcohol like alchemy or any other got a stir evenly distribute [Applause] and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna bring that to a nice boil and that'll be the next phase and then we'll move on we'll pause it here catch up when it starts to boil alright you and as you can tell it has finally stopped and it's been an hour we're taking it off it should smell pretty good here I can attest oh it smells lovely I'm war burning candles tonight nope and all you can see is a empty burners so I'll switch this back over to here and what is next on our stuff sirrah well we're getting close to the end of it here so basically what we have to do now is I guess we let it sit to room temperatures what they want so look at the stuff out now after it let's see it says let's let it cool first okay and then we'll remove all the stuff well slot it out and we'll get rid of our cinnamon our card Oman our star anis and our clothes so let it cool a little and then we'll remove stuff and then we'll finish up the process okay and the magic of editing cut was gonna sit alchemy but short how come he alright and now we have let the liquid cool the room temperature so we're going to scoop out all the cinnamon the cardamom the star anis and the cloves so basically all the debris we use to add an extra flavor get as they'd be disposing that in the bowl here and there's no real easy way without another like bowl and a strainer that will actually like work well that will hold all this little I mean they do have to hide you can you I guess in the directions they see you can use a slotted spoon but I guess tried it it didn't work huh we could try it see how well it goes but there's don't just say you could scoop it with a strainer and that works even better that's what I use blast when I made it because you can cover a greater area quicker well look you've got a pretty decent amount which might require a little more searching because like I never got all the clothes out out the first time most of them seen this kind of like float to the top anyway no no like I can feel them in there they're just stubborn yeah so I imagine once we start pouring it into the jar we'll be expecting to find some no doubt but oh there's a whole bunch ah there you go but if you have a bigger bowl that you can then pour this into to strain it I would recommend that somewhat good if you feel on the bottom anything no there's at least one clove or two is still okay we'll try it all right now for the most important part of the ingredients yep and we're doing how much well first we're going to do the one cup of grain alcohol so it's really really high concentrated stuff make sure that our measuring utensils are clean are these free of the other ingredients we hold that it in this case we're using Everclear 151 because I don't want to use the other good stuff so that's gonna be one cup of that you're a little dose of pipe cleaner yeah magical magical pipe cleaner to prove that you know for this concoction we're not messing around one thing that we changed mm-hmm was the type of of the size amount that we're using for the vodka because it recommends a half cup of vodka but in order to get the correct amount mm-hmm we're up for a cup because we took a cup out of the apple cider and apple juice okay so we're kind of just exchanging our liquids and we're adding in a little more alcohols yes and we are having Tito's handmade vodka so theoretically with Tito's here it'll be a little stronger than the normal recipe calls for blood on drinkable alchemy when we're experimenting we don't want to mess around right so make sure it's a full cup for our particular brand and the recipe is called apple pie neutral so you have liveries exactly a little flexibility can go a long way that is in there and now generally we have come to the final ingredient the final one can you guess what it is could it be vanilla indeed it is okay and in this case we're using a homemade vanilla extract 1 tablespoon of that which sounds like a lot it does but also a little bit goes a long way with vanilla and in this case I'm going to do it over the pot good idea because I don't trust my nan steadicams did pretty good that time yeah I'll say so once again and I imagine this is pretty potent already probably not taste the best right now no but that's where the next part of the process comes in all right and would you like to explain that one well basically the next step here the final one really is we're going to transfer this liquid here into sterilized glass jars and seal it tightly we've got one big one here so here comes the fun part let's get it in there yes hopefully I don't mess well if I miss I'll be cleaning up a little but but try try not to loop this too much of it because do you ever fall okay this'll be fun try this hopefully I don't mess all right be very careful very slow take your time and whoa yeah I was worried about that try not to do that okay do you have a cup yeah that was after the second that's the second suggestion I was hoping for a big or bigger funnel attempt to minor difficulties so we're just gonna use this measuring cup so we can go for easier and keep most of the fruits of arlov or yeah so I'm guessing you figured we have the right glass jar for this to get everything in there oh no okay I was about to say I didn't think I was giving enough it's a beautiful sight though yes what's exciter can't imagine how you know what might be some odd you know something to do with the site or ingredients that they're actually part of it somewhat a little bit easier to maybe that's fine you nosey little miss you got most of it oh well that's most of it that's that's most of it and now we need the lid seal it nice and tight oh yeah something like that beautiful and there's your Apple pot moon shot mm-hmm now for the last step for the last step with the instructions provided by Jim Lee from you steps two steps well now that we've sealed it tightly we're going to refrigerate it for one week yeah and then we'll come back a week around enjoy it and also a side note here which was added on you can refrigerate it for up to a month but don't go beyond that yep and we'll see you back shortly yeah", "btMfrAt99Ec": "y'all ready for this down no no today we have a super easy recipe that even you've seen our grandmother could make begin by coring and slicing up some apples place apple slices into a sterilized jar shove in some cinnamon sticks I mean really shove them in there add two shots of vodka [Music]", "N0GPU8e6rWA": "[Music] everyone this is Jesse with farming Seattle comm today is going to do something a little different from gardening but kinda in the same realm if you grew apples and your house but I'm going to talk about brewing hard cider from apple juice right here is kind of the last stages of fermenting the apple juice I have a six gallon container has apple juice in there a rubber stopper on top with a airlock on there and that just prevents any air from going back down into that container and I put it in this water jug just so that it can cool down because I don't have a big or a lot amount of ice to cool the sucker down so this is cooling down the fermented apple juice so that I can bottle it or put it in a keg so to get started you can go to Costco and get a 2-pack of this apple juice basically it's all-natural it's not from concentrate and as long as there's not too many chemicals down here that'll be just perfect I think this just says apple juice obviously this is refilled with water and you need some sort of yeast I've used champagne yeast which seems to work very good this time I have 10 things of this red star Premiere Blanc yeast which is used in champagne and you can get off Amazon so basically when you start out if you're doing it the same way that I am either you have a container like this so I got six of them I dumped them all into this clean six gallon container I popped on this airlock with the rubber stopper but I put in the yeast and once you do that you put in some water to this fill line so that though the co2 can go up in here and it'll bubble and kind of bounce and it doesn't allow any air to go back in but if you notice after about a week or so this cider will get really cloudy it'll bubble a lot you can probably see a little bit of bubbles right there so this stuff is towards the end it's cleared out it kind of looks more like a beer you know it's kind of see-through once it clears out and it stops bubbling as much that's when it's done and at that point you're going to want to chill it put it in the fridge cool it down with ice or something and that'll kind of kill the yeast or slow down the yeast so that they'll stop and go to the bottom from there I need to put it into the keg there's the keg I have this big siphon you can get off Amazon I kind of just Auto siphons everything and can put it into our keg for us let's see if I can do this one-handed well let me get it set up and I'll do another video okay so I have the bottle up on higher elevation than the cake and I'm going to try and show the bottom right there that is all the yeast that we want to try and not get into this container so I'm just gonna see if I can pump this all right so it's pumping and putting cider into our cake I'm just kind of holding it a little bit above this bottle so it's nice to have an auto siphon like this that'll automatically drain into your container so once I fill this keg up it's probably about five gallons I'm going to try and fill it up to pretty much the very top and from there I'm going to have to carbonate it so if you do the cake or do the cider in a bottle you can put in sugar and then cap the glass bottle and that'll force the yeast to carbonate the drink but it kind of does a lot of a lot of yeast still in there so it probably does a off taste a little bit but this is my first try with co2 and I have a regulator to regulate the pressure of the co2 that's going to go into the keg so we'll see how that works but I'll let this drain and get this going and I'll come to show you the finished product and maybe I can figure out the co2 carbonation okay so about halfway there I thought I'd talk about why I brew cider I like cider a lot and usually from store or something you get cider that is very sugary the way that this is brewed once it stopped bubbling once it stops bubbling you know that the sugar is gone and so the leftovers is something that is very dry which is preferable to me so not allow sugar taste good and a lot cheaper I guess - you can buy those apple juice containers I think there are seven bucks apiece typically a packet of yeast to surround a dollar so if you wanted to you can brew in these gallon containers I just drilled a hole on the top of that container but a number-10 might actually fit perfectly so if you got yeast you got the juice you got a number-10 stopper plus an airlock you're probably looking at maybe $20 to start brewing your own apple juice and so a gallon takes about a week and you can actually put that in the fridge just cap it with a regular cap and start another batch and that'll kind of carbonate in that container and as long as you siphon out some it tastes actually really good and pretty inexpensive and we're getting there with the cider takes a lot longer than I thought and hopefully it's kind of windy out here so hopefully you can hear me and hopefully stuff isn't falling into the batch but I'll follow up pretty shortly with the rest of the gear okay in the last part of the video is the co2 tank is connected to a regulator regulates how much psi or how much pressure can go into the keg one of these posts is for gas and the others the liquid that comes out so there's a table online that'll show you basically at what temperature what kind of beer or cider you're making and in turn what pressure you should be using and you just want to make sure that these lines aren't leaking so you don't run out of co2 and just that it'll sit there for a week or two and carbonate and then you'll have finished product so thanks for watching I'll do another video another day you can click on here for the next video in the series or video that you can might like or you can subscribe on the other box thanks for watching", "KbyahTnzbKA": "- Hey everyone, it's Natasha\nof Natashaskitchen.com. And today I'm gonna teach you how to make what is probably the most\niconic pie of all time. It is a homemade apple pie. This one is loaded with apples. Now the process is a little\ndifferent and it'll surprise you but you're going to love the results. So let's get started. We'll start with the\nsauce for the filling. Place a medium saucepan over medium heat and melt an eight tablespoons\nof unsalted butter. Stir in three tablespoons\nof flour and let that simmer for about a minute whisking constantly. Next, whisk in 1/4 cup of\nwater and 3/4 cup of sugar. Bring that to a boil then reduce the heat and continue simmering for about three minutes stirring occasionally. This sauce is the secret ingredient. It literally takes less than five minutes but will transform your pie. When it's done, it'll have a light\ncaramel sauce consistency. Take it off the heat and let it cool while you prep your apples. You'll need six to seven\nGranny Smith apples or you can use your\nfavorite tart crisp apple. All of the apples together\nweighed two and a quarter pounds. Peel all of your apples\nthen cut them in a half and remove the course. To remove the course you can\neither use a small paring knife or an apple coring tool, or\nyou can use a melon baller like this one and I'll leave\na link to this in the notes. Once the apples are all peeled\nand cored thinly slice them. You should get about seven\ncups of thinly sliced apples. Transfer the apples to a large mixing bowl and sprinkle the top with\none and a half teaspoons of ground cinnamon. Stir to evenly coat the\napples with cinnamon. Next, add all of that\nsauce that you made earlier and make sure you get every last drop. Stir in the sauce to coat the apples and I'm telling you it's so worth it to spend the extra five\nminutes to make this sauce, for the most incredible apple pie filling. I'm using our favorite homemade\neasy all butter pie crust that I've been chilling\nin the refrigerator. This pie crust is incredible\nand I will leave a link to the video tutorial in the notes. Sprinkle your work surface\ngenerously with flour and roll out your first pie crust. Roll that first crust to about\na 12 inch diameter circle. If you find the dough is\nsticking to your rolling pin, sprinkle on just a little more flour. The easiest way to transfer\nthis into the pie pan is to wrap it around\nyour rolling pin gently and use a food scraper to loosen the dough in case it gets stuck to the surface. Now simply unwrap it\ninto a clean pie plate. Mold that gently into the plate and you should have a little bit of dough hanging over the edges. Add all of the apple mixture mounting it slightly in the center. And be careful not to get the feeling on the edges of the dough which will make it difficult to seal. Set that aside, then roll the second crust on a floured surface, but this time just to about\nan 11 inch round circle. I found that if you push\nthe edges in like this, it'll roll into a much more even circle, which is important because\nwe're going to be making strips out of this for\nthe lattice topping. Also, if you're curious, this is called a French rolling\npin, and it is my favorite. I will leave a link to this in the notes. Using your favorite pizza cutter, cut 10 even thickness strips. Making a lattice topping\nis easier than you think. Take one of the long\nstrips from the center and place it across\nthe middle of your pie. The first five strips\nshould be in one direction across your pie with the\nlonger strips in the center and the shorter ones towards the edges. Peel back the second and fourth strips and place one large strip down the center. Now peel back the alternating strips and add another strip of dough. Continue doing this on the\nright and then the left until all of your lattice is complete. Place any remaining scraps of dough around the edges of the pan where needed. Tuck the excess pie dough\ninto the pan around the edges. Once all of the edges are tucked in, you can crimp or flute the\nedges of the pie dough. And this process is so easy but will make your pie look super fancy. Push the dough in with\none finger on one hand and pinch around it with two\nfingers on the other hand. Pat the edges down slightly so that they don't brown\ntoo much in the oven. Next beat together one egg\nand a tablespoon of sugar and brush that egg wash generously over all of the surface of the dough. This will add a beautiful color to your pie while it's baking. Transfer that to the\ncenter of a preheated oven and bake at 425 degrees\nFahrenheit for 15 minutes. Without opening the door, reduce the heat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and continue baking another 45 minutes or until the apples are\nsoft and the filling is bubbling through the vents at the top. Oh, pie. Sweet apple pie. You will not believe how good\nmy kitchen smells right now. And once this comes out of the oven, you want to give it at\nleast an hour to rest, you want those apple juices to thicken up. So that way when you cut into it, it doesn't slide all over the place and you won't burn your mouth. That's important. Been there, done that. Okay, so we're gonna let this rest. (upbeat music) All right, our pie has been\nresting, it's just barely warm. And honestly that's the\nhardest part is the waiting because you just want to jump right in and do the taste test. But that's exactly what\nwe're going to do right now because we have been\npatient for long enough. Okay, so big slice for me, here we go. Okay, that is a big piece. But that doesn't surprise you, right? You've watched enough of our videos. Okay, here we go. Yum! And you can see the slice holds together. It's not sliding apart,\nthis filling is amazing. Okay, lets get that on to our plate. I'm really excited. This is the pie that everyone\nneeds to make this autumn. It looks fantastic. Okay, cool. Let me taste it first. That is worth every second. Fantastic. Just that little bit of cinnamon really amps up the apple flavor. And I love this sweet tart apples, they're perfectly sweetened. This is wonderful. And to be very honest, I love the crust just as\nmuch as I love the filling. I mean it's flaky, buttery,\nreally easy to make. And make sure that you watch our video on how to make this crust. Super simple, just a few\ningredients, but wow. It is just like pastry perfection. Alright, we have some very\nimportant taste testers and these guys are the real deal. They know a good apple\npie when they eat one. Come on, guys. Come on, come on, come on. And they're cute too. Okay, here, dig into the pie, babies. You need some help? Oh, you got this. You should give yourself enough\ntime to breathe there, pal. What do you think? Is that a thumbs up? You Love it?

really excited to make some it's been a little while maybe to two or three years since I've made a batch so here we go alright I feel much better had to put some lotion on my face said the consistency of a desert lizard so that was kind of uncomfortable anyways back what we were doing so for this recipe you know I not 20 ingredients it's really simple to keep it easy and quick but I'll basically just take you through what I'm putting in it so you guys home I have absolutely no idea where I was going with that let's get the ingredients all right starting with apple juice apple cider Everclear some grain alcohol 190 proof you could use vodka ground cinnamon ground nutmeg cinnamon sticks and my secret recipe Sailor Jerry's this is an extremely simple recipe but Sailor Jerry's is like my little specialty I kind of add that in there for Worcester liquor so you can catch that buzz and the flights got a little bit quicker but also you know it tastes pretty pretty friggin good right first things first the apple sauce apple cider is next I did forget one thing that was sugar you need 3 cups of sugar as well move that basically 1 on the dot you and 2 next cinnamon sticks cinnamon sticks what we're gonna do with these babies is cut them in half and then just throw them in they're gonna kind of let them soak and they just soak into the water or get that good cinnamon flavor Roger half a teaspoon of ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon all right now all we got to do is just stir this around basically bring it to a boil let it simmer for about an hour then from there I got to let it cool the room temp and then when we're done with that I'm gonna add the alcohol it's beautiful stuff don't worry Flatlanders we recycle here [Music] well I thought I heard it burn it so came in here check it I think it's hot as [ __ ] I burnt piss out of my hand I was putting the other moms chair oh you know what that means [Music] we don't waste liquor around here and you guys know that all right now that it's kind of boiled cooled down now we can add the alcohol so you know never clear goes in first sailor J's the muscle throw a little bit of this vodka in there just to kind of finish the - the deal off but let's say for about an hour then we're gonna Canada enjoy all right so after you strain everything take the cinnamon sticks out you don't want those anyways then start keying them and that's all you got to do I should send them in a couple cinnamon sticks can it and let's it [Music] I make my homemade apple pie moonshine and it is perfect [Music] [Music]", "ItZGTTSaxmg": "all right today I decided to make the apple pie moonshine the only problem is as I ran out of moonshine when I made the peppermint cheer so I'll be substituting with PGA today first I just added the apple cider to the pot next I'll add the apple juice to the pot and then I will bring that to a boil all right so the part that you didn't see I added brown sugar white sugar nutmeg apple pie spice cinnamon sticks and a few cloves once this gets to a boil I'll reduce the heat and I'll let it simmer for 30 minutes okay it's done simmering now I took out a second pot and I divided it completely in half so that I would have room to add the liquor in I'm using my measuring cup to make sure that I'm getting equal amount of liquor in each pot right now I'm adding the pga about two cups per half gallon next i will be adding the vanilla bean vodka which gives it a real nice flavor i use one cup per half gallon of this since i had to divide this in half i decided to make two different flavors and the blue pot i had a caramel to it to make a caramel apple pie moonshine the other pot i just left it as an apple pie moonshine both will get cinnamon sticks and clove when I get ready to bottle them up okay everything's jarred up now the caramel came out a little cloudy where the original is nice and clear I will leave this in the frigerator for three days before drinking", "yz4b4LEjxtc": "hey everyone how you today so I bet a special treat we're making today I'm gonna try make some hard cider from the juice that I just pressed from apples today my friend torture and I did small video or not so hopefully I had that pose to be proud but this one up because this one should take me long say Anna prevent so it's like first time ever making the hard apple cider so I'm a little nervous about it but I hope that was well I tried searching other YouTube videos and other things online and there's nothing only specific saying how to do it from fresh pressed cider most of it's done from juicy buy from the grocery store and then you just make it them not so I'm gonna try to the process from start from pressing apples to finished so I've got a whole bunch of juice yeah I got some in the fridge so people in out in a minute so everything is to be sterilized I'm sterile eyes my jars of the day sterilized Mara locks and I've sterilized my funnel so we should be good to go you wanna make everything sterilized so all the bad bacteria dies off you know contaminating your your juice and your cider though apples that you get from an orchard you want to make sure you wash them really well before you press them and I'm actually going to filter them as well because there's a little bit of things in that like grass when we were picking them up and we get it all up salmon's off but what you need to do but what I understand is Kevin camping tablets now what that does that killed all the natural yeast in your juice from what I gather if you don't kill the not to least your sign up you turn into vinegar and you won't get a product that's going to be cider it could be doing either way could you to get the cider or you can get the vinegar or something in between so it's supposed to be one table per gallon so I think this has been a whole boat six gallons so I'm going to do 60s right now quickly and get those crushed up and I'm pulling out up it juice to this as well this do off get them dissolves well it's a one two three four five two two four five one one six I don't want to eat too many either since my first time I don't want to over kill all the east but we'll see how it goes so it press pretty easily they're fairly soft and don't forget guys I've got everything here sanitized as well thanks pressure fairly easily nice thought that we've been a bit harder I'm just pressing down until a powder okay so I'm gonna do I look at my juice bag and strain all up juice quickly and then I will go over there okay so I've got a little bit too strained here so I'm gonna take some of the juice and probably the Camden tablets here it's gonna get quick go through up here to get dissolve the bit I'm not even sure if they dissolve or not with the Delos I'm sure they'll break down more to over the 24-48 hours that you have to let it sit so there we go so I'll get this into my car boy here slowly fill up my car boy here might take a while do it this way but so might even give it a go swish here just up get these guys a little bit more salt in here sure that should do it so for you guys will be filling this up cuz this may take me a while I got a few jokes to go so I'll be back in a bit [Music] [Music] so we're at 16 meters now so I'm gonna do another for the years and that should take me up almost to the top there and then we'll be ready to seal it up and I think Camden tablets do their work for the next 24-48 hours okay there we go so that's roughly 20 litres of juice in there and I was gonna give it Cooper the wake down on the outside here so now that I've got the Camden tablets in there and all the juice I'm just going to cover quickly with a little bit of paper towel so there were no fruit flies get in the elastic band here and we let the Camden tablets go to work with 24 to 48 hours and I didn't fill it all the way to the top because once I pitched my yeast in there it's gonna start to ferment and bubble so you want a little bit of room for it to activate and move around otherwise you can overflow we don't want to waste any that goodness so every go guys I will even like that and I will come back in a few days and show you the next step one hut up make your part apple cider so excited okay so it's been what 48 hours since I put the cans and tablets in to kill the wild Lee's so now what I've done is I've got some sanitizer in this bowl here or I need to put a little bit in here to make sure that it activates when's the doc paid so we'll drop her into here I've got my air locks in here on sanitizer as well sanitizing it up and I've got a funnel here sanitizing as well so when I put the east tip pop it on top so there's no bacteria kicking around anywhere so I'm going to go over this princess up quickly bridge really well till you made it all the can't hide your hope so just want a little bit of warm water just to make sure nothing's gonna activate so I'm gonna take the East Terrace in Laughlin EC 118 it's champagne yeast from all the research I've done champagne yeast gives a different flavor a little nicer flavor to it so here we go right now just sprinkle it over top here and then that dudes thing it's supposed to sit for about 20 minutes it says but if it starts bubbling before then then we know that it's you can just drop it in right wait so once wall that's activated I'm going to rinse off all my airlocks here so they're ready to go and then we'll be back in 20 minutes when this is ready to go okay so the easiest activate is jared popping it's only been about five minutes so we let it sit for a few more minutes just to let it do its thing a bit more and then we'll be tossing her and we're I guess they say pitching it into your must I'm not sure why they call it pitching it but that's what we'll be doing okay so the yeast is activated so what I've done as well as brought down the date that I am putting the yeast in September 25th I got my Karen lock ready so every lock Polly consists is this this little tube up the center so it releases all covering oxide or whatever it releases and you put a little bit of water to the water line here but this little cap on top so bubbles out with a little a little bit on top and there's two holes in the top to release all the air over there and I've got my rubber stopper here as well I'll plug it into the carboy there so I'm going to do take this off here we've got my sanitized funnel we'll take the yeast here gonna get a little bit of swish here just to get all mixed up I'm gonna dump it in here and there we go I'm gonna give it a little bit of a swish here well actually stop him down I'm going to put there the stop run first actually I think put on nice and tight there and I'm trying to give it over just we're just together you stop mix into there it's probably better if you have a long spoke I have to buy cycles of Huggies better pants I'm just to give it a stir and slide but we just wanna make sure that the yeast is all mixed in there you go that looks pretty good so I'm going to take my airlock here I'm gonna stick it on top here here we go so this is my first home brew besides kombucha however so I'm getting excited so I'm gonna put this into my office with the cloth over it so it's dark and then we'll check back tomorrow it's even started to ferment and bubble so once that happens we'll show you that okay guys so here we are I've got my cider going away so I'll this has been a quick learning process for me so I've done for the Camden tablets in I let sit for 24 hours and now that the yeast as you've seen previously another video and after two or three days the yeast wasn't doing anything I wasn't eating any of the sugars and it wasn't starting to ferment so I was not worried that they came to tile tapas actually killed most the east plus the East I put in so what I did is I got to put a cup and a half two cups of cider some more juice and then I put in a cup of sugar and smaller the champagne yeast and let that get activated and I put it in and about a day and a half later we started getting some activation in here and you can see the bubbles are rising up now I just changed the airlock here because some of the cider residue have to come up into it and I contaminated so you don't really want that so I switched it out with a fresh fresh water fresh air lock so I'll show you a quick close-up of it the airlock your bubbling away all day it's getting a bit more active than it was yesterday it was kind of bubbling once every 15 minutes now it's one like every second or so okay every five seconds which is cool and then you can actually see it fermenting here and bubbles coming up so I think it's gonna work and the airlock that I just changed out I took a quick snip of it and it does smell like alcohol so we're gonna have some hurt cider here guys so I don't quit close up here and then it's supposed to sit I think between five and seven days before you rack it off to another carboy just try to get some clear just try to get the residue some more of the sediment down so you get a clear cider so here we go a nice close up for you okay I'm not sure I'll be able to get this and focus the bubbles coming up it's really hard to see what that's the top of it there and there slowly the bubbles you'd see them rising up hard to see on the camera here but here's the airlock here and if I just set it here for a second here see you kind of pop up there you go so that's some of the air and gas releasing which is what you want it to do and I just wanna get and just another side note I've got a towel here I wrap it up so it stays dark so it doesn't have any light getting to it oxidizing it um so there we go looks great so guys this is a learning process for me so whatever I'm doing wrong I hope to pass it on to you guys so you don't make the mistakes yourselves and then there we go so I'll come back here in a few days and we'll see the next process okay so it's been going for about three and a half weeks now this hard cider still fermenting so a lot of things I've seen online on YouTube they say to ferment for five to seven days I rock it off to your next fermenting mess although most people are just in one gallon jars I'm doing like 23 litres which is almost like four and a half gallons I guess so I've checked the readings a few times here are the specific gravity is supposed to be close to one so I'm gonna check it again here so this is your hydrometer and I'm gonna be using just drop it in here so it's still it's reading 1.2 so I'll show you guys quickly here so you can see it so there we go sorry it's hard to get focus this close-up went out on a tripod so 1.2 so it was at 1.5 reading Piper's alcohol let's play down to about 3% of all now it's hard to tell so I might actually rock it off now cuz it looks like it's in the finish line there and then sorry is this or to just write like this so I might try to rock it off now to the other car boy and then give it a go and that's it for another one so I would try a little bit right now just because why not so to see how it tastes it smells really nice it tastes really good so I'm gonna rock it off and let's sit in the other vessel for about a week or two and rock off with the bottles here we go so I'll take the camera to down the room where my car boy is and rock off in there because I don't want to move I like the sentiments all chuckle around and get into that into that hard cider okay so I'm gonna take the stop air stopper out I'm gonna rock this into this one actually and then after that I'm going to rear a kit back into this one up acting this out because you want as little air as possible in Atwater racking I got this pretty cool auto siphon off eBay so I'll leave the link underneath in the description as well so I'm gonna make sure I don't get set me on the bottom I'm just gonna get in here here we go so this should take a few minutes [Music] yeah I won't bore you guys with this Allah when I get to the bottom I'll show you guys what it looks like so I'm just trying to make sure that I don't get the set image in the bottom here I should be in seed hair there's about a half inch of sediment on the bottom there you want to make sure we don't get that into the next stage as we're wanna tiny here so I guess idea is this next stage is going to set a lot more of the sediment how much we'll put in okay I think that's good I'll take it to the kitchen and then we'll show you the next what I'm gonna do next okay so I moved over to the kitchen now so this bit left I'm just gonna toss it up cuz it's all the East sentiments and where girls in the bottom we don't want that and then I'll rinse this out that I'm gonna write this back into this one so we have less air space as you can tell this this term was a lot bigger and there's no an air space sir so I've got the small carboy cleaned sanitized and rot the rest of what I had in the big one back in here so I'm gonna the set I think my poor five to seven more days and then we'll put in the bottle see what happens uh I'm probably even on the kitchen table and said back in the office you might have just because when it comes to balling I don't want to disturb his that sediment that settles down from it so I was probably easier to sleep in kitchen here wrapped up with a blanket again so that it's dark and all that gets to it so as I just want to say to that I'm not always right on what I do I'm learning and I want you guys to learn from my mistakes so if I'm doing things wrong if you guys know a better way to do please let me know and I want you guys to learn from our mistakes as part of the reason I do my channel so you guys can learn from doing I'm doing it wrong we can improve on that and go from there so I'll see you guys in a few days once this settles out and we'll go from there okay guys well I'm finally at the point where I can get my cider rock dumped into bottles but first thing we need to do is get some primer Eddie's of 80 primers just some sugar corns deck drums just to give it it's more sugar to the cider so that the last nobody's can eat it and terminate your beverage so I'm going to sort of do a pint of water and half a cup of organic cane sugar that I have there's gonna boil that for five minutes and then we'll let it cool water here so I'll let this boil away do its thing and meantime I'm gonna fight I'm going to sanitize my other carboy because I'm going to type in my cider into the other carboy with the priming sugar in there so it mixes up mixing well okay I've got my primer here the sugar in the water and send-up it in to my other carboy here there we go now I'm gonna grab my other cider here I hope you guys can see that in the yeah there we go so I'm going to pull this up here so just so you know in my last segment where I was using the auto siphon pumping the whole time it's because I didn't have the jar down low enough to actually have a second working so this time it's gonna work well I'm gonna pull off my airlock I'm going to get my tube until my other carboy here and this is just so I can get the sediments out of here cuz you still put a bit in the bottom and then it's gonna go in here and I left this into this carboy Pollock for another month and a half because there's still a lot of sugar in there that was percolating out and eating away the sugars so hopefully we get this to work here and one more sheet going there we go so it's cycling in here now so once it's filled we want to continue the next process I'm gonna keep watching sanitizing my bottles quickly so everything's ready to go the other quick thing I'm gonna do too as well I am going to do reading with the hydrometer to see where the alcohol content sent and a punch into alcohol can calculator to see what my final alcohol content is I can smell it so pretty smells pretty good it smells pretty boozy so we'll see how it goes so this is going along well that's what halfway done I've got two different bottles here I've got up your garage style model that I saved my buddy just told me some of his beer bottles that he's not using anywhere for his homemade beer I'm use computer models as well and I've got some other bigger style models like this now the sanitizing now so it's probably good for the first time that I'm doing this to try the bottle to see what's gonna work best for probably keeping the carbonation in and doing the best fermentation second fermentation with it so I'm gonna go finish the bottles now be back in a few minutes okay so I'll just stop the hydrometer in we're sitting at one point zero zero exactly well check yeah at one point there is oh cool exactly so I will do a quick reading a quick calculation with the alcohol content reader and see what we're sitting at so according to my calculator it's like six point five percent alcohol from my first reading to this reading now I started off with one point zero five and I'm down to one point zero zero so that should be a good amount okay so we're almost to the bottom here I just tried it wow it's really good it's been on the drier side which I like which I prefer but definitely tastes a bit boozy so can't wait to get this all done up putting bottles and H for a few weeks so there's auto siphon - it doesn't suck any sediment up so it's okay a separator on the bottom I may have to tip some of it up to finish off the last bits but it's all nicely okay so if I'm Elizabeth second dog there's a whole bit left here that I try to get from the other carboy and the zoomit sediment so I kind of strain it through a juice bag but it didn't really strain off the sediments so we'll let this set and see the tunnels down and see what happens but right now what we're going to do and I start to siphon this into my bottles here so I'm gonna start with this one here now Paul just gonna add pump it just so I can make sure I get the correct amount in [Music] [Music] now if I just gonna take it up to about their side a little bit of an air and room for the carbonation to occur right just a little bit more hair there we go so I'm just gonna pinch it off here get the next part of mr. Maddock glass bottle to the clear ones that's a one-time dose gonna take it air cap it off it's gonna be pretty nice it's clear nice and clear well 100 mi hopefully it'll get a bit more clarity through the aging process so one down everyone's the next one you know and I'm gonna take a boot to bottle necks as well so I have a few different ones on the go so I can see which one will do the best Hey that's not gonna work so well there's another one for the blooper reel but I probably sleep it in so you can see my mistakes now I got em up this mess up before I continue I resent Titan excitement as well because it fell on the floor so now I make sure everything's clean sanitized at all times here we go round two so hope you guys aren't for my mistakes one of the reasons I do some of these videos is so you guys can learn from some of things that I do that don't work I go a little bit slower with this one here pinch it off here quickly to the next one here a lid on this time here so what I'll do guys I'll finish balling this all up and show you guys the final step when I'm done here okay we'll try this skin up to get the center up here and that looks pretty good right there push down hello there we go seal bottle so I'm gonna do a few more of these here sup tricky first I'm using it so it's a little finicky but we'll get a hang of it okay there you go guys we finally made it come on all of it bottle up I think it's Paul they get 10 to 15 liters here so it's pretty good for my first time ever making homemade hard cider so if you guys have any ideas on how I could do this better next time please let me know because as I said this was a learning experience for me first time doing this so pretty stoked yeah leave the comm leave in the comments below what you guys think I could do better next time to make it easier flow or make it better cider for myself I'll be tasting this probably in three to four weeks I'm going to put it somewhere to store sword ages the bed to gets the carbonation with sugar I just put into it and hopefully gonna be amazing so thanks for watching guys don't forget if there's a swipe I can share my videos around and have a good day out there see y'all soon bye", "I8LvVKdLvyM": "i don't even know if you can hear my video before somebody said they couldn't so here we go again apple pie wine making that right filtering right through getting that good what did", "Dfs7egLEhmE": "Heather youtubers time here from time to test kitchen and today I'm gonna make something I'm surprised I haven't made this before but it's a holiday apple cider that's got a little bit of a kick to it so what you want is when we want to start out with is some apple cider and this is fresh apple cider I didn't get it in a apple farm or anything but it's it's not from concentrate its one hundred percent apple cider so that's what you want you don't want something from concentrate you want some really good apple cider if you can get some fresh from an apple farm like we used to do up in New York that is definitely the best but in my apple cider you got three small apples I think these are called pink lady yeah pink lady and some cinnamon sticks and some whole cloves i'm going to show you what i'm going to do with this in just a moment okay start off with our apple cider let's shake this up really good because it's sitting for a while go sediment and the water so I'm only going to make a half a batch so I'm only going to use about half of this cider so that's about a half a gallon of cider you could easily double this that's about half now the apples you take your cinnamon cloves and you just press them in to the apple I usually go around like this on all four sides and then I get on the top and bottom don't need a lot because little clove goes a long way let's put a couple more them down here so then we have it and then just place that right in so I'm gonna go ahead and finish this apples up later but you want to add three sticks of cinnamon insider so just kind of go finish these up and then we'll get back to this I'm going to turn the heat on too so we just want to bring this up to a nice simmer and let it simmer okay I'll be back when I got this already okay let's come up to a simmer so I'm just going to kind of turn this down a little bit and let it simmer for about 20 minutes and be ready the longer it simmers the more the flavors are going to mingle boi yeah it smells so good it smells like apple pie oh so good okay I'll be back in about 20 minutes Miller's been 20 minutes and the apples are nice and soft they're cooked and you definitely don't want to throw those apples out because you can cut them up and eat them they're so good so let's just ladle out some of this cider into a nice festive mug I've been making this for a long time I don't even remember where I got this idea that's not really that popular here in Texas because it rarely gets cold I mean today it's like 80 yes I need one degrees we have our cider and then a shot of bourbon just give that a stir let's see what it tastes like hmm it's nice and hot very sinha me very happily and that bourbon the flavor of the bourbon with the the apple cider is just just awesome ah man living in New York in the winter it is brutally cold this definitely will warm you up but it's nice here in Texas kind of reminds us of back in the old days there you have it bourbon spiked hot apple cider great for the holidays", "GK7F4ny7fcw": "hey guys it's Daniela I'm really pumped to show you a fast and easy drink recipe today it is a drink that you can make for yourself at home any time I'm actually sitting in my little home office space right now because I was doing some work have been having some more cravings lately and figured okay I'm gonna make my apple pie drink and I'll just throw it on video right now to show all of you okay so first ingredient is raw moon that just flashed it's raw apple cider vinegar and it's important to get the raw one because it hasn't been pasteurized which means it still has the important enzymes and beneficial bacteria in it which is great for your digestion next we are using cinnamon cinnamon I get an organic one very easy to find cinnamon is very anti-inflammatory if you didn't know that and finally is pure CBO drops by the way is it Stevie Irish double yeah I don't know I somebody just told me recently that it's stevia but I've been say it's stevia for years okay back to our drink so we're going to combine these ingredients with my own sherry vinegar um I thought was and swirl this around and get all those good sentiments in there okay a tablespoon okay oh boy so I spilled a little I'm gonna just top this off a little okay then you can just sprinkle this in if you're using a bigger mouth you know top but since I have a small jar alright I'm gonna use a spoon and I did about a eighth of a teaspoon finally we are gonna do some ice cubes Oh stevia okay clearly I need this to help me focus and get more energy right now because I'm all over the place so I go just four drops this ratio of vinegar to studio to cinnamon is good for about a 16 ounce drink I usually double this and do fill it all the way up so you can have this cold or hot I've just been really digging it cold I find it more refreshing that way all right got my ice cube and my filtered water all right we'll stop there for now and you just cover this up and you can see it kind of starts to look like apple cider and it really tastes like that something about combining the cinnamon with the vinegar is amazing and the stevia to take the edge off it really tastes like you're drinking an apple pie so yeah you probably don't believe me so you'll have to try it yourself but give it a try it's really helpful I find you know to drink a big jug of this it takes away that craving and apple cider vinegar has been shown to help with weight loss it has been shown to help curb cravings increase energy so there are a lot of great benefits associated with drinking this and you don't have any of the you know high caloric and sugar and downsides you know why so let's see how this turned out that's really good and you can adjust the amount of stevia as you like it you know I feel like it more sweet go with a few more drops just be careful not to overdo it because it can get bitter all right I hope this is helpful and hope you guys have a great afternoon and I will see you soon bye", "tEkA82bKjxY": "hey y'all it's farmer meatball into day y'all I'm bringing back Mason German they do

outside and I've got to have a keto friendly drink that is not doc coke trying to keep the habit again y'all so here's here's what I'm doing I'm making good girl moonshine have y'all heard of that from trim healthy mama and they usually only use an apple cider vinegar and a ginger that I've seen and then sweetener but I had y'all I've seen a minute and let me tell you this heights like you're drinking apple pie feeling I mean seriously apple cider vinegar when you dilute it it tastes like apple juice with sweetener you gotta had sweetener and and then the cinnamon just picked it over the top y'all son here is all you have to do this has to be the easiest ever you eat your mason jar and you're going to sit on this all day long okay you're going to get a mixing jar and you need all right won't fit in there you need one teaspoon of ginger ground ginger all right come on ginger come out I'm trying to get it out without like dumping the whole thing all right that looks good see a teaspoon of ginger and I just you know I just put a few shakes of seeing him in it I got whoa that was a big hole and I want the big hole I want to sprinkle a home all right sign it sprinkle Semyon and you know ginger and cinnamon and apple cider vinegar all have their own therapeutic medicinal type qualities in some weight loss qualities as well and we couldn't think of it I was dropping weight when I was drinking this but I was also at the very beginning of my Kido journey and and so being apple cider vinegar with the mother and anywhere from 1 to 4 tablespoons really just depending on how strong you want it and how about you can handle and to me y'all it almost tastes a little bit like to meet you because you know kombucha tastes like vinegar there's one and I'm dripping it yo my whole house is going to smell like this apple cider vinegar I'm just going to eat too cuz it's been a while since I beat you or I was already done so alright and so you know I'm just gonna swish it around a little bit it ain't no big deal you gonna try getting a little bit and then the next thing no okay what do you say whenever I usually drink this y'all and truth be told I'm gonna show y'all people talk about like 5 drops is supposed to be a serving huh huh nope for this southern gal it's used to sweet tea I'm Frank on pit I'll put four in here to start I might get more I'm just saying y'all I'm being honest keeping it real I need I need some sweetness in my coffee and then my drinks okay so there's the base and then you just have water utility jar is what nut water ice you need eyes don't let you jar without no I got I thought that'd be no it's not technically you won't do it all the way up with us but my ice maker has decided not to make me more ice and then you go the rest of the way I'm gonna leave a little spice bag more ice okay because you're gonna drink on it all day so you want it strong and again not prepared in the good world I should've brought a straw over here y'all oh

I promise bye y'all", "HlxpbUOvsQ0": "oh hey everybody how you doing welcome to my kitchen nothing like a lot of other shows on YouTube we're not sitting over here cooking stuff I don't cook okay I do but I ain't cooking on this show ain't blending anything trying to see if stuff will fry in this cooking show well we're gonna do is we're gonna mix drinks yes we're going to mix the fanciest [ __ ] drinks in the world you know why because you're mixing with Mitchell today today's drink we're gonna go ahead and make something that's near and dear to my heart we're gonna make apple pie moonshine now you know everybody knows somebody who knows somebody if someone has a friend of a friend that knows somebody who makes apple pie moonshine and I've always said hey can I get some bad apple pie moonshine I got $20 on it man you know you just let me know and I'll go ahead and buy something from it and you know next time I come around they're like yeah man you don't you don't make it the poor man he's dead I know I'm sorry he just dropped off the face of the [ __ ] earth so I finally said look I'll make the [ __ ] apple pie moonshine and I'm gonna show you how to make the apple pie moonshine and since we're both friends you can now say that you know a friend that knows a friend that makes the apple pie moonshine and then once you tell them about it and they say hey can you hook me up with that then I'll probably here's the ingredients here's everything that you need to make this apple pie moonshine right here and now follow me over to the stove and we'll get this stuff done all right so the first thing you need is you need your apple cider we got who gives a [ __ ] with the name of the side of yours we got apple cider that's all you need to know all right so with this we need 8 cups of apple cider in a fairly large saucepan okay here we go Thanks hey just a little bit for the home 20 years that was a way more than a little wasn't it yeah yeah all right okay we need the apple juice makes it just apple juice whichever one's your favorite we're gonna do four cups of that one that was also more than I thought it was gonna be [ __ ] so now that we have the apple juice and apple cider in there now what we need to do is we need to add the sugar you know it's got to taste like apple pie can't have that pop without a little bit of the sugar so so the next thing we need to do is we need to add the brown sugar first all right so there we go so once you got about 1/4 in there dump that in there next thing you need is your sugar sugar you need you need 1 cup of white sugar 1 cup there we go do three for one for scholars is one cup that's mad alright so now the next thing you need is you need your spices so what I like to use is I like use some allspice and I like to use some nutmeg but I have a real simple way of doing this we got your 1/2 teaspoon so what we're gonna do we're gonna pull out we're gonna scoop out what 1/2 teaspoon you don't have to be exact with it then you take your allspice you just top it off a little bit thank you that's shouldn't say it BAM that's trademark I'm sorry let's try that again well and slang oh let the boys be boys alright so now the next thing we need to do is we need to add the cinnamon sticks I like to add three cinnamon sticks to the mix why three because anything more and whenever when you're cooking it it might taste just like cinnamon and spice so one two and three and there you go now we put the concoction on now you always want to taste your concoction just to make sure that anything you know it tastes correct because you might want to make a couple of adjustments here so you scoop that up no no you do not drink out of the [ __ ] things that you mix with your dirty mother okay we just put it in this cup right here now once you've got your concoction all mixed up what you want to do is you want to go ahead and bring it to a boil all right you just want to stir for a little bit while it's sitting there simmering by the heat on up and set it to hop now when I say it needs to come to a boil you don't want to actually let it boy you don't want to keep your eye off of this you know a container because what happens here is all of the mixture that you we don't put up here it's gonna start bubbling up and it'll do it real quick look at that look at that look at that so now you gotta take it off the heat otherwise it's just gonna ball all over look at that that is nice looking beautiful beautiful so what I like to do is I'd like just let it sit just on top of the heat for about a minute let it cook and simmer on in there now when it's about to fall over I'm gonna head and just lift it up just lift it up best exercise in the world right here oh that's so beautiful after that ball is about a rub for about a minute I like to gone ahead and put it down put it on it's own low so we're just gonna stir it for just a little bit one last little stir one last little stir put the lid on it and call it night-night for about one hour now after 45 minutes to an hour depending on how cooked you want your apple pie to taste you're gonna head and take it off the heat and let it sit by itself until it gets to room temperature you want it to be at room temperature so that once you actually use your grain alcohol you know it's not the liquid isn't so hot that it makes that alcohol some of it evaporate I know what you're saying you probably say it Mitchell you said apple pie moonshine where's the moonshine part of it well look I ain't got that type of time to make moonshine you know how long it's taken but just make the apple pie part come on get out of my face but you know also it can be illegal in some states even try to make it it can be dangerous as hell so I'd rather just go ahead and pick up some grain alcohol what I like to do is I like to add 4 cups of that so here we go so once you have to make sure I recommend having move mason jars here I got paint one for me one for all my friends or just all of them for me you know Pinzon how generous of them and so you just scoop them in use a strainer so that you can get all the little pieces of spice and nutmeg because you don't really want all of that floating around in your drink normally a pot this size will make about say about six pints maybe a little bit more now you have to do is put the caps on right here now like I said this is the messiest process part of the whole process here but what you normally do is with all the stickiness from spillage just watch that off and that will do one of two that it will do two things to keep your bottles from sticking and depending on how warm the water is and will help cause a you actually just have that nice little mason jar and there you go that is the way that you make out the pot moonshine well that's the way I make apple pie moonshine you can make it however the [ __ ] you want to but if you follow these instructions you will have a very fine sitting so if you like this just gonna head and leave a comment below like share subscribe if you want to see me do more drinks like this or crazier drinks just let me know leave a comment and let me know what drink you want me to to do and I will put this up I'll make it I'll drink it I'll get drunk off of it and then I'll thank you for letting me get drunk off of concoctions that you wanted me to make so there you go take these", "ChaV-f0dOeM": "all right so this is drink number two and we are doing hard apple pie to make the drink you'll need two akka apple cider mulling spices nutmeg cinnamon sticks and whipped cream for garnish for tools you'll need mugs something to measure in a zester and a bar spoon all right so the way that we start this drink is by taking some apple cider and heating it up in the stove using the mulling spices you know point some in and really let them in letting it simmer for about ten to fifteen minutes so they'll really get the apple cider these like amazing flavors spice it up etc after that the method we used today was to use a coffee roaster we use the coffee filter easy Chemex yeah it is kind of like yeah easiest way because I can grab onto it without burning my hand and it has a spout which is really nice yeah so what we do first is pour some twocking' in to our months and some would be one and a half ounces why not have found this stuff's pretty strong actually so it's 70 proof which means 35% so it's pretty dang close to being like a common spirit like a whiskey or something like that and yeah it's an Italian liqueur that has a heavy orange and vanilla notes and you know there's kind of just a family in Italy imports it and honestly I've figured out what else to use it in it really only is used for this cocktail as far as I know non-it to be the hot apple pie liqueur yeah it's pretty much a nice sweet and has that like orange eNOS - yeah so the next thing you're gonna do after that is just top it off with some apple cider all right here I got you a little more this mugs are small so you know you just kind of always okay want to like gauge what real-estate you're working with [Music] alright let's get it fun you do it first I'm so bad at doing this oh yeah okay so nothing came out though which is weird I feel like now you have to do it whoa Oh boom really it's good it's good is the Target brand market pantry baby sometimes they surprise you dude woo all right Oh yours is prettier you got a whipped whipped cream part going hey you know so there's some things I know I do you're gonna take a cinnamon stick pop it in there one or two take one the nice thing about the whipped cream is that kind of holds it in place yep and then the final part is gonna be taken that little zester and shaving some nutmeg along the top let's give that wrong and watch your fingers the last thing you want is to accidentally zest your fingers what is not the garnish of this cocktail no it smells so good the Nutmeg once it gets kind of that once it starts to be grated like that and just the scent is like I'm control alright that's it really really easy to make so easy and yeah let's Cheers and try it see what that's all about mmm I think I have a little mustache oh my gosh hmm I feel like I love I love the hot toddy but then this is even getting better to me yeah I absolutely not this one more than 30 wowie I think it's more because it's like a dessert drink mm-hmm it's so sweet and warm yeah the apple just it's like a glow inside of you cool well that's it for the hot apple pie it's a real easy one at the end of the day all you need to do is put some - walka and some hot apple cider together put some whipped cream and some fun wintery zests on top and you've got it it's very easy let's move on the next one the proof original the red", "Gt-auBSkGL0": "okay I got really drunk on the pub crawl yesterday and I kind of decided it I'm going to make a pie I'm going to make a pie and i'm going to use coca-cola's the base the reason for this is food balls there's going to be an entire episode I do later which like  covers why I thought this was a good idea but I stuck with it I made this recipe I made a coca-cola apple pie and vanilla coke custard to go with it and it was great it was by far the best experiment I've ever come up with so enjoy the rest of the video this is how to make a coca-cola apple pie with vanilla coke custom ok for the ingredients you're going to need 100 grams of raw sugar 2 tablespoons of flour aight granny smith apples the cup of margarine or butter the reasoning behind choosing butter and margarine at the same time is I'm not a fan of the hard or soft science behind it apparently butter makes you fat and gives you heart attacks marjorie eens meant to send you blind so rather than pick a side like in the Battle of Hastings I've decided to use half a cup of both equaling 1 cup of super fatty goodness and the coca-cola reduction ok so to make a coca-cola reduction easiest thing to do is grab one liter of coke and add it to a fry pan or saucepan once you've done that stage set it to boil and wait it'll probably take you about 40 minutes that's how long this one so to reduce one liter down to about 125 mills or a quarter of a cup once you're beyond that point you're golden everything's good to go you've got concentrated Coca Cola syrup once you've done that you're coca-cola reduction is ready to be used with the rest of the ingredients for the next step you're going to peel then call then slice some apples yeah let's move on for the next step melt some butter into a pan add the flour add the coca-cola reduction and add the sugar stir all that together because you're going to need it as thick and rich and creamy as possible this is a step in the right direction but we want it thicker one against this sort of darkness and that kind of quality that's the type of sauce here after take it off the heat put it aside for now you'll be adding it to the pyre once everything else is ready if it looks like throwing up after a hard night of drinking you're going in the right direction this step is super important if your dog isn't sick of your by now then you failed and you need to start the recipe from scratch take the apple slices you prepared earlier and start laying them down in the pie pastry don't worry about overlapping they'll reduce in size once they cook taking some slicing of pastry we had before start layering it on top of the pie in a lattice like structure start pouring the sauce over the top of the pie making sure that you get it evenly spread out unless you it up somehow it should look like this gradually put the pie into the oven making sure that you don't anger anything already living inside make sure that the oven is about 225 degrees and leave it there for about 45 minutes after which period it'll be okay to take it out now that we have time and we're waiting let's make the custard for the ingredients you will need 2 egg yolks without the egg whites 2 tablespoons of corn flour six hundred mils of vanilla coke and two cups of milk just do a quick reduction with the vanilla coke in another saucepan add the vanilla coke reduction add the milk add the cornflour and then whisk it together don't let it boil just make sure it heats up at the two egg yolks to a bit of the milk mixture from the saucepan and whisk together slowly pour the mixture back in turn the temperature on wed at thicken being careful not to burn yourself carefully take the pie out of the oven and this is the final result if you follow it along and add it in any steps that I forgot to include your pie and custard should look the exact same as mine do my only serving suggestion for this is you take a piece of the pie out you gradually pour the custard over the top this gives you a good combination of just general sweetness and general creaminess and there you have it the entire basics of making a coca-cola reduction sauce pie and a vanilla coke custom two very simple steps that allow you to replace anything involving children with coca-cola I imagine you can do this with Fanta lemonade any base soft drink any sugar based soft drink be really simple to do as for how it tastes I can't describe it's just incredible to just grab a piece of it now it's I just lack the words there is not the pastry is crisp so it's been cooked to the right time the sauce is thick it's gooey it's I imagine this is a combination of butter and sugar which makes everything taste fantastic but it amazes me that this has worked out from beginning to end perfectly as I had imagined it", "eZDpKSfAVxo": "we discovered these old apple trees and I was like wow these tastes like nothing I've ever tasted before in my life five years ago Martin Bernstein walked into Eric childs as fermentation supply shop in Kingston in search of a fermentation kit Eric it turned out wanted apples Martin had apples and so the two established a partnership that soon evolved into abandoned hard cider here's how we crowds there's our apples we send out a mailer in the mail the foundation of every cider Martin and Eric ferment is in wild apples wild apple trees litter of estate thanks to animals spreading seeds humans tossing cores out car windows and settlers planting trees hundreds of years ago there are literally probably millions of wild apple trees or generic rely on five counties of upstate neighbors with backyard orchard stands of a few trees and lone individuals to create their cider offering pruning and the finished product in exchange for fruit they're called spitters because you you spit them out they taste so bad until Martin hands them over to Eric here in this old Apple packing house on the side of County Route six in Columbia County where batches of seasonal single varietals and other experimental concoctions bubble in various containers some of which eric toils and troubles to blend together to meet his own benchmarks for acidity and sugar level as many as 100 different varieties of apple we are coming really close to on point from the year before in our blend but batch to batch before blending is very unique and very different in 2020 a billion hard cider expects to sell 100 thousand cans of cider made from more than 2.5 million new york apples the wild apples have tannins they have acidity they have all these different flavor compounds that you don't find in a gala or a Fuji abandoned hard cider distributes statewide and soon expects to sell its core three products in California DC and Massachusetts places where Morgan Eric cider baller Center buyers believe they're made in New York label carries a connotation of expertise and quality we hope it sort of signals the same thing as a California wine or a Napa Valley wine as we grow we want more and more people to know that we want your apples no Apple left behind yeah in Germantown New York on that kick Fox 5 News", "P7lekG4GIaI": "hey youtubers SEMA here today should be just a real short video I'm going to show you how to make hard cider the easy way I found a recipe I've made this few times I've shared it with my friends they all love it and it's as easy as having 23 litres of apple juice and a kilogram of brown sugar and a package of yeast what I found first time I made it it come out pretty strong what I didn't do was consider the sugar content that's that's in the apple juice and if you look on the back there's always the nutritional facts at least in Canada there is I'm sure there is in the States and you just have to look at how many servings or what the the serving amount is and how much sugar is in that serving and then just do the math now with 23 litres of apple juice works out to just over a kilogram of natural sugars that's in the juice and then with the brown sugar with one kilogram it'll bring the hard cider out to be around 6% so what let's get started alright so I've added 6 litres of apple juice to the pot and I just put it on a medium heat you don't want to heat you know heat the apple juice up too much you just want to heat it enough that when you add the brown sugar that you know help dissolve it then I'll make it a little easier for the yeast to eat all the sugars and ferment oh and what I found in the past is it takes approximately two weeks to ferment oh you can hear it on the bottom of the pot still kind of granular so we're just going to keep on stirring until we don't hear that granular sound on the bottom of the pot you want to keep an eye on the temperature as well again can't stress it enough you don't want to boil the apple juice or get it too hot so we have all of our apple juice and brown sugar all mixed together gonna pour it in here oh my you could smell how wonderful this is apple juice and brown sugar smells just like apple pie now put in the rest of our apple juice and we'll give it a good stir all right now that the Abba juice is all in a big stir stick stir this up good now with the amount of sugar that went into this I actually used 21 litres of apple juice so I'm not going to add any more to this mainly because I don't want to overflow my my pocket or my current boy so we're just going to make sure this stirred up nice it doesn't matter of use cannot produce or from a tetrapack this this batch of hard cider that are making a that would use kingman a tetra pack and that's what was on sale this week and that's given waiting actually several months but i'll produce to go on sale so that I can make another batch of hard cider all right now those are going to do well make sure it gets down to room temperature and then we'll we'll hydrate our East and we'll pitch it so we're ready to pitch our yeast it's nice and hydrated pour it all in and there's just a little bit left for your bottom I'm just using small amounts of water I don't want to water it down too much within our rubber bone the only thing I will say is the ale yeast does not smell pretty at all but don't worry when you go to make it because what you smell from the a least is not going to transfer into the taste of your heart cider airlock is on water levels both here and now we're ready to put it off on on a shelf and let it ferment Oh", "mg8tItaqKMk": "hi guys through here from prepared camping if you followed the news in the uk recently you'll see how some politicians have decided to start telling people what they're allowed to buy and what they're not allowed to buy at some point i'm sure one bright spark will say that we're drinking too much and they'll say that alcohol is non-essential but apple juice is healthy and it's an essential let's just make it essentially healthier by turning it into cider now i'm going to be using this cheap fermentation bucket i found on amazon which i think is a pretty good deal and i'll add the description and link down below how to make cheap cider from supermarket apple juice get a bucket four and a half liters of apple juice a tea bag and some yeast the apple juice can be as cheap as you like but make sure it's 100 apple juice with no preservatives or otherwise that will kill your yeast after 10 minutes soaking remove the tea bag and add your tea to your apple juice stir in a teaspoon of used compound then seal it up and leave it somewhere warm for a week to ferment after a day or so should start bubbling like that so here we are after about a week of fermentation let's see what it's like now i'm going to decant this into these old rosy bottles and these are two liters each so that should leave me with about a pint or so liquid at the end left over to take a gravity reading and to taste what it's like at the moment although at the moment it will still be quite yeasty and probably not very nice gravity is 1.00 once i find the yeast to give the best results i'll start reusing it until then i'm just gonna throw this away i'll just pop these into the shed for a couple of weeks to condition and that should clarify as well as the yeast drops to the bottom thanks very much for watching guys if you enjoyed this please consider watching this one and who knows if you really liked it subscribe to the channel here until next time take care [Music] you", "4cmkhniKLrg": "welcome to bitter reality brewing today we're going to not brew prepare I have lures best cider house select here it's a cranberry apple it's a concentrate kind of like what we talk to non malts where we have multi track can think of this as a apple extract basically just condensed while the water evaporated off the key with these when you get these packets whether it's Brewers best or mangrove Jack's we did a mangrove Jack's before which was a a pear cider with peach and passion fruit I learned very quickly that when you cut this top you can't just reach in and get the ingredient stuff out you are actually cutting both one pocket on one side it's kind of a double pocket and I'll show you I've already sterilized the scissors but before we get going it requires us to take two pounds of corn sugar and mix it into boiling water and they say add it to your fermenter huge warning huge warning if you're using something like this 140 degree fahrenheit max temp don't do it this is a better choice but it's 180 degrees Fahrenheit the boiling temperature is approximately 212 degrees don't want to put boiling water in here what you're gonna do is put it in here as it's cooling this is where boiling water goes in a pot something designed to handle it stainless steel you can get a nice thermometer or you can do something like this we're sitting at about a hundred and seventy eight and it's going down quickly but that's fine what they want us to do is add two pounds of corner sugar here's another little catch this is at five point two percent ABV I don't want these six gallons that's four six gallons I want to do five gallons I'm gonna cake it everything I have is five gallons I don't have six gallon kegs so what you do is basically take five point two you'll divide that or actually yet divide that by five which is where you're going to be multiply it by six or you should be shared of a bin um and that takes you five point two to six point two four you can plug something like that into beer Smith or other calculators it'll come out with the same thing you take your five point two and it's going to go up to six point two four using beer Smith I decided I didn't want to be at 6.24 I want to be at 6.5 I think that's just a better number so what we're gonna do is we're gonna add another two point four ounces of corn sugar to the two pounds of corn sugar which will leave us right at six point five you don't have to necessarily sterilize this part right here even though I kind of cross-contaminated my scissors now don't let's take care of that later not a big deal because we're putting it in close to boiling water and we're just going to pour it in there okay and the moisture of course hits the bag and gets it all wet they don't want to turn around do this cut the second bag each bag is a pound of corn sugar don't forget especially things like the little map there for calculating your ABV and things you see something the video you like enjoy entertaining I'm a bit of a klutz got enough scars to prove that or just a fellow Brewer or someone who likes cider go ahead hit to like definitely appreciate it any comments questions concerns or just for fun of course I forgot the spoon so we're gonna get the spoon here real quick then we're gonna cut this open mix up as much as we can because the temperature drops to below which is already below 180 but I like to be more comfortable maybe 150 we'll pour it into here this has already been sterilized we're gonna measure it out to five gallons once it cools down we're gonna add it to our glass carboy another tip never never and this was actually on here never at boiling water to a glass carboy it will explode fracture shatter beyond the huge mess the glass everywhere which I love glass but definitely not what it's broken you'll probably burn yourself or your feet or your legs not something anyone needs to be doing so give me one moment to grab the spoon and we'll continue tada a spoon so the cup make sure the corn fritters dissolve put two gallons honestly I think it would have dissolved a lot less let's measure out our two point four ounces of corn shredder before we start messing with the cider put on your scale hit tear just kind of shake out about 2.4 ounces warning corn sugar is like dry malt extract extremely sticky and will absorb moisture very quickly okay and two point four three close enough okay stir that up now for the fun just stars' and a little bit of I guess cut it you can always cut more but trust me when you see it you'll understand why I did it that way so one side is dry and I got my directions which shoulds on the outside don't cut it until you're ready to brew I made the mistake with mangrove jack I cut it just so I could get into the instructions and check it out and realize at that moment I was going to be making cider this is the premium cider yeast I had good luck with mangrove jacks I'm gonna try cider houses I'm not gonna add a third party yeast wanted to see how their yeast works you never know until you try it this is a sweetener which I can't tell you exactly what it is but everybody says from what I'm finding on Reddit and other places it's sorbitol it's a alcohol based but it's a very minut it's six point three grams I am looking to add half of it normally I like a very dry cider but I'm afraid it will not allow the cranberry to pop so we're gonna add about half of that I have not seen any complaints of off tastes cranberry apple cider flavoring so probably our cider flavoring it scares me it's not red but we'll go with it okay now I'm opening the second package literally it's separated I would love to show you but as I showed you I would be pouring cider so we're gonna take this concentrated cider which looks ruby red just poured it I already have some hot water being prepared so that I can rinse this with clean spring water and that's all we're using this we're basically just boiling spring water nothing special nothing fancy you don't need to treat your water you don't really want to use distilled because the minerals do help with the east and you want to have some minerals in there okay and see the other side now which is clean and that's where all the little goodies were hidden so then grab a little warm water very sweet tada we're back with another thing of hot water and this isn't quite as hot I don't wanna burn myself or melt the bag I don't know how much temperatures your bag can handle so we're gonna just take there's a glass measuring cup pour it in another glass it's Pyrex very useful in brewing it seems nice but plastic will splash around just a little bit to scold ourselves okay looks like pretty much it and now I can flatten it out and actually see everything but Brewers best cider house select cranberry apple we'll see how this goes let's let this cool down a little over here and make sure another good tip and you're cleaning it let some water flow through this and then shut it off drain it that way you know it's closed last thing you want to do is be pouring cider in here before the other side okay let's take a quick glance at our temp we're sitting in about 130 we should be good when you start pouring it into the bucket the buckets already been sterilized as stars' and here we go and that easy and a miracle and a half I didn't make a mess thank God I don't have carpet smells good definitely like to smell the instructions that I read online that glanced online says that we need to add this before bottling or per-say before taking same thing with the sweetener we're gonna add that little later we don't need to add that right now the yeast we're gonna take the east put it in a little warm glass of water sitting up around 85 degrees let it grow a little bit for a few minutes and then we'll add it to it I'm gonna transfer this to an actual glass carboy what you'll want to do when you add it to a glass carboy or any carboy for that example you wanted to cool down at first and you don't want to add this until you're sitting there at least under 80 preferably worth whatever the temps that the yeast says which is usually I believe this one says 82 degrees Fahrenheit max so 54 to 82 they recommend optimal temperatures of 60 to 75 degrees we're gonna let for a minute 68 degrees Fahrenheit which is kind of right in the middle or pretty close to the middle as far as I'm concerned my fermenter is just very happy right at around 68 degrees from all the else we do got a funnel a little strainer catches any kind of debris I like to use it not even well not even if there's something in here but the key is is that it allows it to get more aerated and as you're pouring it it's gonna aerate the cider not Ward we're doing apple not beer but same principle you want that aeration you want a lot of oxygen in there so that the yeast has something to eat while it's eating the sugar it lives off that oxygen eventually the oxygen will convert to carbon dioxide co2 and that's fine because we don't want oxygen after the fact once it's been sitting they recommend a week we'll probably give it about two weeks in the fermenter then we'll do a transfer off of the trub or the debris at the bottom it's part of the yeast repopulating and repopulating and expanding and dying off and volume to the bottom or at least going into suspension once we have that done then we'll move it again to a keg from the keg we'll drop it in here get it nice and cold nice and carbonated and in about two weeks of carbonation will be serving cider so I'm gonna add some more water to this and let it cool down and we'll go from there founded by the 89 degrees I think we're about ready I'm gonna transfer to the carboy pitch the yeast done did a hydrometer reading earlier wasn't quite where I wanted a lot of times these kids are not at the level that they say they are going to be for the sugar I don't know if they overestimate wow I mean I'm sitting below five gallons and I was barely hitting five point four and I'm supposed to have five point two at six gallons yeah - what - pounds up for corn sugar so what we did is we added up and basically two and a half pounds so we did the two pounds the two point four and then I added another five point six yeah eight ounces total so don't half pounds total I'll show you a trick if you're either you're trying to read a hydrometer if your I challenged or if you are age challenged makes it much easier to read sitting at about 5.2 justa for temperature since it's calibrated for 68 degrees Fahrenheit we calibrated it or not calibrated but adjusted it for 89 degrees Fahrenheit which actually puts us at one point zero five four and if we get down to one point zero zero four I believe is their expected final gravity that should put us just a hair over six point five about six point five point six to six point five point four percent baby which is perfect I'm good with clothes it may be a science to it there's a lot of times you're explose you not dead on when it comes to brewing or anything else related to it so we'll go ahead and transfer this okay so we're going to use the pump we didn't probably with sterilized inside clean outs I need to fit up that scrubbing not to worry bit of a trip here concerning you can only take this out washes we see it so concerning this is the East it's quite a fit in the pack that it was kind of shocked me looking it was twice what I'm used to my beer packet mom's kind of bready a lot of use has a natural fruit smell or smells similar to what it's going to give off those hard esters just ready we'll see if it comes out more site or even Britain tiger okay this is gonna take a little while we're sitting right now at about three and a half Jenn's across this up a little bit just put it close it's good to use a funnel but it couldn't get it lined up at me do you really want to lift it between the danger of it spilling it hitting this or just simply making a mess so here's what we're going to do I've got most of it in there I have the East here looks like a city street auction you just gonna pour it in I got the funnel out because I didn't want to spill that stuff and then a little in here to rinse for yeast we've been aerate it put that on there and little trick rubber bands how hold these on this isn't a rubber band this is one of those weird rubber shoe things that people buy and hook through their shoes my wife bought them from our kid my kid didn't want them so they now hold these on top of the car boys and then shoving this through the hole and this will start bubbling probably sometime tomorrow so we're done give it a week so we'll go from there thank you again for joining bitter reality brewing and don't forget to hit the light if you would appreciate thank you",

always look for new things to do and this year I've got a press you can actually make hard apple cider without a press you can actually use a juicer if you're interested in this press I'll put a link in the description for the Amazon page that'll take you right to this press they're really inexpensive and it makes the whole process a lot more fun and a lot more easy it takes about 15 pounds of apples to make one gallon of hard cider you need wild apples you can't use the store-bought stuff it has to be something that's organic so the first thing we want to do is cut our apples in half and more than anything we just want to do that just so we can make sure that the Apple is good there's no bugs [Music] if you're just trying to make apple cider you're done at this point just put a cap on it and this is ready to go you can actually store it and it doesn't even need to be refrigerated if you're after hard apple cider then we're gonna add just a little bit of sugar depending on how sweet the apple cider is there's no real magic number as far as how much sugar to add make sure that if you do add sugar add it very very slowly or this whole thing will just look like a science experiment and blow out like a volcano on the top so add it real slow at this point you can add yeast also I like to use the wild goose that's on the skin of the Apple but you can use a brewers yeast or a winemakers yeast also and when you add the sugar or the sugar that's in the apple cider that actually is the food for the yeast and that's what creates the alcohol in the apple cider now you might be wondering what these balloons are on top of mine what this is is my homemade airlock you can use the Brewers type airlock that lets the carbon dioxide out of the bottle or you can take just a regular old balloon and you just put a small little cut in the top and that will not let bacteria in but it will let carbon dioxide out and as time goes on this will kind of inflate just a little bit and that whole let just the carbon dioxide out okay once we've got our air locks in place we're good to go these can sit for about two to three weeks and you should have a pretty good amount of alcohol in them after that point you can actually add some more sugar over time just to see if it will generate a little bit more alcohol but you do want to be careful with leaving it too long or too short because it will change the flavor so you might want to just experiment a little bit of that this is retired at 40 make sure you check your local laws for brewing your own alcohol remember to live life simple we'll catch you next time", "yWikcIGl3Pc": "hi I'm Brian and this is City study and today on City sitting I'm gonna make hard apple cider but I'm gonna do it a little differently than I might have thought [Music] okay we're back now as I said I'm gonna make hard apple cider here's the thing with apple cider it's a very very very simple thing to do a lot of people like to make things complicated a lot of people like to keep things simple I'm a simple kind of guy I want it to be easy this should be fun I I like to think of when I do these videos and when I make stuff for people I want it to be that anybody can do this and I mean literally anybody as long as you're 21 in the United States anyway I also said I was gonna do it a little differently normally when I set out to make a brew and you know hard apple cider would be an example I pull out one of these a carboy okay this is a five gallon carboys this thing's big it's heavy and when you start mixing it around sloshing around you get quite the workout I know my parents doesn't say that I work out a lot but you know that's what this looks like anyway today I'm gonna do things a little different I'm not gonna use this we had a question by one of our one of our subscribers who said can I just use the plastic jug that the apple cider comes in I thought yeah why not I've never done it that way I've seen other people do it and I've seen other people use all kinds of various fermentation vessels plastic doesn't seem to be a problem for fermenting especially this level obviously distilling things like that which are illegal in the United States they do require a different level of equipment we're not getting into any of that even mentioning that word I probably should have even said anything but regardless they mentioned a one gallon cider jug that it came in okay I'm thinking they probably look a lot like the old-fashioned wine bottles you know something something like this right which this is perfect as a fermentation vessel that's all absolutely you can use this what I'm looking to do though is just use the container it came in okay now I'm using apple juice to make this you can totally use whole apples whatever but my point in using this container serves a couple of purposes first this is Aldi apple juice it has no preservatives in it when you read the ingredients it says filtered water organic apple juice concentrate ascorbic acid that's just vitamin C that's good for you it's not gonna hurt what you don't want to see is any kind of sore baits and things like that it's even better fault it says it contains apple juice I've seen those too but the advantage to this is something that a lot of people might not to think about when this is sealed at the factory at the manufacturing plant it's sterile inside everything in here is sterile there's no excess bacteria so you don't have to boil this you don't have to sterilize it sanitize it nothing it's ready to go the only thing that I'm gonna do differently is I'm going to put an airlock on the top you can stretch a balloon over it punch a hole in it that kind of thing here's the thing if you're gonna make your own alcohol and you're gonna do this more than once invest $2 into an airlock and I'll show you what an airlock looks like in a minute because conveniently I forgot to pull one out to do this video and through the magic of video we have an airlock now what an airlock is it's a really simple thing it's a piece of plastic and they come in a couple different styles I happen to prefer the two to type you fill it with water as you can see the water there essentially what happens is as co2 comes out of this it pushes up through this tube and down into that one forcing this water down and up this way and the air bubbles come out but bugs bacteria other stuff other air oxygen can't do the same they can't push back through because here's the thing if the pressure outside was that great to force it all the way in this would explode and you'd be dead so it's just not possible it would take a tremendous amount of pressure to do this and you need a stopper now this happens to be just a rubber one that fits in the mouth of this bottle and it works really really well but we'll get to that in a little bit you want to just make sure that you have one of those some other things that you're gonna need the apple juice of course a funnel preferably dry we're gonna be pouring sugar through this if it's wet it's gonna stick and make your life kind of more complicated than it really needs to be a glass it could be plastic but I prefer was a hydrometer if you don't have one of these I suggest you get it it's not necessary but this can tell you how much alcohol you're actually gonna have in your brew when you're done all the stuff that I'm some that we have here like the airlock the hydrometer so like that I'm gonna have links down and below to the stuff that I would use the stuff that I recommend getting it's all on Amazon and if you happen to you those links and purchase anything we do get a very tiny Commission for doing it it helps support the channel it doesn't cost you anything extra you still get like if you have Prime or whatever you still get the best price possible so yeah use those links in the description you're also gonna need a cup of sugar now plain old white table sugar is just fine I happen to like the the brownish cane sugar and stuff like that it doesn't really add much flavor there's a tiny little bit of molasses in there so so it's brown it looks fancy but it doesn't really change the flavor much I just like it cuz it's not as processed as some of the white sugar white sugar has been bleached it's tired but it has so what I've also done is you need yeast now I'm using dance Tarbell sazon yeast today and I have about a teaspoon maybe half to 2/3 of a teaspoon there's all done a little bit of our apple juice okay and what that's doing is it's getting started it's not really a starter it's rehydrating it's letting the yeast start working a little bit you'll see some bubbles in there it's actually starting to already work on that and produce co2 and produce a tiny bit of alcohol takes takes a little time to get get it up to full strength but once you have all that set up this is a super super simple thing to do I mean it this doesn't really take a lot the glass you're probably wondering what this was for it's because once we do this we don't want this to be all the way to the top so we're gonna pour off just a little bit of this apple juice see a little bit more now this is a half gallon by the way 64 ounces and I also have to make room to pour this back in that looks about right and I'm drink if you don't like drinking apple juice you won't like the cider that it makes so make sure whatever apple juice you get tastes good to you I've done this with this juice before several times I know it works I know it's great it's got a nice flavor it's very Apple II and the the cider that comes out of it is just it's just really nice okay continuing on actually you know what I misjudged I'm gonna have to add some sugar in there I need to make more room some might say that I just wanted to get more apple juice to drink in they might be right if pressed I pulled off probably about eight ounces including an ounce for their and I'm gonna do take my funnel drop it in there start pouring in the granulated sugar now you might say what do you need the sugar for well it increases the alcohol content yeah you can do without the sugar you totally just do straight apple cider that way it'll be a little lower in alcohol I like to mix mine and blend them with fruits and stuff so I like to add a little bit give it a little more kick now when I say more alcohol the most basic ones might be four five percent alcohol this might come out at nine to twelve I'm gonna measure it in just a minute and we'll find out exactly what it'll be that's where the hydrometer comes in here comes the hardest part of the whole thing put the cap on and if you notice you can probably see it's a lecture sit in the bottom can't happen gotta shake that up this is where having a small container is nice because that five-gallon versus this and remember the whole rule of a pints a pound the world around that means a gallon is eight pounds that makes this forty pounds plus the jar that makes this four pounds much more happy shaking four pounds in 45 pounds so once you get that chicken up you want to make sure that if it sits for any length of time you don't see any slip you want to make sure it's all in there that is the food for the yeast and that's what's gonna make your alcohol so if it's just sitting on the bottom the east won't really well okay we'll get but it makes it take longer now I'd like to say at this point also there are people out there that will say oh you need nice yeast nutrient and you need this you need that and there's all these things you can add and you know what they're right that's all mine you can make this super easy you can make it super hard people have been making alcoholic beverages like this for thousands of years they didn't even have plastic they didn't know yeast was they just used a stick that their grandmother gave them because it was magic they didn't realize as East was imbued into that stick it actually put some yeast into the brew but even without that you can go pure lambic and just get wild yeast out of the air they are all around you scary but true you're breathing them right now they get into this and they can make it a really amazing apple cider or a really nasty apple cider because you never know what you're gonna get that's why a lot of people will don't add Camden tablets to their stuffing you know what this was sterile when I bought it if it wasn't it did have spoiled in the bottle sitting on a shelf so it's safe this is this is hard to do I like to keep things natural keep it simple and I'm also stalling because it's just not dissolving the way I wanted to oh you also want this to be at room temperature you do not want this cold when you put east in there below 50 degrees can actually stall the east and make it not really perform and over about 110 120 you don't want to go past 120 but over 110 yeast might not be as active so keep it in the 62 to 90 degree range and you're fine here in Florida we have the air conditioning going so I know that in our house right now it is 74 degrees in this room that's a little warm but you know what when it's a little warm the yeast acts a little faster now I know that the room I keep it in is more like 72 or so so I know it takes just a little bit longer but anyway so it looks like we're we're there yep no floaties nothing floating around in there so I'm gonna do take this mix this around real good probably use a funnel pour that's it now this is my yeast mixture as I said again it's just a little bit of yeast mixed with some apple cider I'm gonna mix that up and then I'm gonna take a reading okay what I mean by a reading is I'm going to use a hydrometer to calculate how much sugars there are in this relative to a neutral substance like water okay water equals a one point zero zero zero anything above that has sugars in it that kind of thing in the second half of this video I will show you what we mean by that when we finish and actually measure the complete alcohol but for now and take some of this and report in this tube here just to about there so it's gonna float pretty good back in there get out my hydrometer and what it is it's a weighted tube with measurements on it and the ones you're looking for you probably can't see it on this video starts at 0.99 zero and starts going up and sometimes they even say beer wine you know that kind of thing what I'm gonna do is just drop it in give it a little spin to get rid of some of those bubbles wait till it stops moving around I'm gonna read that as one point zero nine zero now off the top of my head I'm not sure exactly what that comes out to but I think it's somewhere around eleven percent alcohol it's actually pretty decent might even be twelve or thirteen I'm not sure but that's if it goes to completely dry now because of my methods most of my brews do go completely dry you can sorbate early you can cold crash early and things like that to get a little bit of residual sweetness I happen to like them go and dry I know I'm getting all the alcohol out and you know what you can let that sit a little bit longer let that yeast die literally just die and it stops and once it does that no more fermentation is gonna happen then I can sweeten it back up put a little more apple juice back in things like that but that's later on in the video for now I'm gonna put that in just like that I'm gonna mix it up again a little bit then comes the big deal this is where you want to have an airlock okay this is so I can keep stuff out and keep the air in and what will happen is over time this will start bubbling like I can actually simulate it'll do that all on its own when that happens you know your yeast is working I actually want to reset the pressure okay if you don't have an airlock and you absolutely just can't go spend two dollars to get one first I urge you do it anyway find two dollars look in the couch cushions it's probably there this will make things a lot easier for you if you stretch the balloon thing yeah it's probably safe but it's just more of a pain in the butt and you can use this thing forever and it's not like they break they don't use up use it forever I've actually snapped one off in like years of using these things so don't don't worry about it but basically that's where we're at now now we want to take this we want to put it somewhere cool relatively dark so if you have to cover it with a blanket or something or a you know whatever to keep it dark you want to do that sunlight will actually kill the yeast probably so you don't want to go there sticking the cloth at put a blanket around it it'll be fine as long as you don't mess with this too much you're good in about six hours maybe twelve maybe even 24 or 48 don't freak out it's gonna start bubbling in my experience most the time it started in within about six hours okay some notes on yeast I use a fancy East I used a beer cider type yeast okay you can if you really wanted to use like Fleischmann's bread yeast I've done it everybody's tried it at some point if they haven't they're long if they tell you they haven't they're lying to you everybody's tried will it make a huge difference yes and no if you use Fleischmann's yeast and you don't ever do anything to it you just let it sit for months it'll probably taste just fine if you think after two weeks you're gonna get something that you're gonna want to drink you're probably wrong it won't taste that good right away but in time it will taste good if you use a yeast made to make alcohol they tend to come out faster a little bit better I was a big believer I'm just using bread yeast for making ciders and and cheap wines and things like that I did that with bread yeast all the time and it worked really really well a lot of people out there gonna hate me for this and you know what express yourself in the comments it's all good they do work they don't work as well they're not made for this they're made to make bread which means they're made to make more co2 and less alcohol this stuff is made to make less co2 and more alcohol now there is also a common myth that they won't go past say 11 or 12 percent that's not true I've made 15% alcohol using bread use it's all about control and attenuation they don't they don't tend to drop to the bottom and come out as clean you'll get streaky's and stuff and they don't look as nice let's just put it that way whereas this should come out sparkly crystal clean and you know it'll it'll taste really good in just a couple of weeks I'm speaking of that you want to put it in that cool dark place for about two weeks apple cider can take longer and it can be it can be done faster too I tend to find that two weeks is about right if you see that it's still actively bubbling pretty good let it go another week or two the trick to this stuff is don't rush it let it happen it's a natural process we can't say you used to happen in five days it doesn't work like that some juices it'll work faster some juices will work slower some Easter fasts or some Easter slower that's basically all I got but the rest of the video will be coming when this is ready so see that hey guys as always if you like this video please give us a like and don't forget to subscribe and hit that

talking to you about the apple pie moonshine this is a cocktail that comes to you from the TV show justified on FX what you gonna need is you're going to want to first get an apple mason jar mason jar like you know whatever one of these old jam jars something and you get some apple cider for this example I have apple juice but it will search this the same it take pour it in and then gotta heat it up you can either heat this up in I'm stove or go to link wiggle search so I'm going to take foot in this microwave oh my hip it for about men and a half two minutes alright it's done so we do pull it out like a little hops over here and what I would normally say is you want to add oranges some clothes and a cinnamon stick some spices like that put your spices what I ended up getting is a thing called cyber spices from aspect this work just the same for me and I'm going to take and just add a little bit of this to it about let's say for how much I added about a pint here you want a 2 teaspoons tooth and a half mix that up alright the next step is going to be that you want to add I mean it's gonna be however much you want but I'm going to have about a shot of some spiced rum then last step and take a little piece of that bull full wedge just pop it on there look and you got yourself an apple pie moonshine arsenic is optional actually just don't put arsenic in that's hot take a little apple take an apple wedge it on the jar all right", "cnEuiZ9MoBg": "O.C.

"finally on seven from dry to apple-pie there's a flavor for any palate at deep roots hard cider in Bradford County our Cary brazen pop by the business and sugar run to find out what makes it ciders so unique remember to always look on the bright side or should I say bright cider we're inside the tasting room at deep roots hard cider in sugar run for this week's taste test deep roots officially got its roots in 2015 and the ciders here are quite different from other name brands since we do make it more of a wine style it kind of separates ourselves away from the commercial ciders like the angry orchard or woodchuck or stella swapping some cider as well the apples and these award-winning fighters come from local orchards all our apples come from Miller's work shirt and Clark summit and we've been starting to work with Heller's orchard out mouth that way as well when you have a small word here about two acres or so a 400 trees those are mostly especially apples that are just starting to produce so hopefully it'll make our own little homestead blend here soon there are a few favorites our top sellers are actually our dry spot which is our new one that's actually number one this year as followed by like the raspberry hard cider which is a sweet tart and our apple crisp which is basically apple pie in a bottle let's get tasting she's trying the Heritage harvest mmm it's really light I'm kind of like fruity but it also tastes kind of like a like a Riesling yeah so it's really light you could drink a lot of it pretty dry that like a mid-level yeah it's not super dry but it's not super sweet either so I think it'd be a good midline midline drink this gentleman came a long way to sample the ciders his pick raspberry yeah it's really good refreshing that's like a little sourness to it but it's not too overwhelming so is this money a favorite ciders yeah this one's my absolute favorite of them all I've had like a whole bottle of it and I've tried some of the other ones but this one's definitely the favorite and you're not from around here no from Canada what brings you here my fiancee actually I'm not leaving here without a taste yeah absolutely I'm here if you're not able to make it to the tasting room you'll soon be able to purchase deep roots ciders online or at the Dallas PA rotary wine & Brew Fest on June 22nd for this week's taste test Terry brazen

available for a limited time this fall", "aJXOZzCVHCY": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to the sill I know it has been forever I'm living gonna go back to the old sip videos and see when was the last time that I posted any video regarding alcohol but I really want to get back into the flow of the videos or the series that I really enjoy and you guys seem to enjoy as well for a while the last I would say six months I've been off and on due to like work in school and just personal things not feeling like recording and I know you should you should post too but you should want to push yourself to a court but the things that was going on I just I try and feel like I just couldn't forward I didn't feel like it and if I did force myself to record you can see that I wasn't I wasn't in the right mind frame so I do apologize this series has been gone on hiatus for quite a while but it is back guys so today we have st. James winery apple pie sweet wine and I'm honestly not a big fan of apple pie like I'm really not a fan of any fruit pies but this just screamed fall to me like I don't know pies and pies this I could think of and it says it's a seasonal shovel it says it's a seasonal show says it's a seasonal selection so I wanted to get it before it goes out of a stock or be the season ends and I didn't taste it you know so st. James winery apple pie sweet and delicious with a hint of cinnamon like apple pie in a bottle apple pies to select seasonal wine available for a very limited time at select stores only apple wine with natural flavors this is a natural product and sediment or haze may appear it's a sentiment right I don't know oh I keep forgetting the st. James winery is a Missouri wine you know how like you're watching something like the commercials and stuff but you really not comprehending like your mind some rails I keep forgetting that st. James liner is a missouri wine so yeah and this contains sulfites alcohol 10% by volume and the Surgeon General stuff and of course I'm gonna keep reminding you you should not be drinking while pregnant frosty and whatnot so clearly it has this apple pie cinnamon golden color to it and it is not the bottle the bottle is clear with the red cap this is the actual color the color that you are seeing in the bottle is the actual liquid like this the actual wine it's not the bottle that's this golden colored the bottle is actually completely cleared I like the packaging is super simple with the apple pie a bird with like a apple farm with something apples in a bucket it has select seasonal selector yeah seasonal selection or whatever and on the back is super simple as well and I do like how the font is easy to read that's one thing you can never go wrong with rainbow egg I mean sometimes it's a little boring but it's easy to read I don't remember what line that was before head and I could not read the back like it was a pink label with white writing I couldn't read it so I do like the packaging packaging is very nice and simple and that's how it caught my eye like a big old pile on the front it's gonna be eye-catching you know anyway I'm gonna look glass no wine glass I need to get one cuz I broke my last one show you twist off cap Oh it does not smell like apple pie okay that's the first thing it just smells like white wine like I say the color is its true to color it just reminds you of the power [Music] it doesn't taste like all right this is what I mind you up I know I know I said I don't really care for apple pie but I've had plenty of time of my life you know this doesn't taste like apple pie doesn't remind me of apple pie the color you would think okay since it's a flower I thought yeah that looks like you know apples that are inside of a pie you know but it doesn't taste like apple pie it does have an apple tastes like an aftertaste it's sweet but it's not like y'all know we've tried some sweet wines on this channel it's really not all that sweet but it it'll do the job if you're looking for a sweet wine but it's not overbearing okay it has an apple aftertaste to it I like it it's decent it just reminds me of like a white wine just a simple white wine right if i had to sum this up this is like a sweet apple whining not so much apple pie you know yeah so yeah this is good it is good I would recommend you trying this sweet white apple wine not so much giving me apple pie vibes but I get the marketing you know I get it I get it this was $7.99 at one of the local Walmart's near me um when I seen the price on my thing it's kind of expensive for what I do because you know I'm super cheap but then again it's a missouri wine so I feel like anything that's made close to you it's gonna be a little bit more higher price I get it and it's a seasonal type of item so I feel like it's seasonal items they tend to be a little bit higher than the stuff that you can get any day but yeah this is the thing I do find it eight dollars for this is pretty good I like the line I do recommend good flavor cheap ten percent I call by value and those look sips as you seen I have not been drinking like that y'all like I really have not I had me a I had some 18-hundred vodka last night because I got some bad news but I haven't get drinking a lot online but this is pretty good and I'm lucky I'm feeling you know like the little tingle in my foot I'm a lightweight now cuz I have not been drinking like y'all gonna know if you don't follow me on Instagram and snapchat you know I'm never on snapchat like I hardly even opens the app you don't even see me posting about wines like I used to like I literally kind of just stopped drinking altogether like every now and again yeah for my birthday yeah for graduation yeah I drunk you know being in a little bit after but other than that I'm not been drinking so yeah I do recommend this I like this again I am NOT a wine connoisseur I just know what I like and what I don't like so no I cannot tell you if this goes good with steak in a cheese plate or fresh room-temperature fruit I don't know I just know I like you you know like that's it so yes guys thank you for watching this video welcome back to the sip we're gonna get these videos going again I'm super excited to try out the fall winter seasonal selection type of items and yet we're back on it so give me some recommendations the ones that you have been trying that she really liked because I feel like I feel like I'm just new to this like I fell off the bandwagon and I gotta get back going so you're recommending single line [Music]", "vUzuy6YmKA8": "this is the second part of my making hard cider video as you can see the involves three weeks later since I first started formatting and as you can see the fermenting has slowed down quite a bit now and it's quite a bit of stuff that's settled to the bottom of the carboy so now what the next step I have to do is I have to siphon the six gallon carboys off down into a five gallon carboys move into a cool spot to have everything else settle out and age for a couple of months the first thing I'm going to do is remove this airlock that's been in here keeping the air up and I'm going to my siphon it put to open me the lower job then you just pull up on this a little pit push it and start it siphoning now it's still siphoning down into this new carboy and then you can see it's still pretty cloudy so it's probably going to take another three to four months sitting in a cool spot for everything to settle out and finish up the fermentation I'm transferring it to the secondary for a matter where I like to make sure that I have that as full as possible with the site or to keep it much air out as you can for the secondary fermentation and I also like to want put use vodka in the airlocks to adjust in case if you get temperatures should change and something should get sucked back in it as you can see is about an inch of stuff left in the bottom of the original firm entertainer that is just dumb garbage it must be removed so it doesn't affect the taste of the cider I also have some extra over to five gallons that I usually put me another smaller carboy which I'll mix for the next batch too and do a batch of cider that's really kind of a mixture it's not always that great but sometimes it's alright and now with a good time to take a little taste of it to get an idea what the flavor is I've noticed this year that's a lot not as sweet as batches have been in the past there's a lot less real sweet apple taste but it still tastes pretty good now for the next yaagh I actually have run out of glass carboys five down the side so I'm going to use a one a better bottle that I've got which is basically a plastic carboy but what I like to do is I like to put them in a big stainless steel pot so I can move them later because when you go to move them they squish and squeeze and liquid will come out so it makes it a lot easier to move it so now on to siphoning the next batch so here we go again everything's been washed and sanitized again the same thing take out the airlock put in the safe in drop the hose in the carboy and just give a little pull and push and we're sizing all right second ones off siphoned out now you can see what's left in the bottom is a bunch of dead yeast and settling from the fresh press site dirt so there it is there the second one I'm going to carry them down in a cool spot now and put in the airlocks and let them age also have a little three gallon carboy with the extra that didn't fit in and I'm going to throw another gallon of cider in and just do a potluck one all right the final step was move this down into my basement firts maintains a constant cool temperature and now what I'm going to have to do is just let it sit here probably till about the middle of January beginning of February to settle out everything will finish fermenting it will finish settling out and hopefully it will come out looking like my batch from list he'll come out crystal clear and really start mellowing out you can see I know so I have my elderberry wine I still have 11 gallons at a sitting here fermenting so I gotta wait another three and a half years for that to be ready but I should be doing another video the final one of this putting it into bottles sometime around February thanks for watching please subscribe", "gtBJy039IXE": "hi Manny Langham lead distiller here at leather with distillery I'm just talk to you a little bit about our classic apple pie moonshine this has a really nice cinnamon flavor to it it's not overly sweet it is sixty proof thirty percent each bottle you can see comes with a cinnamon stick and a piece of apple in it when you get it tasted it's got enough cinnamon you take the cinnamon stick out if you want more cinnamon and just leave it in there for a while and you get a lot more cinnamon flavor Cheers", "TbLGwwR6XMQ": "hi guys I'm Shaun Gannon future president of the United States of America and today I'm gonna show you how to make easy hard site okay this one can be a little different has hard regular apple cider and does it have a little cherry flavor to it so ingredients are gonna need 1 pound brown sugar this one's like brown sugar but it doesn't matter some container that can hold it all needs to be cleaned out their special brewing cleaner they're gonna use similar to beer brewery if you barrack it you can easily use that but jug works just fine couple gallons of hard or regular cider now you want to make sure this side right here is pasteurized pasteurized cider that's what you want right there pasteurized but you don't want it to have [Music] pasteurized no preservatives and no preservatives right yeah no preservatives but you want to pasteurized and the same thing with the cherry cider now we're not adding the cherry cider today that's it in a couple days we'll add that to our mixture so the first thing really doesn't matter the order so you're gonna add brown sugar now it doesn't mean difficult if I take some time so we're probably gonna pause the video while I get all this brown sugar and making sure everything is clean it's gonna take a while I know this is even gonna work but so we're to pause the camera and come back on it and all that brown sugar in there all right so now we got all the brown sugar in there we're going to add the apple cider cider [Music] now with this amount you could make a total of five gallons but we're all gonna make three gallons worth this one so we're doing two gallons of apple cider with one gallon of cherry cider to be added in a couple days all right there we go so now it's time to go get the yeast so now we're gonna have the yeast to it this is just wine yeast basic generic wine nice the I mean what the name is and it's s for wine yeast at the store and got it but you can order these online and we just pour it in there a little bit left that's super crucial they will multiply but man I cleaned off the yeast packet with a disinfectant the scissors they used to cut it I gotta cleanliness is important same thing with making beer got to be clean all right now it's gonna top and then we'll be done so a little two-dollar attachment goes over makes a seal over this top and really there's so many different ones you can get the fit whatever container you have and I'm gonna put a regulator on but I'm gonna kind of slosh this a little bit it'll move around some when I take it downstairs there we go it's kind of moving it a little bit that should be fine and then I gotta go put them on the top this is the so this is the top and this little air lock regulator so I'm gonna put this in there and as the East ferments the cider it kind of puts the air through but it kind of keeps it kind of sealed off it allows the gasses to go out so put that in here and again I cleaned all this stuff cleanliness is important and there you go that's like a dollar thirty dollar fifty is like two bucks you play find these for free and then you're good to go for right now so we're going to let it sit for about two days then add that that cider to it the cherry cider and then I let it go for another two weeks two and a half weeks something like that we'll see a bubble and stuff and then wouldn't keep it we store it in the basement in a cool area and look at the the east temperatures it probably stays below 75 degrees only four you should be fine degrees Fahrenheit but just go cover it so you don't want any sunlight to get to it and let the East do its mat so I'm going to move this to my basement and just play the waiting game now I forgot mine comes the stand all too loud [Music] [Applause] don't do that all right so um we're in the basement now it's been actually spent like six days we haven't put the extra stuff in we're gonna put the cherry cider in now so I got my funnel and then we're gonna put it in a dark area and it's kinda it's cooler down here so if you come over here you can kind of see we have our that's right this is clean so I'm gonna take this top off we can see this one was bubbling so that has been brewing okay and I'm gonna give you to hold this just for the top there perfect so got the first jug I'm just gonna pour this in that's all we got to do you mix up I don't think I needed to shake it I guess I can check that's right so this is a total of one gallon of this cherry cider again pasteurized with no preservatives shake well before serving but it's a lot so it shook up let's do the other one I'm gonna save these bottles and we're gonna put it in this bottle clean these out speaking guzo tap it and put the top back on hmm I need to add more water to it but anyway that's it and we just gotta wait another week and a half won't cover this back up so no light gets on it then we're good to go all right so it's been about now three weeks something like that good enough it's done fermenting you can't put it in a second fermenter they kind of get some of the sediment out I'm gonna try my best to pour it in here without getting instead of and we'll see but my kegerator is actually ready so we're not going to bottle it wasn't tossing the cake if you were gonna bottle it you put it in sanitized bottles put a little sugar in there tap it wait another week this will create co2 then you can drink it this way I put in the kegerator I add co2 that adds a carbonation to it but I also like federal it'll permanent that's what I would it say it so anyway taking the airing cap now I'm gonna try to pour it into here my mini sexed okay but that's billing alright and I always said I clean that ready for him so the goal was to pour this now if I remember correctly yeah I can see all the yeast is going in here it's fine a little yeast you taste to it not let it all go down though so that's done I'm gonna stop we can see that's all the yeast out the glass bottle it's slowly dripping in there so you get some in there it's not bad for you make it part sometimes we're going in obvious if I you say my normal brewing thing you could pour it out without the Heat's getting in there but this is what we have I'm showing you we can do if you don't have anything really all right there you go and that's it so now I'm just going to get the capper to seal it and tell us in the fridge alright so let's get the cat alright so now we have the top I'm gonna do this and let's seal it up I'm gonna put it in pretty easy comes with these sex little kits now one thing you want to note mine did actually nut note on the outside by nut which one's the intake for the co2 which one is the beer it kind of does but I just want to make sure you know that before you seal it up and then now it's sealed so we're gonna bring it inside and just you can follow me let's go at it to the kegerator pretty easy setup now I've already cleaned the lines of my kegerator so it's all clean because there the carriers I sealed up otherwise oh so what I want to do is where the co2 line is input I'm going to add this in okay boom now what you want to do let's run all I see a two tank and then I'm gonna add co2 to it nope so notice here you see a co2 is bubbling things my seal isn't 100% so it doesn't do a good job with that so I'm gonna fix that here you might let the rest air out and you try to redo that seal doing it Cecilia so I'm gonna try again I reset it see if the co2 comes out and we're gonna so what you wanted to do is yeah it's eloping there but this kind of you don't make sure it's sealed up I'm gonna fill it with co2 right now let it get all fill up in there then I'm gonna stop it and I'm gonna let that co2 out to the top I want to get all the oxygen out of here so I want only co2 to help keep it clean and wait some co2 but we start back on a little more just a little more out and I should be good to go alright so I'm gonna turn down here and then what I like to do is keep the PSI above ten clothes maybe fifteen seventeen depending on it this is a lot of space it should be fine but you want to increase the pressure this year to help carbonate faster and then has it's there and this carbon 81 then turn down the co2 so it's really just letting me run slow Oh one mistake I made though good thing I cut all right we could clean the lines let's route the co2 let the co2 out one last time and it's okay to do a little extra cleaning what this does is you don't want to put the tap for the line when I see a fistful it'll explode everywhere so you make sure it's not pressurized if I can get the lion and trouble with this last time there we go and now I gonna have to see a - the last time through flip the switch and we're good to go and now you put it in here okay maybe I chose fridge back on and in a couple days maybe you bricking panel would be warm put it in a couple days it'll be carbonated and ready to drink so there we go [Music]", "DTMVwKcvlyw": "where this Josh today I'm doing a review on old smokey moonshine and this apple pie flavor most the time I'm not saying I've had moonshine but any moonshine I've ever seen that's been apple pie usually isn't this color but not saying it's not real moonshine but you know most time like I said thing kind of a little more clear but anyway I poured some out right here in this little mini mason jar looking a little shot last thing so suppose though it smells like the real deal smells it cinnamon apples taking will shot at it and let you know what I think sometimes these things smell like getting really good really fruity and they don't end up being really fruity tasting the case of like alcohol so smells really good it's got a look like apple pie the like apples look like cinnamon looks good so I'm just gonna drink this a little bit right here Oh yeah tastes like real moonshine holy cow anyway tastes like apple pie you know sometimes like I said this uh you drink these it doesn't exactly taste like what it smells but it tastes like apples tastes like cinnamon tastes like moonshine so pretty good stuff", "Dicx8w1oqA4": "hello this is Randall the Michigan tropical gardener and I'm going to take these Apple peelings and cores and things and use them to make apple cider vinegar I'm going to put them into this vase as I need a widemouth glass preferable container and that will do just fine and I need to put something over it that will breed and that's where this comes in cheesecloth and I need some warm water and that's what I was just running okay so to do this I need to put the peelings into the vase here I let them sit for a little while they say I guess you should let them get brown but I don't think that's necessarily written in stone you just need to put them into a glass container I'll try to keep my video from being all shaky now there are different opinions on what you can do how to do it basically what you're doing is you're adding either all peelings and scraps and things like that or you can use the entire Apple it all depends on what you want to do and what you have if you want to fill it up at least three-quarters of the way yeah mine's closer to being really full which is fine and I need to add water to it and once again there are different schools of thought I read instructions where they say just to add water to this you know top it off with water I've also read where people used water and then added sugar or honey to it and basically what that does is it speeds up the process of turning this into alcohol and the alcohol will then turn into the vinegar all the depends on what you want to do how much time you want to spend it's going to take at least a month either way you let this sit with the water in there and kind of stir it up once a day once again you know this is it seems like everybody has a different method you can either just let it sit in there for a month or six months or you can stir it every day depends on what you want to do you know I think what I will do is I will add two tablespoons of sugar to some warm water and then fill this up so the water is pretty warm okay one moment please okay I'm not sure how much water it's going to take but we'll start with that and I'll add an imprecise measurement of sugar into there it's going to be that's good enough because otherwise I was going to add any wasn't going to add any sugar to it initially anyway okay now just pour that in and I'll add some more water to that but as I said the sugar only speeds up the fermentation process and really the the entire process is you know you determine when it's done after a week I will probably be removing all of the apple peels and all of that stuff and straining that out and then putting it back in here to sit for another you know like I said maybe six months it all depends on what you want to do you want to taste it after it gets to be a least maybe a month and you can try it out and see if the fermentation process is gone from alcoholic to more like a vinegar and then it's a matter of preference if you think it tastes like the vinegar you want it to be then it's fine otherwise you can just let it sit and keep fermenting for more information there many sources on the web that you can check out but now I'm going to cover this with the cheesecloth just to keep any bugs that might come along and dust them things like that and then I'll put a rubber band around there if I can fit it on there and then I'm going to leave it the counter somewhere in a corner so it's more dark I don't have anywhere else really right now that's warm enough like in the basement it'd be too cool and so I'll leave it on the counter somewhere and then check it every day so I'll continue making updates on this to let you know how it goes thanks for watching take care bye oh this is Randall Lee Michigan tropical gardener and this is my apple cider vinegar after a week so as you can see it's getting cloudy which is supposed to do and I can't really tell in the bottom but it will be forming a kind of kind of a thick layer on the bottom which is often called the mother and never mind the NCAA game playing in the background and so anyway that's looking pretty good my other one hasn't been in the container for a week okay here's the other one and you can see that it is it's fermenting by all the bubbles plus I took a slotted spoon to kind of force it back down under the liquid and you can well you can't but I can smell the fermentation process it smells a little sour but that is my other apple cider vinegar which has not been there for a week so we'll just cover that back up and with that continue brewing and we'll check on it again and maybe a week or so there are different different ways of making apple cider vinegar excuse me there are different ways of making apple cider vinegar some will tell you to mix it to stir it up every day I've read some that said just to put it put the apple peels and cores and things like that add water and just let it sit so it depends on what you want to do you can follow whichever one you feel most comfortable with I added some sugar to the water that I put in there to kick-start the fermentation process but I still haven't mixed anything it's just kind of sitting there on its own so we'll see how that works out some will tell you to empty it out after a week or two and then let the rest of with the liquid then ferment for a week or so or a week some will tell you to allow the fermentation process to continue for a month at a time or maybe a couple of months if you don't use sugar at work you do you sugar some and this is kind of a hybrid of the different methods so we'll check back in this a couple more weeks thanks for watching bye whoo this is Randall the Michigan tropical gardener and I started without you yeah wasn't thinking and started without you I am going to take all the peels cores and everything else remove it from there and then return the liquid back into there as soon as I get that cleaned out some of it looked like it was getting moldy on the top which is probably why they say to stir it although some of it is just looking like that so what I will do is transfer that into there getting rid of the peels and all of that stuff and then once I collect all the liquid from these two containers then I will clean that out and return it to there and then put it back on the counter to age so it's going to be a difficult challenge to hold on to this and well I'll get my look at my folder Oh done okay now for that increase here it has been over two weeks since I've allowed this to sit on the counter and I've been following what they other people have done and so going by that this should be fine and really I don't think there's any way you can not do it right I mean now once you put the apple peels in the water nature will take its course and if you add sugar it speeds it up much faster I'm not going to give that to my worms just because I add the sugar and I don't think they need to be eating that put that in there to mean and we'll add this this batch has not been in here for two weeks but it's been pretty close you okay I think there's really two and ecwid in there I'm really not going to try to force any liquid out okay and that if you want to rinse this out not that I suppose I really makes much difference I'm not going to use soap and water but I do want to quickly runs this out all right I'm not sure if I will be able to fit all of that liquid into this container which is actually based we'll see I believe that the mouth of this container base is wide enough that I should be able to pour this in here without making too much of a mess but we'll do it over the sink anyway okay here we go - OH and guess what I poured some of it into the sink which is okay because this is actually pretty close to being right to the town I don't know if that's going to work out now I will return this to being on the top mm-hmm what will happen is that little this will end up soaking up some of that liquid so what we'll do is we'll take a mason jar and take out some of this and put it into the mixing jar which we will quickly rinse out I don't think there's any reason for it to be sterilized of course I'm sure somebody can tell me differently yeah maybe okay put this back on there that we will return this to there will be one one layer put that over top and that should be good so what I will do now is return this to where I've had it which was in a corner of the counter by the stove kind of an out-of-the-way place and we'll check on it again in two months and see how it's going so thanks for tuning in take care see you two months bye hello this is Randall the Michigan truffle gardener and this is my finished apple cider vinegar I didn't show you the final process which was basically filtering the cider vinegar through a coffee filter exciting stuff however here's what we have it looks like apple cider vinegar amazing and yeah so that's it from the beginning of the video - now this is what we have move that back so I can there we go it can take several months it depends on how it tastes and how strong you want your cider vinegar it's up to you so there you go thanks for watching take care bye", "XXtmbJciy0M": "i cider is an alcoholic drink made from fermented frozen apples or apple juice it's also known as apple iced wine and it's produced the same way as iced wine but with apples instead of grapes it's typically served with foods such as foie gras cheese fruit and dark chocolate there's a world of difference between ice cider and regular cider regular cider is made from fresh apples whereas ice cider is made from frozen apples or frozen apple juice and while cider can be a non-alcoholic beverage ice cider is always alcoholic there are two methods to making ice cider one is to leave the apples on the tree to freeze over the winter then pick them and press them the other method which we're about to see is to harvest the apples in the fall when they're ripe press them then freeze the juice the apples are always hand-picked at perfect maturity and always right off the tree an ice cider producer never uses fallen apples because they often get damaged when they hit the ground and then pick up bacteria from lying there this producer uses different varieties of apples to make several types of ice cider the one we're about to see is made from empire Spartan Cortland McIntosh and golden russet straight from the orchard the apples go onto a conveyor belt which feeds them into a multi-stage press the first part of the press crushes the apples into what's known as pumice a screw conveyor moves the pumice onto a mesh conveyor belt that transports it through five stainless steel rollers each roller applies 275 pounds of pressure progressively extracting the apple juice the juice trains down through the mesh conveyor belt to a vat below from the VAT the juice is pumped into a large container made of food safe plastic the container holds 264 gallons however they leave 13 to 26 gallons of air space to leave room for expansion when the juice freezes at the end of December they haul the containers outdoors the juice stays outside from 40 to 50 days during which time the water in it freezes leaving unfrozen concentrated juice at the bottom of the container workers measure the sugar content daily and once it reaches a certain level they pump the juice indoors and to temperature controlled stainless-steel tanks then they add yeast to kickstart fermentation the conversion of those natural sugars to alcohol every day they measure the sugar level to monitor the fermentation process when they hit their target which typically takes between 40 and 50 days the juice has transformed into ice cider with an alcohol content of 10.5 to 11% i cider is bottled just like wine the korky machine automatically pops in a cork as soon as it's sensor detects the presence of a bottle the next machine slips a plastic seal over the mouth of the bottle then heats the plastic to shrink the seal tightly around the cork finally an automated labeling machine simultaneously applies self-sticking labels to the front and back it isn't only the Apple variety that determines the flavor it's also the production method the process we've just seen called cryo concentration produces ice cider with a strong fruity flavor the other method called cryo extraction letting apples freeze on the tree then pressing them produces ice cider which tastes like baked apples", "J6mO-tPZma8": "hey everybody plant it today I'm going to show you how to back sweeten hard apple cider so let's go well at the time of this recording in the whole world for the most part is in some form of lockdown in some way or another so we're all kind of stuck at home we're still wanting something to drink an adult beverage so people have started looking to make their own at home one of the easiest don't member just make it home is hard apple cider basically we just take either apple cider which is unfiltered apple juice or just regular filtered apple juice and you just take that per minute it's one the easier for easy esteems make I will leave a link up here to my original apple cider video will literally ferment in the jug you don't even fermenter however one of the things I get feedback I get from cider when people make cider trying traditional ciders nowadays the major breweries have all kinds of crazy flavors is that in the other traditional apple cider a lot of people don't like because it's dry a lot of people are expecting just to drink apple juice with alcohol unfortunately part of the process is the yeast that we use eats up the sugar inside they need the sugar to survive so when we drink it after fermentation the sugar is gone and it's a little dry people just don't like the taste so one of the ways we improve the taste is to back sweeten and that's why I want to talk about today in the video back sweetening is just a way to add that sugar back in that was lost through fermentation now there's a few different ways of doing that some people would just take their firm in its apple cider and just where they're serving like alright we'll just pass out sugar or whatever and you add to taste instead of swinging the whole batch that sweet'n per drink either with regular table sugar honey value nectar what-have-you on a waiting time becomes almost like a cocktail at that point but that is a way to sweeten up your drink the other methods are done at the batch level one of the ways you can do it is to stop fermentation early don't let the yeast eat up all that sugar that they want the downside of that is you don't get as high as a B ABV you don't get as much alcohol we didn't let the yeast do their job completely also - if you ever plan on bottling that you don't you're not sure if the yeast will reactivate building up co2 which it first would carbonate which is not always a bad thing but too much that can lead to articl bottle bombs and get balls exploding your top blow off trust me you don't want that another method to sweeten our cider is to add more sugar we allow this to ferment but even when fermentation we think is done even when the the hydrometer doesn't show you know progression there's still most likely yeast in there yeast will work until they can't for the most part but there's billions and billions of yeast cells going on at one time some died off earlier than others some are just real hearty seed you kind of never know when that those final yeast cells stop well this myth is we just keep adding sugar after she east in there to eat it we just keep letting them eat it and it provides more alcohol and you just keep doing Easter of sugar additions after fermentation though I add all the sugar up front because you might not even start fermentation it might be just too much for the yeast to handle but after fermentation going back and any sugar not bottling it because we begin we don't know if we're going to reactivate it and build up bla co2 pressure but just continuously adding sugar until they just all those yeast cells die and luckily we would have additional sugar in there to bring about certain amount of sweetness that could take a while depending on your yeast trainer Arbor but that is an option however you're probably going to end up just having a sugar sweetness to it once you can have a little different flavor then the fourth way and the way we're going to do it in a way a lot the way I originally learned to back sweeten is we will ferment this one gallon we will let it ferment completely and then we'll crash the fermentation the best we can and then we would go back and add apple juice to it that's kind of what people are wanting anyway is kind of alcoholic apple juice in the first place so we go back and add apple juice to sweeten the flavor again hopefully after fermentation is over and we'll talk about how to avoid restarting fermentation from the point-of-view again not one you get bottle bombs or over carbonated one other alternate out there that's something I wouldn't do but you know just want to let you know it's out there it's adding non fermentable sweet or something like a stevia or armor to the finished product it won't kick off fermentation again you can get the sweetness but some people aren't early in the idea of artificial or alternative sweeteners um like I said our plan here is we're going to ferment this one gallon of apple cider I'm not going to add any additional sugars to it we're just going to firm in it we're going to use a champagne nice champagne nice generally produces the clean dry traditional apple cider and we're gonna do that we're gonna let this go for a couple of weeks then we're going to go ahead rack it off separate off from the yeast we're gonna crash what's called cold crashing or put this in the fridge and that temperature will pull the East activity drop it to the bottom then we're going to add something called potassium sorbate that there's actually use a preservative in some of these two strings that again will halt any yeast activity or the possibility firming and then we will go back then and then add our apple juice to taste creating a nice sweet hard apple cider so let me get everything prepared I want to do a hydrometer reading real quick and then we'll come back to add our yeast all right so real quick I had quick change of plans I went ahead and threw it in my one gallon glass carboy fermenter this plug I had did not fit the container of the juice came in so I just I had to go ahead and put it in the glass fermenter did a gravity reading we came out at 1.05 2 which means if we hit one point oh-hoh on our final gravity we'll get around six point eight plus on the ABV the yeast were users of champagne yeast you can use whatever kind of yeast you have available including Brady's rapid rise bread yeast regular bread use what have you it still works now the champagne yeast it is designed to honestly make champagne champagne gets into the low double digits to teens as far as ABV so it will thoroughly ferment this worked quite easily and so we'll go through that sugar so will we would end up with a dry cider that's why we're going to back sweep it we're going to let this permit for two weeks we'll come back in two weeks do a gravity reading and see if we hit that mark or if there's still some room to go if we hit our target mark in the fermentation as far as the hydrometer says it's done then we will go through the process of crashing it adding our potassium sorbate and then we'll and then we'll be able to back sweeten our cider so we'll come back in two weeks and do another hydrometer reading all right so it's been two weeks we've left her out room temperature to ferment just did a gravity reading and we came out we hit our target one point zero zero so with that we're around six point eight percent ABV which again what we're shooting for at this point most fermentation activity is done just a little left and before we add any additional sweetness we need to stop that activity so what we're going to do next is I'm going to wrap this or transfer this into another container into our secondary fermentation we're gonna leave the yeast on the bottom most of this is dead eat some of its live yeast so we're gonna separate this liquid off that Geeks now there's still yeast suspended in the liquid so what we want to do next is we're going to cold crash we're going to drop the temperature I'm going to throw this in the refrigerator after I put it into a secondary container and that the temperature is going to slow down the cell activities and those yeast cells will then drop and then we'll use after that occurs we'll use our potassium sorbate potassium sorbate is preserved if it's used in a lot of juice drinks in for Finn's yeast activity from happening or fermentation for recurring but it doesn't stop it we have to stop it first and then this is used to prevent fermentation from starting back up again which what we want to prevent because we will then eventually add more juice to the back swing so let me get this transferred we're going to cold crash this overnight and then come back to add our potassium sorbate alright so we have left our cider in the fridge overnight hopefully the cold temperature has crashed the fermentation activity all real quick I took a little sample off to the side again we're winding to back sweetness so I just wanted to give a little tasty we're at now sweetness wise not bad it is this fairly dry though [Music] yeah fit faint into the East not bad but I definitely think especially most people's palates we could probably add a little more apple juice or additional sweetness I think a lot of people would not find that approachable so we'll continue the process I'm going to go ahead now and add our potassium sorbate again it's not to stop yeast activity it's to stop it from renewing or beginning again so again that's what we looked at overnight was to stop the yeast activity and now we'll add the preservative in there you don't need to stir or mix this up anyway it is three-quarters of a teaspoon for every gallon all right work again no need to stir we're just going with that sit in there and take hold we'll come back here in about a day and again hopefully at that point you any and all east yeast activity stock will come back to bottle and when we bottle that's when we'll add in the additional juice so I'll see you guys tomorrow all right so it's the next day I went ahead and transferred the cider into my I'm going to use this mr. beer fermenter is my bottling bucket my check this morning all bubbling and stuff so we'd stop the East activity which we wanted to do now we're going to go ahead and add our juice I have one gallon in here I'm gonna add 30 ounces of juice so that's going to drop our ABV from around 6.8% down to around five point five percent so it's still plenty of alcohol it's still strong enough drink but we're gonna add a little more sweetness to it the fresh juice and then I've got my balls ready and I'll go ahead and bottle it one thing we want to do when bottling we're not going to add any additional sugar to it cuz they were not wanting to kick up fermentation also too we stopped it so there's nothing to where yeast and I know reactivates we're not gonna carbonate so no need to throw sugar into the bottles also - we are we're going to once we bottle instead of leaving it out at room temperature for a couple weeks to help carbonate we're just going to throw straight in the fridge it's gonna be ready to drink you don't want to leave the bottles out because god forbid there is some active eat left you'll reap kick off especially if you leave it at room temperature fermentation can kick back off in that's we can potentially a bottle bottom so we want to avoid that so what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to go ahead and follow this and we'll come back we'll try a little bit of our final product of the apple cider and see where we need to adjust on the sweetness levels let me come back alright so we've got our cider bottled and now it's time to try out see how we did with our back sweetening or the addition we added additional apple juice to it so let's give her a try okay yeah that then definitely helped it out actually that's quite quite drink so what we did was we took a gallon of our regular hard apple cider we made we had 30 ounces of apple juice that's when the easier ways to back sweeten if you want to you can add honey you could add sugar brown sugar molasses you can sweet and kind of you want if you wanted to mix juice maybe like a cranapple thing where you had add cranberry juice is to have additional apples you could do that just the the point of this was a lot of people a lot of times people have cider it comes out a little drier than what they're expecting they're expecting apple juice and people get turned off by that but there's a way to fix it and called back sweetening a given a most important part is stopping that fermentation because there's no it's pointless to add additional sugar if we still have fermentation if they're still active yeast in there you don't get you don't get that sweetness you're hoping for and you could potentially over carbonate and have one of these bottles blow on you which is definitely the last thing you want so that is how you backw sweeten hard apple cider well I hope you like

taste the fresh apple crisp and cider more than three decades ago this fall festival began in Mount Holly and has since grown and become a tradition most local families must attend linchpin of this whole event is the 100 plus year old cider press that is we can hear in the background chugging away it was donated to us about 15 years ago by Jen Dibble whose grandfather had it on Cape Cod before that we had a whole an old hand cranked press and this event started about thirty five years ago we had an old hand cranked press we had a stock tank on the green and people would bring their wild apples and dumped him in the stock tank and then on Columbus Day weekend we would press them and the event grew and grew and grew to now we have over 36 vendors we have music we have a photo contest we have a book sale by the library and it's pretty much all fund raiser for the Mount Holly community associations homemade soaps jewelry clothing pulled pork and more line the tents here it's a real community event the Mount Holly Community Association has like over a hundred and fifty volunteers who we'll take part in this event over the next two days we also have a roast beef dinner tonight with homemade pies and every single part of it is voluntarily you know stopped staffed by volunteers and kids have grown up here loving this event we now have like running the cider press is the second it's the second generation I get all choked up and the people who are here bending are people who have been here for a really long time and they're mostly community members this very few of them come from outside of Mount Holly so I think it's it's just a real community event and it's a chance to show off our town [Music]", "hdDGKzQ8U7c": "hi welcome back to the Apple podcast I'm your host Jonathan Appleseed to my right we have grandfather smith today is our Thanksgiving special where we'll be reviewing apple pie apple cider and in the kitchen segment grandfather Smith will be showing us his family's version of a cornucopia I hope you enjoy so first off we have a apple pie which I procured from a well-known pie making establishment home by the name of Walter Martin I actually spent my entire life savings on this pie Wow I'm looking forward to it oh hey it's I hope it's massive get ready it's certainly what's delicious that it does do you want to do shape trend density I'm sure you can start off shape a little malformed but it happens to the best of pies I can't fault it for that yeah shine yet and practically non-existent shine though I will give it bonus points for its tin foil dish that's a nice addition density would you like to have it's uh pretty it's pretty light not very doesn't seem very dense I agree I think maybe if it had lived up to my expectations I would have been a little more enthused would you like to get to the cut yeah let's do it [Music] you as with any good pie you first have to test for its aroma so will waft its scent smells like an apple pie yeah I am impressed by that aspect of it grandfather smith bring hither thine fork and sup with me nonexistent crunch mm-hmm it tastes like your average apple pie um what'd you expect since it's from such a fine establishment do you happen to know what apples they used in this I don't know let me check so it looks like the ingredients are water apples I thought it tasted potassium sorbate oh I think I got into that too yeah but um it doesn't say what kind of apples that just said apples oh that's a shame I was impressed by this tiny pie um how many of course out of five would you give this hmm I'm gonna go with a three Wow just cuz I also don't know what kind of apples are in there so it's hard to judge and like I said it was just like a taste like your average apple pie so I'm probably gonna give it and debatably harsh - oh that's a shame I was impressed by this tiny pie because I was so underwhelmed by its presence on my plate but I paranoia it was a fair apple pie yeah it was good it was definitely worth my life savings and I guess we'll go on to the apple cider next up we have mathematics organic Honey Crisp apple cider and as our longtime viewers know I'm certainly partial to a Honey Crisp we're going to shape shine and density shape a bit bulbous I would say yeah almost as much as my pink now unto shine pretty nice shine considering the glass bottle so yeah points for that definitely and then density you want to take a half yeah as our longtime viewers if they remember the apple juice episode I'd say this is about thousand and three kilograms per meters cubed Oh Warren's density yeah I guess we'll get on to the Portland I think yeah it's pretty good how many of course out of five give that um I'll be like probably even before yeah I was thinking forest it was pretty solid yeah pretty good apple juice herb cider and then I guess we'll go on to the kitchen segment yeah so a Smith family tradition that we do during Thanksgiving is putting a cornucopia in the center of our dinner table and I'm gonna show you guys how to make that cornucopia today so first off you just take your cornucopia basket right here lay it on the side then you take a few apples you just have laying around your house says every good family does and you just kind of place them inside stacking them different patterns on top of each other all around so it's nice and full maybe a couple sticking out the front of it so they're not rolling all over the place like that and there you have it your smith family cornucopia thanks for joining us and have a good Thanksgiving grandfather smith what are you thankful for this Thanksgiving season I don't know well I'm thankful for the bountiful apple harvest that we've had this year yes",

season [Music] hey guys welcome back right here one of my favorite times of the year it's Christmastime and one of the staple drinks I like to make is just a well it's actually at the whole bottle mixture of it's an apple pie infused bourbon and I make this every year try to make about every year and I won't bring you along this time and show you how it's done let's get busy thank you guys this is just a small to a medium this is a Golden Delicious apple I can't stress this enough I've tried the Granny Smith but I'll tell you what Golden Delicious makes this a bit much better recipe start chopping this up get rid of that core we're just gonna cut this down into chunks hey guys we got a quart size mason jar we're gonna put everything in here I guess for that we're going to add just about quarter teaspoon or so of ground nutmeg I'm going in with not one but two cinnamon sticks very simple recipe gasps I'll take a few days my bourbon of choice here is just some jim beam black got a whole fifth of it gonna put the whole thing in or as much as it will hold [Music] will it hold it oh not all of it it's okay I'm pretty sure what take care of the rest of that here just a bit well seal her up alright guys that's about all there is to that I'm gonna give this a good little shake or what not really shake but you see what I'm doing there it's about all we're doing we're gonna put this up on the shelf for four days and maybe once a day I'll come in and give her a little toss like that so other than that I will see you in four days and we'll finish this thing off alright guys four days up let's get this back into here hey guys look there's some cheesecloth go straight back in the same bye provide metal spillin [Music] smells delicious [Music] the cheese calls just to keep that some of the particles [Music] so you did lose a little bit to absorption into the apples I know what you're thinking bite into the Apple trust me you do what you want I've done it before I do it again me personally I just discard the Apple so that to me it's it I've tried one in the past and it just don't taste that good okay one thing I failed to add on camera but I did go back before I tasted it that was just a quarter cup of simple syrup I yeah kind of embarrassed I fail to put that on camera but egg it's in there guys and it will be in the ingredients listed below all right the moment of truth do this ago I guess here it is apple pie refused bourbon let's give this thing a taste that is uh Wow as always I want to do this about once a year folks generally around Christmastime I know you've probably seen the apple-pie moon shines or the Apple path used by kids a lot of people do guys give us a shot with bourbon it's awesome and I tell you what I'm gonna be enjoying this

don't cost you think though so hey see you next time folks god bless you you have a Merry Christmas you", "5nIT87eWCSU": "best fight forever hi everyone it's chef Alicia with best bites forever calm and today we will be making hot apple cider I'm going to start off with 12 apples and the first thing that I'm gonna do is peel those stickers off because you definitely don't want to cook the stickers along with your apples then I'm gonna go ahead and wash all 12 of those apples and bring them back over here to my cutting board when they're nice and drained and I'm going to cut them into quarters once I get them cut into quarters I'm going to remove the core and the easiest way to do that is how I'm showing you here you simply lay that quarter onto the cutting board and then use your knife at a slight angle and cut right into your Apple and a little bit of an angle and it takes that core off leaves the core on your knife leaves the rest of the Apple nice and clean and that's the part that you want to use so we're gonna do 12 apples this way and put them into a big stockpot the stock pot I have is 8 quarts now on to my cardamom these are cardamom pods I have three of them and I just crack them when I put them in there I don't open them all the way I just crack them I have no cardamom see what's in there there are little black seeds inside which you can ground down into a powder but we're not doing that today we're just going to add those right into the pot the next thing I've added is three cinnamon sticks I know it looks like more but it's not so don't add more three cinnamon sticks three whole cloves and then I'm also going to grate some fresh nutmeg into there which is very very delicious and there's my pretty fresh nutmeg you can see and what I used was a micro planer if you don't have one you may want to invest in one because they're awesome to use in the kitchen and then what I'm adding here is a half a cup of honey that's what I'm gonna use for sweetener you're welcome to use sugar if you want or agave but I like the honey the next thing that you need to do which is very important is see how high your apples come up and your pan because you want to add about four extra inches of water over top of them oh forgot my allspice that was five whole allspice okay so as you can see I've added my water in and again apples float so that's why I said to make sure that you check how high your apples came up and your pan because you want to have about four extra inches maybe three I don't know how BIG's your pot but let's say three the next thing we're gonna do is boil those apples for one hour and here I'm just adding in the zest of one orange and I would have actually added this in at the beginning but I didn't have an orange so I had to wait for my husband to get it home tonight and bring me home in orange so now I have added in the zest from my one orange which again mine has been boiling for one hour you can see that my apples are looking pretty delicious here and they're starting to cook down let me show you one of these little guys here you can see this guy right here see he's almost falling apart and too just so you know I've came back and I've stirred my apples maybe every twenty to thirty minutes and kind of use my spoon to mush them up against the side of the pan just to help him out a little once your apples have boiled for your one hour go ahead and put a lid on them and let them simmer for two more hours when they're done simmering you're gonna have this beautiful pulpy liquid it should look just like this if you've been gnashing your apples as you go and you've been doing everything that I said you should have something smelling wonderful your house should smell just like fall and so should your neighborhood which is pretty awesome for the neighbors isn't it and moving right along here what I have set up is my colander just my regular old colander that I used to drain noodles with and I've set it into my biggest mixing bowl that I have it just happens to fit right down in there perfectly and I'm just dumping all of that liquid right on top now I personally really really like my apple cider to be like pulpy and thick and delicious but if you don't like that you have two options here you can either line your colander with some cheesecloth and go ahead and strain it the same way see here my husband actually helped me lift that up and drain it a little or you can use a fine mesh but if you don't have the fine mesh the cheesecloth colander option is a really nice way to go the next thing you got to do is enjoy some of that delicious apple cider so here I am just putting some of mine into a cup add a pretty little cinnamon stick for some garnish and there it is all finished it's as easy as that for this recipe and some of the other ones that I have please join me on my website it's best bites forever.com thank you for joining me and happy cooking everyone back bite for answer dot-com", "Em7u2BeQGP8": "okay here i am in my own kitchen filming myself which is weird my name is andrew you might recognize me from the show worth it eating foods at different price points with my pals steven and adam or from the show eating your feed where adam the same adam challenges me to recreate foods from the internet and today i'm going to be doing a little bit of both today i'm going to be recreating one of my favorite dishes from worth it vinegar pie wait you guys never ate vinegar pie some of you savvy or viewers might say in our pie episode at our second location underbelly we're mainly eating this delicious carrot cake hand pie the restaurant actually had a few other pies on the menu that they wanted us to try this is the one that adam is giddily poking at with his fork super delicious and explores a thing that i'm really obsessed with which is the fundamentals of why something tastes good vinegar pie holy doesn't sound like it should taste good and yet this version was extremely delicious to get a little more background on this dish i'm going to be speaking with victoria dearman from underbelly about how it's made where it came from and how how does it taste good and why ah i want to see my big frying pan hey victoria thanks for chatting with me hey yeah thanks andrew good to see you again everybody that i brought up this recipe to is like what kind of pie a what pie nine years of my life hearing a what type yeah every person that came in thunderbelly there were two things their server told them to get korean goat and dumpling and it was the vinegar pot and there's a lot of people that are like man this thing is so weird just so good but so good yeah well i'll actually show you where i got the inspiration for it it's called hillbilly cooking jessica shepard got from maybe a garage sale he just writes yep and yes the recipe itself is up to translation i guess a nubbin of butter i made it at first with straight distilled vinegar oh interesting not good so the whole point of it is it's a pie that you can make when citrus is an infuser so i use steamed sugarcane vinegar and korean double strength apple vinegar are you willing to share more of the recipe with me for me to recreate it or is it more of a secret it's actually in chris's book that came out honestly confession it was probably my favorite pie i ate in the entire video not not about that confession thanks for chatting and i'll let you know how it goes send me a picture can't wait to see it all right bye so it's another day i've got the exact korean apple vinegar i wasn't able to get that second vinegar but i was following the underbelly recipe from their cookbook that used entirely just apple cider vinegar and since i'm exploring taste why not do a side-by-side taste test with my american apple cider vinegar is that weird maybe i regret this decision just just the smallest of tastes [Music] yeah very vinegary also incredibly appley by comparison this is bragg's much more like fermenty kombucha like while this one tastes like an apple sour candy that's great but i have the exact vinegar i need it's on to make the crust so in the underbelly book it recommends using a hand mixer i don't have a hand mixer but i do have a stand mixer as you can see i don't have adam here follow me along so i'm moving the camera i didn't realize how annoying that would be i'm going to put it in some plastic wrap and leave it in the fridge it's been 30 minutes the dough is chill it's time to put it in my tart pan i'm gonna grab some flour for my surface that is a uh a soft blob this feels incredibly fragile and now i'm going to do the thing that i've only watched other people ever do to try gently rolling this up this is i can already tell this is a huge mistake and then unrolling it my dough is not a circle so i'm filling in the cracks and crevices this looks like crap i know i know what you're saying you're not wrong next i have parchment into which i will pour old beans to weigh down the crust i'm now going to put this in the oven for 15 minutes okay it's been about 15 minutes time to check on the pie and remove the beans it doesn't look done but it doesn't look terrible that could turn into a pie 10 more minutes it's been 10 minutes uh i i don't i don't know this looks like it doesn't want to get any darker so i'm calling it there the next step is to make the filling and that's when the vinegar comes into play i am not a very well seasoned baker what are the things i'm gonna mess up so that's the best part about this pie meaning the words every time you make it is totally different okay so the biggest thing you want to watch out for is that it is a corn starch space so you do have to boil it like you gotta go for three ish minutes and what happens if you don't do that it'll be soup oh interesting well maybe i'll invent vinegar soup if things don't go well so starting off four eggs two cups of sugar which i mean i guess desserts just have a lot of sugar but i am i don't know a little surprise whisking this together until there are no more clumps the magic ingredient part one quarter cup two cups of water yeah this pan is definitely not large enough oh well lemon juice salt corn starch okay so now bring this to a boil whisking constantly not realize how stressful baking was i think this needs to like achieve the boil because that's what the instructions say but it also says whisk constantly i mean this is medium heat god this is the most stressful part of anything it's like the do nothing like i'm used to failing on eating your feet but failing is a lot less funny when you're by yourself are bubbles coming up yeah we got like a slow burble now oh it is quite thick now yeah it's like it's a pot of pudding now i see some dark bits so now i'm scared that it's burning on the bottoms but victoria said boil the crap out of it jesus it's only been one minute i can't do this for three minutes the smell oh you know the smell is not pleasant currently okay we're up to two minutes we're almost there this is the this is the stress we're right at three minutes i've got my butter here i have this vanilla paste okay it seems to be all incorporated it's my cooled tart here we go ready i have a little bit of excess here because i'm actually [Music] oh oh the last instruction takes some plastic wrap directly onto the surface so that it doesn't form a skin because this has to go in the refrigerator now overnight forgot that there was a uh separated bottom on the bottom of this one more quick wrap i think i'm going to call that a pie that's ready for the fridge so here we are pie has been in the oven uh not the oven the pie has been in the refrigerator overnight it looks like a pie but there's one more element that i want to recreate the caramel brittle this is not in the underbelly cookbook but this is the way that i had it at the restaurant so here we go one cup of sugar a quarter cup of water and now i'm turning it on like medium i don't know i've never done this before i think you're not supposed to stir it but i want to stir it because i can see where the sugar is it's kind of pushed away from the bubbles okay it's now a nice even bubbleage bubbles are trippy like a miyazaki movie where every bubble is a little creature trying to eat the air suddenly smelling very caramelly i'm at around 3 okay that goes off and now i'm gonna pour this on here a little bit of salt did i just make caramel that is freaking okay it seems firm i knew i should have done a better job getting those bubbles out there has got to be some baker's trick to get plastic wrap to be perfectly smooth on the surface still pretty vinegary in smell yeah look at that thing it's a freaking pie i'm dying to know how this tastes ooh uh oh i'm scared it feels very loose god hell yeah is this why they say easy as pie i the crust for sure look it's got that that that wobble the caramel this is a big sheet of something here it's definitely screwed up in some way that has this like cloudiness over it hurts my teeth so looking at our video the little shards of brittle are just cascading off the side should i just stab a little piece in this is my pie i think it's time to try it [Music] doesn't taste terrible it really does it does not taste the way that it smells i i don't know what to call the taste is this as good as the restaurant's version it's not no the crust is too thick i clearly screwed up the caramel it doesn't taste like a weird wacky thing it's just got like enough butter from the crust mellowness from this vanilla a sourness that is kind of familiar but it's still curious and interesting it's a pretty good pie i think the only thing i want to do now is see if adam wants a slice oh it smells like vinegar [Music] oh yeah [Music] you", "ztRWgqZjpwc": "[Music] sup guys my name is Courtney button and this is what's written today I'm going to be showing you guys how to make a delicious apple pie latte now this time of year everyone's all about PSLs but I wanted to change it up a little bit and I have zero regrets girl because this is so delicious I know I say that literally about every recipe I do and I am Telling You guys there is nothing more warming and comforting than having a cup of this in your hands when it is freezing cold outside then without further ado let's get started alright so the first step is making sure that you have some really good fresh hot really strong coffee you can choose any kind of coffee that you want I personally like to use the instant Starbucks one because I don't have a coffee maker I'm not a coffee person so that just proves that this recipe is amazing so go ahead and throw that in a mug and we're gonna work on making the apple flavored cream you want a small saucepan over medium heat I'm going to add my half-and-half now by all means if you want to use milk go for it but I personally believe that this is the best way to have it and to that I'm going to be adding a few tablespoons of apple butter now I made this homemade I actually filmed the recipe so if you haven't seen it yet make sure you go and check it out it is so delicious but if you don't want to make it at home you can by all means get it at the store it's not gonna be as good I can promise you that but it's still gonna be delicious and I'm also going to add a little bit of pumpkin spice now you can use just plain cinnamon if you want and then to that I'm also gonna add some granulated sugar you can use as much or as little as you would like and then just give that all good whisk together now we're not looking to boil this we're not looking to simmer this you want to be really careful you just want to bring it up to temperature so it's nice and hot if you start to simmer or boil it there is a chance that it could curdle the milk and that would just be a hot mess and you'll have to start all over again which nobody wants that so just bring it up until it's nice and warm and then you can go ahead and add that to your hot coffee oh that looks good and then I like to add just a little bit of vanilla extract tap it off with some cream cheese I mean oh my goodness cream cheese whipped cream dust on a little bit more cinnamon or pumpkin spice and if you really feeling bad to the bone then you better drizzle on that caramel sauce you made it this far you might as well complete it I had a bowl there you have it I'm no barista but I can tell you right now that this is so stinking good you have your very own apple pie latte mmm really hot it's really good this is so good you guys I'm telling you gotta make it and the more apple butter that you use the more of an apple pie flavor you're gonna get you can't go wrong if you guys want to recreate this recipe just look below in the description box I'll have all the measurements as well as the written instructions and if you did like this video don't pick it up smack that like button and as always thank you guys so much for hanging out with me and we'll see you next time yes pinkies out if you wanna be fancy hold your pinky up like this [Music]", "hUz4IbKolp8": "[Music]", "hPFhq16ZZ-I": "tonight a nation community is celebrating the apple harvest Angela Kelly joins us live with more on a free event for the public eye ang yeah hey guys well we're joining you live from the cultural heritage site which is just a just right on the Green Bay Hobart line out here on the Oneida Indian Reservation and there's going to be a ton of activities this Saturday ten a.m. to four p.m. one of them is learning how to make apple cider the old fashioned way so I have with me Eliza scan adore so Eliza let's get this machine going here and you tell everyone how it works okay so you want to get the wheel going so that you get momentum up and then you're gonna put the apples in there and if you can see in there if you slow down a bit there's teeth in there and so that's what shreds up the apples and then the apples go down into a bucket here and collect and then um how the press starts to actually work is there's a wooden plate in the bucket and you just squeeze it down okay and then that will squeeze the the apple juice right into the strain it and then go into the bucket while you're working on getting that pressed why don't you talk about some of the other activities going on here at the cultural heritage site well um we're also going to have a big apple pie contest on the grand prize is two hundred dollars and then there's another category which is anything goes which any type of apple dessert that the main ingredient is Apple yeah and then there's also going to be a farmers market um there's going to be chewy the horse and a trick mule and barrel riding racing and then each of the homes on South Park Avenue are going to be open for tours hmm over here it goes yeah there does look at here we got this has to be and of course the kids can do this the cider press yep this has to be not only fun but educational for them of course because nowadays you know they can just reach into the fridge and grab um apple cider and back then no you there's a lot of work that went into it this is absolutely awesome and take it you can always buy some cider but can we maybe try some of this we got some glasses here I'm going to actually just reach under and see if I can get some here I'm so excited this is my first apple cider of the season Oh awesome okay so I'll just put that right back underneath there oh my goodness there is nothing better than that this is awesome oh so much fun you have to come check out the Oneida big apple fest this saturday at the cultural heritage site and the apple orchard which is just about a mile down the road so we've got all the information on our website cheers I'm going to finish this off yums good thanks Ange", "xcAMkWxsFXQ": "[Music] hey you guys it's carolyn from homesteading family and today i am gonna show you a super simple treat that you guys are gonna want on every single holiday table you have from here on out and it is a probiotic non-alcoholic sparkling cider this tastes so incredibly good and when you see how easy this is to make you are going to wonder why you haven't been doing this for years it's delicious and the kids are gonna love it okay so today we are going to start with just under a gallon of fresh pressed apple cider now you know if you have your own trees look around and see in your area if you can get your own apples pressed into cider because it is such an amazing way to go if you don't have access to a fresh cider you could certainly use some cider that you get maybe you from the farmers market or you could go to the grocery store and just get any old juice now let's talk about cider versus juice for just a second because in the United States we tend to use that term exchangeable cider and juice kind of mean the same thing sometimes you'll see the term sweet cider but outside the United States often it often the term cider refers to the alcoholic version of cider or hard cider in this case we are talking about a sweet cider or a juice so this is just a fresh pressed apple juice now you could use just any old brand from the store that you can find that's just fine you can use other flavors of juice too it doesn't just have to be apple you could use a cranberry mixture you could use pear you could use a cherry raspberry you could use just about anything that you want to come up with and it would be delicious and a mixture of the two okay but what you really do want now this goes very counter intuitive and it goes against what I usually tell you what you really want for this is a plastic container and the reason for that is because this is going to create a lot of carbonation really really quickly and those even those glass swing top bottles you're likely to have an explosion this really helps having a plastic container helps you to feel how full it is and I'll grab one that I've already gotten done in a second you'll see exactly what I mean because this works that really quickly now you are going to need two special things one is starter liquid from another firm it now this happens to be the juice that was left over from my cran fermented cranberry sauce that I make for most holidays it's delicious and salty and tangy and really good and I have a video out on that if you want to see that but you need something it can be a sauerkraut juice I know it doesn't sound good to put sauerkraut juice in your sweet cider but you're only gonna put a little bit of it on in you're not going to notice the flavor change at all believe me I've done it many many times with the sauerkraut juice if you do not have an active ferment or the juice from an active ferment around you can go to the grocery store get yourself a plain yogurt that is not a Greek yogurt make sure there's no flavouring in it and you can strain off the clear liquid that is a way and you can use that as your starter so you're going to need that and then you're also going to need a warmish spot in your house you're looking for something from the high 70s up to about the low 90s a spot like that is going to be ideal now this will work without that if you just have normal room temperatures it will work it will just work a little more slowly depending on what you need that could be a good thing or a bad thing now we're gonna take about two tablespoons of our starter culture here and we're just going to pour this in now you can see that I pour it off just a little bit that way there's some headspace here believe it you're gonna need that so we're gonna go for about two tablespoons of starter liquid in there now you can see I do measure I'm not being super exact if you really are in a hurry let's say you need this today you wake up it's morning and you go oh I really want to try some of that sparkling cider you can go ahead and double that and put a quarter cup in there you can even put more you just are really gonna have to watch it because it's gonna go fast okay all I do at this point I put the lid back on make sure it's airtight because you don't want to lose that carbonation and I'm gonna set this in that warm spot that could be above a refrigerator it could be sitting near a heater it could be anyplace that just stays generally pretty warm at about the 12 hour mark you are going to want to really start keeping your eye on it because it may start really swelling look at this one okay I went ahead and started that this one a few hours ago now quite a few hours ago probably about eight hours ago and I went ahead and they used that quarter cup just so I could have it done in time to film with you guys and I kept it in a nice really warm spot right around 90s right next to my wood stove and do you see I don't know if you can see how firm this is but when it gets to rock solid you're ready now listen for this because I want you to hear how much fermentation how much carbonation is built up could you hear that so once it gets to that rock solid you want to one burp it by opening it and with this plastic I will often go ahead and squeeze it down a little just to get myself a little more time and put that lid on and then get it in the refrigerator to chill don't worry it will build back up carbonation and this just makes the most delicious sparkling cider and there's a huge benefit and that it is probiotic because we added that bacteria starter that means not only is it going to be sparkly and fizzy and sweet and delicious but it's also gonna help you digest that big Christmas and Thanksgiving meal whatever it is okay I want you to see how amazing this is it is so sparkly and fizzy let's see if I can get this right up to the camera so you can see what's going on and this is so delicious it's a great way to go no um I want to talk for just a second about why this is different than making a hard cider and why you can't just leave this out on the counter you can take your raw apple juice and just leave it out on the counter and it will start to ferment and it will start to get fizzy you will get some some carbonation build-up the challenges with that is that that is a yeast that is fermenting it then and it is turning into a hard alcohol not necessarily a bad thing but you don't have quite the same probiotic power once you have a yeast from it and it will turn alcoholic it is very simple to leave a Rogers out and end up with an alcoholic juice usually for our holiday table we are looking for something that is less fermented less alcoholic and more friendly for the kids and maybe the adults who aren't interested in the other alcoholic beverages so this is a great way to go enjoy you guys you can see how completely simple that was just make sure you keep an eye on it so it doesn't explode because cleaning up that kind of mess is not simple but it is delicious enjoy have a wonderful holiday oh and I have a download for you in the description section here that has our families but you've read holiday recipes and this one is in there for you take care of you guys is so good [Music] you", "4sblxMhTWOg": "this is what we make now is a Captain Morgan hot apple cider the reason why I'm doing cocktail like this is very very simple as two ingredients Captain Morgan spiced rum and hot apple cider the reason before that is anybody can make this at home at any skill level as long as you have those two ingredients and make sure when you do keep the apple cider if you don't do it too hot and precook that don't mix them together and then heat it off because you're gonna pick up the alcohol sorry all you need for this one is an ounce and a half of Captain Morgan spiced rum hot apple cider and the mo makes a difference then we sit a couple monk I like to say this on top like this get a little up knocking forward to is your balls and where does one get a mug like that internet antique stores", "7uV0ppV32xA": "welcome back everybody I'm Brad I'm Jessica and today we have a beer from outside ales this is called granny's apple pie ayo with cider milk sugar and spices added like warm apple pie it's this yeah and um the ABV and I views are not on the label I do not see it on their site the only place I could find anything was on untapped and that the abv is 5.5 okay so that's what I'm going with I'm hoping that this is a nice fall beer um we really like outside ales and so I don't it was later and spices might be delicious so tan had not very big I have good head there um medium little to medium bubbles I would say yep if it's kind of cloudy a caramel color kind of cloudy um I am getting a couple bubble streams coming up I just wanted to smell it obviously smell it smells good it smells I smell cinnamon yeah cinnamon it almost maybe touch us nutmeg is I think what I'm smelling but cinnamon it almost smells like a batch of beer brewing oh that's okay let's try for a taste I don't know if I would like in that well yeah okay sorry i was i was thinking no but now as I'm tasting at that tastes like yeah buh-bye you're not you are tasting the cider apples I'm tasting apples and you're not you're not getting that Apple taste out of or that Apple smell no no it smells like cinnamon I think just not and there's not an apple sweet apples but the taste is I think that tastes like an amplifier yeah yeah you're getting um the apples the cinnamon in there which is really good I think interesting taste I don't know maybe this would be better like warm hmm I'm like warm apple pie yeah they're a bit I think that I will not drink the rest of mine and let it sit for 10 minutes and let it go to room temperature in the apples it's not a cider apple no it's like a baked apple yeah well and like the the one we did maple was a blueberry maple as it warmed then I really could taste the blueberry maple the pancake so I'm gonna try that I'm gonna I don't think it's bad cold I'm just good fall beer I mean it's what I wanted to try for the fall um it's not bad it's it's an interesting flavor yeah for tonight I don't think there's that much cinnamon coming through in the taste as much as in the nose hmm that's good what would you give it out of 5 probably like four I don't think it's I don't think it's perfect I think it set is what it says it is but I don't I'm not like oh this is so good you know what I would have liked to have a little bit crust flavor in there have to be thinking about it yeah um but but the idea of apple pie apple with cinnamon this this is what it is I just think that I'm odd and into the sweeter beers right and i'm not sure that i could even get through a full one of these to be honest with you it's just it's not i would consider this a dessert beer that's if that's such a thing um you know and this would go perfect with donuts uh you know it would it would go well with you know fall themed things mm-hmm there you have it yeah I think so I would probably have to get a little for also good that's the way to go have you guys had this beer if so leave a comment down below tell us what you guys thought about it and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't and until next time I'm Brad I'm Jessica happy brewing", "EzVQnxho5Ww": "[Music] oh my gosh there is nothing more comforting than warm apple pie who needs ice cream [Applause] hey y'all today we are baking and we're making america's favorite pie the apple pie but this isn't your traditional apple pie no no no this is an apple slab pie it's going to be a big pie and it's so easy to make so pull out your most beautiful apples and you are going to charm anyone who eats a slice of your apple slap pie can't wait to make it there's just a few ingredients in this apple slab pie and it's really easy to make first thing we're going to do is zest some of this lemon because nothing's better than lemon zest in a pie especially this apple pie so just take your lemon your zester and just get that oh golly the aroma's already it's like intoxicating first thing is your lemon zest this is gold now let's juice this lemon so this is the prep work for your slab pie we've got the lemon zested and now we're just going to get the juice and put it in the bowl and the reason we're using a lemon with these apple slices is it keeps the apples from turning brown so you want to be sure to toss them in this fresh lemon juice it's going to be delicious [Music] and it's going to give that little spritz of citrus that always makes something taste even fresher now we're going to take these apples these nice juicy crisp sweet apples and we're gonna slice them [Music] now we want to get as thin as slices as we can so we just use a really sharp little paring knife so once you get one apple done just toss them in the lemon juice your next apple [Music] beautiful apples all done we're going to use two refrigerated pie crusts these are about room temperature i'm going to roll them out [Music] there now we are just going to kind of pinch this together to make it into more of a rectangle shape you could take a a pizza cutter and square it up but i don't want to waste any of the dough so if you want to square it up fine but if you don't want to no problem just use your fingers it's like play-doh what's an apple pie without cinnamon we are going to mix it in our butter melted butter recipe is going to be at and alleyskitchen.com mix this up and get a lovely aroma of cinnamon in this butter oh my goodness this smells so good we're going to need a pastry brush and we're going to use about oh three quarters of it and we're going to save the rest for the next step [Music] there we go oh you know it's going to be good i mean cinnamon and butter now we're going to get some sugar and just going to put the sugar on the bottom okay so this is going to be from the bottom up and the top down with all the goodness apples and you can arrange them any way you want to but we're going to start leaving about a half to three quarters or even one inch around the perimeter and i'm going to make three rows [Music] okay here we go ready for the next step remember the lemon zest wow this is when it goes off just going to give a little extra pop of citrus and that leftover cinnamon butter here we go just a drizzle next the sugar and we're going to add some cornstarch to it this will kind of keep the apples and all the juices that come from the baking all together so we're just going to mix this up [Music] now here's the thing about the apples you can just kind of scoot them in as i said you want a border around the edges that allows you to flip the dough up and make the pie complete the slab knife so i've got probably an inch maybe an inch and a half so the ends are a little a little more but that's okay so we're just going to flip these up and then we just kind of crimp and pinch to bring it all together [Music] okay we've got an egg here we're going to just take a pastry brush and coat the exposed dough this is going to give it a golden brown look it makes it really pretty [Music] and if you see little holes just take your fingers and pinch them once you get that egg white on now just a little bit of sugar [Music] around the perimeter this is totally optional my husband looks spicy and sweet so i'm going to take a few little jalapeno slices and put them right on the end here for his slices and this is a washed and clean jalapeno so i'm just going to slice it really thin [Music] and these become the spicy jalapeno apple slab pie there we go ready to go in the oven look at this slab pie it's absolutely divine those apples have cooked down we're going to let this cool and then we're going to slice it and you see all this good juice that's come out those are crunchies they're really good too and check the jalapenos perfect [Music] now this is one beautiful apple slab pie if it sticks just because the juices ooze out as it bakes just take a spatula and just kind of go in under it and loosen it to cut it we're going to use a pizza cutter so oh the crust is still warm i love to eat this apple slab pie warm and i'm going to take a piece with the jalapenos oh my gosh listen to the crunch [Music] and i love the corners just like uh whether it's brownies or a piece of apple slab pie recipes at allieskitchen.com you can put ice cream whipped cream whatever you want on it or you can just eat it like

beginning of America ice distilled from apple cider there was no need for infrastructure or elaborate equipment which made it the perfect solution for these times the term jacked-up comes directly from Applejack with ice distilling process jacks up the alcohol content resulting in apple brandy with an alcohol content anywhere between 20 and 50 percent today with the exception of a handful of craft distillers Applejack is made with a blend of apple cider and commercial alcohol to start pour your cider into suitable food grade bottles this side a is presently about 7% ABV place your bottles in the freezer overnight remember not to tighten the bottle cap as the bottle may burst in the freezer once frozen you'll have a bottle of golden ice remove the bottle cap and invert the bottle in a measuring jug you'll notice almost immediately some of the liquid will drain from the bottle this is the alcohol and the syrupy flavor component of the apple cider that does not freeze along with the water content I'm going to Jack my alcohol content up to around 21% and to achieve this I will collect one-third of the original volume of liquid in other words this one liter bottle will yield 330 milliliters of Jack at around 21 ABV as the run off parts of the neck of the bottle it will cause an air block so you need to lift the bottle every few minutes to allow the runoff to escape into the jug if you must the introduction video about arse distilling you can click the on-screen link this will give you a full explanation of the alcohol calculations and process now I've collected 330 moles of runoff this runoff is the Applejack you will notice the ice on the bottle is now very pale as almost all of the alcohol flavor component and color components have drained notice how beautifully clear the result is with concentrated color and flavor a taste test will reveal the quite obviously stronger alcohol content thanks for joining us today please subscribe to our Channel and we'll see you again tomorrow", "b9E_hrrtO08": "hello today we're having an apple fest at our house and I'm making apple pie sangria so I wanted to show you how to make it it's pretty yummy to make your apple pie sangria you're going to need a pitcher apple cider caramel vodka two to three apples some peanut curry geo and measuring cups the first thing you're going to do is take an apple cutter and cut your apples into small pieces once your apples are cut up you can put them in a little bowl of lemon juice and it will help the colors stay better instead of them turning all brown and then once you've done that you just put it into your pitcher now that my apples are all chopped up and into the pitcher i'm going to add 6 cups of apple cider the next step is to add 3 cups of peanut Grigio whoopsie i made a mess the last but very not least is to add 1 cup of caramel vodka and then just mix it all together you can put it in the fridge for a couple hours to let everything combined and just know that the apple cider um will kind of a separate and go to the bottom of the container so just give it a nice mix before you serve it and enjoy", "fZffz-MPbas": "hello everybody welcome to the fourth episode of bernie baker bakes so i made apple pie and i went back to mel's kitchen cafe dot com and found her blue ribbon apple pie recipe and also the perfect pie crust recipe and i also i couldn't help myself two brothers little apple cider just to add a little extra i started with the apples because i didn't want to start with the crust because the crust scared me two and a half pounds of granny smith's and two and a half pounds of kanzi apples this is about 1.13 kilograms of each one tart apple and one sort of sweeter apple okay so i've got my granny smith apples and my kanzi apples and i'm going to use my apple peeler core slicer thing found out about these when skye was back in kinder the kinder teachers would use these on their apples that's totally not even bloody hell what now i noticed the apples started to go brown pretty quickly so i thought why not marinate them in little apple cider by two brothers of course so this is the second well how do you like them apples then i tossed the apples with caster sugar brown sugar lemon zest salt and cinnamon i need a half cup sugar i'm going to try this spoon and scoop method yeah that's a lot better next i need a quarter cup of packed light brown sugar no so spilled and need a half teaspoon of fresh grated lemon zest overflowing a half teaspoon of fresh then we need a quarter teaspoon of salt then we need 1 8 of a teaspoon of cinnamon remember what happened last time when i tried to put the spoon in the cinnamon the smallest one of that is a quarter teaspoon so i'm gonna try that hopefully it won't get jammed in there what's a little extra cinnamon among friends i'm gonna stir this together first now that that's all nicely mixed together i'm gonna add that to my apples which are already in my big it's in my big large pot or dutch oven you just want to toss that around cutting the apples okay that's nicely combined so i'm gonna bring that over to the stove and cook over medium heat just for a little bit yep so i cooked the apples just to get them tender when poked with a fork righty-o i'm at the oven and i'm gonna turn it on to medium heat cook over medium heat stirring frequently until the apples are tender when poked with a fork but not mushy about 10 to 12 minutes don't overcook in this step the apples will finish cooking and softening up in the oven [Music] i don't know about you but that looks like enough apples for about three pies it's been about 10 minutes and the apples are tender after cooking the apples then i just transferred them to a large baking pan and let them cool for at least 30 minutes i don't think that's enough for three pies once the apples were cooled i drained them i've drained the apples and reserved the juice from the apples and put a quarter cup of that a little bowl with two teaspoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice then i thought i might as well get started on the crust i really thought i was going to wait until tomorrow to start the pie crust because it fills me with dread and anxiety [Music] [Applause] me [Music] i lightly whisked yep i brought out the whisk again i literally whisked lightly whisked three cups of plain flour with a half teaspoon of salt four teaspoons of caster sugar right i just whisked that first yeah i know then 20 tablespoons or 10 ounces or 285 grams thereabouts of butter so this is frozen butter and i used the large holes of a grater and i grated that i'm sorry i grated that butter into the flour mixture holy cannolis that takes commitment then with a fork i should have used a metal fork straight away but for some reason i grabbed this wooden like takeaway fork that i had in the drawer i don't know i don't know why all right now we're gonna toss the butter and flour mixture with a fork just until it's coated with the flour the butter until the butter is coated with the flour then we add a cup of sour cream not low fat not light sour cream normal sour cream full fat pressing the fork down into the mixture i probably should have used a metal fork and there's where i switched the fork to a metal fork but don't overwork the dough and after you kind of done what you can do with the fork you just get your hands and you pull the dough together with your hands quickly and firmly so the butter pieces don't melt it should start to form a cohesive ball some of you might be wondering where's the ice water get it into a ball this recipe doesn't use ice water if you need to add a bit more sour cream if it's getting if it's too dry just add a tiny bit at a time like a little teaspoon at a time the mixture should not be overly wet or sticky at the same time it shouldn't be falling apart either it should hold together when pressed a cohesive ball then at this point the dough can be rolled out on a lightly floured counter i've split it into two um balls and i'm gonna roll it out into a disc and roll it up to as thin of a crust as quickly as possible then you want to roll the dough over the rolling pin and then unroll it onto the pie plate no i mean did i tell you who's going for a rustic after that you want to trim the edges around to about a quarter of an inch i covered it with plastic wrap and i refrigerated for 30 minutes at this stage i've also preheated my oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit or 220 celsius right back to the apples it's the moment we've all been waiting for once the um pie crust was chilled for long enough i put the apples i don't know is that enough apples you know what there's not that many left i'm just gonna freaking add them all and drizzle with this juice lemon juice mixture done after that i put the top of the pie crust the top crust on top okay this looks a little wonky rustic right and trimmed around the edges and then it says to kind of tuck the top edge underneath the bottom edge all the way around and then you crimp around the sides crimp crimp crimp make it look like a pie crust crimp crimp okay after that you cut four gashes in the top of the pie with sharp paring knife let's do cash here and cash here and here you take that lightly beaten egg white and you brush it across the top of the pie crust then you sprinkle a little bit of caster sugar across the top of the crust once that's done your pie is ready to go in the oven and then you bake it for about 25 minutes after that 25 minutes reduce the oven temperature and you continue to bake until the juices are bubbling and the crust is deep golden brown about 25 to 30 minutes longer okay so pies out of the oven i'm gonna let it cool for about two hours cutting trying the apple pie haven't seen it yet [Music] it's good chocolate apples i feel like kind of healthy two thumbs up", "D-D8vgoRp7c": "hi I'm Tom from fireball and today we're gonna make the warm apple pie in this drink we've got a purchase I've preheated some in the microwave Bobby is always best to this I'm going to add some fireball one to two shots depending on how your days be the servings for one person what I'm going to do now to find the glass with a handle what nice and say pour the mixture in fireball is quite sweet so we're going to add a little bit of lemon juice just to balance it out and pop in some apple and some orange and there we have", "KISIDZ-iRE8": "you know up here some people should make it that beside it today what are you drinking hey Eric it's a great idea we haven't done any apple cider since I first started brewing that we know we haven't secret guys we're gonna make an apple cider today [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys welcome back to my Channel today I'm going to do a mangrove Jack's craft series cider it's gonna be an elderflower lime flavour looking beautiful I reckon I'm hoping it is anyway and what I've been told it's gonna be a good tasting fruity outside very sweet cuz I don't mind a sweet cider easier to drink for me I don't mind a mild mid strength sweetness as well but that's my opinion but I'm going to do it fully sweet so my wife can drink it to me she probably enjoy it then family member so it would be quite good it rates at five point two percent alcohol volume it's also 23 litres that's going to go into my fermenter here let's get stuck into it shall we so as usual well unpack lick pouch first we're gonna cut the pouch open with a pair of scissors so give the old scissors a bit of a sanitizer this is sanitizer or keeping a bottle just for this sort of reason just keep things sanitized before I use them you might not be necessary for this but I'm gonna do it anyway this stuff's been in a lot of people's hands so a bit off keeping that clean so give this a snip stro fruit is a two pouches in here so I'm going to just cut it in such a way to hopefully you guys can see what I'm doing here from the other camera there and see what it comes out like showy whoo all right oh I've already smelled that apple cider it's wonderful yes apple cider all right so what we have looking I'll grab the little camera and show you what's inside so there you go we have our ingredients and instructions or it looks like hops well or something might be flower seeds or something like that it smells nice now we have lime flavoring so edit player and elderflower and lime flavoring that's cool an instruction manual which I have up on the computer anyway as you can see we have beside a yeast number 2 or mo 2 we also have a different kind of sweetener so something to make it sweet so they recommend maybe using half that if you want half the sweetness and whole thing for a nice sweet and it actually says it there if you can see that awesome so it looks like about eight in the packet and there's our concentrate it smells wonderful it really does so break open the instructions it looks like the instructions are pretty much what they are approval screen if you can see it so we're looking at please reduce first we've chopped done which is on here as well that's the same instruction manual it pretty much says the name to clean and sanitize the fermenter which I'll have done I also have to remove the sachet certain from a dry compartment in the pouch which I have done it sent off fermenter and squeezed out through your minds right so I'm going to pour the apple cider concentrate into my fermenter so now I have to tip this out I'll be back with you in a minute okay guys so it's empty I shook it up a little bit to get the firm the sanitizer all through the edges and all the sides of the actual fermenter Saurus this little bottle I'm going to close off and then actually close this cap here then my concentrate will pour in so it doesn't go into the bottle don't want to go under bottle yet because I'm a bit worried it won't mix properly so so I just allow that to be turned off for now and then I'll crack it open later I want it mixed it so basically all you need to do is pour your concentrate straight into your fermenter and then pour cold water to mix it and you do have to put dextrose in there so it's 1 kilogram of dextrose but I'll do that later I'll boil the kettle and I will dissolve it in the pot first before I pour it in so you can goes the concentrate just like that listen nicely now they said just use clean drinking water to ferment with so I'm gonna do one better I'm gonna get you some really cool spring water in this because the spring water is from the shop and it's clean and I got 20 litres of it so I'll just pour that in well I've got that open what just put a bit of sanitized around it just just to be certain that I'm not polluting or destroying anything take that lid off if I can give me that they say to poke a hole in the back so a breeze will do [Music] like that will shall pour our first lot of water [Music] that's ten liters okay I never ten liters [Music] that's two bottles that gives us 20 litres I've go 3 litres boiled in the kettle over in the kitchen there so I'm gonna put a heap of dextrose in there now mix it all together and then follow the rest of the instructions as I go now apparently I'll just pour the rest of it in like that just a little bit there no instructions it just says squeeze out the excess so I'll just squeeze out the excess yeah you could probably put water in it but yeah you don't have to worry about it so much wasn't a lot left done okay so now checking out the instructions I'll get that screen back up so you look at the instructions on the instructions if you can see this properly I'll probably I'll zoom in so you can actually see what I'm doing here 3 liters of boiling water to the fermenter but I can't do that because there's a fermenter source the fermenter source will mount so I do cold water first even though that saturation of dry compartment needed return time into squeezes right so we did the contents of the wet stuff first they were put the cold water in first because a fermenter surahs can't handle heat now I'm going to put a hot water in with the dextrose already mixed and dissolved top up to 24 letters but I've got about 20 I've got about three liters in maquette already so it doesn't matter it's gonna be 23 litres and check the temperature if it's between 18 and 28 degrees Celsius we can pick our yeast yeah and it tells you to keep it cool as you go and next bit is dry hops if included at this point they will be required on later do not add a saw hot cider essence so we don't add the essence or the flavouring and we don't add sweetener at all but I think looking at the instructions here comes with any additives especially like this keeps please please add them too Mehta now and I'm pretty sure this is a tea bag type so this will just drop straight in just like that and it smells good and that's in so that will now psych into the into the what which is what really what the cider is what and bring out the flavors from they look like flower petals to a drift so that's done so now I'll just go get my dextrose which is a I've got a big bag here I've got a 500 grams from [ __ ] sellers which I'm not going to use today I do have a spare bag of one kilo which is what I need to use today I got from the local store in Turin ah and I'll use that today so we'll pop that in and we'll see here we go for me be back okay I've got my dextrose or 1 kilo dissolved in about 3 liters of water this is gonna be ominous it's gonna be a problem I think I hope not but we'll try and not spill it what do you reckon an Ergo spilt I don't have a funnel that's something I'm going to have to invest in is a good funnel so that's the dextrose poured into the fermenter so all I do now is grab my stirring stick right got my stirring stick it to middle one but what do you do I'll give this a quick ear right stir up a bit does it make sure that X trace is mixed true which is fine it's not not that vital pop that near now remember I said it ties everything as I went you always have to do that sanitizing basically kills most bacteria on their systems no pits and tools and things like that which minimizes the risk of getting bacteria in your brew bad bacteria so I'm saying that I look my squirt bottle out there I'll be back so after saying that that's all mixed in I always try to keep everything sprayed and sanitized as I go just to make sure that I don't get bacteria that's already on the surface of items because that's one thing you've got to try and void is as many bacterial products you can and now from that I work on my lead aha you didn't remind me I have to put my yeast in okay so what I'll tell you now is that the temperature should be between 18 and 20 what to say 18 in 28 degrees Celsius and at the moment it's a 20 degrees so it's perfect it's the 20 degrees now water he is nice and cold at the moment so it means a nice and cool so again I'll Senate eyes the yeast packet white and this is mo too so it's a cider yeast cracked it open and will pitch that straight into the fermenter I will have to move that teabag out the way I look at it so where's my spoon gone that's still clean so put that there for now no trying to sink it a little there's a little issue I'd never fought I came across bloody it's in the way no I don't get this we'll just pour that straight in [Music] that's a yeast pitched you did a bit of a stir doesn't say you have to but I'll do it anyway no way yeah you know I'm a little tea bag of flavoring doesn't soak up the yeast so okay we're ready to pop the lid on now and again I'll just quickly spray it out again because it's been on the surface somewhere pop that even tighter up put some sanitizer in the air lock the layer lock Italy locks have a little top on it like this they they basically help float the bubble so they don't pop back in it doesn't feed back in itself you feel it halfway there to with some sanitizer water alcohol I've seen people do that before and it works the lead basically creates that airlock once you put sanitizer in these squiddy old air sanitizer ring is what I do anyway and always work for me this way if bacteria does get on okay get in or get on top of it it gets killed before it even goes into you into your middles so there you go so I fill it up to that line it's good enough now we'll just whack that on top of my little outlet look pop the lid on and we're ready to go so this little Bowl here is a true catcher it'll actually catch you true most of the east will build up in here you can actually take that off halfway through or to the end of fermentation that way you haven't got dead yeast floating around in you in your brew so it helps with the flavoring you can't keep the flavoring yeah oh sorry keep the east and then reuse it in other batches but a lot of people do that I haven't I haven't learned how to do it haven't really bothered to learn how to do it because he's so readily available anyway so why keep it so yeah that goes on the bottom of our fermenter source which I made a mess of by the way screw that in what I'll do I'll get the little camera again just show you what I'm doing what what I'm doing here what I'm doing here it is cracking the air as you can see eroding the what and all the yeast is going into a little bowl now which doesn't matter because that will quickly accumulate and become a vital little piece of process so guys when at the end of the process as you can see I've done everything it says to do fit the airlock which I've done and have to dry hops if you have dry hops after four days check with specific gravity that's not hops I don't have dry hops anyway you just gotta check your gravity which one is what I'll do in a minute and then I'll let you know what that is now pop it up on the screen I've got to do it the hard way now except forgot to do it beforehand so you have to crack your valve and put into a little tube and test it all and I'll let you know anyway so we're at the end so what basically takes about six or seven days to ferment depending on the temperature and we'll just work out from there so what you think did you enjoy doing that yeah dude what it was great beautiful product yeah I do too yeah what it's great yeah thanks for watching guys thanks mate it's bye from me see you for me see you again [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "20T4yNbg-hg": "I can't welcome to another episode of cocktail hour of butter and salt Krista Macklemore and that's Kevin and today we are making an apple pie cocktail so that we can get drunk on Thanksgiving having for dessert apple pie first we need to rip our glasses so I think that these need glasses from TJ Maxx this may or may not be in an episode of my favorites coming up to what I'm going to do is I'm going to dip it in a little bit of apple cider and then I'm going to rim it in some brown sugar second I'm going to do is I'm going to take a handful of ice and put it in my shaker while I'm at it I'm gonna put some ice in my glass is cute this is for one drink one ounce of fire all fish one ounce of vanilla vodka phish four ounces of apple cider fish and a natural ground cinnamon lid on and shake you it was a cat much then paste you want to get extra fancy garnish with some cinnamon sticks get more cinnamon stick well that's a Polly it's got the apple from the cider it's got a little into vanilla that you might get either in the pie itself or in the ice cream I've got the cinnamon from the dash of cinnamon but also from the fireballs of got a little bit i'm going to put all my ingredients away cuz i might be garnished with apple like an apple ring like you wouldn't work i had another thought about how you could garnish this lovely apple pie treat with the normal apple-pie garnish Cheers yep do this all right proceed I hope you enjoyed this episode if you did give it a thumbs up and if you haven't yet subscribe to my channel it's a little picture of me they want to see last monday's episode of my pinterest fail the pumpkin pie treats go in and click on the video and yeah i will see you next time which will be tomorrow okay bye", "0hnfhlurS90": "am i on yeah you're on oh okay so today I'm making hard apple cider we're gonna be doing it with frozen concentrate instead of fresh because we've run out of fresh so come on over here I've counted up some cinnamon inside of our coffee grinder that's gonna go on to this pan right here to get toasty and then right now over here I'm boiling some some logs some oak logs in some tea bags so the boiling will hopefully kill anything that's growing on there I want to get that oaky flavor so we got that going there and then once that's once the cinnamon I'm gonna want to keep moving the cinnamon because we don't want it to burn and then once that gets toasty we're gonna toss that into the pot and let that stew like a like like a tea bag but it's deep okay so while that's beeping I'm gonna start cleansing my stuff so I got my brew bucket here five-gallon bucket I'm gonna be putting some of this sant\u00e9 sanitizer stuff it's basically when you add water it basically creates like a peroxide so I'll be shaking a little bit of that into there adding water and then cleaning all of my through stuff and then once it's done we spill it out and then this is what we're gonna be actually using as a juice this is frozen 100% frozen juice concentrate it's just literally just apple juice frozen and it's concentrate didn't mean it it's like almost syrupy will be adding water to this so this many jars will do about 3 gallons so I'll probably do a little bit more than 3 gallons as I'll be adding sugar yep so that's that's the next step I'll be showing you how to do that cool so so these are the the frozen juice concentrates and I'm just cracking of cans open there it goes you can see it's very syrupy and getting them in the bucket you see inside you look at the bottom and then I'm just swishing it around with some of this water just a little bit just to get it all the goodness out of the cans and I'm doing that with all these cans as you can see I also grabbed some grape juice I'm gonna use three grape juice cans in six applicants this obviously grapes make wine they don't make cider but I'm just trying to look for a new way of doing things this is more sugary than apple juice so it's gonna be higher alcohol content so we're gonna want to use less we're gonna want to add less sugar to it and after I'm done with this I'm gonna pour in that tea that I've been making with the oak logs and the tea bags alright thanks alright so I added all of the apple and one of the grapes and so 6 apples in one grape and look at how purple it became I think I'm only gonna use one grape just because it seems to overpower it's much more syrupy and it's much more concentrated so that's what I'll do listen next it's on my frozen bucket alright and so I just added the the hot tea and now I'm gonna stir it I'm gonna start adding extra water to it and so I top it up to the three the three gallon line on my bucket the oak is going to stay in the envy brew for the primary and then in the secondary I'm gonna add smaller oak pieces so that they fit in my car boy alright we're getting it all stirred up nice and well we're gonna raise it up to three gallon mark and you can see Carter is working on using this siphon that we've rigged up you can see the water is coming out it's going sucked up through this pulling spring swaddle brew bucket say hi Carter okay we're mixing in some brown sugar because instead of I I should have probably used to additional apple cider or apple concentrate jars but I was gonna use grape instead but then it turns out we didn't want to use those two grapes so I added in extra sugar with brown sugar the next step is this we need we need to use our yeast nutrient and our pectin and done nice new trim gives yeast food to eat and helps it helps it eat the food and it's actually I think it's like urea it's yeah I tyria it's basically stuff that we pee out which is interesting and then Peck thick enzyme prevents Peck decays which makes it more clear when it's when it's time to bottle and drink so this one you use a half teaspoon per gallon since we have three gallons we want three of these yep ts piece so I'm gonna pop this in Carter's gonna keep mixing [Music] 2:30 okay so that's done and then this one is the bigger spoon this one is the one well this is actually a full T TSP per gallon so we're gonna need six of these shoes steady three four five six okay and now after that we're gonna take a break and then we're gonna start our yeast on top so go ahead and stop stop stirring we're gonna put our yeast on actually in about an hour we're gonna put our yeast on top and now I'm just gonna put in some red star yeast and to my yeast starter this is just water with with some brown sugar and all I do is take this red star yeast packet premiere classic dry active dry yeast and you just sprinkle it on the top you want to see come to the surface see this you just let it float on the top and then they'll still height rehydrate and sink to the bottom and then in about an hour I'll add the whole thing into my bucket all right we've waited in an hour and our yeast is ready let's see here it's float it's sunk in and that's floated back up widow it's kind of bubbling a little so we're gonna add that to our bucket here goes now we'll let this we'll stir this bucket every day for the next 10 to 15 days and at a certain point we're gonna make the call to add it to add our on to rack off the liquid and all off of the sediment and into a demijohn or into a carboy where it'll have a secondary for a minute and it'll stay there for a longer period of time and I will be videoing that as well so be sure to

Appalachian backwoods making white lightning in illegal copper stills operators of illegal whiskey still has conducted their business at night to avoid detection of legal authorities became known as

plummeted today hooch has once again become popular inspiring TV shows and now legit brands of shine in mason jars lining the shelves for all intents and purposes moonshine begins in the same fashion as the whiskey you buy on the store the major difference is that whiskey is aged sometimes for many years in oak barrels that are charred on the inside distilling moonshine is a remarkably simple process requiring four main ingredients corn sugar yeast and water corn can be substituted with various ingredients including barley rye or fruit but corn is most often used because it is cheap and easy to obtain moonshine features the pure flavors of the ingredients it's distilled from typically the sweet aromas of corn or the subtle spice of wheat traditionally moonshine was often heavily

Today I'll show you how to make home-made cider! This year I make it from red sweet and green tart apples and sweet and balmy pears. Last year my roamer broke down, that's why I'll use a chopper. After one and half an hour of grinding and our apples and pears became a pot of pulp. Now it has to be pressed by using of cheese cloth. I've got about 9L of juice, so let's determine it's sweetness! I use areometer Well, this juice includes 12% of sugar, so after fermentation it will be about....5-6% ABV. I poured it in equal parts Coz of not washing the apples, there must be wild yeast. So, juice must ferment by itself Cover it with cheese cloth and wait till fermenting. Would-be cider's the second day under fermentation lock The fermentation process is OK Let's wait till fermenting out! 5 days ago cider has fermented out its sugar Now I rack it off I've tested it and I think it's too low-alcoholic I've decided to put another 50g of sugar per 1 Liter. Pour it into the jars and leave it for postfermentation. As yet it's like a young wine to the taste, but smells like cider. Cover with fermentation lock and let it ferment. After 6 days I rack it off and brighten I'm using bentonite - it's special clay. I add to bentonite some water for mixing it till thick condition. Close up the jar and shake well Shake it during the day 2-3 times then leave it for a few days till it becomes bright and clear. After 4 days cider became bright and precipitated out It's not so much bright as I expected but yet. Now I rack it off again And as always - quality control! The smell is nice - feels apple and pear. To the taste.... it's dry.... fruit...wine...tasty! Now let's carbonize our cider. The bottles you see I've antiseptisized by iodine water and washed by water. Then I put into each bottle 1 TBSP of sugar and bottle cider I void about 3-5 cm from the neck Then I leave cider for about 2 weeks in dark place at room temperature for carbonization. Hello everybody! Today I gonna test cider made from sour-sweet apples and sweet pears After 3 days of carbonization I've noticed, that bottles are too soft and a thought has struck me, that bentonite has eaten wild yeast and cider has nothing for carbonization and I made a little trick: I've put into each bottle a pinch of wine yeast and a bit of sugar Now let's check out what we have! As you can see, it's well carbonized: a lot of foam and carbon dioxide. It was carbonizing 2 weeks at room temperature and 3 days in the root cellar. So let's smell it! It has fruity.... fruit aroma with pear note apple-pear-honey sweet Let's taste! mmmmm.......nice....very nice! I thought it would be bitter coz of yeast - but not! What about sweetness?......emmm...It doesn't need sweetness slightly sweet and slightly sour The smell is nice! I've already drunk a glass and I can say about its alcoholic effect: jollifies nice, I feel tipsiness So, it's about 5 or 6% ABV....definitely...I feel Having tasted it, I can surely say that smell is apple-pear-honey sweet to the taste it's slightly sour...apple-sour..I feel soreness of the mouth It's really nice.....tasty and aromatic drink We made decent cider from apples and pears, so we can stand it or drink a chilled glass after hard working day. From my personal experience I can say, that cider goes nice with cherry and currant fruit liqueur. So, let's put some ice-cube! I pour out 30-40 ml of.... currant fruit liqueur. and pour out with chilled cider Mix it.........taste it! Delicious! Nice! Actually cider goes well with cocktails.   I've tasted it with grenadine or cherry syrup, especially nice it goes with strawberry or raspberry syrup. What can I advise to concoction: It's better to brighten it in natural way, because bentonite can \"eat\" the yeast, but we need yeast for carbonization. My second advice: Usually cider is made from several kinds of apples, rather sweet or sour-sweet apples, I used sweet pears You can ferment it by using either wild yeast or wine yeast But I have nothing to say about Saf Levure yeast or others. I reveal a little secret to you! I have for you at least 2 recipes of cider.

flourishing and productive and the crowning glory is the orchard of Cornish heritage apples he planted one had to leave something behind for somebody to inherit these are going to be here for a hundred and fifty years it's looking after our environment it's not looking after me looking after what our children are gonna inherit [Music] hi John James farm touches on it yeah yeah right I've heard a lot about your orchards well well so they're not just like your average grannies my name is James Strawbridge I'm a chef and I was excited to meet John and even more excited to choose some of his rare heritage apples to make an absolutely unique apple pie it's beautiful and how many varieties we're talking well you're talking in the truss of 18 this Apple here this is one that Ford Cornish gimme flour they're going to like this one raw you just have a touch John's orchard is both beautiful and clever with bees for pollination and the trees planted in a diamond pattern chosen by the Victorians to maximize light and ventilation you'll pick up that nice red one there this one yeah look at the color soon we had gillyflower Cornish mother and the strangely shaped box apples and I'm ready to bake back at the house I'm struck by how John has added to the 700 year history of the estate the plan of course is to make an amazing apple pie with the delicious flavors of John's historic Aliza in the apartment my idea was to add nothing to the natural tart flavor of the box apple the bitter-sweets Cornish mother and the juicy get flour all with an orange zest and cinnamon spiced pastry to set it off [Music] respect some of the base layer as well this is got some history too isn't it weird living like noir and that really is a very special apple pie [Music] you", "M93FEEX8psc": "hey guys Eirik here from OC homebrew and today we're brewing the cider broom making a cider we're preventing apple juice Don Lemon we've never actually done a cider before it just so happened Imperial yeast had a has a seasonal yeast out right now called bubbles 840 but it ferments at 5777 fuck-you h flocculation is medium attenuation is anywhere from 85 to hundred percent and it kind of just makes things convenient so today we're using Kirkland Signature apple juice hundred percent if you're going to use anything else just make sure there's no preservatives in it you can use clear apple juice you can use cloudy cider for this making sure there's no preservatives and you'll be okay I've read online that people had very good luck with the Kirkland Signature Costco branded apple juice and it's fairly reasonably priced at I think eight or nine dollars for two of these and then reviewing the steps of how we're going to do this we're probably gonna break this video up into two videos mostly because I'm gonna start the fermentation today which can be probably a short video and then I'm gonna come back and add potassium sorbate to inhibit the yeast and probably secondary the cider and then probably back sweetened with brown sugar so today's video we're going to take our apple juice put in our carboy first we're going to sanitize it and then we're gonna pitch east throw it under the stairs inside the house come back in about a week and a half and show you part two of making cider so first things first go ahead and clean up our carboy this is a five gallon carboys I've got four gallons here I want to try and leave as much headspace I'm not sure how active and how crazy this fermentation is gonna get so I'm gonna leave about a gallon of head space on the carboy hopefully that'll give me enough to you know cause any explosions in my closet because my to be real pissed [Music] [Applause] [Applause] as long as the foam doesn't push out the sample juice that I'm pouring in which it probably is typically when we brew it's not a big deal because we got a tube going down the middle of it I wonder if I could shake it up if that would decrease the foam but I don't have many other choices right now that worked pretty good I got some headspace there now keep going [Music] so close hey there we go one really good shake and now they're coming back let's go hurry up and do this now we get to pitch east [Applause] [Music] yeast is officially pitched one thing I forgot to do is actually add the East nutrient so I'm gonna do that real quick typically typically you would add yeast nutrient to the end of a boil of a beer so it's already boiling it would already make sure there's not in the living and he's nothing living in it to contaminate it I guess I'll have to boil some water and just add it to this I mean I've only got to use less than half a teaspoon I'll probably use half a teaspoon but for five gallons we're doing four gallons so let's go do that all right so now that we've got everything in here I took about QB like half a cup to a cup of water to start boiling it and added our yeast nutrient I'm gonna go ahead and add it to this it cooled down now so hopefully this goes better than apple juice get all that stuff mixed up I'm gonna put this under the stairs for about a week week and a half and then I will see you in the second part of this video and that's gonna be adding the potassium sorbate and back sweetening with brown sugar hopefully this comes out alright so overall today seemed to go pretty well kind of step by step pretty easy just adding apple juice yeast and yeast nutrient that's all for part one part two is gonna be adding the sorbate and back sweetening with brown sugar so keep an eye out for that if you haven't subscribed already make sure to subscribe hit the bell so you get a notification your time to come out with a new video and we'll see you guys next time Cheers maybe in the future this will actually be a cider [Music]", "O9UfzSjQsR8": "if your boss looking pretty much as dismal as what mine is I mean I've had a lot of people ask wait can we get booze from they give me a cigarette from we can we get sort of those little essentials that a lot of people do want but not a lot of have so not that I can give it just by the way so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you guys all your mofos only how to make your own pineapple beer and I'm also going to show you how to make an apple cider and tell you about similar eight days for it to ferment and for you to then be able to obviously bottle it so just a quick cap on what you guys are gonna need get like two packets of apples Granny Smith works really well it's going to taste for the cider as well get four or five decent-sized pineapples in a buoy okay get to solve two two and a half kilograms white sugar and some packets of brewers east or any useful work like I said earlier get yourself like four or five t Beck's and Bob's uncle not Roy was make sure it's normal T so you know five roses binti just not rebels right obviously you're gonna need a big-ass knife I'm gonna need a cutting board okay that's all yeah really prepared forgot what I'm doing [ __ ] early so I wanna sleep picked up over yet what you want to do is just make sure you got a keen working surface I'm holding this bottle because I needed to explain to save your coke bottles coke like painters whatever I save as many as you can because once this is all done you can basically deke enter your beers or cider into these bottles chocolate in the fridge and obviously use as you need so what you want to do is I've sprayed it down you want to clean your service make sure everything is pretty much use a freezie to work on we're making pineapple Buell I'm making a corona the other work there okay so next step you're going to need to do get yourself 225 liter drums you know big buckets if you've got at home you can still buy it at high piranhor a couple of shops as for sort of relying you to buy those big buckets if necessary okay pull them up just over half so I call it two thirds of hot hot hot tap water you don't have to use boiling water so just basically your big buckets preferably with lids alright what you should also do is you should get a helper I've got a really cool guy that's staying with me Kyle he's really for my thumbs up for me with hot hot tap water you can just check her on the floor yeah so cause houses are spinning off done with me it's actually really cool he's a personal trainer as well so so before you start you actually need to pop yourself a beer back pop yourself a beer I've decided to Ava honey control it much better so before you start make sure you watch your favorite Jake whoopsie-daisy alright let's get started so actually a better idea is just throw all the junk into a citric bag and not into your actual rubbish but in your kitchen because if you're not using a rubbish bin that often it's just ink okay so what you're gonna do is gonna keep dropping this planet below you've got a blender blender was really really cool so basically what you do you take the pineapple mix it into the blender with a little bit of hot water and you can turn it into a smoothie and obviously just placed it on a little bit bigger it will work it's not that this way is not gonna work not everybody has a blender so listen carefully remember nice nice nice and hot start checking all your cut pieces into the pocket nice what y'all gonna show you wonderful oh yes not popsicle okay sorry by the time you've done this you've added a pineapple into your hot tap water water once again my friends do it okay so at the time you guys have done this what you want to do is do your pineapple mixture you want to add four kilograms or white sugar so how about cheesemakers of two point five kilogram so I'm just gonna be like obviously the warm water also helps the sugar dissolve into your alcoholic solution this is not on here just give it a good stir so yeah at the right temperature now what you want to do is take your east your disease brewers yeast obviously works pretty much the same as any other yeast as far as I'm concerned you want to take twenty grit okay so it's basically one of these packets you can add a little bit more in if you really want to modify the mystery once you've stirred everything which guys open the packet across the top like that and the trick that I've learned from another Brewer also homebrew that if you sprinkle it on top just sort of like close it seen it with the lid and you know just for five minutes once a five minutes is up the open and I began giving a good stir so it will give a do now okay so this bucket is really well sealed when I have done please I'll punch two tiny little holy unlit she wouldn't I just needed to finally go to a skate that needs these days okay and then you had a few pineapples while we doing this let's prepare our apple cider so long thanks man okay you want to get something at seals a little tighter through this one okay a fighter here we come okay these guys get a few choppers fun as financial domine giving they puff up anyway just slice and dice I in actual fact make one for once a year I know some of you guys have tasted it and yeah you've I like forgotten all the events that occurred yeah the same night think of teabags about half way truth and right so now that we've got our apples brilliant picks we think our second P point five kilogram - it it is alright sugar you need some cheese and probably maybe they're not I got this [Music] hey you don't want to stir this out real good hey sorry once daddy's gone take the East once again and just sweep it around the top I'm gonna give this a place for five minutes so will actually sit at the side right of it yeah and it's and then you pour beer now like I see this is quite a my seating lid it's a cool option just just just just so what you're gonna do is you're gonna leave it alone for like seven eight days except for that once a day that you open it but can give it a tiny little little scoop that is absolutely it the rest of the time even learn thing that the kids play with it only to walk near it to leave it alone and in similar 8 days you are gonna have a delicious pineapple flavor is the alcohol theory otherwise known as a beer which is made in South Africa for many years these other ways of doing it but to me this one which were based in a pretty cool after the same in eight days what you're gonna do is you're gonna be ten minutes of ads and obviously for the bottle so makes you've got a fennel and just a little strainer just just just just fine and yeah pull it over to surprise the way you wanna drink I don't hate that's how you make fine FB let's check on our Apple Apple Apple for the Apple tech Gabrielle forgave this one in Aikido scared I'm gonna put another kilogram I'm gonna find it but you know what to do what you aren't kids do what you want okay you go know what a tea bag is on them apples less you there you have it you now have both apple cider and Queen a fully beer keep it closed sir once every two days and don't forget to either one take it away from it until it's ready to be plated I hope you join us for the next edition of [Music]", "1JJILD7vrFM": "hey gamez you're by Platt here today with another home brewing kit review today we're going to review the mr. beer hard apple cider kit so a couple months back I did a review of the mr. beer craft beer series kitten at the time I said that my spirit expanded their line and I wanted to start hitting some of the other kits they had besides the traditional kits of that used in previous videos um if you had bought mr. Berger kits ten 15 plus years ago there was a limit selection of basic beers American ales cervesas Irish doubts stuff like that but since their merger with Coopers they've really expand the line and not just into beer they have a camp boat your kid they've gotten into wine and today we're going to talk about their hard apple cider kit what I have here is the refill kit it just comes with one I need to make the batch because I have had several other mr. beard kits I've got four miners' I've got beer bottles I don't need that stuff if you're new to home brewing' or want a complete kit feel free to buy that I will have a link down below my Amazon affiliate link if you want to get either the refill kit which I'm using today or if you want the complete hard apple cider kit with for men or bottles instructional DVDs etc a real quick I want to talk about that complete kit the hard cider kit it's a little different than the regular kit you get with the beer this is the standard form in ER that comes with the standard mr. beer home brewing kit with the hard apple cider kit the fermenter is shaped just the same but it's perfectly clear which is kind of cool because one of the things when using a standard mr. beer kept this dark brown for me is once you load it with beer it's really tough to see inside and for sanitation purposes you don't want to keep opening the lid so if you want to make sure fermentation is going all right or just just kind of watch the science happen it was kind of tough you couldn't take a flashlight but it's still one the same but with the hard apple cider kit that fermenter is perfectly clear and you can see the magic happen so that might be something you might be interested in again especially if you're new to home brewing and this whole thing seems kind of weird and wonderful to you who I had black said today we're gonna review the refill kit that's what I got so let's see what's inside first off is a one quart container of it says Archerd orchards hard apple cider mix it's it's a fruit it's an apple juice concentrate for lack of a better term on the cover it shows a green apple so I'm assuming it's applying this is a green apple juice concentrate this really stink leer lis what types of apples are used it does sit on the bottom makes approximately 2 gallons and that's that's what we're gonna make today um one thing I note here and I did a little research online it doesn't say anywhere what the ABV is of our final product I find that kind of disappointing I don't necessarily have said this in other reviews or mr. beer kits I don't know I understand they don't necessarily have gravity points even though I think the burgeoning home brewer once you do one or two of these basic kits after a while you'd want that information what have you but I am disappointed that we don't even know the ABV of this yet so what we'll do because we know how how to check that is I will do a gravity reading also in the kit is the mr. beard non-rich cleaner cleanser comes with all their products on you only use half the package before we're sanitizing or fermenter as we speak also we probably will probably end up using a spoon so you want sent as that but you'll use half of this one brewing and then the other half you'll say from when you bottle your finished product last in the packet is a package of Seth ASO for brewing yeast now this yeast is persistent specifically designed for English ales there are also other popular a lists a fail so4 for American ales what we're gonna well we're going into brewing is probably closer to those apple ales you'll see on the market there's what's that red Redd's Apple ale and couple this out there and what why they use the term why they may use the term Apple ale instead of a hard apple cider water is because of the ale yeast a lot of your traditional signers will brew with either wine or champagne yeast they kind of give a the creative a drier product or drier finished product and they can hit higher atvs because those yeast are designed for higher atvs probably what we'll end up I'm just taking the guess is that we're gonna be a BB Weiss around a generic kale so let's this work out perfect also this yeast packet is enough for a five gallon batch we're doing slightly over two gallon batch so we'll use about half this and other mr. bjur products there's generally a smaller gold package of yeast and that's the exact amount for two gallons that's their proprietary yeast but they pitched they threw in Asaph ASO for one of the thing on one do note on this refill kit they do not heavy in instructions inside they presume that well you bought you will have the complete kit and there's a DVD when you buy complete instructions you can go online to mr. beer and find the instruction for this also we'll walk you through it in this video but if you're not sure on how to do anything you could always go to mr. Brewers website to find out so that being said let's make two gallons the part apple cider alright game to start off with first thing we need to do or we already done is already sanitized our fermenter with the non-rich sanitizer also sanitize the spoon I'll be using shortly well let that sanitize once we do we'll dump out the snare it's a non red sanitizer you might want to rinse it off but you definitely want to top it out before you use it anyway we dump that out and on the mr. beer fermenters in the back there's two notches there's a number one notch in number two knotch we filled with cool water up to that number one notch or look we have that setting right there um then our next step is we're gonna take four cups of water we're gonna pop we're gonna take four cups of water and bring it to a boil and it's with this water we're going to add our apple concentrate we're boiling for a couple reasons a for sanitation purposes and B this is thick sugary liquid we want everything incorporated so we're going to need hot water to kind of help help us out there one thing I want to point out real quick that I like about this package it's a reusable top that's gonna make pouring this in easy the old mr. beer kits you had to take a can opener there's a can [Music] you it was kind of missie also too because the Surrey's will live I put a little bit of water in here because there's always gonna be a little leftover because this is thick liquid and I shake it up get that last little bit out work with the mr. beer cans I couldn't take that I actually didn't want to just dip it in like that I was kind of scraping over this hot pot it I became Missy kind of came harder to execute that should be mr. beers hopefully listening maybe we put the bearish extract into something like this maker like a little bit simpler but just want to say that so we're almost up to boil like so we've got a fermenter ready to go if you meet questions on sanitation again mr. beer kit wallah can answer you on that and I have a video on home brewing sanitation - you can always go back and review that start and now you want to make sure you stir this you want to turn down the heat a little bit because you don't want to scorch on the bottom you see how easy that comes out if you see me my mr. beard videos you'll see right now always kind of have a little bit of a mess or I'm always having to scrape out the very bottom all right turn that down some more and I got a little cut I got some water just gonna add two there and we're gonna get that last bit of juice out see how much easier this is we can I hope mr. beard watching oh that's perfect yeah I'd smelled it sweetness it smells a little bit like actually does smell like beer concentrate - but not the multi part but just kind of a thickness all right so we'll turn this off what we're gonna do now is we're going to take this we put it in our fermenter that already has water cool water in it we're going to put this in and then the second notch the number-two notch we're after we add this we're going to fill that up to that number two notch with cold water maybe went through a couple ice cubes in if you're in a warm you know we're in Vegas the summertime our room temperatures a little warmer but anyway you're going to fill it up with cool water and that's gonna help bring down our fermentable liquids to a temperature where we're then able to pitch the east i'm before we pitch east and going to do and gravity training because again we didn't know what our ABV is so let me do that we'll come back with a full fermenter and we'll review and discuss what we do going alright game so we went head through in our can't really call it work we threw in our liquid into our fermenter which already had cool water we topped off to the number two notch in the back with cold water that so we could get the liquid the temperature of the liquid down to where we could pitcher yeast we used our ale yeast that came with the kit that packet like I said is for a five gallon batch we're only doing a little two gallon so I use roughly half the packet before I did pitch though I didn't do a gravity reading we came out to 1.0 four five comparison wise that's similar to brown ales cream ales American Standard lagers so ABV wise I'm just gonna take a rough guesstimate worst she between four and five percent alcohol by volume if everything works out right as far as fermentation goes we're going to let this ferment in the fermenter for two weeks and then two weeks we'll bottle if you have any questions about bottling the mr. beer website can answer that for you also I do have a video on bottling beer we'll let that sit in the bottle or bottle conditioned for three weeks then you throw in your fridge and ready to drink we will probably hear about a month and a half two months or so we'll probably pull a couple of balls aside and try them out in our next homebrew tasting video as far as any experimentation or ways you can play with this mr. beer sells something called booster it's just additional fermentable sugars that you can throw in an Emmy pretty much any other beers or products if you wanted to bump up the ABV of this with the booster packet feel free to do that maybe once you feel coupled with this maybe you want thrown that cinnamon stick nutmeg there's brown sugar here a couple months when we get to the fall season make something but just a little more fall flavor maybe adding those additional spices is the way you could go with that well hope you like this video if

really delicious I say everything's delicious but it really is is good and I was like I'm gonna call it a hot cider cuz it's not quite a wash sale is it raw sale or waffle is it waffle we're gonna like the grapes sometimes they have grapes in the bottom when I used to work at a cardiologists office the week before Christmas we would kind of have some sort of a holiday thing where we would serve this and goodies to all the patients and they loved it so every year it's like a tradition I guess I'm carrying on I don't know if you can see that cloudy murkiness like I'll try and shake it up a little bit you can kind of see that it's got gunk at the bottom that's why I put apple cider should have like when you do this you should see like junk floating through like Apple bits not bits but this is like murkiness that's what you should see they were trying to sell some apple juice as apple cider because there was apple juice and then it said apple cider and they looked exactly the same and I switched it over and all the ingredients the only difference was one had citric acid which is fine because it is just pressed apples but if you don't have the murkiness like it's just basically apple juice all they did was change the label and then jack up the price so anyway it that's with my little two cents for you about that two ports which is what eight cups eight cups did I stir this maybe I should shake it first I could kind of eyeball it so it's like half of this gallon next we're gonna add orange juice and we're gonna do a quart of orange juice so four cups of orange juice I just chose one that was on sale this is the color at this point now comes the good part where we add all the only spices and it makes it into something that is just so fall two thirds cup of brown sugar we're gonna add I'm gonna go ahead and turn this on higher because we're gonna need to boil this folks so rather than do big floppy splash I'm gonna just like place it in there drink it up a little you are gonna add 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt and 1/8 of a teaspoon of ground allspice which smells really good we're gonna add six whole cloves we used to take these clothes as kids and glue them onto like walnuts and make like reindeers because they kind of look like reindeer antlers I should do a crouched we used to take them on the walnuts and glue them like on the low reindeer for Rangers anyways we're doing six of these if you don't have whole cloves and you have like a pickling spice mix look in your pickling spice because there's clothes in there you can pick them out there one and then we add four cinnamon sticks every year me and Neal get a membership just for the holidays to link PJs it's kind of inconvenient for us but we like to get those temporary memberships that are free the trata ones then you can see what they have for Christmas and you can also get good deals on like stuff like this which are horrendously expensive in their little jars but when you buy them in bulk like this it doesn't make it seem so bad I'm adding four cinnamon stick cider added one already and then two or and did you guys know cinnamon is actually bark from a cinnamon tree why we can't grow them in our backyards and then just cut the bark from it and dry it out ourselves why is that because I would do that because these things are like gold in price you're like they're like vanilla beans it's it's just not not right this is not right hey we're gonna heat this to boiling once it starts boiling we're gonna have it simmer down turn it down a little bit simmer it for about five minutes serve it up try not to burn your all of your taste buds off when you're eat it and then if you want to use the cinnamon sticks for little stirring sticks you could do that that would be kind of posh wouldn't it we're a little pinkies up I'm ready to ladle this into my mug um you just try not to get the clothes and stuff you could have put the clothes in a cheesecloth or I don't know some sort of a tea steeper something if you didn't want to have to bother with trying to not get the clothes when you smell it up close you can smell the spices but it's not like it's not like the mulling spices you get those little cartons of the mulling spices that you just put on and it like makes your whole house smell divine it has some kick to it actually it's like more of a spiced cider but it shouldn't just be called hot cider should we call it spiced cider you can really taste the orange in this and some spices you know what we should do we should put whip cream and your xoauth caramel sprinkle a little cinnamon on there or there are some nuts in there and I don't know to dress it up that's what you could do there's your spiced cider guys nice little fall drink guys are doing good we'll see you next time on the green apple home", "uYh8NcRLp-4": "what's up y'all Sarika back with another cocktail video so sense of thanksgiving i decided that i'm gonna do a special cocktail and it's called caramel apple pie martini so it's a really sweet drink but it's really good and it is strong even though it doesn't seem like it okay so here you go okay guys so we're gonna start with any vanilla flavored vodka and we're gonna do two ounces of that next we're gonna add one ounce of almond milk a little dash of vanilla extract we have a little swirl of our caramel and then we're gonna go with three ounces of apple cider next we're gonna add our ice shake it on up you want to make sure that the the metal is cold so then we're gonna dip our glass inside of the caramel sauce and then in the cinnamon i'm gonna pour it in and then for our last step we're gonna add a little apple slice and don't break it like I did and there you have it we have our caramel

I'm Rick a New York state apple grower today let's talk about the history of apple cider and the cider industry like apples apple cider has a rich history filled with facts and possible myths in 55 BC Roman invaders found the local villagers in Kent England freaking a cider like beverage made from apples it said that Julius Caesar found apple cider positively delicious by the start of the ninth century cider had become popular throughout Europe the production of cider has been an important part of American agriculture for over 200 years it began when the pilgrims arrived on the east coast and discovered the native crab apples were abundant but not very edible to grow better apples they had seeds and cuttings sent from England a Massachusetts man named John Chapman spread the apple seed across the entire country you know him better as Johnny Appleseed from there apples and cider began flourishing in America and George Washington made sure that apple cider was available for his troops during the Revolutionary War the wealth of a town was sometimes measured in the number of barrels of cider preserved in local cellars for the winter even President John Adams praised it as a fine breakfast drink in early America apple cider was often consumed as much as water due to if Eve water supplies cider was known as America's drink up until the Civil War and today New York has more cider producers than any other state with over 200 cider mills now that you know all that you're truly an apple insider for thousands of how-to and advice videos on any topic visit monkey-see calm", "cdJCsKB2Pkk": "hey spices so today is part three on our series of making hard apple cider if you want to see the other two parts I will link them in the description box below and in the iCard above so today we are going to be bottling our cider so we're gonna be mixing what we need in these buckets and turning it into a hard apple cider so let's go spice things up what we got here is some preparations and getting this cider made first of all you see the bottle caps in boiling water that's the quickest and easiest way to sanitize those the water boiling back here is going to be used for my corn sugar I'm gonna add a cup of corn sugar to it since I have about five gallons of cider I'll mix that in the cider before I bottle it that's gonna add the carbonation and put the final touches on the cider all right here's the corn sugar also known as dextrose priming sugar we're gonna add one cup to that freshly boiled water it's cooled down just a little bit game this as the carbonation you have to wait 2 weeks after you bottle not all the Wow enough time for the carbonation and the finishing of the cider and we have about a cup of corn sugar their own are sliders ready and our 5 gallon bucket we'll add that and stir it up bottle this is our fermenting cider we have right here it's been going for about two weeks the recommendation is 10 to 14 days but as it's been fermenting the sediment has been collecting on the bottom so before we mix in the corn sugar we're gonna take all the good cider that doesn't have sediment in it put it in here we'll leave the sediment in the bottom and then we'll add our corn sugar here we are about to bottle it and this is 5 gallons which is about 50 bottles that right mm-hmm so we did sanitize everything but just in case there's a little leftover sanitizer in here we're gonna use this tool and get get it cleaned out so that we have a solid stream of fresh cider and in goes our corn sugar this is the leftover sediment and as you see it is kind of thick and less clear so we are not pouring that into bottles and now we're gonna stir the corn sugar just make sure you have a sanitized spoon or stirring stick [Music] all right this made 51 bottles and now we have to put the caps on here our bottle caps they're pretty cheap at the store this awesome tool I think was 15 bucks this caps it and keeps it airtight just like that we got a beer ready the beer does have to wait two weeks to carbonate but after that two weeks it's time to chill and get ready to enjoy some awesome cider and once again we are storing our cider our bottles even in the closet but after two weeks we get to drink these", "h0dRN_pTF9E": "it's like in rare form and like separates at the phone hey you good evening guys it's tinkin Lee in here what you're looking at is a pot of apples these apples were frozen we back in the summer they were a part of our Gleaners haul and they were prepackaged like free ones and i unpackaged all of them and you know I'm being real resourceful at that point so we are forgives for our family running another batch of apple pie moonshine I like to call this apple pie apple pie moonshine remix because this is the third time we've ran a batch at all and every time either gets tweaked lets cinnamon more cinnamon I still like the very very very first batch we made but you're talking to somebody that's not a real strong person with recipes and either I save them I lose them I forget so needless to say I'm gonna get better with that so in here was a entire ziplock bag of apples just regular old apples in here and this old Carlos and Rossi was some homemade cider that I made in the slow cooker then I kind of went a little bit heavy on the cloves so interestingly enough tanks behind me she's gonna come in with a couple of cinnamon sticks and what we're gonna do is just and let this cook for a little bit and then we're gonna come in and with three cups of brown sugar and one cup of white now we also just went to Kroger's and we got a gallon of Kroeber apple cider and then they're Gala apples or $2.99 that seemed a bit pricey to me but these are going biscuit back she's gonna be gifts so this batch Tommy made with love so we went for the galas and this is just gonna sit here and simmer and do its thing I'm relaxing just got off work this is our brand of the Kroger just apple cider you know it's not finding her from Trader Joe's but it's an apple juice apple cider baby oh it is apple cider okay so we've got that and my homemade concoction juice kind of going on all this is gonna come to like a rolling whatever and we have to pick my son up from work and when we pick him up our local liquor store that we frequent for we're making this we will pick up the spirits for this batch I'm off tomorrow so we're trying to knock some of these gifts out of the way while there's time and energy so we will get back with you all efforts cooking for some more like baby tastes takes a minute for the cameo appearance we gotta take again soon give me a potion like I told you ain't ready for that so it you know we're just gonna let this set and it's fun tonight I'm distressing and this is one of the many ways I D stress is by being in the kitchen with her and that's it so we're making apple pie moonshine tonight this is holiday style remix be back when you okay good evening guys it's well midnight honey and we're still up finishing up so the ones that black bag of apples and see what was this a fish - the cheese sauce cut this every clear and this vodka warranted tanks amazing juice it juice and he's a tester I don't know if he's too hot to try but we finally finished up our first batch of Christmas gifts here for our friends our third time making apple pie moonshine pretty impressed didn't take that long actually the whole house smells like what me apples apples and cinnamon thinks it ain't she headed up this whole project and got it all finished so we're excited and these old big Christmas gifts to family and friends on the holidays thanks for watching guys so we used freezer bag of apples and a little bit Everclear a little bit of vodka I had some already prepared apple cider that I made homemade and kind of went a little heavy on the cloves little brown sugar and Cheers thanks for watching guys peace you", "_POFdyEQB5Y": "hi this is Chris and welcome

a bail notification so you'll know every time I come out with a new one and a new video today I'll be making an experimental cider it's a peach apple cider hard cider so this is a cranberry apple cider and it turned out fabulous if you want to learn how to make these for yourself hit that subscribe button in the bail notification and today like I said we'll make it a peach cider so stay tuned today we'll be making a peach cider with the base is going to be apple juice but I'm gonna add one bag of these dried peaches that I got from the store it is six ounces so let's go over what you'll need of course you need the dried peaches you'll need yourself a one gallon fermenter I'm gonna need apple juice that has no preservatives I like the Indian summer brand I'm going to add some yeast nutrient and to boost alcohol content just a little I'm gonna add one cup of light brown sugar and today I will be using a red star cuvee but any white wine yeast will do so let's get started okay let's get started with this Apple's peach apple cider first I might like to add my dry ingredients some will add my brown sugar sometimes you got to add a little liquid to it you get that brown sugar down in there so that's what you got you juice for then I've chopped up I've chopped up the diced peaches and I'm just going to add them to it now normally I like to add any adjuncts to my cider that has sweetness to it in the secondary so this is kind of like a experiment to see if the tastes are any different in the primary they were probably slightly different but probably not enough for me to tell and I'm trying to simplify some of my ciders so I don't have to remember okay this one's done with fermentation so we'll stick it to the secondary and we'll add our adjuncts then I want to add everything let it go and then when it's done it's done I don't have to poke and tinker with it later so hopefully this will come out fine and that's what's good about these one gallon batches they're essentially experiments every single one of them is an experiment so don't be afraid to try something new and something different on these one gallon batches that's the beauty of them all right we got our peaches added we're gonna add the rest mostly of our juice we're gonna give it a little bit of headroom so when we shake it up when we shake it up it'll have room to dissolve and move around so when we shake it up so we can dissolve all that sugar now this is a cider and main difference between a cider and apple wine is basically alcohol content you add much more sugar to an a wine to boost it up a cider typically runs less than about 7% alcohol by volume and anything above that really considered a wine so I'm going to shake this up and incorporate all this sugar in the bottom just enough to boost the alcohol content a little bit but not enough to to make it a wine so I'm gonna shake this up and we'll be right back all right I got it all shook up mm-hmm shaking it up those two things if course it dissolves all the sugar that's in there also you adding oxygen to your it's called a must now you're adding oxygen to your must oxygen before fermentation is good oxygen after fermentation is bad that's when you get vinegar so we want to add the oxygen right now now I'm going to add a little bit since it's wintertime especially since it's winter time I'm gonna add our you give our little yeast Easter nutrient so we're gonna give us a teaspoon of this yeast nutrient all right [Applause] alright ok we've added our yeast nutrient we're going to now finish adding our our juice to it you want it right at the bottom of the neck all right we got our yeast nutrient we got our oxygen in there now all these all we need now is the little yeast ease like I said I'm going to be using a red star cuvee make sure that's what I got you a premier cuvee but any white wine used to do but just red star cuvee and premier blunt arts my two favorites so we just pour it in there with ciders I never do a starter I've half once it seemed that really no difference give it a little swirl and your airlock and you are finished so we'd be back to wrap things up alright I took my first initial hydrometer reading it was the starting gravity was one point zero four or five so basically when this is done it'll be about five and a half six percent alcohol just how I like it fermentation will take about a week to two weeks seven to ten days and I'm gonna let it sit in there a month bottle it let it sit in the bottle I'm a bottle conditioned all my ciders so they'll be sparkling so I'll let it sit in the bottle for another three weeks to a month they'll get good and carbonate it and then I enjoy so if you like what you see here please hit that subscribe button in the bail

red beard and this is a daily drink vlog featuring a hard soda / cider for the Heartstone / cider above the today [Music] we've got a can of spiced apple cider by the Thornbury village cidery oh yeah spiced apple cider I don't know what to expect except depict always expect cat ears there's they're there all the time everywhere let's crack her open see what we've got not expecting you know any real haze right it's actually a little bit darker than I would have expected I have to say that actually looks like a beer or something yeah really quite very looking you see me through a little bit yep that smells like apple pie like apple with spices in it wow that smells incredible like exactly like a fresh apple pie let's give her a shot [Music] oh my good god it's liquefied apple pie the cinnamon and nutmeg and other it this is [ __ ] incredible are you serious hey apple pie let's do this cheers everybody oh my god this is some of the best [ __ ] i have ever drank ever ever oh my god i can't believe that like during the week of the pumpkin okay a couple beers were tried that were very similar to pumpkin pie but they weren't even half as close to full on pumpkin pie as this is too full on apple pie this is bloody incredible and yep my nose curse was missing there it is okay today being December 11th on this date 1816 Indiana became the 19th date who cares on this date 1907 the news view in parliament buildings are almost completely destroyed by fire that was kind of interesting because I'm assuming not anybody died or very few people died because New Zealand's biggest death toll due to fire i believe is 41 just a thing that stuck in my head it's a small number [Music] it's so good so good our cider master maker nope our master cider maker created this unique cider from the juice of a special blend of one hundred percent fresh pressed Canadian apples delicately balanced with carefully selected spices its flavor is a perfect balance of sweetness soft cinnamon with a hint of caramel that will be sure to remind you of apple pie serve trill chilled or try heated you know I bet that would actually be pretty damn tasty if it was heated up like a hot apple cider or something ingredients is fermented apple juice fresh pressed apple juice cane sugar natural spice flavor and caramel actual caramel in there oh we don't have any kind of date which there's whatever that means 6259 that could be a full-on date code I've seen other ones where they say like the first one would be the month and then the second one would be the day of the year so if that's true it's definitely not super fresh but it's still bloody amazing that's all we got in there five point three percenter [Music] yep I just burped up some apple pie on the state 1941 germany and italy declared war on the United States because America declared war on Japan because of Pearl Harbor so then the US declared war on Germany and Italy like what do you clear war on you yeah well we declare war on you too like stupid book stupid war [Music] this is like really close to that peach cider as far as like in the running for the best cider stuff I have ever had in my lifetime I'd almost like put them even though they're still not really comparable apple cider peach cider it's like comparing apples and peaches not as an order just kind of thing on this date in 1962 Arthur Lucas convicted of murder was the last person to be executed in Canada I believe he was hung I think that's what we used to do here yeah we haven't had the death penalty for a while and we're doing okay as opposed to like the states where they still have it in a bunch of places and people are all up in arms if anyone who talks about getting rid of it [Music] hmm just say like one of the big things America just doesn't seem to be very good at accepting any kind of big change as a whole the whole country someone either Marv just so stuck in the past mentally then it's really kind of sad did you think about it all this date in 1972 apollo 17 became the sixth and final Apollo mission to land on the moon yeah 1972 was the last time humanity visited the moon that's actually kind of pathetic music on it right really and funny to that no other country besides the state's ever actually sent a man mission to like China's got a big space program going on like Russia big space pray that blablabla program going on it just seems kind of weird to me unlike the flavor of this which is just amazing to me like if you're a fan of apple pie and who the hell isn't a fan of apple pie seriously and hair floating around my eye yeah if you like apple pie full of cat hair then come try to my house otherwise try it on your own time and it'll probably be free of pears she's right there sleeping thinking she's she's all that shady [ __ ] I [Music] really can't get over how exact they got the flavor profile on this finally on this date in 1994 a bomb exploded on Philippine Airlines flight 434 on the way to Tokyo Japan killing only one person the captain was able to safely land the plane [Music] that's like unheard of for anything to happen on a plane involving fatality and only one person dying that's usually it's like everybody on the plane or everyone's fine kind of thing excuse me again here cheers to you captain guy for being able to save the plane and in a member of the memory of the death of the one person who died that's kill the spicy cider stuff drink never last [Music] thornbury your spiced apple cider that's like a 10.5 assuming that that is a date code that means what I think it means if not then we knock it down to like a 9.5 or something regardless that is one of the best cans of anything that has ever gone over my taste buds man that's gonna do it for today's daily drink vlog thank

put some comments in the box down below but thanks again and I'll be back with other daily drink blog tomorrow a pip many more cans of that will be purchased and consumed by the me so good you", "oh6hi7KILx4": "hello there everybody how are you doing happy home-brew Wednesday so I'm brewing a caramel apple cider here and this is kind of an experiment for me because I've never done this one before I've seen it on some other channels and my friends d45 CA has also brewed one up so what I'm doing here is I'm steeping 200 grams of crystal 30 grains for about 30 minutes and after this I'll be bringing it to with boil and then reducing it to add some fermentable 's okay so in this scene I'm adding 500 grams of yellow golden sugar I'm just going to add a dan\u00eds about a half a package of what I bought yeah and I had her in there and stir it up really good and this is after the boil so I've taken it off the burner of course and just starting to let it cool down all right I'm giving it a good stir here as well it's looking real good in the pot there nice and dark okay and here I'm adding in I decided since I had some lactose left over that I would try to back sweeten it just a little bit with some lactose so I'm adding in three heaping tablespoons of the lactose and just to see how this is gonna fare out with well you know after fermentation add the Santa give it a good stir Oh kidioki and goes the the mixture into the sanitized growler of mine it's only a one gallon as you can see gonna pour her in here now and top her up with the apple juice at my also going to add some yeast nutrient alright and this is the East nutrient that I'm using yeah I added it half a teaspoon of this into the mixture it goes and here we go with topping her up with just regular apple juice buy it anywhere supermarket Walmart wherever you can get apple juice this is just regular stuff it's not low acid or anything like that kind of top her up and then I'm gonna give her a good stir good shake and a good stir and this is adding a little bit more from a second jug that I had I wanted to make sure I had extra apple juice so I didn't run short getting giving the growler a little bit of a shake here now and now giving it a pretty good stir before I'm ready to add my yeast and of course topping it back up just a little bit more all right so what I've done here is I didn't want to add my full package of yeast to one gallon so what I've done is I taken the package of Coopers ale yeast and I've separated into two tablespoons kind of evenly if best I could do and I'm just gonna add one tablespoon to the mixture okay so in goes the east and getting ready to seal it and let it go for however long it needs probably two weeks or so and here I am putting the rest of the yeast back in the package and I'm going to reseal it and I'm gonna put it back in the fridge just in case it didn't start fermenting so hold on to that for a couple of weeks and if I don't use it all toss it all right so here's the final product it's in the in the growler and it's getting ready to start fermenting away and hopefully you know in three weeks time four weeks time it'll be ready to go all ready to taste cheers everybody keep your mugs full 17", "q76nWM6fwuw": "hello welcome to mr paul's pantry i'm mr paul nice to see you all back here again but if you're new a very warm welcome now today my recipe is something that is truly british but is eaten all over the world it is actually an apple crumble apple crumbles were really a product of world war ii when things were rationed people didn't have enough ingredients to make pastry to make a pie so what they did was they made the pastry and then instead of rolling it out in to make a lid for a pie or a base what they did was they crumbled it up on top of the apples or the fruit whatever they had so that everybody got a little bit but it wasn't actually using many ingredients so that's how it came about so i'm going to show you the ingredients now here and what we need is first of all apples i'm using four granny smith apples here i've tried other things but i think apples are very difficult to come by especially brambles and things like that if you don't live in england you can get granny smiths almost anywhere so that's why i'm recommending i use those four granny smiths i'm using sugar flour half a teaspoon of baking powder the rind and juice of uh some juice of the lemon not all of it a quart a half a teaspoon sorry should i say no i bake your pardon a quarter of a teaspoon of ground cloves some unsalted butter and my special little ingredient is some cider so there we are we'll get on with making the uh crumble now and i hope you enjoy it first of all we're going to prep the apples so we'll peel the apples first we are just do these quickly i'll rush through this process i don't you don't want to sit watching me peel apples all afternoon or evening or whatever time it is where you are i don't know how you peel and call your apples but i find this the easiest way and the least wasteful i watched some so-called celebrity chefs on television peeling and chopping things they appear to throw away more than they actually use so anyway we'll speed through this again now we're going to cut the apples into smallish pieces there we are about an inch and half about an inch pieces that's all we don't want very small tiny pieces and we don't want great big lumps sticking out of the top of the fumble either there we are that should do as nicely so now we're going to zest the lemon [Music] if you haven't got a zester like this you can use a very fine grater or if necessary you can use a potato peeler and then shred it up very very fine okay but i use this little zester which is quite handy so we need the zest of one lemon [Music] and the juice of half a lemon i'm just running that through the sieve just to catch the seeds i don't want to be picking those out afterwards and there's the juice of half a lemon without the seeds next goes in the sugar followed by the quarter teaspoon of clove groud cloves some people like to use cinnamon i don't use that at all i use cloves and in goes the cider then we're going to give them all a nice little mix first of all light the gas and we're going to warm those up now and let them start cooking for about five or six minutes what i am going to do is i'm going to put the lid on that way we will keep them nice and moist okay now that's been five minutes cooking the apples and depending on which apples you're using you may get quite a lot of liquid out of them you may not get very much because don't forget we've only put that very small amount of 50 milliliters of cider in but i've got quite a bit of juice in there as you can see so what i'm going to do i don't want to waste that so here i've got a teaspoon full of corn flour corn starch if you want to call it that and a tablespoon of cold water mix that into a little slurry pop that in turn up the gas and that will just thicken the juice in there so it doesn't make your crumble topping go all soggy i'll show you that in a moment when it's can you see now how it's thickening up the juice there can you see now what we need to do now is we need to take that off the heat and notice the apples haven't fallen down to a mush like an apple sauce they will do if you use all bramley apples i only use if i use bramleys i use just a few bramlees and the rest cox is orange pippin or something like that if i'm in england here in spain i can't buy anything like that so i've told you i only use granny smiths they need to go now to one side and left to cool and we'll get on with making the topping i'm going to put in first of all the flour plus the half a teaspoon of baking powder please note this is not this will not work properly if you use self-raising flour because there's too much baking powder in the self-raising flour to make this work so i'm using plain flour all-purpose and a half a teaspoon of baking powder and then in goes 100 grams of butter so it's 200 of flour 100 of butter [Music] and we're going to rub that in now with our fingers it's not necessary for this little bit of paste um topping to put it into a mix you can do it in your food processor if you want but we'll just break it up get it incorporated with the flour and what we're looking for is rough looking breadcrumbs we're not looking for something smooth like sand because if you do when your crumble comes out of the oven the top will be smooth like sand it won't be crumbly at all so we're getting it all mixed in there nice now you can see that it's nice and crumbly i'm going to mix in now the sugar now i have a little secret when i make my topping normally people who make crumbles would just put that on top now as it is not me i'm going to add one two tablespoons of cold water and we start to just fluff that around we don't want to squeeze it squash it we don't want to squash it together like a pastry but it will start to fall form clumps can you see that in the bowl i'll just show you just get it off my fingers you can see that in the bowl there it's just starting to form clumps so it's not going to be a smooth powdery topping it will be a nice crunchy topping so we'll get that into the get the apples into the bowl and get this on top now you may also like to try my homemade apple pie if you follow the little eye icon i'm not sure whether it's in this top corner or that top corner uh if you press on that sometime you will take you to my recipe for making the apple pie which is delightful and you can enjoy that with either homemade ice cream which i have a recipe on there as well for on my website or some homemade custard so let's get on and get this crumble together now right now i'm going to use this oven proof dish you can see inside it's a bit crazy a bit like me i i do get comments on most of my videos saying how old my equipment looks well i can tell you i've got very little modern equipment in my kitchen in fact this dish i'm using here to my knowledge is 40 years old as far as i know so that's going to have the apples in there so off we go apples you can see how now the juice has thickened right up so it's not going to make the topping soggy level it out and now for the crumble topping we're going to put on top here spread it all around if you see any very large clumps you can break them up if you want but i'm trying to work left handed here for the camera i'm sorry about that i can't do it okay so there we are we're going to just smooth that over a couple of large lumps there we don't want can you see what i meant about the nice little lumps those would be lovely and crunchy now this is going to go in the oven now set at 200 degrees for 30 minutes and i'll be back to show you the result well there it is you can see it nice crumbly crunchy and still bubbling straight from the oven i'm going to let that cool for a short while and then we're going to have a taste now we'll see what what it's like and here we have the nice creamy homemade custard i think you've got to agree that looks very very inviting i'm going to have a little taste now it's absolutely delightful absolutely delicious [Music] well i hope you've enjoyed the video it's very very hot in here today i'm glad to get it finished so go underneath

for now and i'll see you next time bye", "cg42zeDhf6Y": "[Applause] [Music] hi I'm Jerry James Stone in today's video I'm going to talk about the difference between apple juice and apple cider let's get to it okay so you're probably have seen in the store there's apple juice and there's apple cider right and there's no real easy way to tell the difference do you want to know why there is no difference they're actually the same for the most part in fact if you look at like popular brands like Martinelli's they will even tell you on their website they label the same juice apple cider and apple juice completely different packaging they only do it for marketing purposes because some people prefer apple juice and some people prefer apple cider but there's actual no difference in the product now there's a little bit of a caveat to that so some places do actually have rules like some states have rules for what apple cider can be and what apple juice can be so there is a good rule of thumb when it comes to apple cider it typically tends to be juice that's pressed from the apples but then it's not completely unfiltered or even pasteurized right so it's kind of the most raw form of apple juice that you can get apple juice itself tends to be pasteurized and filtered so it's clean and crisp and lasts a lot longer so that's kind of the main differences there's a few states that do have laws that that's how that has to be produced but overall there's really no difference between the two the one main difference here in the u.s. is apple cider outside of the US is usually what we call hard cider so that typically is alcoholic apple cider here it's not always alcoholic that's one of the main differences but when it comes to the products themselves between apple juice and apple cider we're kind of the same for the most part if you like this tip hey give me a thumbs up there's something that you want to know about when it comes to food drop a comment below and if you like to cook drink or eat like I do subscribe I release new videos every single week see you guys next time [Music] [Applause] you you", "PHHS7vm-rgQ": "what's going on guys welcome back I'm going to do another random short video for this video we're doing a ciders gonna be cranberry apple so we're using approximately two gallons of cranberry juice as cranberry cocktail and four gallons of apple juice and to give us some more body we're gonna use two cans of concentrated I think this one's grape I could've playing cranberry so we're using that some nutrient yeast and this is not necessary I'm only using it just to make sure that I have enough nutrients for the fermentation and we're using a dry hopper or a little tea hopper and this what I'm going to use to put some hops just to give it a little bit more depth to our cider so let's get started okay so now we have a concentrated rainy we're going to go ahead and pour that in it concentrates in we're going to add half a teaspoon of yeast nutrient now we're gonna go ahead and add my cranberry juice [Music] [Music] so we got everything mixed up as you can see our gravity is about close to one point zero four zero we want to bring that up to about one point five zero over five five so we're going to add some regular table sugar six gallon so I'm going to be adding about a third of a cup of sugar per gallon so it's gonna be two cups of sugar we mix that in all right we added the two cups of sugar and this is our gravity reading which is perfect for what I want now we're going to add the yeast set the the dry hopper and we're good to go I'm going to be getting about half an ounce of Citra hops so we're gonna using the dry hopper but before that I want to point out on my airlock on if you could see it I drilled out a small hole and that's where we're going to be hooking our dry hopper maybe using the red star five for the yeast we get everything done now we were just gonna drop in the dry hopper with the lid and that's pretty much it we're gonna let it ferment for two weeks then after two weeks we're gonna bottle and we're gonna enjoy Cheers", "uu8TUlwuhTM": "hey I know you're probably wondering what I'm doing out here and to blowing snow and all that stuff it's so cold out it's about I think it's like 3 degrees out here right now and we've got a ton of snow but tomorrow I'm gonna be doing a lot of stuff on my smokers I might have several of these running I've got to do some turkeys and a pork loin and a spiral cut ham and some pies and stuff for friends and family and our family for the huffard Thanksgiving which is tomorrow and I'm not gonna be doing that today I'm not gonna show you that today but what I am gonna show you is a drink that I make some people call it apple pie moonshine some people just call it apple pie 3 personally I like to call it my sniffing sneezing shaking coughing stuff your head commode hugging laying in the front yard naked medicine so let me get through with this snow and we'll get inside and I'll show you how we make that [Music] okay guile the snow shoveled out there got everything ready to start smoking that stuff tonight we've got quite a bit we're going to be smoking tonight so we're gonna get started on our apple pie moonshine whatever you want to call it you know what I called it out there so the first thing we're gonna do we're gonna start off we're going to put in one gallon of apple juice into a big pan just gonna pour it over in here the whole gallon there's gonna be some really good stuff here all right I'm sitting right here we're gonna save these jokes but we're gonna need them you'll see all right I got a cup and a half of brown sugar then I'm just gonna dump in there I got a cup and a half of white sugar that I'm just gonna dump in there this is not keto friendly so be prepared I've got ten cinnamon sticks just raw cinnamon sticks I'm gonna drop in there and now I'm going to put in about ten whole cloves all right got ten of them I'm just gonna drop them in there now we're gonna add two cups of water to this and we're gonna get it on the stove and we're gonna get it to a ball and we're gonna ball it you let it boil for about 30 minutes and I'll be back and I'll show you how we're gonna do that so I'm going to get the water in the two cups of water in this and get it on the stove get it balling so be right back okay our apple juice and our cinnamon and sugar and everything they it's balled 30 minutes we just pulled it off now we're going to add in one gallon of apple cider it's still hot so we're going to just add in this one gallon of apple cider okay and we're just going to give it a good stir and you want to you'll notice whenever this gets about 30 minutes because your cinnamon sticks will start unwrapped unrolling really good that's when you'll know it's about done and it reduces itself the apple juice will reduce itself a little bit so all right we've got this all mixed up now we're just going to let this sit here and it's got to cool completely it's got to be room temperature when we touch it again well let's just cool to room temperature and I'll rewrite be right back and we'll show you how we finish this up we'll even try something okay our apple juice and our apple cider has cooled down and now we're gonna do the finishing touches on it and what I have here is I have one bottle of 190-proof Everclear that I'm gonna stir into it if totally cooled down you had you have to make sure it cools completely before you start adding in and just to go along with the Coppa this is for ages 21 and older okay we've got that added now the next thing we're gonna add is one pint of Captain Morgans hundred proof rum and we're going to stir that in stir it in real good okay and we're just going to stir this up really well and our apple pie moonshine will be just about ready to go just makes good Christmas gifts every time I make this I have people all my friends everything showing up with their quart jars wanting it and I give it to Christmas gift this stuff is really good but you want to keep this away from the children because this stuff is spout tasting just like a pit you're eating a piece of apple pie but it's got one hell of a kick okay get this stirred up now what I've got I've got a pint jar here that I've got a funnel in and I'm using a coffee filters and what I'm gonna do I'm going to because you've got some pieces of a cinnamon stick that are still floating in this and I'm just gonna pour this in there and it takes a little bit for it to run down but that's okay and you just want to dip this in and the reason I said to save those gallon jugs is because you can also put it back to the gallon jugs and then just fill pints or cords or whenever you need it so let me sit this down here and a little bit this and I'm gonna go ahead and get these done and soon as we get this done I'll be back and put on a taste test some of this okay there's what it looked like in each pint I always put a cinnamon stick in it you know to give away but I store it in these gallon jugs that the apple cider and apple juice come out of you put it in a refrigerator and then if some if you want to give some for Christmas or whatever your friend shows up most take some home you get a pint jar with a lid though you send them a stick in it just pour it over in it and makes great gifts and that eggnog you're drinking throw it out you're gonna want to you're going to want to drink this but I got me a little bit here I'm gonna give it a taste test [Music] it tastes just like you're eating a piece of pie right there a piece of apple pie yeah buddy that stuff's good well I hope you give this a try because I'm telling you you will definitely like it everyone have a wonderful Thanksgiving and let's remember our military personnel that are serving all over the world they're not going to be home for Thanksgiving they're let's keep everybody and I thought all of those people our thoughts and prayers that's also keeping our thoughts and prayers all the people working in law enforcement that's gonna be working on the holidays I want to send a special thanks out to all of them everyone have a happy Thanksgiving and we'll see you after the holidays on the next video you", "HvWiDEXq8fw": "today we're gonna make a sweet sparkling spiced cider that's what she said okay so yeah like we said this is actually step one of a multi-step set of videos where we're gonna try to keep it in small amounts so that you can get it all but we're going to end up with in the end is bottles of a spiced cider that has carbonation and still tastes sweet it all starts very very simple to do this you will need a 1 gallon fermenter with a small enough top so you can put a bung in there and an airlock you will need to have kale actually you need one gallon of apple juice or apple cider if you're in the u.s. that's the cloudy stuff if you're in Europe you have no idea what I just said you just each use a funnel we're now using this stainless steel one that is food grade our old black one if you ever saw it has been removed from our stores and our links because we found out that it's not so food great so we decided to stop using it you will also not need but good equipment to have a turkey baster a graduated cylinder and a hydrometer also known as a hydrometer for measuring sugar levels we're going to be using safe ASO for ale yeast for this why am i using an alias well for one it's the last packet that I have of this particular least I like this particular lease and I don't want to go bad I'm going to use half this packet though because I do have a rule up to three gallons you use half a packet over three gallons you use the whole packet add three gallons whatever mood strikes you that particular day is what you should do but first we're gonna start with a little word about juice mm-hmm I was just gonna get to that okay this is from Aldi this is probably the most basic juice you can get and it's probably fairly easy to get even during the kovat 19 lockdown hopefully people can still get it ingredients apple juice from concentrate water and apple juice concentrate that in itself is not a bad thing okay I would prefer if it was not from concentrate first but it was it is it's just how it goes sometimes ascorbic acid in parentheses it says vitamin C that's all it is that's actually only there just to kind of keep the color going it doesn't really do anything there's probably not very much in it at all to harm anything there is no sulfite there is no sorbate in here that's important if you have those things in your juice it may not ferment we've had people that it did in that case what you want to do is whole pack it for a gallon give it the best shot you can okay sometimes you can overpower it some people say heating it I'm not convinced on those things but sometimes there is naturally-occurring sulfites in juices and that's why they have to list it it's not that they added anything they're naturally-occurring sometimes people have gotten past that and gotten it to ferment okay that's the best I can say on it I prefer stuff that doesn't have it there's plenty on the market so if you can get stuff that doesn't have it go for how are we gonna do this really really simple first all these things were sanitized in and this being that I just opened it was actually sanitary inside all I'm gonna do is pour some in mr. Kurtz not some all of it do not worry about sloshing splashing and whatnot you want to get some oxygen in this brew oxygen in the first stages of fermentation is what yeast need notice I said first stages of fermentation because the quantity that's in here is nothing you want that to build a colony so that they can go to town chowing down on all that apple juice now second one I probably won't use the whole thing you want to leave a little bit of room in case it starts to bubble up so it doesn't bubble through the airlock and make a mess okay that's the only real reason in secondary you don't want headspace but that's another show okay so I used all but you know a couple ounces but you know what I'm gonna do with that and this leads us to a good thing to think about if you like the flavor of the juice before you ferment it more than likely you're gonna like what you from it this particular juice is a little bit on the tart side you want to taste it it's got a little bit of the tartness of Apple's I taste a lot of sweet apples in this now some people will say that using juice from the store is not the best way to make cider they're not wrong if you have access to apples that grow about that big in your backyard or from a friend use those it's a whole different animal to try to do explain how to do that but basically you juice them put it in a jar and you're at the same stage weed arm we live in Florida thus we don't have access to homegrown apples because I believe apples are one those fruits that require freezing yeah because they don't like to really go for it so what I have here is are filled ferment oh oh oh oh my goodness I'm going to cut this open for anybody else no I did not sanitize my Swiss Army knife you'd be amazed people out did you sanitize your hat you sanitize that cap yeah i sanitized my cat seriously all right so as I said about half the packet I'm gonna eyeball it there's really no reason to get too anal about this because right there is probably all the yeast I need a word about yeast hydration we have learned that it is not actually necessary to hydrate it in a liquid that makes this a whole lot simpler because here's the thing it's gonna hydrate in this liquid yeah I don't even need to mix it it's just gonna fall through and hydrate because it's in a liquid but what I do want to do it's not actually meant to do it before I put the Easter yeah take your reading I wanna take a reading so I'm just gonna put my thumb saver stopper in this and give this a little bit of shake this Eric's as well as it's least out of the way so I can actually get a reading there's no extra sugar or anything in this you might have noticed this is not going to be a high ABV thing this is more like a beer okay it's gonna be like four to six percent so we're not range we will find out in a moment well not really sort of find out where it's gonna be now when you add your yeast directly to your Roux we really should have done the reading ahead of time yeah cuz I'm just sucking it up now doesn't matter really but it would have been neater what have I ever been known for being okay most juices that you buy off the shelf run anywhere from 1050 to 1055 this particular one is one point zero five zero which means this could come out to somewhere in the six to eight percent range however there's other things that we're going to do to this that may alter that but that's another show just gonna pour that right back in next step aside from writing down that number that I just gave is an airlock and stopper all right airlock and stopper these are important some people believe in doing open fermentations and there's nothing wrong with that what that means is they put it in a bucket and they put like cheesecloth over the top or something like that that's all well and good we're likely they don't live in a small house with seven cats I wasn't really gonna admit how many cats but we have cats they shed and leave hair everywhere it gets in places where I didn't even know we had places okay and in the communities I don't really want to drink that cuz you know nobody likes it or you know hey have some of this friend but watch out for the cat hair nobody really wants to do that so that's why we like to use airlocks plus it works nice it keeps it tidy and we don't really worry about it what does the airlock actually do well what it does is gases are gonna be formed in here as the yeast ferments the sugars that are present in the juice they're gonna be forced up here and down this side where it pushes the water to the other side and air bubbles will start to go through that's why these are called bubblers okay what it also does that's the one way part the other way is it keeps things from going through the water and back into your brew things like flies fruit flies love this stuff someone asked the other day do you put the cap on your airlock yes I do they also ask does that make it explode and I said there's holes in it so no it doesn't make it explode now if for some reason your particular airline doesn't have holes poked some yeah make some holes in that there little tiny hole it needs to be air flow yeah they're just small holes to keep larger flies and bugs out but that's the gist of what that four so you're probably wondering we said spice decider that's right we did you'll see that in another installment of this video this was just to get the cider going and I don't mind that Thor just jumped up now because his timing was much better than it would have been had we not had the airlock in yet that is Thor by the way who is probably wondering what the heck is going on he's freaking out anyway what's gonna happen next this will go under my desk or somewhere in this house for fermentation and it'll sit for probably at least two weeks okay we get this question a lot how many days does it take to ferment well there's no way to really know we took a reading on this I'm expecting this to go completely dry safe al so4 is like eight or nine percent tolerance East this should go completely dry I want it to go completely dry it's about control this is a very simple simple brew but it's all about control and it's gonna teach a lot of basics of how to do things in brewing and from this series of videos you can go in all different directions with things and that's why we wanted to do this for you so we're keeping this one simple for today and as always guys thanks for watching have a great day [Music]", "9EcmHMlgMoo": "hey everyone animal man here today I'm going to do a really fun project with you and I shouldn't have to say it but to cover my butt I will this is for adults ages 21 or older we were going to learn how to make our own homemade hard apple cider and you can make a whole gallon of it just from the store-bought apple juice probably for five bucks which is really really cool and it takes seven days to make it so if you started now seven days from now you can been enjoying this for the holidays so you can get everything from you there's a supermarket or at Walmart which is pretty awesome you need a gallon of apple juice this is just signature kitchens Apple Hughes they got straws think it was four dollars and change to get this and you just want to make sure that whatever Apple you should get has no preservative this says filtered water now we'll just concentrate a sorbic acid which is vitamin C that's okay you just don't want anything that's going to interfere with with the yeast and kill the yeast we're going to use so do you then girl the baking aisle you get one packet of yeast and I try this with four different types like I tried every year so they had the store and I made a batch to see how they taste they all taste very very different but one of them that I had tasted kind of like champagne one of them tasted a little bit of had a little bite to it little sharpness to it and this one was the best the pizza yeast that I used it tasted horrible not taste good that's all the one that didn't work it didn't taste good but this one this is essential everyday old actual active dry yeast and they come in three packs like this so you get through I think pack like this for like two bucks something something crazy cheap like that here's a good shot of the yeast you can find this yeast it ends up tasting kind of like cider jack so all the other really you need is a birthday balloon you may even have these lying around the house or you can just go buy it back so here's what we do we're gonna open up our juice gonna pour four ounces into this measuring cup and you can drink it or whatever drink it or throw it out doesn't matter so four ounces that gives us some space now waste doesn't bubble over and we're gonna add the yeast we're gonna cut this open and he had it in there I swear this multi-tool I use this like every single day for things one of the best things ever walk we yeah the yeast right in there this yeast activates pretty quick put the cap back on nice and tiny they're gonna shake the heck out of it shake the crap [Applause] you just want all that yeast took this all in little water you don't want to see any chunks on the bottom later on it looks good so we're going to take the cap we're gonna give it a rinse stare decides you're gonna need it later on and what this blue is for this is our airlock if you get really into brewing your own beer and stuff you can buy professional airlocks that are pretty cheap and what airlock does is it allows gas from the fermentation which is co2 to come out to escape that way this thing doesn't explode but it does not allow stuff you don't want in there you know think of this like you know it's like a balancer it keeps unwanted guests from entering the party in there you don't want other East's bacterial stuff in there left side to this yeast and this keeps it out of there so you just stretch it right over the cap stretch this right over and that forms a good enough steel to keep stuff now you're gonna see this balloon inflate by tomorrow this should be inflating a little bit when I did these test batches this yeast made the balloon almost twelve inches across by day three it was almost full size it's pretty cool to watch your your blue and slowly deflating check it a few times a day oh and you don't need to worry about sanitizing the balloon you don't have to worry about the yeast or anything like that because if there are any other germs that get in here by accident there aren't too many ways for it to get in there but it does get in there this yeast is gonna ferment this into alcohol in seven days that is so quick that if any germs start to multiply in there soon as it turns to alcohol alcohol is just gonna kill it all so it's not even gonna be a problem at all I promise it's gonna be totally fine so you leave it like this room temperature seven days you'll see this bloated flame then you take the blow it off throw it out and you're going to either drink it as it is or what you do is you have a second bottle one gallon junk that's cleaned out with soap and water and dry and this is called racking what you do is you slowly pour this into that other one and what you'll see is at the bottom of this there's going to be all this weight stuff on the bottom that's called the leaves and you don't want that that's all like the dead the dead yeast and byproducts of the East furmity fermenting and everything and you want to leave that in the jug so you pour it into a second one clean out this jog wash it out real good pour it back in there and then you can drink it like that and that'll keep any off tastes from entering your your brew you've made and it's about 5% alcohol somewhere around there depending on what you used to use that kind of thing if you want to carbonate it what you would do now is you need to spend a second week on this so the carbonated it you take two tablespoons of brown sugar which you may even have in your pantry we already have in our pantry put that right in there and now you're going to put the cap on and let it ferment to room temperature for another seven days and that brown sugar will activate all the leftover yeast that's floating around getting the apple cider and that'll start to carbonate it you'll see it starts to get more and more and more firm if you look at these ones I did here these ones have been carbonating for a week with the brown sugar and look it's like the bottle starting to puff out the label popped off the bottom is like bowing out a little bit and you can feel it when you like push on it it's getting very very hard after seven days of carbon eating it to shut the yeast down to stop carbonating you then refrigerate it and that you know kind of makes the yeast I'll go to sleep and then you're ready to roll you've got carbonated one gallon of carbonated hard apple cider you've made it yourself for less than five bucks hope you guys enjoy this", "d6VZHeHEhc4": "all right everybody today we're gonna have an instructional video on how to make clown box sevens tactical moonshine what i like to use is one half gallon of apple cider from concentrate i don't like to use the fresh apple cider because it's already pasteurized and when you boil it it actually takes away the flavor and makes it all flaky and chunky i prefer to use the mott's natural fresh crushed apple juice not from concentrate but i didn't have any of that so today we're going to use natural apple juice from concentrate so you need a half gallon of apple juice you need a half gallon of apple cider and most importantly you need some grain alcohol i get this grain alcohol from connecticut we live in massachusetts so we don't obviously can't get it but this is 95 percent alcohol 190 proof what you're also going to need is one cup of white sugar and one cup of dark brown sugar i prefer to use dark brown and cinnamon sticks this is very important what you can also do in my recipe i add a little bit of pumpkin pie spice and pure vanilla extract a lot of people don't put any of this in there but i seem to find if i put these spices in there it tastes more like a pie and not a cider so what you want to do is bring your mixture to a full boil add your ingredients add your ingredients your sugar your cinnamon sticks bring that to a boil take it down to a mild simmer and let that run for 20 minutes after it's completely cool because this stuff's extremely flammable after it's completely cool i put four cups four cups of this alcohol into this mixture and it's not too much where it's overpowering but it gives it a good flavor grain alcohol has absolutely no flavor if anybody's ever tried it so it works out pretty good i used to do it with two and a half to three cups and it just didn't have enough punch so now that i use four cups it seems that people enjoy this and it brings them to a different state of mind during the holiday season so this has been clown box 7 and this is my tactical moonshine i hope you enjoy have a happy holiday", "5sz7jBmJKeI": "hello this is melodyday massage therapist and my friend Ruth friend client Ruth she had a great idea for a gift she makes for Christmas for people a holiday adult beverage called apple pie and I wanted to show you that really cool recipe in case you have people you don't know what to make for them it's a great little drink that's okay it's really potent so it's a sipping drink or a shot you know they drink a lot of it so it's a nice little gift I'll be back so you take two gallons of apple cider which you get in the app where the fresh produce is at so we take two gallons of apple cider one gallon of apple juice and it can be generic apple juice and you take three apples so my husband didn't see the directions and he started this before I was home and he accidentally cut the apples but you want to have them whole apples so and you pour the middle out and you just let them simmer in it and you try not to let it boil or the apples it's starting to boil the apples will disintegrate and then you have to strain it at the end but you are simmer for three hours two gallons of apple cider one gallon of apple juice the three green apples cord but keep them whole and then ten cinnamon sticks and you simmer for three hours I'll be back third simmered for three hours we actually took the little apples out after two hours because they were starting to fall apart but if you keep him talling you don't have to pull them out unless you see them starting to just integrate and pull them out pull out the sand and sticks you take a fifth of vodka and it's fixed I've ever clear and you add it to the apple cider apple juice a cup and a half of scotch it can be any scotch not the cheapest not the most expensive whatever you want to add to it and then you put it back slightly back on and that three hours of simmering you have the lid on - and you put it on the low simmer like number three on an electric stove for a half an hour so after its cooled for three hours you I kinda need to strain it so I'm gonna take a big old strain it doesn't look like there's much too much in there actually I don't see any in that there were some floaties earlier and when you pour it into your jar I made a little label apple pie hundred plus proof so make your little labors I got these jars at IKEA for like a couple dollars each or a doll or something hey you take a cinnamon stick half a cinnamon stick hey drop it in your and you pour it in you jar and you have to keep it refrigerated all the time and you have a nice little gift for your friends but remember it's super potent and it tastes like apple pie and keep it frigerator and there you go oops I probably should switch that around enjoy be really careful with this cuz it tastes really good and it tastes like apple pie and have fun giving your friends presents bye bye Happy Holidays Merry Christmas I forgot to mention the longer it's in the fridge the better it tastes so it lasts over a year in the fridge but only to keep in the fridge okay now I'm say goodbye bye bye", "zL00pxdlels": "oh yeah we're live and it must be thanksgiving day because along with drinks with david's sign there's turkey and some pie the eaten part of the turkeys on the back we couldn't hide the eaten part of the pie all right time for a cocktail and thank you larry for that extended introduction welcome back friends to another edition of the ever evolving explorations of the world of cocktails we call drinks with david today is a special post-prandial thanksgiving edition for those of you who are not completely comatose from having consumed all the food today but in keeping with our ongoing theme this week which is tea day treats and what could be more appropriate to thanksgiving day than a caramel apple pie cocktail okay sounds delicious it sounds delicious well this drink is made with vodka buttered up easy for me to say butterscotch schnapps apple cider and lemon juice and then served in a cocktail glass which has been rimmed with uh grandparents graham crackers get out of here doesn't that sound delectable so anyways this is a drink made and shaker so our trusty and well-used tread shaker we put it in our eyes and we got our little glass here and so we start with vodka of course as as you always should you know as a general rule one should start with vodka is often a good place to start also a good place to end many people think so anyways this called for one and a half shots of vodka so you know we mean the ever uh generous yes it's a holiday i mean yeah you don't have enough cheer in there that's right and then we're going to have one ounce of butter not butternut butterscotch well you're thinking of butternut squash which is so thanksgivingy so butterscotch schnapps a shot there goes there it goes and then we're going to have one and a half ounces of apple cider from this very tiny container i bought about outside whoa and again in order to fill up that drink i think we're gonna make almost two ounces all right let's be on the safe side and then just as one teaspoon of lemon juice just a bit just a bit okay well you can if you want you could that'd be one way to do it and do whatever you want i'm gonna roughly it's our show it's our show we can do what we want whatever we want okay having put all the ingredients i believe that is all the ingredients time to shake her up the davids are always interested in checking things out that's right that is well known but now what has to happen now we have to and again you're going to have to wet the edge of your glass so again we want the why don't you move that out here so i can get it okay move the shaker out of the way so you have crushed graham crackers and now we're going to rim the glass with it well let's see i think it needs a little more oh okay i don't think we quite got the technique down okay sorry we're gonna have to again we haven't practiced much well you know we worked on this in production i think that's good enough oh that's beautiful look at that okay and now we are ready for the all-important board oh sorry i got my finger in front of the lens sorry ah well it's so hard to get good production i know the only only person worse than this larry is the other larry we use oh that's perfect pour there look at that beautiful now for the all-important element which is the taste test go to the place where we have some good graham cracker on the rim my husband says i'm not you know effusive enough a few said no so wowzer that's really quite good so the butterscotch and the vodka uh makes for a lovely lovely one so anyways for those of you who need to relax after an exhausting day of consuming food that's right this would be a lovely cocktail great job all right everybody have a wonderful remainder to your thanksgiving day and we'll see you tomorrow tomorrow on black friday adios", "BWRh5YU-wC8": "today the continuation of the sweet sparkling spiced cider [Music] today we get spicy this is like gonna be the easiest thing you've ever seen us do so i'm i'm almost drawing it out on purpose no i'm just kidding so all i want to do is take the stopper out derek is going to hold on to it for me i have here cinnamon sticks dig one out cinnamon stick then all spice berries why all spice berries why not all spice berries pick out some big ones one two three three cloves three because why not he's feeling brave apparently clove can be very overpowering put this back in see in a week so it's been a couple of weeks like probably three weeks i know it was supposed to be one but i thought you know what we like spicy like spices so i left it okay truthfully i have a very big desk we put it under the desk we lost it i'm joking we just forgot about it for an extra week or two no big deal but what we're going to do today is we're going to rack this and then we're going to naturally carbonate it and to do that the first thing we want to do is take a reading to make sure that it's really really done so i'm just going to remove the airlock and i'm going to very very carefully move this you want to be very careful when you move things like this because the leaves move around and bad things can happen you don't want to stir it up if you're about to bottle it so what am i not going to do at the end i'm not going to pour it right back into the bottle okay so we're going to take a reading on this it was at 1.002 back on may 12th okay so we're looking at almost seven weeks ago and i know we added some spices but we didn't take any readings or anything so i just want to make sure that it's really really done even though it's not done at 1.002 i'd like to point out how clear this is too by the way this worked beautifully which it's just a basic cider shouldn't be anything too complicated we are at for all intents and purposes 1.002 based on the way the meniscus is sitting it could be like 1.000 either way i'm good with that it's perfectly fine because we're going to actually re-ferment it anyway a little bit by bottle carving that's a common misconception a lot of people don't seem to realize that that's what bottle carving actually is is it's a mini fermentation so that's why you can't be past your alcohol tolerance or anything like that and still get natural carbonation it just won't work your yeast have to be able to chew on something now right now this went dry which means there's no sugars in there whatsoever but let's rack it out of here get it off these spices and go from there okay in order to start the racking process what we want to do is get out wibble also known as the white bucket of levitation hello and we're going to take our source and put it up on top of wibble just like that and i'm going to take an auto siphon and a pitcher that has some liquid in there that i forgot about that's why it was splashing around and i'm going to have derek hold that in there because we've all seen what happens when i'm left responsible for that i'm only putting the siphon in about halfway because i really don't want to get close to that lease on the bottom there's a lot of what looks like chalky gunk that's the technical term for it and we just let that siphon out when i get down to the bottom because i know a lot of that stuff got pushed to the side from the way this sat one time it shouldn't be too bad as far as getting stuff out back to the natural carbonation idea we've had some questions lately where people were concerned because well i bottle carbs something and there's sediment in the bottom of my bottle how can i not have that well the only way to natural carb or bottle condition as people say it is that way you're going to have a little bit of sediment in the bottom if that really bothers you well you can pressure keg or whatever people do don't use a soda stream i've heard that that just makes a mess but keg pressurization like force carb that seems to work we don't do it i just do it in the bottle makes life easier i don't really have room to keep kegs around and we go through so many different brews that a keg of something is just too much one thing i will say about this yeast is the lease is chunky and hard rather than like wispy i'll uh i'll actually when we get finished with this show you a quick close-up of it so you can see what it looks like it's a good example of the way you want lees to be when you're racking as a matter of fact because i'm not really seeing any bits and pieces coming up i thought i was going to have a lot of waste from this doesn't look like it all right so looking in the bottom of this it actually looks like a nice little seaside scene you got you know your log bench over on the side you got little boulders but really what i want you to see is it looks like nothing really dissolved like you see it's hard edges and chunks of that lease that's a beautiful thing and it's actually kind of unusual we don't see that very often but it was really nice because it meant that almost no lease got into my bottles which is fantastic all right so we've covered a few things on this it's supposed to be a sweet sparkling spiced cider so far we have the cider we have the spiced which i get cinnamon and clove she gets it from way over there so if the spices are strong now to counteract some of that with a dry cider you want it to be sweet which we talked about and i'll get to in just a second but we're also going to naturally carbonate this now the one thing that we need to do to carbonate is we need to add a little bit more sugar since we're already adding sugar for the carbonation i decided let's make it sweet at the same time since there's really no other way to do it so how much do you add well we know we like between 1.015 and 1.020 for sweetness so i have here eight ounces of sugar now can you use corn sugar of course you can i'm just using plain white sugar because that's what i always use and it's always worked for me and it's okay but what that's going to do if we know carbonation in general very general gives about a half a percent that means i'm going to use between three and four points of my gravity to create that carbonation well half a pound of sugar would be 0.023 gravity right because it's half of 0.046 and a pound per gallon so 0.023 minus 3 or 4 points leaves me with a 1.019 to a 1.020 gravity very very simple it's just it's just math so what i'm going to do is take this half pound of sugar and dump it in here i am also considering something that derica might not be aware of and that is the fact that when i dump all this into a non-degassed cider it may actually foam over we're gonna find out the second coming of mount vesuvius yeah i didn't degas this and i probably should have but hey look at that it's been sitting long enough that it probably degassed naturally and now that i'm stirring this a little bit yeah it's totally naturally degassed and all i need to do is just mix this in yes i could pulverize it in my food processor and make the sugar smaller all these sorts of crazy things or i can just stir it takes like three minutes okay so our sugar has been dissolved our bottles have been cleaned in [Music] i'm so glad we brought that back anyway and we are going to bottle now you've probably seen us bottle before i'm gonna go through a quick series of it but if you missed it we did do a full video on just bottling and how to do it i'm going to use the exact same techniques here the only thing we're going to do different than from the bottling video is i am going to fill one that is plastic and there's a reason for that the way this works is we're going to let this carbonate for a few days and then we're going to pasteurize this batch okay if you do not pasteurize you can't just throw in the fridge and it'll be just fine but that's the next section so don't do that quite yet but this bottle here is our tester you give that a squeeze and if it feels very firm obviously you know you've carbonated enough and it's time to take the next step [Music] for those curious yes these are flying's burger bottles [Music] oh i love it when a plan comes together what i mean by that is we got out that many bottles and there's only this little tiny bit left here that uh well i'm gonna drink it [Music] that's right i'm drinking it right from the pitcher oh taste that i would drink this right now this is so good that is some of the best apple cider i've had in like a long time and i mean even the commercial stuff and it's not even sparkling yet yeah that is very tasty i'm pleased it's just sweet enough without being like it's i wouldn't call that super sweet at all it's just sweet the spices though everything's just balanced and we don't usually get that excited about young apple cider so yeah that's a big big deal anyway so here this needs to be washed now and as you can see we have a bunch of bottles what do we got three six nine ten bottles out of this so uh what do we do with these now like i said this is gonna sit in a relatively warm-ish like room temperature okay you don't wanna keep them in like a cold area room temperature which for our house is anywhere from 70 to 75 degrees fahrenheit depending on where they're sitting i am probably going to put these into some sort of a heavy-duty plastic tub but a cardboard box works too just in case one of them decides to over carbonate and explode we don't want that to happen the idea behind this is they're going to carbonate for just a few days okay just till they're carbonated enough if these were left to carbonate fully they would explode be very very cautious when doing this method you have to keep an eye on these this is not the kind of thing you can go away for a week and come back you will come back to a sticky mess with glass everywhere i'm not trying to scare you but this process right here is the riskier part however that's what this is for okay if i squeeze this now it obviously flexes very easily over the next few days i will check it once a day when it just feels like if it feels like you took a soda bottle and you shook it up you know how firm that feels if it feels like that it's done the minute it feels like that it's done now if you do this before you watch the rest of the video and you lose track of time once it gets to that point if you put them in your refrigerator you can kind of hold time for a while okay you can actually drink them at that point too if you really want to but we are going to pasteurize and that'll be the next step and you'll see that in the next video in this series but as always guys thanks for watching and have a great day bye [Music] you", "hGrRaMkNaPU": "hey guys you had a request from a viewer to make some hard cider I've never made hard cider before so I did some research and I now have an idea of what I need to do so I'm just going to show you guys first thing we have some apple cider five gallons we're going to need some sugar and then we're also going to need our yeast with the cider very important make sure there's no preservatives in it because if there's preservatives it will kill your yeast so I got these I'm ever at the local farm they freshly press this it's not pasteurized or has any kind of preservatives unfortunately some guy grabbed two gallons right before me and I ran out or they ran out so I had to go to a store and I just got two more gallons of apple cider at the store this is a white rose doesn't have any up you know it doesn't have any preservatives but it is from concentrate so it should work just as good to get started we're going to get five cups of sugar you want to do one cup of sugar for each gallon that you're going to make of the cider now I'm going to put the sugar at first because I don't want to get the funnel wet because it will stick so I'm going to put the sugar in into the the carboy first now everything on this table also has been sterilized so we have everything sterile even the the measuring cup i sterilized I'm going to put one two three four and five all right now that I have that the sugar into the carboy what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the apple cider I'm going to put one gallon in and then kind of shake it up scroll it up try to get some of this sugar dissolved before I put the rest in okay now that I got my first gallon in there I'm just gonna take it give it a good swirl so he can get it with that sugar yeah dissolved I did take the apple cider and take it out of the fridge so it's not really cold and that what really helps make the sugar dissolve now the reason why you don't have to add sugar to this but but if you don't add sugar you're going to get an alcohol content between five three to five percent I just added a cup of sugar and that should bring it up to about five to six percent alcohol just want to give it a little extra kick all right now let's get the rest of this in here it has a little different color to it I was just there five minutes earlier I had all farm-fresh cider the great thing about farm-fresh cider is it actually since it's not pasteurized has some wild yeast in it but I my understanding is this wild yeast is actually really good for making the slider because it's it's specifically yeast from the press that's been over the ages has developed to be a very good yeast for the apple cider making hard cider okay let's get a hydrometer reading on this alright it looks like it's one point zero five eight the potential alcohol that would be City Oh potential alcohol that's all the way up to almost six percent so it looks like we'll probably come in somewhere around five five and a half percent with this I just finished pitching the yeast in here and I just wanted to tell you a little bit about the yeast two different types you'll get two different distinct styles of hard cider according to the yeast so I was talking to the guy at our brew store you can either use champagne yeast and make a dry a hard cider or you can use a British ale yeast and make more of a sweet cider now I had some why East British ale yeast that I had washed the other week and I want to use up so this is going to be kind of a sweet um hard cider compared to a drier one so you know if you want you can buy one of those packs of yeast pack or whatever just decide whether you want to dry or um you know a sweet one in advance now I'm going to take this downstairs it's going to according to the information I have it's going to take about two weeks for it to fully permit I'm going to do what I always do is can't condition it and then I'm going to put it in by out bottles now that's another place where you can make two choices you can almost make it a still cider and no carbonation okay or you can make it carbonated in my mind I'm going to carbonate it so they're put in the cake I'm going to force carbonate like I do everything but you can put you know you whatever you can put some sugar in there and use the sugar - you know carbonated in the bottle just like you would normally prime so this going downstairs and we're going to see how it goes", "PqPJms8MYfc": "welcome to hobby brewery welcome back home beer breweries Channel today I'm going to make a large batch of hard apple cider approximately two months ago I made a small batch four and a half liters or something and it turned out very well so I will make more I like it my girlfriend likes it so well let's make a bigger batch of hot apple cider very easy step-by-step process and then I will show you the ingredients please keep watching these are the basic ingredients playing apple juice no more apple juice 1 kilogram of table sugar and of course some cider east last time I use regular wine yeast but now I'm going to try cider yeast so this is different this is a package for 50 litres of cider I'm going to make 20 today so I'm using almost the half of this set it and I'm also going to use a couple of grams of yeast nutrient first thing what I'm going to do is sanitize all the equipment by the airlock spoon hydrometer and my brand new fermenter that I bought from homebrew online in the UK it's a nice fermenter for brewing episode and for sanitation I use starting so let's hand it eyes all the equipment I have five liters of hot tap water in this container and then I'm adding seven and a half million liters of stars here we go it's a little bit more of it there's no problem I prepared already the yeast nutrient the description tells me to add 2 grams to 10 liters of wine or cider so that's what I'm going to do and dissolve it in a little bit of warm water so I have already done that I added a quarter of a teaspoon about three to five grams of yeast nutrient now I'm going to boil it boil it and add it just before I'm going to pitch the yeast I'm going to remove the caps and then spray a little bit of starting in the opening sanitize all the equipment going to put the lid the fermenter the container off start there is a little bit of stores hand left another mint of it there's no problem sanitizer now I'm adding the first three litres of apple juice go to notice that all the episode resets a room temperature it's about 20 degrees now after this three meters I'm going to try resolve all the shiver that I'm going to add after this I know from the last time that I made the hot apple cider with the same apple juice that the starting gravity is 1.04 for I'm going to add the sugar boost elbow low gave me approximately I'm starting gravity of one point zero seven zero let's dump the sugar in I told you it's very easy and it is with the salt in the sugar and room temperature can be a hot dog NuStar the level steering this way you also aerating apple juice we're happy three minutes later the motion of the sugar is dissolved I'm going to add the next bag of help you again I do it very rough to every attitude I'm not feeling sugar anymore at the bottom for the main soul that's what they need a linguist of the Apple douche 10 litres of apple juice is already in it and know for sure the sugar is dissolved so let's dump in the rest of their use everything the apple juice is very important to create healthy yeast you can also use a diffusion stop or for other methods because it's an open man fermenter the steering can also be a good job I think will do the job okay that's all the entities and implemented iterated and very well now it's time to add the prepared is nutrient and the East itself there it goes alright that was the East nutrient now I'm going to pitch the East and sanitizing off-camera did you set it show you another little star sent on it this is side of yeast and I'm going to add the half of this package evenly over the phone smells great okay let's the half of the three spec edge and will rehydrate the yeast for about 10 minutes we are 10 minutes later now I'm going to stir in the yeast it's a little bit rehydrated right there those will snap the lid on right edit the airlock and going to add a little bit of vodka into the airlock there it goes I took a gravity reading off camera and the starting gravity of this one is one point zero 6 8 so let's sell more or less what I was expecting with one kilogram of sugar I thought it would be one point zero seven zero or something this will be around nine and a half percent alcohol a beefy or something when it's done fermenting I didn't made a video about taking the gravity reading I thought it wasn't necessary to share and will tell you the number so this is my homemade apple cider I hope it turns out great last time I did well thank you for watching this video thank you very much and remember nothing is better than a good home brew speak each other later I will keep you guys updated about this brew bye", "GciLz01XTuk": "all right folks we're going to do a quick video here making some hard apple cider and I just happen to be driving through Central Maryland today and I picked up a gallon of this Catoctin Mountain orchard apple cider one gallon of it it has no additives or preservatives it's made from fresh squeezed apples I paid about six dollars and fifty cents for that so you can make apple cider with apple juice but you're going to pay about 450 for that and I figured this was going to be a nice little experiment here Catoctin Mountain range also has a creek - runs through at the Catoctin Creek and it runs from pretty far north in Maryland all the way down into Virginia and a lot of the local businesses in that area call themselves you could talk to mountain orchard or you'll see like Catoctin actually believe there's a distillery to talked in distillery and I think anything they can attach that name to they do so anyhow I'm going to go ahead at the pause button I'm going to go back and I'm going to get the the rest of the supplies we're going to need and we're going to go ahead and it started this is a pretty simple and easy thing to do it's a my fourth batch of apple cider I've done two cranberry hard ciders and then one grape but that was more like a wine anyhow let me let me go get the rest and stuff and we'll finish up alright I'm back so let's go ahead and get started the first thing I'm going to do is add about a cup using a sterilized funnel I'm going to add about a cup of corn sugar and right here to this one gallon jar this is the jar jug we're going to do our fermenting in and we actually use a little bit less than a gallon so I'm going to transfer it from the gallon container that I bought to the fermenting glass gallon container let's go ahead and get that in there now the reason I add this sugar is because I want to boost the alcohol content of the hard cider that I'm making with this fresh juice you don't have to do that you can just ferment that with just putting some yeast in there the other thing is you could probably take that jug go outside leave it open for a couple hours and come back in put a lock on it and it would probably start fermenting on its own since there's no preservatives come on sugar you're just about the reason I put the sugar in first because I want it to be mixed up when I go ahead and pour the juice in all right now the sugars in I put a half a teaspoon of this in for every gallon of juice that I firm in it's a yeast nutrient that's supposed to help your yeast grow apparently apples are don't have the same nutrients that you get from grapes so you don't really have to add grape or dese nutrient to too great wine but it's my understanding it's a good idea to do it too the cider I've done in every batch and I haven't had any problems so I'm just going to keep on doing it and then we're going to do now is we're going to pour this gallon in there and hope I don't make a mess all right now that I got it up and flip it in there what I like to do is just take this I'm gonna shake it up it's going to be off-camera maybe not but I really want to shake the heck out of it and get that sugar all mixed in there real good now I'm going to leave this a little bit breathing room so I'm gonna stop right there now some people wait for it to settle and some people don't what I'm going to use is this cider house select Saturday and this is supposedly been bred or formulated specifically for doing sires I think that's how they get a get away with pulling in cider used now I don't have to pour this whole whole thing in here but I always do just because I don't feel like managing open packets of yeast so we're going to go ahead and were going to pour that in and when I do this I don't stir it I let it sit let it do its thing I expect this will be bubbling pretty good by tomorrow morning now what this is is a one-way airlock and it lets the gas produced by the yeast fermenting the sugars out without letting bad stuff in so we're going to go ahead we're gonna slide that in and then about two weeks from now I'm going to bottle that up and then about two weeks after that I'm gonna drink it so there we are thanks everybody", "24YH8mkXQKU": "hi guys Dave here I'm gonna show you how I make my kombucha now unfortunately I can't really show you from the beginning because I basically need a real camera to do that but but I'm gonna loop you in and show you what I can so in here in my cabinet is my Scobie and in here is some finished kombucha and this goby here is a culture essentially it's covered with a paper towel and it's secured by a rubber band the reason why there is a paper towel here is because you need something that's breathable because this culture we're going to take this off is living yes it's live it's a Scobie a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast I know it sounds disgusting however if you are a kombucha brewer you probably think that this is beautiful so the finished kombucha is going to be poured into this junk which has been sterilized we have a funnel and we're gonna pour this into that and then we're gonna take this which is sweetened black tea and what I did earlier and this is the part that I was not able to show you I took sugar in the raw and I took bottled water well spring water a gallon of it and I mixed it all together and I just let several bags of black tea steep in here you want a straight kind of tea it can be straight black tea straight green tea polarity whatever it happens to be it's fine but do not use Earl Grey because of the bergamont and there don't use herbal tea because what will happen is this will start to grow mold because the pH balance is going to be off and it's you know your scobie's gonna be ruined so rule always use a straight tea so I cord what I could into the bottle and you want to leave a little bit of the kombucha still in the in the glass jar and what I then did was I poured the sweet tea into here so the culture is basically gonna be feeding on the sugar that's what keeps it alive that's what keeps it healthy and and you want to cover it back up now I want to just say that the tea that was over there is room temperature maybe a little warm you do not want to you know boil up the water steep the tea and then put it in here because you will kill the scoby the scoby is a living creature so you have to treat it like a living creature and so we temp is it the other thing is that you want to have at least a good inch and a half two inches of air why because you want it to breathe it's a living creature so we have the sweet tea with filtered water spring water I wouldn't use distilled water because that's a little there's a reason why you shouldn't use that I don't remember what it was and I apologize for that but use spring water that's the best that you can use and you can use regular sugar if you want however I like to use sugar in the raw because it is healthier overall I hate white sugar it is nasty I don't even put it in my coffee so anyway here we go so we've got that and what you're then going to do is put in your cabinet and put her to bed and leave her for a few weeks and there you go however for this lady here she produces kombucha pretty fast so I guarantee you she'll be ready in about probably a week and a half the other thing to point out - I'm a chatterbox is that for every batch you do she's gonna grow another layer because scobie's are living organisms and they grow and at this point in time I can start investing in other mason jars and you know start producing more kombucha basically and the other thing that I want to just say to you as well is that with the left over tea you want to save this for two reasons number one let's just say you're really craving the kombucha you really want some and you don't have time to brew up the tea well guess what you're gonna have tea that you can store right in here so you can literally pour it right in the bottle the other thing is that what you can do pour them in here mmm you're gonna want to make sure you have some room for air you're going to want to seal them so that they are completely airtight what you will do is put them in here in the dark oh one more and then within a few weeks you are going to have tea soda because it will carbonate and it will ferment no there is no trace of any Scobie in here or any bacteria it's just the sweet tea but for whatever reason it ferments and now for the part that I've been waiting for all day so now this is what's known as I believe a primary fermentation or you know it's a first fermentation now with this if you want to flavor your kombucha you know you can add to the finished product okay you do not want to put it in the scoby because otherwise you know the scoby could get moly it's just not gonna be a good thing that is always straight tea that is it whatever tea you want but it has to be a straight tea it's got to be green black Claire white is okay do not use an herbal and do not use a blend unless it happens to be you know black and green I'm not even sure look it up on the Google alright so but what I'm gonna do I'm not going to actually do another fermentation but what I am gonna do is this doesn't that sound good I'm going to flavor this with a little bit of apple cider because I can and stir and enjoy Wow Wow Wow that is very very good so there you have it I just turned over a batch of kombucha and discovered a really good recipe to take your primary batch add a little bit of apple cider serve on the rocks", "Ew56XvlmQV8": "How to make hard cider. It's\nsurprisingly simple! To make hard cider, We're going to need a 1 gallon glass jug\nof sweet apple juice, a packet of yeast, a paper towel sheet, and a rubber band.\nUsually you can find a glass jug of apple juice at a farm stand or a grocery store.\nWhen looking for apple juice, be sure to select one that has been pasteurized but\ndoes not have any preservatives like potassium sorbate. As for yeast, locate a\nhomebrew supply shop near you and purchase a packet of cider, wine, or\nchampagne yeast. If in doubt, ask the nice folks at the homebrew supply shop. If\nthere are no homebrew supply shops near you\nthere are plenty of online stores that will gladly ship you a packet of cider\nyeast for a nominal fee. Back in the kitchen, take your glass jug and pour out\na glass of juice, then put the cap back on the jug. Shake up the juice for about\n15 to 20 seconds. By shaking up the jug with the air in it, we're dissolving\noxygen into the juice. We do this because the yeast really like oxygen when they\nstart their party in your juice. Next, cut open the packet of yeast and pour the\ncontents into the jug; no need to shake it up. Tear off a square of the paper\ntowel and fold it over a few times until you have a small square that can fit\nover the mouth of the jug and secure it with a rubber band. When the yeast party\ngets going, the yeast are going to produce a fair amount of CO2 and if you\nhad put the cap back on the jug, it would have caused the jug to over pressurize\nand explode. The paper towel allows the CO2 to escape but still keeps wild\nairborne yeasts and mold spores out of your cider. Alternatively, if the guy at\nthe homebrew supply shop talked you into buying a rubber stopper and an airlock\nyou can use that instead. Be sure to fill the airlock with clean water, but don't\noverfill the airlock like I did here in the video. And now you wait. In the\nbeginning, you'll notice the dry yeast fall to the bottom of the jug.\nWithin a few hours, the yeast should start rapidly reproducing and will make the\ncider cloudy. Soon, foam will form at the top and CO2 will start to escape the jug.\nBe sure to keep your fermenting cider around room temperature. If your\ntemperature is too cool, the yeast will go dormant; if it's too warm, the yeast\nwill produce unpleasant spicy off flavors and aromas. During this time, the\nyeast will reproduce rapidly, quickly taking over the apple juice. The majority\nof the action will take place in the first two to three days but fermentation\nmay take anywhere from seven to ten days. At some point, the fermentation process\nwill wind down. Since we're using a glass jug, we can see here that there really\nisn't much activity at the top of the cider anymore.\nThis means that fermentation is pretty much complete. If it is still bubbling a\nbit, you can leave it for a few more days. When fermentation seems to have ceased,\ntake the jug and stick it in the back of your fridge. After a few days, your hard\ncider should appear clear and ready to drink. Mmm mmmm. Tasty, tart, slightly sweet too,\nWhat? \"The cider isn't sparkling!\", you say. Oh, that's true. This is known as \"still\"\ncider as in, not bubbling. If you'd like to learn how to make sparkling cider, my\nnext video will take you through the steps of bottling and the secondary\nfermentation process for getting good carbonation.", "L7m1lt11GHE": "-Fall spices. Fall spices.\nFall spice. Every time I've said, \"Fall\nspices,\" you should be drinking. We have the most iconic\nfall pancakes you possibly could ever imagine\nor dream of or want. Forget your\npumpkin spice lattes. Forget all that stuff.\nApple spice is where it's at. \u266a\u266a Literally, you could not\nget more fall than this recipe\nfor breakfast. There's gonna be\na fall-spiced granola, an infused maple syrup,\nand then a compound butter. I've got my butter softening. You know where.\nCome on. Ah, sunlit softened butter. I've coined that phrase,\nby the way. Ground cinnamon, sugar,\nand a little bit of salt. We're gonna add\nall those things in there. You can whip this, but what I'm\ngonna do is just mix it up, and then we're gonna roll it\ninto a log. We're gonna refrigerate it. \u266a\u266a Let it harden up,\nand we'll be good to go. Mmm.\nWhat else are we making? We're making\na fall-spice granola. I've got some rolled oats here. We got our pecans -- \"pe-cahns,\" \"pee-cans\" --\nin here. I always say \"pee-can\" pie, but then, when I talk about\nthese as the nut, it's \"pe-cahns.\" But you know what?\nTo each their own. There's no wrong way. There probably is\na wrong way, but... We've got cinnamon,\nnutmeg, and cloves -- all of our classic\nfall spices -- and then, yeah, salt and sugar. Maple syrup. So a touch of vanilla\nright in there. That's gonna go in there, and you're just gonna\ncoat these up. You could make\na big-ass batch of this and then have it\nfor breakfast every day. Spreading it out onto this baking sheet\nright here -- even layer -- and we're gonna bake it at 425 about 10 minutes. and then after this is done, we're gonna add\nsome dried apples into it. \u266a\u266a It's smells like I'm walking on\nan apple orchard right now, hand-in-hand with my --\nwith Pete Davidson. [ Laughs ] So, it's out of the oven. They're nice. It's golden,\nit's toasted. We're gonna let this cool, then we'll stir in\nthe dried apple. Just got a standard maple syrup. Wonderful. We're gonna put it\nin our saucepan here. A couple sticks of cinnamon,\nbecause apple-cinnamon, and then I'm gonna add\na vanilla bean. Um, I'm gonna split it.\nSo vanilla beans -- Oh, my God. You could also just add,\nlike, vanilla paste. Remember when\nI used vanilla paste for the strawberry shortcake? If you have that still,\nuse that. But I think vanilla bean, it's kind of\nmore bang for your buck. We're gonna heat this up, bring\nit to, like, a little simmer, let it infuse\nfor about 30 minutes, and then we'll strain it. On to making the pancakes. We're going to use two apples\nin here -- fresh apples. This is a Gala apple. I like a crisp\nfall apple on this. If I just eat\na whole apple, I burp. Isn't that weird? \u266a\u266a Will I burp? \u266a\u266a I'd say, like,\nquarter-inch pieces. You don't want them too big. Like, bite-size-ish,\nnot even. Everyone claims their pancakes\nare the fluffiest. I think mine are pretty fucking\nfluffy, too, because guess what? We're gonna whip up\nthese egg whites. We're folding egg whites\ninto these, so that adds an extra layer\nof fluff to them. And then, also, there's baking\nsoda and baking powder in this, and when you combine that\nwith the sour cream, which has the, um, acidity\nin it, it activates them. So, we've got our two egg yolks. I'm gonna add apple cider. Then we've got sour cream,\nsome sugar. Mix these guys up. Our apples are gonna\ngo in there, too. All of our dry ingredients --\ntwo cups of flour, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, baking soda,\nbaking powder, and salt. Gonna whip our eggs -- whites... ...till they're nice and fluffy. All right. Everyone I know, they're like, \"My dad makes the best\npancakes.\" It's, like, definitely, like,\na dad thing -- like, pancakes. I don't know why,\nbut Dad, guess what? Here's your new\npancake recipe, okay? Just gonna mix up\nmy dry ingredients, add it into the wet. We're gonna fold in our whites, and you're getting kind of\ncareful folding it like that. You don't need to over-mix it. \u266a\u266a We're gonna do it\nin a cast iron skillet. You can do a nonstick skillet. The first pancake's\nalways the ugly pancake. Why is that? I'm gonna, despite the odds, make a beautiful first pancake,\n'cause I'm a professional. So I'm using a measuring cup\nto do this. \u266a\u266a \u266a And now we wait, wait, wait \u266a Wait for the pancakes to cook. It's starting to bubble. \u266a\u266a Look at that.\nTold you I'm a professional. The first pancake invented\nby the Greeks, they put, like,\ncurdled milk in it, which is kind of like\nsour cream, right? So basically,\nI'm making the first pancake. One pancake down,\nnumerous more to go. \u266a\u266a [ Burps ]\nTold you apples made me burp. Mmm. Do-o-op. Mamma mia. Look at this -- this one big ol'\npat of butter on top of it. All of our delicious granola. Tuck some apples in here. Gonna add our syrup. A cinnamon-sugar butter.\nWe've got fresh apple. We've got a delicious appley\npecan granola. An infused syrup. I'm going to take, like,\nthe top part. Oh, yeah.\nOh, man. And look, you can kind of\nsee the apple. It's still kind of -- it's,\nlike, softened a little bit inside the pancake,\nbut it's also still chunky and whole and fresh in there. Oh, yeah,\nthis just has me turned. Mmm-mmm. The butter is so good.\n[ Laughs ] The butter is the star\nof this dish, to me. It all kind of comes\ntogether very well.

from mass popularity in the colonial era to near obscurity today Applejack so what happened what caused a drink from a fruit not even native to the continent become the most popular booze in America and then decline until only recently one company was even producing the answer is very much linked to the growth and development of the us the type of apples are typically eaten or brewed were brought over when the first colonies that would eventually come the US were founded amongst the other crops brought over from Europe apple cheese would spread throughout the continent as the colonies expanded one of the most famous people known for helping spread apples was the American folk hero Johnny Appleseed born John Chapman John Chapman help spread apple trees to Pennsylvania Ohio Indiana Illinois and West Virginia contrary to the Focolare image of him just randomly spreading apple seeds what he actually did was start nurseries in the American frontier at this time to lay claim to a plot of land on the frontier one of the requirements was to plant 50 apple trees knowing this Chapman was then able to sell as apple seedlings from his nurseries to arriving settlers a follower of the new church Chapman was a strict vegetarian part of his beliefs also disallowed grafting a zoo is seen as causing suffering to the plants over most apples are produced by the graphing method or the stem of an adult tree is attached to the root stock allowing you to effectively clone a tree prevent any variation of taste to the new trees Apple because Chapman didn't graft his trees were largely unfit for eating but could be used for making hard cider and Applejack the widespread popularity of these hard beverages at this time the results of the isolation of the early settlers with limited access to other beverages and often even the clean water locally produced apple beverages was the best option they had the wane in its popularity is largely linked to America's own development as warmer frontiers evolved became more developed access to other beverages increased grains became more available and then become an achiever method of producing hot beverages popularity declined as hard cider and Applejack that replaced by cheaper to produce beer and whiskey then and the 1920s prohibition gave the near death look to these beverages many of the trees Chapman himself had planted were destroyed by the US government when they cut down any apple trees that could only be used to produce alcoholic beverages today hard cider and Applejack are only just now starting to return in popularity now understand the history of it what exactly is Applejack and how do you make it Applejack is made from hard cider by concentrating the level of alcohol in it the method called pleased distilling the method is actually pretty simple the only real equipment that's actually needed is a cold winter unfortunately it's been rather mild this year we'll just have to use a freezer there's actually some ambiguity about the legality of making Applejack yourself so I decided to let Chris handle this one using the hard cider we had previously brewed left it to freeze overnight he then inverted the frozen liquid over container let the alcohol be followed of the ice in a syrupy caramel color you can repeat this a few more times to increase the strength even more [Music] so we have here is some of the hard cider we brewed previously and now they've been jacked and distilled into various concentrations so the first one here is some of the stuff we grew before this is distilled three times and this one's been distilled five times so potentially you get around twenty to forty percent alcohol our first foray into distilling hopefully won't get arrested or go blind from this all right we'll start with the regular hard cider yes parts letter it's sour we have this normal cider nothing too special about it it's about the strength of a good beer alright this is the three times still no alcohol already oh wow that is strong that is definitely definitely stronger than the standard hard cider I'd say maybe like a strong wine I'm sure a full glass of this would do the job for me something that I'm a lightweight try this five times is still one the last one is a sweeter it's smoother some reason this one's just a little bit more smoother maybe it's got more of the extra flavoring that distilled enjoyed or something I don't think this did anything besides remove a little more water and make it slightly more cloudier as you can see there's not much of a color difference in either one overall is is pretty good there's obvious limitations to how much you can distill it just because the standard distilling you can actually get all the way to pure alcohol I believe this not so much kind of a limit a lot of the cider was probably wasted in this process but ultimately if you're looking for a quick way to get drunk freeze your booze over and over again not the strongest was definitely harder than standard cider and it turned out pretty good so I looked it up to the legality of it and like generally sounds like it's illegal but adult anybody even cares I mean after this I'm going to call the cops on Chris and see see if anybody shows up", "FJaH8JvddQM": "hard cider is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juices of apples Since it's made from fermented fruit hard cider can technically be considered a type of wine and is legally often defined as such In the U.S. there are generally three classifications of Apple beverages: Apple Cider which is usually the straight non-alcohol juices from pressed apples Apple Juice which is cider has been filtered pasteurized and sweetened while still remaining non-alcoholic and Hard Cider which is apple cider that's been fermented to become alcoholic and many other countries alcoholic hard cider is just referred to as \"Cider\" Cider  can also be made from other fruits such as pears which is then referred to as Perry having already picked apples before from earlier project last year but I let someone else help out on this one hi i'm nick butler and i'm here to steal Andy's job now i do have a broken ankle and it's gonna be a little difficulty, they didn't give me any vicodin at the hospital so I'm here to make next best thing hard cider after helping pick a few apples the first step was to put them in the scratter here can you take these for me?\nYep Thank You Whole apples are now thrown in and broken down into small chunks Do you guys have any like pots to put my head? I mean, I feel like I need to get the whole experience with my head, a little Johnny Appleseed, right? Well, I think there's some kind of technique to it and I don't have it Working hard for my booze pretty good\nI didn't think this was going to be like hard work. do I get to crank this thing now?\nNo, no, not at all.  Quarter done. Quarter done?\nYeah, you're quarter done I'm all the way sweating Here we go fellows let's get to get to halfway. You know it's more satisfying when you get drunk you know where it came from.\nAnd all the sweat equity. Yeah, like I literally sweat into this batch of cider You know, this is just satisfying work out here with a broken ankle just mashing up some apple.  I really can't wait to get drunk with Andy George The fruits of my 10 minute Labor Once pulverized the apples are then ready to be pressed and the juice is extracted. Ready to squeeze?\nI'm ready to squeeze. alright let's fold sack over and get going. Let's fold the sack over. Here we go, this is more my speed really, just doing this I feel like we should be singing some kind of song like an old sailor song ...like.\n\u266b \"Ninety-nine bottles of cider...\" \u266b\noh woah, woah! settle down, reverse crank\nOk.  I think we need some better signals.  We good? Almost.\nAlright.\nSwitchy! \"Switchy\"? I don't know what that means-\nAlright, crank 'er down! \nOk switchy, I get it \u266b Heave-ho, heave-ho, the apple cider's low heave-ho, heave-ho \u266b- Come on guys! \u266b the apple ciders low! \u266b\n\u266b We're going to drink it hard \u266b \u266b we're gonna drink it slow \u266b \u266b heave-ho, the apple cider's low \u266b Need some, need some oil We're done!\nThat's it! Yes! Hard cider! How long's it gonna take before we have we have actual hard cider?\nIt can go anywhere from a week to a year.\nA year?\nA year. Let's go a week. I'm more like the bathroom hooch kind of guy. Oh, we're done cranking.\nWe're done. Now reverse crank. Now we got to do the clean up.\nClean up?  That's for the employees give me a high-vis shirt if I'm on staff yeah apple DJ.\nDJ apple juice leftover Apple waste is then tossed and composting then we got to taste some of the freshly pressed cider Do you want in on this?\nI want in I'm a little eager. Ah, that's fresh pressed But there's still no booze in that, so they let me taste a batch of hard cider they have previously brewed. There you go, there's your finish product folks. The finished product. Yeah?\nI like.  This is hard cider. That's right.\nIt feels more like the wine actually more than the cider because is it? This is a bit dryer This is year vintage.\nYear Vintage.\n5.9% Appley.\nWell the process takes at least a week I can't hobble around my leg that long so i guess it's PBR for me. Now that Nick's successfully produced some cider, he's going to go brew his own batch meanwhile i want to take some of his juice make my own unique hard cider so with \"How To Brew Everything\" I want to explore both the traditional beverages and also some of the more extreme examples of what can and can't be turned into alcohol.\nFor ciders, which are traditionally done with fruits want to take a more interesting fruit the durian and see if I could turn that into cider Durian is best known for its smell. Right now it doesn't have too much of smell see what happens when I cut it open. I can smell it already.\nIt smells...ripe pretty well-defended with lots of spikes it's got the smell to defend itself too why would people eat this? everything about it says \"don't eat me\"\nMmm...that stinkyness Can I smell it?\nthat smells like a wet pile of garbage.\nThat means it's good That is just aweful!\nI feel like I'm gutting a rotten animal that's what smells like at least. I thought it'd be a lot worse I think it's warming up because it's I feel like it is getting stronger I'm really curious how the drink itself turns out.  If it's going to retain the smell or if it's gonna get diluted interesting Interesting flavor and texture very gooey like boogers.\nLet me try some boogers. I don't know how to describe it.\nOh god.  Hey man you want some? Sure why not?\nThat seriously feels like a booger.  Tastes kind of like sweet and hot garbage. Yeah, I guess that's one way to describe it. Gooey.  So tasty.  Gross smell, gross texture, gross process it's gonna be delicious when it's done....or not. Got one durian worth of durian meat in there now Smells so disgusting. So next we'll add some of the cider we had Nick collect for us little too fast. Oh dude, that's pouring all over your shoe. I had an accident Oh what happened?\nStopper went inside. The stopper went inside?\nThat's probably not good it's gone.\nWant to try some durian? Oh he likes it!  Likes it more than you do. Dogs love durian!\nNow the question is does your dog like it or does your dog just eat everything? I'm thinking the latter. The only thing is going to eat now: $20 durians I got that all mixed up let's add some yeast.  Now we just got to add the stopper here and you're supposed to sterilize it didn't pick up any sterilization but we have some of our leftover mezcal we picked up in Mexico so we'll use that was about a hundred dollars so...good use alright give it a couple weeks. While mine is left to ferment, Chris took the remaining apple cider and some ingredients we have left over from previous projects to experiment with creating some other unique hard ciders Now everything just needs to ferment for at least a week, then it's time to try all of our ciders.

GMC everybody he knows that it's BYOB tell me how it tastes help me tell me how it smells with a bad old butter they angling hell but it's something so we started off we gonna party all night let's go alright what's going on guys and gals and we are back for yet another fine season of the Bur view another fine season action-packed romance filled booze inducing hopefully not upchucking season of the brew review oh you have to bring that up yes don't know a little curious here what the hell is this there's no label in their packaging with this has already got another one out of five for me I'm just gonna give you the close-up for the bottle you can see it's blended [ __ ] there's no packaging turd in there yeah someone dropped the log in there you can see the cap or oh I'm sorry cork shut and it looks like it's 48 ounces alright I believe there's some backstory to this is there yes New Year's of 2017 we what when this air is this what this will be like a couple weeks ago that we recorded this well anyhow I got this from our good buddy teabag teabag yes he made this let me guess it's good old-fashioned everybody knows how to make it but mines so much better than yours apple pie moonshine that's right complete with a cinnamon stick with us and as you can see it's been in the fridge for so long that the cinnamon turn the sentiment I mean look at that [ __ ] people that's alright looks like diarrhea yeah look at that some of these work somebody just do dude in that bottle but anyhow it's been ageing in our fridge it's been ageing in our fridge for literally what over ten months something like that though they always say that whenever you let it age it tends to be a lot better yeah now again I've I wasn't joking when I said like everybody and their uncle claims to make the best apple pie moonshine it's really not that hard well what's crazy is it's legal to make it and drink it however it's not legal to sell it you can give it away all you want but don't sell it but yeah I've known people just saying like oh yeah that's other stuff sergeant mine's better because I do this know everybody makes it the exact same no I had some of this batch well probably the same batch ran around New Year's when it was ten months newer so we're gonna see I'm gonna be able to tell all should be if it changed after ten months between Isis now I don't necessarily think we're finishing this whole bottle no I don't plan to we cuz we got other we got other episodes to record on top of this yes so ask tradition actually not as tradition and it not as usual but as usual we're gonna do the court test the body and head the body and head testers pass the draft test the what the oh the leg test you kind of swirl it like wine this is not something we're just gonna chug we're gonna do it so without further ado now a normal can opener just will not do in this situation so that's why we brought out there's no corpse so would you like to try I'm gonna try and I'm hopefully I'm not gonna abuse it yeah because if that one goes in there we're screwed now as you see he's twisting the head of the bottle don't do that so I got it buried we used to have these autumn these make automatic cork screws oh it's coming it's coming pull pull that's pretty with a [ __ ] stick man pool yeah I got go it has a really good pop beautiful pump Wow so definitely a ten on the pump we will not use this cork again we actually have a special hole corks it smells [ __ ] good man smell here for the first time ever on the brew review it's only taking us one how many season six seven six seasons to do a cork test the cork smell test the aroma clementa the bottle smells better I'm thinking apple pie see you I don't remember I honestly don't remember it smelling like that strong when we had it the first time thinking apple dumplings I'm thinking anything with apple pie involving apples yes yeah like the pie feeling is is what it is so as as people did back in the day you know you sip a little bit out of the bottle you get some backwash into it that's the flavor so I'm gonna go ahead and brave just a sip of the of teabags apple pie moonshine Thank You teabag cheers Cheers oh he gloves it nobody this I know we say this about a lot of our smooth beers and smooth brews no this is going to get you [ __ ] up and get you [ __ ] up quick so you don't taste any bite there is nothing that [ __ ] as smooth as a baby's butt I don't even know what we call this dog like bottle let's try it teabags apple pie moonshine let's try it like mine I had to and we'll do the Flame Burst get the flavor bird go right ahead [ __ ] sake I can chug that thing and then you'd be dead yeah so far for the sipping for the sophisticated people haha we're gonna go ahead and do our sifter glass that we hold at night so we're gonna go ahead and just gonna pour Justin yeah because this stuff is you know liquor Lord where I liquor so it's gonna probably honestly don't know the content on it either now we've already seen what it looks like in the bottles so really what this what does this shine average using them content maybe around 15 to 20 percent so this this one set a record in percentage of content that we're really not gonna count it because it's not to say a beater yeah the beer as far as content goes still is the double dog double dog double IPA yeah that's our strongest beer this really is kind of in a league of its own as far as we would classify this more with like the malt beverages we just kind of assign these something off the beaten off path yeah they do make other moonshine too like cranberry moonshine and they sell this stuff to certain places you can get it but I'm gonna go ahead and sit this yeah I had a I bought a jar of blueberry one time then at Moorefield Walmart brought a thing home I drank that whole thing one night and I was feeling good by the end of it but you want to talk about a [ __ ] hangover we got plenty now you can taste the alcohol in there you taste it but it's nowhere near as strong as like a beer like it's so like the content is strong but it's so [ __ ] smooth but yeah if you're not careful you could drink the whole damn thing and then you be in trouble I am gonna suffer tomorrow guaranteed alright so we're gonna do another oh lordy ooh oh he got more than me oh crap yeah so oh this is something I wanted to do the leg tests a leg test so you swirl it get some swirl that's going on now mm-hmm you try and see where yes there is legs there is legs I'm not sure about moonshine but I know with like wine when you see those legs moving down the coffee now it's good my dad actually used to make his own wine or I guess he still does but not like he used to but anyhow I'm gonna draft attractive draft Simon stick sticking out of it yeah well take a big old curve we're not gonna finish it though no no no no we'll put you an extra quart oh yeah in the glass you can taste the alcohol a little bit more mm-hmm so I think what's going on is like whenever you pour it out it's it's almost like the alcohol flex more to the bottom yeah separate and as he continues what do you think what do it should we even bother with a range we just give it a straight five we need you know what we forgot to do a stupid rating in season five yeah because this was gonna be the finale yeah that is true and then Dima you remember how like every season finale we did a stupid rating yeah like what old mail was family all new as the family raised like the home brew kit was when we call that I did something my usual was something with that O'Doul's was whatever dammit you're making me think I don't want to think anyway well should we give this then if we're gonna do a stupid radio well I mean if we're good numbers I would say five easy five this is the tea bag rating of just moonshine I guess I don't know you know what's weird but it gets stronger as you get to the bottom yeah like the alcohol tastes get stronger they get to the bottom of it you said it even in the glass settle so ratings wise yeah straight five for me teabag you know how to brew some good [ __ ] yeah and and part of this might be the fact that aged for ten months every morning yeah what an age don't drink it right away I know you're all excited about drinking moonshine but let it sit or it make a couple batches and then drink that one and just forget about the way dev of make wine is like some of the wines he'd make he would let him age for maybe like three months or so and then but I hear like the longer you age that the better it gets oh yeah why is so much better with age famous scotch but we're not that sophisticated especially with it as we can't afford Scotch something good something different I liked it yes if you know somebody that knows how to make apple pie moonshine by all means grab some that's it apple pie don't stick your dick in it yeah you can't stick your fingers in there but I guess you couldn't in there oh let's do the record test oh the record test yes you're not don't even bother don't even bother no I have specialized for that too there we go there you go so I hope you enjoyed tonight's review on my coffee but yeah blank bottle apple pie moonshine because Terry likes shooting blanks I hope you're watching today that's going actually he has three kids so he ain't shooting blanks I know but anyhow I hope you enjoyed this and we'll see you next week and it's out", "TRhCHSaG_58": "[Music] I've been wanting to create the ultimate cider donut recipe for ba for a while and this I think is it it's packed full of apple flavor and I'm gonna show you how to make it so let's go boil some cider because one thing I didn't I did not understand about cider doughnuts because I looked at a lot of recipes when I was researching this and there wasn't a lot of cider in it and a lot of the recipes just didn't seem like they had a lot of apple flavor and so what I really tried to do with this recipe is really concentrate a lot of apple flavor into the recipe so I'm gonna start out with 3 cups of apple cider you want to put this in a large skillet along with two cinnamon sticks and we're just gonna bring this to a boil and we're gonna reduce this down into a syrup we're gonna really really concentrate the flavors it's almost going to become like like a really thick syrupy honey jammy situation we can't possibly add this much liquid into the batter or else it would actually be more like a cake than a doughnut so by concentrating it by getting rid of all of this all the water and the moisture that's in the apple cider we're just gonna concentrate all the sweetness we're gonna caramelize some of the sugar we're adding the cinnamon sticks to really bring out those like warm fall spices that I love and it's just gonna make a really great Nonna I think probably the easiest way to shop for apple cider I mean you know like you can you can go into the the juice section of your grocery store and you'll see the you know apple juice and like all of the clear apple beverages if it's cleared then that means it's been processed and all of the flavor has been taken out of it what you want to do is shop for apple cider that's refrigerated if it's refrigerated that means it's perishable and it probably looks like this kind of cloudy but that just means that there's a lot of apple flavor in there and it also probably means that it was fairly recently pressed so they're just taking all the apples in there like you know pressing them down they're extracting all of that juices and all of this all the stuff that's making it cloudy it's gonna add more flavor and that's what you really want so this is going to take about 30 minutes to reduce but we have a swap well good said we don't need to like swap the pan now right yeah great so okay so what's gonna end up happening is you know as the the apple cider reduces it's gonna get like you know some shmo G stuff around the the edges of the pan but it's gonna get into this like very thick jelly like substance it's really really super delicious actually if you made this and like put this on pancakes or french toast or swirled it into some soft butter and put it on a biscuit or a muffin it's amazing this is basically like a form of apple butter which we are actually going to use in this doughnut as well because I needed even more apple flavor so might as well just take this over and all right so we're just gonna get rid of the cinnamon sticks they've released all their flavor I wish you could smell this because it's like it's got a really really strong cinnamon and apple flavor it's super delicious it's really hard to get apple flavor in baked goods like if you've ever had you know applesauce cake or muffins it's a lot of times you know you compensate for the lack of apple flavor with a lot of the spices so they tend to be very spiced forward and if you take it away it just reads as a really moist cake you don't really perceive a lot of the apple flavor and so now we're going to whisk all the dry together I hear Brad Brad I just saw your yes making doughnuts side of doughnuts red bean doughnuts mmm no that's a apple butter and reduced apple cider yeah yeah yeah you gonna be around for a bit what's a bit yeah I'm surprised you're still here I'm glad you're making doughnuts Rick if there was anyone I'd want to make a doughnut it'd be sugar man marking yeah well I'm sad you're not gonna be here so is this old-fashioned yeah yeah all right I love cake times when they're good and they're fresh do the best oh yeah you know as long as I if I had a pick I love a yeasted doughnut but like when a cake is optimal it's something special it's really awesome carry on the good work thank you sir all right so that's mixed what am i doing now all right now I'm gonna mix all the wet ingredients so I've got the reduced cider this is the apple butter it's so good if you've never had apple butter you should definitely try it if you like applesauce this is like applesauce on steroids I've got some vanilla all right and you just want to combine this the the reduced cider is like pretty thick and syrupy so you want to make sure that you get it in there get everything combined before it goes into the stand mixer and when it cools off its gonna have like little clumps and that's totally fine those are actually just gonna melt into the batter all right no we're ready for the stand mixer so we are going to we are going to beat up our butter I love brats laughs this is brown sugar and granulated sugar and so we're gonna basically treat this as if we were making a cake this is a cake doughnut so let's just start on low just to get everything incorporated and so like with any good cake you want to incorporate some air into the butter you want to combine the the butter and the sugar it'll start to melt a little bit I'm using brown sugar because I like the flavor it also helps with the moisture level for cake donuts in particular the reason why cake donuts are so good when you get them at a good bakery is because they have an extruder that they can actually create a very wet dough and then just drop it down into the hot fat when you're making them at home it's harder because obviously most people don't have that and what makes a good cake doughnut is a really really wet batter and so anytime that you can add more moisture so in this case we're using the two forms of Apple we're using the the brown sugar which also has a lot more moisture that just helps with the the texture and also the flavor all right I'm going to add the eggs one at a time it's gonna look a little bit broken and then it's gonna come back together I'm gonna scrape the sides this is really important when you're baking cookies or cake or Donuts you want to scrape the sides of the bowl make sure that all the butter gets incorporated you can see the it's coming back together now I'm going to add the second egg so this looks pretty good I'm gonna turn it off and then I'm gonna add the dry and the wet in three editions so we're gonna do about a third of this just gonna kind of eyeball it and then I like to pulse whenever I using a stand mixer when I add the dry just kind of pulse it like that just to make sure that no flour comes and flies out at you all right the liquid and then and that looks like it's almost completely incorporated I'll add the dry again all right we'll just go ahead and put all of the flour in there now right and then the last of the wet all right looks like it's mixed great all right so no we're gonna transfer this to a parchment lined baking sheet you can see it's like super super wet and that's exactly what you want now the trick is whenever you're making a wet donut batter like this you absolutely [Laughter] like to lube up our mixer I like the way you think yeah all right just make sure that everything is completely incorporated in here and there are no streaks of butter or sugar at the bottom so the thing that you want to do because this dough is so wet you want to use a lot of flour on this parchment paper so I usually put about a third of a cup down just sprinkle it down it's gonna want to stick if you if you don't put this amount of flour and I know it seems like an obscene amount of flour but this is a very wet dough all right and then just turn it out make sure you get all this delicious appley goodness good all right and now we're gonna pop this out we're gonna need a little bit more flour to make sure that the dough doesn't stick to our hands and then just Pat it down you want to go about three quarters of an inch thick and it's gonna when it fries its gonna puff up so make sure that you get it pretty close to three quarters of an inch if you're gonna err err on the side of making it a little bit thinner all right that looks pretty good all right and so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna let this rest it's gonna be a lot easier to cut and fry if it's chilled the other thing that's gonna happen is the flavors are gonna come together and a really nice rest time about three hours or up to overnight in the refrigerator it's gonna allow the flour to hydrate and what that's going to do it's just gonna hold on to that moisture if you dropped in this into hot oil right now they basically just steamed out and so the donuts would seem a little bit dry and crumbly giving it a nice rest time of three hours to overnight its gonna just keep all of that moisture in there it's gonna give you some really beautiful craggy edges that are gonna hold onto a lot of that cinnamon sugar so we're gonna wrap this up and put it in the fridge now we're going to mix the cinnamon and sugar together so I've just got some ground cinnamon and some granulated sugar you want them in a fairly you know like a medium to large sized bowl because we're gonna toss the hot donuts in here and you want to you want them to have room to like mix in and get in all those cool craggy bits and now we're going to cut the donuts so this Joe's been in the fridge overnight I actually think overnight is best like so whenever I make this recipe I make the dough the night before I'm gonna use it and then just let it sit and then cut in fry to order and I've got a three and a quarter inch cutter it's important whenever you're cutting like whether it's a cookie or a doughnut you want to dip the cutter in flour just to make sure that it's not going to stick and then what I usually like to do is just go around give it a little twist to make sure it's not sticking the dough is still pretty pretty wet and sticky so that's why it's important to make sure that you flour after each cut and then just go around I usually just go all the way around make the cuts for the big guys and then go back and punch out the holes and then definitely we will save those scraps and then re-roll and punch out those and just take a smaller cutter and then just go in and punch out the holes do I keep them oh my god Tommy yes they're delicious those are actually shot snacks like when I'm frying these up like i'll you know fry up the doughnut holes first to make sure that you know they're good and i'm not gonna feed my guests subpar doughnuts so my oils heated up I've punched out some holes and some doughnuts and now I think it's time to fry you want a decent amount of oil because otherwise if you don't have at least three inches of oil in your pot the donuts could sink to the bottom and potentially get burned so we're just gonna go ahead and carefully drop these in we're running a little over 3/16 that's fine because we're dropping these in I'll throw in a couple of doughnut holes just for funsies adjust your temp as necessary but whenever you drop anything cold into hot oil you're gonna you're gonna lose some heat they're gonna sink to the bottom and they're gonna come back up and you can see what's really fun about these doughnuts is they get this really beautiful craggy edge so what's happening is as the batter heats up on the inside all of that moisture starts getting released and the steam will open up cracks on the top of each of the doughnuts and that's a classic old-fashioned style cake doughnut if you glaze them they're gonna hold on to the glaze in this case we're gonna dip them in cinnamon sugar so all the cinnamon sugar is gonna like get into those like little craggy bits and it's gonna be really really delicious they're gonna start to puff so you know the the dough itself is only about 3/4 of an inch thick but we're probably running about like an inch and a half now the hole is going to kind of close up so they're gonna get this really nice brown color and that's really what we're looking for I've got a couple more ready and if your dough starts to get a little too soft you can always throw it back in the refrigerator all right these are looking good you can see how puffy they are now and see those are the beautiful craggy bits that I was telling you about so that's the steam that's like escaping from the doughnut it's super hot look how beautiful those look alright I'm gonna drop in the next batch all right I love making donuts well really I love eating donuts let's be honest it's the best thing in the world and make sure you have a thermometer in your oil this really needs to be around the 350 360 degree range and anytime I fry I have a thermometer a lot of times I'll actually use a digital thermometer with an alarm so it just cues me in like when it's dropping too high or too low and then you just adjust the the temp and don't be alarmed like you can see like this one's opening up on the sides in the bottom so these these donuts were a little bit wetter I think there wasn't a lot of flour where they were sitting on the parchment paper and so they're kind of opening up and that's totally fine because that's just more area that's going to get sugared it needs a few more minutes but I think these donut holes are ready all right that guy's done they're gonna be pretty soft when you pull them out of the oil but they'll they'll firm up a little bit as they sit I love that look this look right here with all these little craggy bits and he's beautiful okay the donuts when I first made these Brad was actually like I want you to leave me some plain without sugar I was like dude who eats an unsure gerd donut maracas the same ways like I don't really like the glaze no donuts need to have something on the outside or something on the inside glaze or cinnamon sugar look at that that is that is what it needs to look like it needs to be puffy it needs to be craggy it's light and fun little donut holes right like who wouldn't want that like if if I walked into somebody's house for brunch and they were making these and that's what they were serving me I would be so incredibly happy I don't know I'm like so confused I just want sugar this one is so beautiful to me I love those craggy bits and it's still warm oh yes it's gonna be so good I'm so light I'm so moist I just love this we're really good I know Ben want some I can see him I think that the holes might actually be the best way to go because it's like there's more sugar surface area I know thank you", "2MWHklj6Dbs": "[Music] [Music] well this is the second time recording this you can see they're already apples in here I just recorded it about probably two minutes ago and then realized I didn't turn on the microphone I added the apples this is all twelve pounds of them I took a gravity reading and the gravity readings showed that we were at one point zero three which is a little bit below what I wanted in the timeline of adding this stuff so it's okay we're gonna let this set and we'll see hopefully the the yeast will go ahead and start eating the sugars from not only the honey but also some of the apples I don't know how much flavor profile we'll lose through fermentation but I do know I'm gonna have to go through and punch the cap with this which means that you push down the the fruit to help us to make sure there's room for the yeast to you know shoot out there the gasses as they go so I'll be doing that I'll be back with some updates soon I don't know let's find out what happens alright here we are it's been about about three weeks I had a little contraption here that I used to keep my apples down I put a couple airlock Bundeswehr we called and then I put my lid on top and that made another lid that pushed down the apples the whole time so they're basically submerge the entire time that this was finishing riveting so I think that worked out well and that now these apples have been fully submerged maybe their flu flavors got imparted well enough I'm just gonna move this to the side and we're gonna go ahead and move this into a new container today so what's gonna happen I gotta clean my mess here in a second I'm gonna take a move from this container down into this one I don't have a glass carboy I wish I had a glass carboy I would I would much prefer putting this into a glass carboy as opposed to a plastic bucket to age for any amount of time in however my five gallon glass carboy and my six gallon glass carboy are both being used therefore I don't have an option I've already stand and sanitized everything that's easy I'm not even gonna pull like the apples off the top literally what I'm going to do is just put my my auto siphon through here and I am gambling I'm probably gonna have sediment to deal with anyways so I'm gonna get as much as I can out of this it's I mean it's just filling up like this right now let's see it going and we're gonna finish moving it over and then I think I'm gonna get a quick taste test to see what it's like currently and then I'm gonna add there I got a couple cinnamon sticks my favorite one my favourite means I've made it's the apple cinnamon Mead many of you know this and I'll be putting a couple cinnamon sticks in considering this is about five gallons of me - after the apples or before the apples yeah the three cinnamon sticks yeah basically like two and a half one of us pretty broken should be plenty the cinnamon flavor goes a long ways so I'll be back in a moment when this is finished moving over and then we'll try it okay so while we're waiting this is still moving over or getting moved over I am I'm gonna go ahead and take a gravity reading and our goal is to see of course where it landed I haven't checked it since it started for a meeting and I'm hoping that it permitted all the way out and it looks like it did it one point there's a couple bubbles but I can see through the side here one point one yeah one point zero zero zero zero so we are currently at you know leveled out which one means we've hit our max percent ABV currently unless we add more sugars and I don't plan on adding any more sugars there might be a little bit of sugar in the cinnamon sticks like only a slight amount that's not enough to actually do anything about it so let's get it take taste test I'm going to pour a little bit this to do a glass okay let me give you my expectations before I even taste it it's gonna taste eesti I can say that for sure I'm hoping that there's apple flavor present because of the apple juice who put in as well as hold the apples we put in and then I believe there will be a honey character there but I think the biggest flavor overall is going to be yeast because this is still a fresh fermentation the yeast were living on those apples and when I moved them over the Easter now and here they will drop down blah blah blah you probably know how this works so let's get a quick taste test Wow not as easy as I thought it's definitely very very dry yeah it's really dry like it's like a cider it tastes like a cider if you carbonated it but like a very not sweet cider it's definitely gonna need some back sweetening it's this a little bit tart for me so I think there's gonna be a little bit of a change in my plan it's a little too dry but you get the apple taste which is nice you get a Polly taste it's just not not sweet enough and I don't want it to be super sweet I'm not the biggest fan of like a super-sweet Mead but I definitely want it to be a little sweeter because I plan on giving this over to people a little chunker apple in it it's fun I definitely put on giving this to people and I want them to like it and then generally a little bit of sweetness helps to it with that so yeah gonna need some so much honey but that's okay I think my alfalfa blossom honey that I currently have in here it's gonna work really well for it so let me finish moving this over then we'll talk about adding those sticks cinnamon sticks in and stabilizing because we're gonna have two back sweetie some other things alright we finished moving it over that's a lot of apples there at the bottom that's about up to there worth of apples so we have there's a lot space taken up by that this right here is my six and a half gallon furniture no glass plastic furniture that's almost full we probably have five and a half fish counts almost I'll take five and a half comfortably and the next step I'm going to throw these apples out we used for him not gonna bake with them they've been basically preserved in alcohol so I guarantee you they don't taste very good I'm just I have no use for them so I'll throw them out feed him to somebody next step this is going to be the next steps I should say I want to impart some flavors so first flavor I want to impart and add into this mix our cinnamon sticks so I have three cinnamon sticks here and I'm actually I've made an executive decision in this moment to only add two so we get a little bit of cinnamon flavor I think the cinnamon flavor will add over time I can go ahead and add them like this because we have alcohol content to protect them I think it will fine and so I'll leave them in there I just basically set them into this mead now we also need to talk about the the step after this this is going to sit with the cinnamon sticks for let's say a week or two I'll probably taste it as we go along I do want to back sweeten and I don't want to back sweeten when the Easter active so I'm actually gonna go ahead and do two things today cinnamon sticks and stabilize the meat if you've never stabilized a meat that means you use potassium sorbate and potassium metabisulfite or Camden tablets as we call them sometimes to stabilize the mead which means the yeast stopped fermenting on anything and generally are halted from any further possible fermentation so what I'm gonna do is gonna add all of my white powders to do that here so let me show you what that means all right here I have my potassium sorbate like I said that stabilizer that just basically slows down the yeast to make some not really be able to function any more potassium metabisulfite also a stabilizer but it also is a preservative I don't know why that word didn't come to be preservative so this will help make the mead last longer generally they last long anyways but this will let me bottle it for longer if I could leave it for ten plus years so I need on here it says 1/4 teaspoon for 5 so we don't need a ton of this really we only need one little spoonful one little quarter teaspoon so we're gonna add that straight in now I am doing this because I don't plan on actually going back and and trying to carbonate this naturally I could go back and forth carbonate but I don't have the utility to do that so if I wanted to to carbonate it I would want to make sure that the yeasts are still alive so I could add some sugar and then they'd carbonate in the bottle you might have seen just a little activity there that's from the yeast going what the heck is happening this ain't cool dudes now we're gonna add the stabilizer which is half a teaspoon per gallon so we're gonna assume we have 5 gallons here we need what is that two and a half teaspoons so let me get that we're also going to see some activity from this okay so we have our potassium sorbate and meta by sulfite in here makes it dance um do I think there's any issue of adding this with the cinnamon sticks no I think it's okay the next step will be to close this down and I'm actually going to just let it sit like this for probably two three weeks maybe a little while longer and taste-tested along the way to see how the cinnamon stick flavor is imparting if the cinnamon stick flavor is imparting well I might go ahead and rack it off into a new thing but because we have stabilized it now and eventually our cold crash it which means to put it in a cold area things start to settle down and at that point the the mead begins generally become clear which is nice after I go through those steps I'll be able to back sweeten with my honey without any worry of reefer mminton which means that all the sweetness I'm adding will actually be added to the mead instead of just fermented on so for right now I'm gonna go ahead and put this put a lid on this put it away videos not done though I'm gonna complete this mean because I want to teach you how to make a sizer which is what we're making right now an apple Mead so I'll be back with next step of problem racking and putting some honey with it soon all right and we're back this has been sitting with the cinnamon sticks for like three weeks no no just a little while I have just taken and moved it from basically another six and a half gallon furniture which is it was in this one right here and I wrapped it into this new one and I used a you can see oh yeah down there that's all the East and stuff and then I also use this funnel that is a great at the end to really just try to make sure you have any extra apples so the next step real simple we're gonna try and finish this hopefully the next couple days I have a little sample of it now I'm gonna get a taste of it and then we're gonna add a little honey to SPAC sweeten it because I'll go and spoil for you I've taste tested this before and it's a little too dry for my taste but here's this without any honey in it it's like definitely like um ooh that cinnamon is popped more the it's like apple juice it's very obviously cidery this is a sizer so it's very cidery taste very apple ii which is great this cinnamon is just enough it's just there enough that's like that's perfect just needs a little sweetness to kind of back to support it I don't want this to be super dry this is something I'm gonna share with a lot of friends so they are generally not sweet sweet people but like you know the sliver between dry and semi-sweet they're kind of in that range so I want to add a little bit so what I'm gonna do here is yeah it's good okay so I'm gonna do is add this is from bumblebees this is they sent me some honey really nice people thank you for that I'm gonna add just a couple drops and we're gonna get see with just a few a little bit a couple drops of honey if that's enough to back sweeten this of course I have a spoon and if this is enough basically what we're gonna do is not use the bumble bee honey but we're gonna end up using my alfalfa blossom honey to go ahead and back swing this so ooh Spillman mister this up real fast okay so this is with just a little bit of honey the issue with a back sweetening in this case is like I don't have exact measurements so I'm going more by taste so this is just to see if this is the sweetness character level all that stuff they want ooh yeah that's good perfect like blend of sweetness - cinnamon - flavor - apple flavor obviously I've done like a carbonation carbonated sizer before it's pretty good I preferred non-carbonated to be honest mmm that's great I did find one a little sweetness which what I've just learned is that I just need a just a little couple drops so to speak so what I'm gonna do here I'm gonna go and guess that I'm gonna need probably for this five gallon bit how many probably was it probably of half a pound no maybe a quarter pound of honey we're gonna first multitasking here oh here we go this thing weighs 46 point two pounds so I'm gonna go and tear this tear my scale out and now I just get like me here don't know if you can see it we're gonna go ahead and start adding I'm gonna start with a quarter pound of honey I think that could possibly be enough but what we will add a quarter pound in and then we'll stir it all up of course and after that we'll taste tab so the hard part with adding honey this way is that this thing doesn't pour super well so I just got to do it kind of slow and see looking for oh okay I should have been on the ounces Graham selection we're at 0.7 pounds of honey whoo all right so let's hope that I needed more than a than 1/4 pound of honey because I have more than quarter pound so let me stir this up real fast okay so I've got how to stirred it up this is a ad gassing wand with a of course the drill attached so now the next step is going to be I'm just gonna dump it in there how's my dry version we're gonna get a little sample of this one and I'll make sure to get a gravity reading too of this before we pour it all it's all bottled so this is with some sweetness this is with 0.7 pounds of honey a little more than I expected and I think that's okay because the honey is not really that prevalent it's there a little still a little too dry I think I had at 0.7 I'm gonna add point for more so about half of what I just did to that so I'm gonna go and do that real fast and then we're gonna see if that is what we need it all right mixed it all in 1.1 pounds of honey 2 back sweetness so far ooh spot-on not like it's not super sweet like apple juice but it's got a little sweetness to back support it yeah I'm definitely a fan of that man that's kind of good blend between sweetness apple that cinnamon is just enough in there to like it not quite in your face I think that's the big thing that's my previous one that was very very cinnamon like so this is get this is a lighter version of this meat and I want to remind you that this has been stabilized hopefully it's been actually stabilized so that whenever I the this honey won't be you know fermented on again so here's the next step we're going to take and actually put the lid back on for about a day and I'm gonna watch the airlock and see there's any activity if there's any activity that basically just means that the yeast are truly not dead that they are still gonna ferment some which is not good which means that all that honey we added just gets feasted upon so I'm gonna go ahead and put this lid back on and then I'm gonna put it away and I'll see you in about 24 hours and hopefully about that time I can actually take and bottle it into however many bottles I can get out of it but oh actually for have to do one thing let me let me get a gravity reading that's my big thing I forgot okay so my gravity reading here shows though we are currently at it was leveled out last time I looked so 1.000 we're currently setting at roughly one point zero five looks like one point zero zero five not quite one point zero one which is fine we've got just a little sweetness we don't want it to be too too sweet because that thing that would greatly affect the mead so we're gonna go ahead now and get like I said and put this lid back on I'm just gonna pour this back in here and then hopefully in 24 hours time we can go ahead and bottle it so I'll see you in about 24 hours all right we're ready to bottle so I've gone ahead and sanitized all my bottles here I've got a ton of them don't know exactly how much I'll need with about five gallons of liquid that's 60 beer bottles or I think like it's a like maybe six wine bottles per gallon so we're gonna see how many bottles like get by the end of it I'm using beer bottles he's in these are basically double beer bottles little wine bottles bunch of wine bottles a couple 375 milliliters excuse me anyways you'll see in a moment but I will be giving away a bottle of this so stay tuned for that everything's been sanitized I've gone ahead and done that I have a spray bottle that I use to sanitize all my stuff and of course you know you know how this goes anyways each bottle I have this elevated so that will actually flow easier we're gonna get our first bottle going this which is the hardest one every single time basically so I feel like each bottle and then I after that after I fill each one I'm going to go ahead and cap them and core call them that are you know that need to be captain corked so I'll be back in the second we'll talk about the giveaway and of course you know take care of the rest the video so I'll be back in a few all right so I've finished bottling them all I have roughly let's see 28 33 beer bottles I got four wine bottles five 373 87 milliliters I think is what those are I don't know if that's right math in then I got three of these basically bombers so uh I'm gonna be giving away one of these bottles I'll be giving away one of these I think it's three I don't exact math but let me tell you how you can win so I'll be giving away one of these bottles this is roughly what my labeling looks like you can kind of see I'll put nicer labels on these for now I'll put a temporary label so I don't get them confused cuz I have a bunch of stuff going on all at once and the big thing is I want to make sure and not get things mixed up so I'll put some temporary labels on until I finish these and get them printed out and stuff but you can win this bottle the way you can win you need to be a man-made Mead subscriber on YouTube we need to go down in the comment section and say something like hey I want to win that bottle and you also need to follow me on Instagram or the Facebook because that's where I post the winners so you will know if you want real simple and I love getting doing those giveaways so go check that out but this has been a lot of fun if you've never made a sizer definitely worth it I really like my sizer recipe because I think I'm perfecting it at this point but also adding things like cinnamon and extra flavors just take it to the next level so I highly encourage you to try making a sizer if you've never done it before I'd also encourage you if you want to go check out my other videos because I have a bunch more you can see but ton of me make content at this point it's a lot of fun to do and then of course this other links down below I have a website there's a Facebook page there's a Facebook group there's a patreon all that stuff goes to support me the big thing with with making Mead is that you need to try to have a good method and of course make sure you're sanitizing everything but just be patient so these things are gonna have to age for a little while longer of course to be better because it's still a very young mead and if you have any questions about the process like bottling I skipped over stuff like that feel free to ask below or check out the video on my channel about bottling so hope you guys have enjoyed this video I will be back with some more content very soon maybe some more cisors some various things as you can see behind me I have got a ton of stuff happening and that's just what you can see there's even more stuff happening in these cabinets so stay tuned for more videos see you guys next time and Cheers [Music]", "pDpm8e2L968": "[Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm so excited for this I want to show you how to make my caramel apple pie it is out of this world it's so good but it's really easy of course I'm making it I don't make things that are complicated but before we get started we need to go over the ingredients you're gonna need some sliced apples some chopped walnuts brown sugar regular sugar caramel sauce some cornstarch salt cinnamon and orange and for the topping you're gonna need some more flour some more walnuts sugar and some cold butter and of course you're gonna need the pie crust now I'm using just a store-bought 9-inch pie crust but I do have an episode on how to make basic pie crust so if you want to make it from scratch go ahead and follow that video because it's my no fail pie crust recipe but I don't have it on hand and I got two of these for a dollar fifty so they were a really good price so while they're cheap buy them stock up so first thing I do is get your oven to 350 get that kind of ready for you now the apples in question I am using McIntosh apples that I have just peeled and then I've sliced and then turn a little bit Brown because they've been sitting here for a couple minutes but I did put a little bit of lemon juice over them so now let them turn to brown too quickly so before we get going on this what I want to do is get my caramel sauce now this is my homemade caramel sauce and you can definitely find the recipe on WWN calm I do have an episode on that and what I'm gonna do is just take about a quarter to a half a cup and spread it thinly at the bottom of my pie crust so just go ahead and spread it until you have an even layer you don't want too much of it but you want a nice even going layer yeah that's perfect okay now set that aside so we can go working on our apples now in here and this couldn't be easier I'm gonna start with my orange first all I'm gonna do is take the zest of a small Orla probably used by half the zest and I want a whole lot I'm also gonna use that juice of half of an orange this is really gonna be sort of a nice bright flavor in the background with all those rich flavors so it's gonna really go well with everything else we have going on and I do put it in my apple pie so I figured hey why not let me just grab a knife because of course I'm unprepared squeeze that in not too much just gonna give this a toss that looks great now I'm just gonna add pretty much everything else my regular granulated sugar now these are kind of tart apples so you know whatever Apple you're choosing to use make sure it's a nice tart one and one that'll hold its shape nicely walnuts just gonna give him scrunch in my hands to break them up a little bit more cinnamon cornstarch and some salt if you don't have cornstarch you could always use just a couple tablespoons of flour that'll do but the cornstarch really thickens it well so just carefully and with a lot of patient just mix everything together until all the spices and everything is kind of incorporated and coating the Apple as well this looks good now I'm just gonna put the mixture in my pie crust just kind of trying to make it as even as possible that out take my here we go that looks good don't you think yeah at least so now in the same bowl because you know me I don't like to wash up a lot so you know fewer bowls the better I'm gonna put all the toppings for my streusel and what this is gonna do is just kind of give you you know texture and more flavor on top and this is cold butter that I've kinds of little cubes oh wow that's bizarre and I put it in the fridge you wanna make sure it's really cold and you can use a fork or you can do like I do and just use your fingers and kind of pinch the butter with your index finger and your thumb and just mix it through the dry ingredient just like that just keep mixing until the butter is evenly distributed in small little pieces that looks perfect I'm very impatient so the butter is a little bit bigger than it should be but now just go ahead and evenly distribute this topping all over your apples I'm told you have pretty much the top covered in it there we go that looks perfect now I'm gonna wash my hands put this into the oven preheat it to 350 for about an hour and then we're gonna let it cool completely I'll take a couple of hours before we can serve it and then I'll show you what this beauty is gonna look like once it's all done and we're ready to eat my pie baked for about an hour and five minutes and it's perfect I let it cool for a half an hour but unfortunately it's not cool enough to cut yet and I don't know about you but just because I can't cut it does not mean I can't taste it I can't wait to extra hours to cut this so I'm just gonna go right in because really all I'm looking for is for the topping the apples in the caramel I could care less about the pie crust at this point I just want the gooey goodness that's in here and I like it when it's warm so that's what I'm gonna do some of that and some of the walnuts mmm what's that a sticky caramel apple filling I don't know it's a divine I'm gonna go back for more I has everything I'm like out of my mind like I don't even what to say it's so good it has everything I love it's sweet it's got that like delicious like cinnamon II mixed with the orange makes it really great almost Flor Lee tasting the background texture it's unreal this is a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream and then and only then top it with whipped cream you're in business do you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying I'm gonna eat inside of this I know it but that's time it's super simple and easy to make you saw how long it took me let me know no time at all go www.laurainthekitchen.com and get this recipe and make this pie because you're going to absolutely water see ya [Music]", "3nRFan6eru0": "today on the stay at home chef I'm showing you how to make slow cooker apple cider when apples are in season I love making large batches of apple cider in my slow cooker I freeze it so I can enjoy it all winter long I'm going to show you how to make a basic apple cider recipe so you can alter it for any occasion I like adding in a little bit of orange juice for an orange apple cider or even caramel and whipped cream for a caramel apple cider it's really delicious we're gonna start out with eight Gala apples now my method doesn't require any peeling at the Apple so I'm just gonna cut it in half cut it in half again then cut out the core and cut it so that it's in eight pieces for the Apple I'm gonna do this with all eight of my apples now don't worry if the apples Brown a little bit while you're cutting them it's totally okay once you have all eight apples cut up we're gonna transfer them all into a slow cooker all in there then we're going to pour in ten cups of cold water which is a lot and really fill your slow cooker on this one there's eight cups another two and that makes ten now the idea behind this is that the apples will steep in the water and release all of their juices and flavor we're gonna add in three more spices to give it that apple cider feel I'm going to add in a tablespoon of whole cloves a teaspoon of whole allspice and then four cinnamon sticks and I'll use the cinnamon sticks to kind of push those down in and then I'm going to put the lid on and let this cook on high for three hours after three hours we're going to take a masher and mash up all of those apples then we're going to add in half a cup of brown sugar and let it cook for another three hours on high the last thing we need to do is run this all through a strainer to remove all of the solids and leave nothing but our delicious apple cider you can enjoy this apple cider right away or you can freeze it for later use like I do since we let it cool completely and then transfer it into freezer bags and pop it in the freezer when you're ready to enjoy it let it thaw and then you can warm it in a pot over the stove thanks for watching you can find the full written recipe in the video description be sure to subscribe and check out the rest of my channel where you can find more than 150 restaurant quality recipes you can easily make it home see you later [Music]", "06DqUgTCdBY": "all right so what we got so far is for cinnamon sticks gallon of apple juice and a gallon of apple cider and three cups of sugar you let this simmer for about fry it right around an hour and a half or so at medium high until it gets to a nice smooth boil and then when it gets done boiling the mix in your 151 proof of Everclear alcohol oh now it's a waiting game now I would recommend you use a little bit bigger of a pan than what we decided to use probably start on that big round pie from that tall maybe you know couple more inches but as you can see it's medium high yeah tune back in", "LnT2f0bsujI": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hi guys thanks for visiting my channel today it's finally feeling like fall outside and that has put me in the mood for some of my favorite fall treats so today I thought I'd bring you along for one of my Starbucks favorites and we're gonna do a copycat version of their caramel apple spiced cider now when they make theirs they use apple juice the cinnamon Dolce syrup and caramel and then they do the whipped cream on top so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make ours a little bit special today and we're gonna make our own cinnamon Dolce syrup from ingredients you probably already have on hand it's super simple to make and it's going to make ours really yummy and in addition to that we are going to use real apple cider I know they use apple juice but we're going to use the real deal and then you could always make your own caramel which I frequently do but today I don't have any on hand so I'm gonna use some I bought at the grocery store and that's totally fine if you don't want to make your own cinnamon Dolce syrup that's fine too just stop by Starbucks and grab a bottle of theirs but it's super easy to make and it's more economical to make your own and there's no preservatives or anything else in it so let me show you how easy it is to make and then we put our apple spiced cider together so the first thing you're gonna do is you're going to take a cup of brown sugar and put it in a saucepan I've packed it a little bit so you need a cup of brown sugar you're gonna need a cup of water and basically what we're doing here is just making a simple syrup into that we are going to add a teaspoon of cinnamon so that we have our spice to syrup so what we're gonna do is we're just going to bring this up to a boil and you're gonna let it simmer until it reduces approximately by half it takes five to 10 minutes for that so I'm gonna go ahead let this come up to a boil let it simmer for five minutes or so until it's reduced some and then be back and we'll put our fall drink together okay guys I brought my sugar and water and cinnamon mixture up to a boil and now I'm simmering it and I just wanted to show you how you want it this is about how you want it to simmer for about five minutes and during that time it'll reduce and thicken up a little bit and while that's happening I've got my apple cider on the back burner warming up so we can put it all together once our syrup is done okay guys our cinnamon Dolce syrup is all done I let it simmer for about five minutes until it started to thicken a little bit and then I poured it into a glass measuring cup just so it can cool a little bit and that's what it looks like smells amazing now you could use this for a lot more than just making the caramel apple cider that we're going to make today you can drizzle it over pancakes or over waffles you can put it in your coffee you can use it in a lot of different ways it's really versatile just make sure that whatever you don't use you keep in an airtight container in your refrigerator it doesn't have any preservatives in it so we need to keep it refrigerated and one of the ways that I like to do that is I like these little glass bottles with the attached lid they don't take up a lot of space in your refrigerator and they're perfect for a syrup like this so I just bought this at my local grocery store but you could probably get them on Amazon as well so now when we're going to do the fun part is we are going to put together our caramel apple cider and what you need to do is we're going to take about two tablespoons of the cinnamon Dolce syrup and I did as you saw in the video earlier I warmed my apple cider up we're going to after the cinnamon Dolce syrup you're going to put in a little squeeze of your caramel and and you can make your own caramel I frequently do and it's better if you make your own but today we're just going to use what I had on hand and then you're gonna pour in your warm apple cider six to eight ounces good stir to make it even more special and decadent I'm going to do just like they do at Starbucks and we're gonna top it off with Carla cream and then a little sprinkle of cinnamon and there you go homemade copycat Starbucks cinnamon caramel apple spice cider so good smells so wonderful great for a cozy fall afternoon to cuddle up with a book or sit by the window and just enjoy the beautiful leaves as they're changing and I also wanted to mention that this is a great way to save money for the cost of a venti sized drink at Starbucks you could make one of these for your whole family and I think that that's a pretty good deal and when you make it at home it makes it even more special so I hope you enjoyed coming along with me today I hope you'll give this a try this fall and enjoy the changing of the seasons I thank you for stopping by and spending part of your day

ahead and get this started now this was originally bottled on December 5th 2018 and it is currently December 24th 2018 let's look at the carbonation here this was carbonated naturally there was a no co2 was used and it was pasteurized with heat afterwards to stop the carbonation and it looks like I hit the carbonation perfectly on that you can see that's a nice head that that has on there for a hard apple cider give it a little taste it's it's nice it has a good apple flavor it's not dry at all but it's not overly sweet either I might have actually hit the mark with this that means I got super lucky I'm gonna try it again real quick here but I want to show you the bubbles in there again it looks like I'd hit that carbonation level that I was looking for about perfectly so again this was the test bottle I've got a bunch of other bottles that are actually in the fridge and I'll be letting them age until the summer and we'll enjoy those then thanks for watching and hopefully I'll see you on the next video if you enjoy videos about the randomness of our amazing world consider clicking on the globe to subscribe or maybe checking out one of the other videos right here", "pqx3-AbPBl4": "hey it's Kyle with Colin haymer supply in this video I'm gonna show you how to make aged peach pie moonshine so of course you're gonna need some moonshine some spirits you can use any kind of white on aged whiskey that you prefer I am going to be using this ole smoky white lightnin moonshine this is a hundred proof they make this specifically for making cocktails and mixing with other stuff so it's a higher proof which is good because we'll be diluting it with some juice okay as far as juice goes I'm gonna be experimenting with two new recipes in this video the recipe fo is used uses peach white grape juice like actually in jugs you can you can pick that up from Walmart you can pick that up anywhere but recently I discovered that Welch's makes a white grape peach concentrate so I'm gonna be trying that out and one version of this recipe and then also you can find this stuff it's called lose a peach nectar at like health food stores and whatnot it's kind of pricey but it tastes delicious on its own I mean like it's seriously good stuff and I'm gonna make a batch with that as well moving on we'll talk about the spices here so we've got some dried peaches I think we have 8 to 10 big chunks of dried peaches here we have some woodchips so a tablespoon to 2 tablespoon of woodchips and I mentioned it at the top of the video here that we're gonna be aging this recipe the peaches are gonna take some time to infuse the alcohol with their flavor that's going to take at least a week I would recommend probably taking a week and then just giving it a little sip to see how concentrated it is and then if that's to your liking then you move on we have an eighth of a teaspoon of the following cinnamon ginger orange and cloves we have about a half an inch of vanilla like a stick vanilla dried vanilla bean and then I have in there about 1/4 teaspoon of pink peppercorn if you didn't catch all that or that didn't cents just look for the link below in this video description and I'll point you to an article where I will list all of that out alternatively those ingredients are roughly what we use in our peach pie moonshine spice kits and I will link to these as well in the description the first step here is that I'm actually going to take these peaches and I'm going to cut them up into smaller chunks basically so there's more surface area for the alcohol to come into contact with there are two reasons I'm not using fresh peaches number one peaches is kind of tend to disintegrate pretty quickly when you use fresh peaches and you end up with like kind of a lot of chunky slimy stuff in the mix that's why I've never used something like this before it's kind of cloudy but it there is some pulp in there I guess but there's not much but I'm gonna try it out and see how I like it the people who really have been around the block and they've done this a number of times and they've learned from people in the past especially like mountain folk who do this kind of stuff what they'll tell you is that the best peach moonshine is actually made with what are called Indian peaches or blood peaches they're generally not something you can just pick up at a grocery store you have to go to an orchard or go to a farmers market or something like that to find those they're super hard they're not really for eating they're for baking they look blood-red on the inside and if you're using the fresh peach like that which I don't have right now because it's the middle of December you just cut slits in the side of the peach and then you would put that in a mason jar and you'd leave that set for as long as six months or so alright so I have my peaches here what I'm going to do is just pop the peaches into my kettle and then I'm gonna put the spices in there as well all right next I'm going to add the moonshine and like I said I'm experimenting here in this recipe so I'm gonna make this batch a bit bigger than I normally do just to see if I can extend the spices a little bit make a bit bigger of a batch without diluting the flavors too much I'm gonna be adding six cups of alcohol all right I'm gonna pop a lid on this and I'm gonna leave this set for about one week and then we'll come back and we'll wrap this up hey it's only been 24 hours actually since I last put the ingredients in pot here and then it occurred to me two things actually one I don't want to leave the alcohol in this container for a week despite the fact that it has a lid on it I'm worried that too much is going to evaporate out of it and two I made a mistake when I added the ingredients I should have used a muslin bag for the wood chips and the spices that's what I normally do one of these guys right here I did not do that that's okay that's fine this is gonna be just a test run for for a new recipe Stiles anyway so I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to strain the ingredients here and I'm going to pull out the peach chunks I'm going to set the woodchips aside then the other spices aside like I said this is just an experiment here this is not the normal recipe because I'm using two different peach ingredients I ain't worried about it what is gonna be kind of a pain though is pulling the peaches out of this strainer and not the other ingredients it's alright I might get some woodchips in here that's fine think really what I want to leave out are the cloves and there's some pepper in here Vennela would probably be okay to transfer over all right well that's that I'm going to now leave B sit for the rest of the week and then we'll come back and I will add some different types of peach juice to this and we'll figure out which is going to be the best all right it's been a week everything's done infusing so I'm going to wrap this up the first thing I'm gonna do is strain the ingredients the peaches and whatnot I'm actually gonna put it back in I ended up with a couple of wood chips in here I didn't end up with much wood in there and it's gonna just continue to add some more flavor however I don't want it in my like finished jar and like I said I usually separate these ingredients in a muslim' bag and I don't have to do this process of manually picking stuff out but forgot to do that so we're gonna pick through this one last time and just get these last few wood chips out of here I do want the peaches in the jar they'll continue to provide flavor and you know they're not going to make anything bitter or you know like overly oaky or anything like the other ingredients might so they're a nice addition okay so I'm gonna set the peaches aside here generally this much alcohol makes about three mason jars of finished product six cups I'm making two different kinds so I'm not really sure how I'm going to what I'm going to do no one's going to be a one type of juice and ones the other I don't know maybe I'll do a mix for the one in the middle what I do need to do is split the infused moonshine into the jars evenly nope got a wood chip in there I've about two cups in each so 400 500 milliliters it looks like in each one of these this has been in the fridge I let it fall out so I'm going to top this off for the most part I'm gonna leave some room to add some peaches back in and I'm going to do the same with this give this guy a little shake alright I'm gonna set this guy aside and I'll figure out what I want to do with that here in a second just give both of these guys a little shake strong oh yeah all right clear winner and there's the clear winner here I've always really liked this stuff I bought this from the grocery store before it's really delicious so I thought it might make it a nice peach moonshine it's just not strong enough though you know like when you drink this on on its own tons of like fresh peach flavor we were nice but it's not very strong obviously not strong as a concentrate it's gonna be that's just not doing it for me this however yeah it's sweeter it's on the sweeter side but at the petrol it comes through as well and with this recipe what I generally do is I will toss the peaches back in here and I'll leave these even longer like I'll leave them set another few weeks before actually drinking them and the peach just continues to infuse into the alcohol this is definitely something that gets better with age up to a point obviously you want to keep it refrigerated but at this stage this is way better than this is so what I'll do with this last year I think is I'll do like a 50/50 mix of this and the peach nectar do good good amount of that probably 2/3 of the can I'd say and then I'll top it off with this and then I'll add the peach back to you all of these all right and that's that aged peach moonshine I probably wrap this video up and then I'll come back with a separate video in a few weeks and I'll let you know after aging which one tastes the best at this point I am going to throw this in your refrigerator you know I'm not sure what the final abb on this is and what the ABV would need to be for it not to sort of like spoil so I'm gonna refrigerate it I'll come back in a few weeks with another video and I'll let you know which one is the definitive way thanks for watching see ya", "xolthx5tmeM": "okay quick video I'm gonna put a brew one quick and simple bro really quick and simple so I've got some juices tea types of juices I'm going to do tea brews by just walk you through one these ones from Aldi apple juice cider five litre water bottles keep everything clean obviously I've got hand sanitizers a bit of a salon I've washed my hands as well but just make sure now everything here is sterile inside so the juices are Sarah inside these bottles are sterile inside yeast a sterile everything's cleans you don't have to sterilize anything which is cool so I've empty the water on this one literally gonna open these and pour the juice is in how simple could this be [Music] they call turbo side I guess juice in this one I'm gonna do save these from Aldi these cartons 55 P each bargain really don't forget get your favorite glass and pour yourself a drink as well on your doing this each one of these cartons is five liters so I want to put five liters in here sunny some room for it to ferment being a bit mindful that you don't contaminate anything that's a juicy bowls Tara say that a minimalist way to start brewing cider lobbies hours or those they're a bit more complicated aren't this easy to do but genocide is really really simple [Music] yes it's kind of a Hilbert wave you can outcome let's try this apple juice yeah tastes like apple juice not bad and give you a close-up at the side I'm using and the company that I'm getting it from good people Deezer they send you comical emails as well have updates as to where your parcel is left for try if you're in the UK possibly Europe I'm sure the ship is right now I'm just a steps on these slightly loose leaks I got a fermentation for it so I know if thinking there's there are but what you can do is get some clean firm around the top elastic band no factors in there look for you or if you're really inclined you can drill a hole in the cap and put a bubbler in there obviously a sterilizer when you do that have me worked up that's five bottles minus the half pint that I've taken out and keep drinking so that's that bit right next comes the yeast as their societal yeast this is five grams of yeast but hunger that sort of roughly half fill in here of yeast I'm not gonna add any extra sugar because don't think I'll need it it's enough yeast to do a lot more than what I've done in these but don't do for now so basically go and tap that away somewhere warm 16 degrees 18 degrees something like that and wait for it to do its business job done next what I'm gonna do I've not done it with this one before but exotic juice this one's from Tesco it's a TPA juice garden here we go fusing these make sure they've got no preservatives in because that I'll stop yeast from doing its business and otherwise go make Sur so cheap so simple okay have fun be safe build something or brew some beer ciao", "65-Bc8MfIq4": "hello everyone welcome back to my kitchen i'm back from whipperwill holler and i have apples that i need to get processed so that's today's project so what i'm going to be doing today is i am going to can caramel apple pie filling and i love the flavors of caramels and apples together so i think it's going to be really good i'm not going to thicken it in the jar because i want to have flexibility so i'm gonna start peeling a lot of apples for each quart jar you're gonna need two and a half pounds of apples so i'm gonna try for five or six see how many i get but this is what i have so there's a fair amount of apples here and i need to get them used up so that's what we're doing so these are my mutsu apples and like guys if you saw my previous videos these i bought at apple hill california and i bought a big box 40 pounds of seconds and i also bought 40 pounds of pears now the pears i had to get done much earlier because they ripen and they don't last the apples have lasted but it's time to get them in jars so i'm gonna peel these and slice them and get the core out and it's going to take me a little while so we'll come back when i've got that all done i'm going to be putting them into water with some lemon juice to keep them from turning and this is going to take me a little while so i'm going to get with it get this done and then i'll bring you back i got all the apples peeled cored and sliced and i've got about 13 13 and a half pounds cut up that's this weight so i'm going by the directions per jar it calls for two tablespoons of lemon juice per jar then it calls for one teaspoon of cinnamon per jar so i have six teaspoons or two tablespoons and it calls for a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg per jar so now that i have all those in there i'm going to very carefully try and mix this some and i don't care if it gets totally because we are going to cook this a little bit but first we're just going to let it sit for half an hour covered so i'm just going to slightly mix it best i can and i know i won't get to the bottom but that's okay this is a big pot of apples but i need to use these up now before they go bad so they're getting canned all right i'm going to mix this up just a little bit more cover it let it sit for 30 minutes and then i'll come back i've let the apples with the cinnamon and nutmeg sit for it's been over half hour but brian's in here getting chicken rub and stuff ready for putting on the smoker so we're having to shuffle now what i'm gonna do is for every jar again this is per quart you will put one quarter cup of butter so i'm making enough for six quarts so i have a pound and a half of butter and i'm going to turn that on i'm not kind of medium low and i'm going to let it start to melt and i'm gonna go ahead and add one quarter cup of brown sugar tightly packed for every quart jar so that would be in my case is a cup and a half of tightly packed brown sugar and we're going to let that melt together once your butter and brown sugar mixture starts to bubble and it's all melted like this we're going to add a quarter teaspoon of salt per quart so that's one and a half teaspoons for the amount i'm making now that i've got that dissolved and ready i'm gonna pour that over the apples and i'm going to put that over i'm going to put medium-low heat to start until these start to cook a little bit and if you can only imagine the cinnamon nutmeg but also caramel apples just sounds amazing you can use this in a pie you could make tarts with it you could put this over ice cream and other desserts so now that i've got it mixed up a little bit i'm going to let this cook till it comes to a gentle boil and then we're going to turn down the heat and simmer it i'll bring you back well i've let this simmer and i'm not sure if you can tell but it has released a fair amount of juice and you can see how much it's been reduced which is what i expected to see and at this point make the apples to your preference i like them just a little bit firm but if you like them softer cook them a little bit softer so let's get this in our jars so we have hot apples and we're going to use hot jars and hot water bath or steam canner so now we're going to fill these jars and i'm going to leave about an inch head space the recipe calls for half inch but my experience is apples are going to swell some so i'm not going to put it that much now you will have the option of either canning these or freezing these i'm going to tell you this is a rebel kind of recipe i believe i think that because it has butter but i'm still going to do it i'm not adding thickener to it and i'm going to tell you this looks smells so tasty i love caramel apples you know being off grid we don't always have the lights on because it uses power so the sun is going down right now which means it's getting a little bit dim in here so i'm probably going to leave a little over an inch here but these are going to be amazing now you could also put this in jars or other containers and freeze it or you can use it right away whatever you would like i am going to can it and again that's probably a rebel recipe um but mostly because it has the butter but i didn't add any other thickener i know i see a bubble in there be sure be sure be sure to de-bubble and i'm wiping the rim with vinegar because this is sticky so i want to make sure that i get all the sugar and syrup off of it finger tight and oh my i think this is going to be so good into the canner as far as canning this quartz and pints are treated the same and it's 20 minutes if you're at sea level or but for our high altitude we're going to can this for 30 minutes so you add the extra 10 minutes but look at that caramel syrup it's going to taste so good so if you're not familiar if i say it's a rebel recipe i did not find that it is an approved recipe so if you choose to do this please do your own research and decide if you are comfortable doing that so finger tight and honestly with thanksgiving and christmas coming up i'm not sure how long these are going to be on the shelf anyway because yummy i'm going to finish filling all my jars and then we'll see how much i got well as mrs laurie whipperwill holler would say i'm a messy cook but i thought that i would probably get six quarts from those apples and i was basing that off of two and a half pounds of apples per quart but the recipe didn't say if it was before peeling and coring or after and that's before so your weight of your apples supposed to be two and a half pounds per quart since i peeled and cored them first i got quite a bit more so i have six quarts in the canner and i could add this other quart in there and the pint and a half but i decided instead i'm gonna take a pie to church so we can test this thing out so i got seven quarts and over a pint from those apples which makes me very happy so i'm gonna get these quartz in the canner and i'm using my steam canner but you can use water bath canner and i'm going to process for 20 minutes plus the 10 minutes for my altitude and i can't wait to see how those come out but in the meantime i'm going to start making pie so out of six jars one had a false seal but the other five are beautiful i made this pie for church and it was a huge hit it was gone in no time thank you for watching god bless and we'll talk soon you", "ujjdIIDthXQ": "A hard cider-braised pork. We're going to start out with a piece of marble pork. All I did was salt it and brown it in a little olive oil, which is the point I have it to here. You see this color is flavor in food. So we really have to take the time and be careful with this, to get our caramelization of the sugars in the protein really goin'. That's going to be such a key element in the ultimate flavor of the dish. So here's our pork. That's the color. Took me about 15 minutes or so to get there. Again, it depends on how big you cut the pieces. As you can see, I cut mine about three, three by two, three or four inches long by two. And now we're going to add to the drippings two large onions, lots of sage and thyme, one bay leaf, and I also add some juniper berry. We're going to add about a quarter cup each cider vinegar one, two, three, four. (pan sizzles) Keep your nose away from the pan. Obviously it'll make you sneeze, it'll clear out your sinuses, all that kind of thing. And we're going to add about a quarter cup of Worchestershire. This is the braising liquid. Hard cider, two bottles. And then once this comes back up to a boil and we begin to reduce it a bit and just make sure we got all the flavor, we simply cover it and put it in the oven until that pork is super tender and literally falling apart with a fork. So now we're just going to get the pork into this braising liquid, cover it, and get it into the oven. Now, how do we know when the pork in that hard cider's done? When it does this, when you can barely touch it and it breaks up. We're going to take the pork out. You can just take this beautiful glossy, literally hot mess, and go like this and thicken it up a hair, or we can take creme fresh, okay. And almost like we're making a paprikash or something where you finish with creme fresh or sour cream, you can add a few generous dollops and just whisk that around, let it come up to a bubble. Just reduce it a bit. Here's our perfect pork that's so tender, it was falling apart, and we're going to pour that down over the whole thing. All of those big, beautiful chunks of pork. (windchimes twinkle)", "d_HGTfAPr1E": "hi it's Danielle Walker from against all grain and today we are going to make a pressure cooker apple pie apple sauce it has been so cold and rainy here in California I know I can't complain since most of you are getting tons of snow and freezing cold weather but whenever we do get some rain and just a little bit of cold it makes me crave all of my favorite comfort foods plus I'm just starting to feed my little six-month-old some solids so I figured why not make applesauce for the whole family normally I do it in the crock-pot or on my stovetop but it's been one of my personal goals to try to use my pressure cooker instant pot a little bit more often so today we're going to throw this all into the pot set the timer for only five minutes and then walk away so just like when I like to make homemade apple cider I like to use a variety of apples when I make apple sauce that way you've got a little bit of tart a little bit of crisp sweet and then some soft apples so today I'm using a combination of Fuji Granny Smith and Gala apples my son had been asking to go apple picking for years and so finally we took him last year over to Sebastopol and it was so fun to see just how many different apple varieties there are there's so many more than what you see in the store so you've probably seen this contraption maybe in your grandmother's kitchen from years and years ago and it's you know the original spiral slicer is kind of what I like to call it but it peels cores and slices these all at once super simple I'm just gonna turn this around now this is a really fun thing to do to get your kids involved too of course you can go the old-school way and just take a vegetable peeler and a knife to it but this makes it a bit fun plus these long little ribbons are fun for kids to see as well so we've got about three and a half pounds of apples and it's about nine apples depending on the size obviously these Granny Smiths and Fuji are quite a bit bigger than the others and quite honestly you can kind of just eyeball this and really just do as much as you'd like it won't make too much of a difference so I was making an apple pie the other day for my Facebook by the way and I realized that what I love so much about apple pie filling is that the apples bacon gets so nice and sweet and then because you dot it with some ghee or butter it has this really rich flavor to it and then of course those spices like cinnamon and allspice so without the crust this kind of tastes like an apple pie if these are giving you trouble coming off the end the cores just pull this lever and pull this guy out and it'll kind of just pop it off for you we finally have our last Apple telling you this would have taken like three times the amount of time if I was sitting with a vegetable peeler I love this thing only problem is it does kind of spray you with a little bit of apple juice so be prepared to smell like apples for the rest of the day which is not a bad thing so I've got my bowl for my instant pot here and we're just gonna throw all of these fun Apple slinkys into the pot some of the bigger ones sometimes it misses a few of the seeds so just check it over you just don't want your little guys chomping down on seeds a few of the peels at the end is totally fine personally I don't tolerate apple peels very well so I just always peel them and they do add a really nice beautiful color and some added nutrients so if you want to leave them on no problem go ahead and leave them on there just a bit easier to digest without them okay and then we just have a few simple ingredients to add to the pot so I've got 3/4 cup of water just a bit of sea salt to help bring out that sweetness two teaspoons of fresh lemon juice and then we've got that delicious key that we're going to add so just two teaspoons is more than enough if you're not familiar with ghee its clarified butter and so the milk solids have been removed and it just leaves behind the butter fat which is 99% free of casein and lactose so a lot of people who have dairy intolerance --es can actually tolerate ghee if you can't go ahead and use some coconut oil in this this is fine and then we're going to just do a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice you could throw some nutmeg in this too that would be really really good but I found that this blend of spices even though it's not much it's just enough okay so we are all set you don't even have to stir this or cut the apples up any more we're just gonna pop this right into the instant pot make sure that your lid secured and that that pressure valve is set to pressure and then we're just going to hit the manual button and adjust the time to five minutes so that's going to take about ten minutes to come to pressure before that timer starts to countdown so it's going to be about fifteen minutes total five minutes of cooking time and the pressure cooker all right the applesauce is done I let the pressure release and I'm just going to take my handy dandy immersion blender just to mash this up you could also take a mashed potato masher if you want or even just a fork now I like my applesauce kinda chunky but for Easton I go pretty smooth all right doesn't really take much honestly very very soft already so just release that smells so good and you can serve it so many different ways so I actually loved it warm my husband used to travel to Chile quite a bit for his job and he used to have this homemade applesauce with just rich dairy cream in it and he always would come back and ask for it so I've started doing a little bit of coconut milk cream on top and it's really delicious but you could also chill it and serve it that way it's also really really good over my maple Dijon pork tenderloin for meals made simple and I've also been eating it with breakfast sausages in the morning so there's so many different options for it just going to this is the cream has hardened on top of my little coconut milk but I'm just going to put just a teeny bit in there a bit on top and then I like to put just a few slivered almonds it's kind of like a dessert but there's no sweetener in it which is fantastic hmm it really does taste like apple pie filling I love the allspice and the cinnamon in it and it's so warm and delicious on this cold rainy

go to Goodwill for my clothes a lot save money a lot by Morgan is the lab I chose I've rolled in a way up I use another day for all this junk IT my neighbors all hate me they abused and raped me cause I have energy yeah I do energy welcome to another episode of doing it cheap well how y'all doing we got us another video here one of my viewers told me about how he makes his homemade one and I thought man that sound like a cool idea so I thought I'd share with y'all and it occurred to me yesterday whenever I was doing the UH the Welch's grape wine you know I was looking at my I was looking at my recipe and I noticed that doing a 1.75 litre jug I was using 1.75 cups so that means that I use a cup of sugar for each liter of juice and then 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon of yeast so that makes it really is remember how much sugar you need a cup of sugar for every liter of juice okay well let me show you something my Muir says both I know the oldie and they've got he said a 2-liter bottle of apple juice for like a dollar 89 well it's not too Leisure's it's two quarts okay it's one point eight nine litres but it's close enough a quarter is is 32 ounces I think a leader is thirty three point something else's so it's not enough that we're going to worry about so we're going to say that I use a cup of sugar for each liter or each court okay but when I'm making a gallon I really don't use four cups I usually use about three and a half but it's you know it's something you play with you know the neat thing about a recipe is once you've made it one time you can play with it do it different the next you know you want it sweeter add more sugar and I was telling everybody you know the yeast I use is just that that flesh ones yeast from Walmart Rutherford by the by the flour and stuff I don't worry about buying the winemakers yeast and a woman asks me says is that active yeast filling them if the splashlings active dry yeast you tell thee but like I said we don't take this and put it in a bowl of warm water to activate it we just please write in our wine jus and speaking of just put it right in there that bad just started your he's already got suds and froth on top of it's working so hard alright well let let me show you what we're going to do here to make this so simple so all you do is buy your two or jug of apple juice they're made apple wine before looking forward to it in the two cups of sugar and a little bit of yeast let's see what we come up with here now I know I know that whenever I try to pull this back in this jug and it will fit because I'm going to have that much sugar to it but I got an empty wine bottle here I'm going to put the excess then all I'm going to do is in this 100% juice I'm just going to pour it in a pitcher if that room temperature it's not at all chill two cups of sugar and since I just opened this you actually I don't know this would still be good so I'm going to get a little bit of this yeast here it don't take a whole lot alright there's plenty I'll put that in there okay all I'm going to do is spear that up stir that up feel the sugar is dissolved I love that wine bottle a nice thing about you check this one go in there make a little bottle of wine that's a lot do we have any balloons I don't have a screen cap to that thank you for no I said well do we have any condoms just she looked at me like what the hell hole that looks pretty good stuff in there man I taste like an apple pie mmm Delos let's ship Raven that apple juice just like an apple pie so by having this extra picture here I would just pull right back and the same ball would come out on I want to leave a little headspace I'll be enough we'll find out and then what I'm going to do I'm going to put some rest bottle right there it is make a little ball with me how much is in there almost a half of all let's take a quart on there but right now yeah all right well I'm going to sit at some more dark and I'll set that some more dark and warm I'll listen up the capped word can breathe a little bit and I think I'll just leave that Cork a little bit loose like that I'll do what it wants to it you let it let it pop that top off there well that's it that's the easy way to make someone that's it that's all there is to it folks y'all have a wonderful day and abettor more [Music]", "XRjJ2_Q9lQg": "okay we heading out to baltimore maryland to do our uh ninth review of a dog or a of a dog yeah of a beer from flying dog brewery uh in baltimore um and this is a style that we haven't really done many reviews for which is kind of a surprise to me and very interesting beer this is their apple pie blonde ale it's a fall seasonal um but for optimal freshness enjoyed by april 23 2021 it's currently december uh 13th and that falls well before the expiration date on this part of their looks like brew house rarities i see the the label is in the vein of a tape i guess rarities could be you know bootleg tapes and stuff like that maybe they're harkening back to the days of the uh i guess the 90s 80s and 90s i should say so this is apple pie blonde ale which is an american blonde ale um we've done summer love i know from victory and i'm not sure what else we've done in this style i'm sure probably a few other ones but i couldn't really find too many just at a cursory glance of them so we're looking for a very easy drinking beer very simple but they do add they can add i should say um notes of honey it looks like spices and fruit in this case it looks like they definitely added some fruit and spices we're looking at somewhere between four point one percent and five point one percent abv this one blows that out of the water it's all the way up to seven point two percent so it's out of that range uh ibus fifteen to twenty five the ibus in this beer actually are less than that uh twelve so one of them way out of range the other one a little bit out of the ibu range of the uh of the normal american blonde ale so this is a fall seasonal i don't know if this is a one-off if they're going to do this again next year uh they use oat munich and munich malts i should say and as far as the extra ingredients we're looking apple cinnamon cardamom nutmeg vanilla and lactose so maybe a little bit more of a thanksgiving kind of taste uh beer maybe even can be enjoyed around christmas and there is a little blurb here saying that nothing is more american than apple pie right well hold by beer literally we might not have invented beer or pie but we sure as hell perfected both 100 times more fun than paying to pick apples on an autumn day this crisp spiced brew is perfect for f-a-l-l in the usa okay so let's open this up and see what we got got this is part of a mix of six at wegmans it looked interesting i always try to just look at the beers in order of the ones that i haven't reviewed yet when i do a mix of six but likely all the time there's a beer that'll catch my eye that isn't in order and i end up picking these ones um very very light i'm getting like an apple smell already from the back but a very very uh amber golden lagery kind of look to this beer with a frothy head maybe about a half a finger or less lots of bubbles very bubbly kind of a kind of brew i'm drinking this in a prima pills glass translucent can see through it so let's get the aroma now of apple pie blonde ale extremely apple this almost smells like a hard cider like a angry orchard kind of a kind of beer and i'm wondering if that is going to be what the taste is that i am in store for so let's get that taste interesting so um whereas it's it smells like apple uh right at the right as it hits me i'm getting cinnamon like extreme cinnamon um and the nutmeg too so that's overpowering the apple taste but i am getting the aftertaste of an apple it's a pretty pleasant taste it's not that bad a little bit spice heavy for this style but i it's one of those beers that i think i would have one and then i'd move on to something else if i wanted another one um but pretty good i would say they did a good job uh succeeding in what they were setting out to do uh and that i'm supposing is making a beer that tastes like an apple pie not an apple pie person if you like apple pie you like beer you'll probably like this one so i'm gonna go ahead and give apple pie blonde ale from flying dog a an 8 out of 10. decent look it looks like a blonde ale the one thing that i would probably knock off a little bit is the aroma smelling just like a hard cider so it's if you just poured somebody this beer didn't tell them what it was they would automatically think by the aroma and the appearance that it was a hard cider which it is not um but the taste really uh for something that is not quite my ballpark of what i like i think they did a good job recreating it so uh 8 out of 10 for apple pie blonde l from flying dog", "G32GMXMF4mY": "hi I'm Emily and I'm a level one chef hi I'm Beth and I'm a level two chef hi I'm penny I'm with the Institute of Culinary Education and I've been a chef for 15 years this is my easy enough apple crumble pie recipe that's a trademark name the best time to eat this apple pie is every day every single day because an apple a day will keep the doctor away there's so many things that makes this special first of all there's spices and it's tons of delicious choice spices that I toast first before I grind fresh then there's rum right rum makes everything better the first thing I'm gonna be doing is pulling out my pre-made pie crust and just flour time just to make sure that when I roll it it doesn't become a pie table you know I'm going to start adding my dry ingredients to my mixer I have some all-purpose flour sugar souls hate flowers I'm just gonna combine them this crust is so delicious because there are two sticks of butter which is really cold it's something nice about rolling it out a little is it also makes it look slightly more homemade well one chef level-3 trickster I don't want too much water in the crust I wanted to just cut it together see how it sticks together this is perfect and I'm gonna start to add my water and my vodka most of the alcohol is gonna evaporate out and I end up with a drier flakier crust so I want to make a two crust pie I'm just gonna divide it get some plastic wrap you want it to be round try to make it as smooth as possible it's real easy crust is done I'm just gonna work it by hand for a second I'm gonna give it a little bit more love by hand by wrapping it tight I'm helping the flour fully hydron a minimum of one hour in the refrigerator or it comes at overnight 30 minutes some flour on my board I actually want the sides of the crust to drape over the pie pan I'm mostly just gonna try to get this bit out a little bit is half of my dough that's been chilled and rest in the refrigerator first I start by beating this down and now I'm gonna roll I want to roll the dough out pretty thin flour on the rolling pin riki mistake not flowering things big enough I'm gonna spray with just a light coating of pan release and then to transfer it I like to fold it in half line up the half right in the middle and open it up in the pan I love moving dough's and definitely not breaking them you always see people do this because it just makes it easier make sure you have some hanging over this end roll it back over the pin so I'm just pushing it into the pie plate to make sure that it's up against the edges lift it up let it fall back down into the pin this is gonna go back in the refrigerator for 30 minutes let it sit for about 20 minutes or so to let that gluten rest now I'm gonna be crimping my outer edge of my pie crust we're gonna make our egg wash the egg wash is gonna be glue let's start with an egg little milk a little bit of water to loosen it up the way that I'm going to decorate this top is to kind of make it look like a blooming flower and I'm gonna start cutting out my petal shapes okay so these are had a few minutes to chill out in the fridge the egg wash here is gonna allow them to stick to each other and stay in place there's naturally little small air pockets between the pieces so you don't have to cut any air vents in the pie layer up three together to look like the butt of a flower a little more standing up and that's the top crust of my pie ready to chill and firm up all right so my next step is I'm gonna make the mixture for my crumble that'll go on top of my pie I'm just gonna mix together flour brown sugar cinnamon and butter I do not believe that this is something you can over mix black pepper allspice both star anis green cardamom and cinnamon sticks I really just want to start to bring out the aroma transfer them into the spice grinder ginger is what makes chai tea spicy we're gonna use clean water and sugar a little pinch of salt after it comes to a boil we're gonna turn it off and let it sit for about two hours or so I use Fuji apples because they are very tasty and they work well for pies the Golden Delicious are sweet and soft and the Honey Crisp a very crunchy what I like to use our Granny Smiths and Gala apples and Jonagold I'm gonna use this awesome contraption to peel them and slice them and core them all in one go this is tough because I'm really slow and bad a feeling I'm gonna try to core this now because if I don't know how to use this corer I need to find out immediately I like to peel them all first then I cut them in quarters then I just used a paring knife to get the core out each segment I'll cut in thirds into my pan give us some butter already split scrape the seeds out 6 grams of that spice mix a couple of extra cinnamon sticks all my apples are gonna go in raw sugar vanilla cinnamon nutmeg and cloves flour salt 2 tablespoons lemon juice so I like to put the zest of the lemon in as well as the juice just make sure all the apples are coated the last ingredient rum so I'm going to chill this down and then chill it overnight I am just going to prepare my toppings for my pie I've done it they're prepared today we'll stick with whipped cream cream is nice and frothy some heavy cream and some milk sugar and a pinch of salt put in some vanilla got a half sort of sugar and we're gonna bring that up to a boil cream skim milk cake sugar egg yolks that's it that's all that's in here just till it says sniff this you like it the secret ingredient in this recipe is the caramelized white chocolate turn it off I'm just gonna use the residual heat from the cream some melts all that chalk and while I do that I'm gonna add this room what goes better on a pilot ice cream nothing nothing pour it out we're gonna chill this overnight so we're able to whip it later the next step is I'm gonna put my filling into my pie crust I do arrange them got a little more uniform distribution is probably good for cooking no slice is like the best slice and no slice is the worst slice we're all just different slices who look different you know make sure that you pack the apples in you don't want space I'm not gonna make it to talk because I think at all explode I like to put some butter right into the filling cold butter I really want it to be kind of like extra crumbly in the middle there's that candied ginger that I made earlier even with all that boiling it's still very spicy just want to make sure that it's evenly distributed I want to use my egg wash it holds the top to the bottom lots of filling in this beautiful pie talking paper makes it really easy to just peel it off just gonna roll the top unto the bottom beautiful top now I want to secure it to the edges make sure that you have slits in the pie for the seam a little more egg wash and I'm gonna sprinkle it with more of that Demerara sugar I'm going to bake this pie at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and then I'm gonna turn it down to 375 after the pie is in the fridge for 30 minutes you're gonna bake it on the lowest rack in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes at 425 after 25 minutes you're gonna reduce the temperature to 350 for another 35 minutes it's gonna go into a 375-degree oven from anywhere between 45 and 60 minutes after it comes out of the oven I'm gonna let it sit at room temperature for about an hour or so so my pies all done look at that said it couldn't be done but Here I am with a pie take a look at this beautiful pie and here it is this is my finished pie it is time for me to taste it here we go boom alright God and get the cinnamon and the butter and the crumble bit on top it's nice it's old print cheap the apples are nice and soft and they taste like apple pie apples I think the flavor makes it special I think the ease of preparation makes it special as long as you follow the steps the easy steps you get a perfect pie that fires on every note it hits the spicing and the warming and the sweet it's got a little savory kick it's got a boozy kick which is super fun too if you're gonna eat dessert it better be worth it this is worth it let's see how each of our chefs made this classic American dessert Emily used a convenient store bought crusts that only requires rolling premade crust contain preservatives like butylated hydroxy Anna saw a synthetic antioxidant that prevents that's from going rancid her crust also contains butylated hydroxy toluene which helps to retain color and foods as well as hydrogenated shortening hydrogenation is a process where liquid oils are made solid by adding hydrogen atoms to double bond to carbon systems and liquid oils making them really stable with a very long shelf life you'll also find flour sugar salt and some preservatives like calcium propionate which is an anti molding ingredient they're also pre hydrated so you don't need to rest the dough as both Beth and Penny did Beth made a tender and flaky pie crust in a food processor the flakiness of pie crusts happens because the flour coated solid fat particles form layers when the dough is rolled and when it's baked the water that was added plus water from the butter as both Beth and Penny used turns to steam and lifts the sheets of fat and flour mixture that was created everything needs to be really cold the water the butter penny used some vodka in place of additional water the more water you add the more gluten is developed which will decrease flakiness and make a tough pipe trust the vodka will keep the dose supple without participating in gluten formation penny also used a combination of all-purpose and pastry flour pastry flour is lower in glutenin and gliadin so she minimized gluten development with this combination we want to limit how much gluten we create both beth and penny rested their dough in the refrigerator pie crust is very stable and can be made ahead of time and refrigerated for a few days or even frozen for a few months when rolling out the dough you need a little flour on your bench to ensure the crust doesn't stick but be careful not to add too much because if you do the dough will become stretchy and shrink when baked that's because you're working the gluten proteins too much apples are called palm fruits which means the edible portion is the enlarged tip of a flower stem and the seeds are protected in the inner core most of the flavoring compounds come from fruity esters ethyl alcohol and acetic acid combined to form ethyl acetate which is a common ester in most apple varieties emily is only Fuji apples which are very sweet with a honey like flavour so she doesn't need to add as much sugar to her apple pie I news food the apples because that's what the internet told me to do she sliced her apples on the thin side so they'll cook more quickly the addition of cinnamon nutmeg and cloves added complementary warmth to her pie filling a splash of citric acid in the form of store-bought lemon juice added a bright slightly tart note to her pie this apples got it going on baby Beth used a combination of Honey Crisp which are bred to be very sweet and brave earn apples which have a sweet tart flavor a slightly golden flesh from the presence of carotenoids so that combination of textures with the crust is going to make this a really delicious delicious pie this combination alters the sweetness and texture uses the same traditional flavor profile as Emily's pie like Beth penny used a combination of apples including Granny Smith Granny Smiths add a lot of sourness and tang which is balanced the pie doesn't get overly sweet John in bold which also have carotenoids lending a golden color to the flesh of the Apple and Gala apples which are sweet and have a pear like quality so when you mix them all together it's a more interesting and unique flavor profile penny added star anis allspice cardamom cloves and black pepper all which were toasted whole and then ground together which is a combination of warm toasty spiciness she made candied ginger which also adds some sweet spiciness to her pie and also added cinnamon and rum for an additional punch to her flavor it's a really good high quality rum I added at the end in place of white sugar penny is Demerara a partially refined cane sugar which is brown in color and has a larger crystal size than white sugar white sugar is just sweet Demerara is coated with molasses which adds a caramel mineral flavor making your flavor profile more complex penny partially cooked her apple mixture blooming her spices along with the apples and then refrigerated it overnight this allows for quicker baking when she assembles her pie and it ensured her apples will be fully cooked all of our chefs rolled their bottom crust and added their Apple mixtures instead of a top crust Emily made a crumble which is sweet crunchy and delicious turned out really great what if it does it has similar ingredients to a crust but more sugar that is cut together with solid butter that's topped her pie with a rolled crust crimped and brushed with egg wash to ensure the edges were sealed what makes this pie spectacular is the egg wash she sprinkled sugar on top which adds a crunch and visual appeal penny also seals her crust edge with an egg wash and then add a beautiful petal design top creating a visual experience along with a wonderfully tasty pie Emily started baking at 425 degrees and then lowered it to 375 this works because initially you need a very high heat to create steam and form the flaky crust Emily's crust is not going to be very flaky though and it's on the thin side so turning the oven down cooks the apples and doesn't burn the crust she also covered her crust in order to help prevent over browning Beth baked at 425 degrees for 50 minutes while penny baked hers at 375 degrees again you need that hot oven to create steam in the crust to promote the all-important flakiness all three chefs served their warm apple pie with a cold accompaniment Emily went classic with smooth and silky vanilla ice cream I'm not gonna make my own ice cream because let's be honest you wouldn't want to eat it and Beth served hers with a homemade whipped cream flavored with sugar and vanilla pani made a creme Parisien which is made by boiling cream milk and sugar and then adding caramelized white chocolate and rum which itself has a high sugar content it's almost like a whipped ganache and it's delicious all three of our chefs took their own paths to creating this quintessential American dessert and all three of these pies are absolutely delicious no matter how you slice them", "qNCfgm3ZP6k": "hey you guys what's going on youtubians jeremy here uh a little bit of different video tonight uh hence the different backdrop here in my kitchen um before we get started real quick tonight boswell's stubby freehand and uh in it mac barons both kentucky but this isn't really going to be a pie video so that's all i'm going to say about pipes uh the purpose of tonight's video is going to the dagner pipe meetup here in a couple weeks and i was going to make some apple pie moonshine so thought might be something cool to post this on how i make it that way you guys can trot at home when people you know talk about moonshine most times people think of you know somebody out in the woods with a still um getting chased by the police and [ __ ] but uh really all moonshine is green alcohol so anybody can really make apple pie moonshine um you don't need to you know have a [ __ ] still out in the woods or anything like that so what you're gonna need basically um now here in florida um anything above 153 proof alcohol is illegal which i mean i think is stupid um but nevertheless i think spring breakers have gotten themselves in trouble and whatnot that's why they made the law but in the event um so the best we can do here is 153 proof normally uh like the recipe that i use that i got offline um calls for the everclear which i think is around 190 proof but like i said you can't get that here uh and everclear doesn't make 100 anything below 180 or 90. so in florida you can't get it so what we have to do is this this is uh i don't know if you can see that hopefully it focuses enough it's 153 proof grain alcohol this is just the liquor store brand uh 153 proof brain alcohol so that's what i use in it uh i've tweaked the recipe a little bit what the recipe calls for i'm gonna tell you what the recipe calls for that i got offline and then i'll tell you the tweaks i've made the recipe calls for one liter of everclear or 180 90 proof grain alcohol calls for one gallon of apple cider not apple juice but apple cider there's a difference and then one gallon of actual apple juice just you know 100 apple juice then it calls for three cups of white sugar and eight cinnamon sticks the other thing you'll need is some kind of big big pot to uh put the stuff in and you'll also need i like to use mason jars oh you'll need something to put it in uh mason jars i found the best they're airtight they'll hold for a long time plus it kind of keeps that whole moonshine feel these are one quart mason jars you can get a box of like 12 of these for [ __ ] i don't think it's been about like 10 9 or 10 bucks i found these are the best thing to use and that's what i like to use uh this recipe makes depending on how things work out the actual recipe online if you go by the standard recipe makes about nine of these i add a little extra alcohol that's mostly what my tweak is to the recipe adding extra alcohol i'm going to end up making a little more than nine of these i'm closer to 12 of these but that's that's the deal there so what you're going to do is you're going to take your big pot here you're going to put in your gallon of apple cider which these are half gallons so we're going to use both of these and this big man pajama hopefully it all fits i think it does use a different pot last time i made it but it doesn't quite all fit we'll just go to the top and you don't need to be dead on measurements so that's pretty close to the top i'm gonna cut it out there and then your sugar and your eight cinnamon sticks easy enough now what you'll do is you'll put that on the stove uh use a whisk or a spoon or whatever and stir it you're gonna bring this to a boil uh making sure all that sugar and stuff had time to melt once it hits a boil you're gonna take it off and let it cool to room temperature um but it has to be room temperature before you add your your alcohol you don't want um any of that grand great alcohol cooking off because the heat so you're going to wait till it's room temperature to add the alcohol so i'm going to go ahead and throw this on the stove get it boiled like i said boiling take off let it cool um i'm obviously not going to sit here and make you watch the [ __ ] boil so we'll get this going get it all melted down let it cool to room temperature once it gets back to room temperature and we're adding that stuff the alcohol and whatnot we will we'll come back and let you see that part of it all right guys all right so we're back um took about i don't know about two hours i guess for uh all that stuff to boil get up to kind of temperature and then cool back off down to it's a little warmer than room temperature but it's just a little you know lukewarm kind of temperature which is fine you just don't want it hot to where it's going to mess with any of the alcohol at all you also want to give it time to really kind of sit that cinnamon stick and the sugar and all that to kind of get happy with all the with all the apple juice inside or so here comes where the tweak the recipe for for me it just calls from one liter of this stuff i found that that's not near strong enough for my liking might be partially because i'm using 153 instead of 190 i've never made it with 190 because like i said here in florida that's illegal so could be it and i've also added a little bit of vodka to this recipe which might be kind of blasphemy for moonshine purists so to speak but this is a pinnacle whipped cream flavored vodka which i found in apple pie usually put some kind of ice cream or whipped cream on it so i found it adds kind of a nice touch to make it taste even even more like apple pie but in any event um i put a um this is a what is this this is a 750 milliliter um and just kind of a note how i like to do it just to make it easier is when you're trying to transfer all that stuff from those big pots into mason jars that could be problematic so i mean i guess you could use a ladle and like a mason jar funnel um which really if all you guys smoke pipes and canned tobacco uh you should have one of those mason jar funnels anyway to help you know when you get your tobacco down in your mason jar so i guess you could go to that method i usually prefer just to get out my cooler wash it out real good with hot hot soapy water make sure the inside is good and clean dump all my apple juice and stuff into the cooler um it gives me plenty of room to mix it and like most coolers there's a there's a spout here on the back side so it's really easy just to kind of open up that spout and fill those um fill those jars makes a lot a lot easier so you know your mileage may vary but that's the route i go you find your own way with which way you prefer to do it but in any event so in here i've got all the apple juice i'm going to go ahead and crank out like i said that's a 750 milliliter of the pinnacle whipped cream vodka it doesn't have to be pinnacle i don't suppose any whipped cream vodka you could even maybe try vanilla vodka might be all right and this is a what size is this thing i saw it earlier it's bigger than a 0.75 i think it's uh where the heck did it go i'm just holding up it works it's a 1.75 liter so this is a 1.75 liter i put a whole one of these in there too so um seven five 750 milliliter of vodka and a 1.75 liter of the 153 proof that's gonna take way too damn well take that little pour spout off there all right so there is all of that now here is where um i'll give it a little mix sorry i'm a little out of frame here guys but i don't feel like moving the camera around jostling you guys all over the place that smells serious here's where it gets a little this is going to be to your taste um i always get two of these um i don't know that you need two whole ones that seems to be a little strong to me what i would suggest is put a whole one in there your 750 of your vodka and then add a little bit of this or even taste it which is this you to you that might be be fine but start adding some of this to flavor uh and then when it gets to kind of the factor that you want um hold it off there um this stuff is always better if you let it sit you can drink it right away but if you go ahead and can it up and let it sit for a week or two it does tend to mellow a little bit but anyway so yeah so i'm going to go ahead and cut away again i'm going to add some more of this and taste it a couple times to get to about where i want it to be strength wise and then i'll come back real quick and just show you guys some of putting them in the jars which is i mean pretty straightforward but i'll show you real quick just so you can kind of see the end result all right guys we'll back in a few all right guys here we go so the the cooler's full mixed it all up i usually put a little towel on the floor here because uh it will you know as you're opening and closing this you're going to drip a little bit so just to keep the mess down i usually put a little towel down on the floor there but pretty simple you take your mason jar put it below your spigot here open up your spigot just gonna fill your jar up once it gets close to the top and just put your cap back in there there's your uh jar full of stuff i usually take some of the little pieces of cinnamon stick uh from when we cooked it put a piece of cinnamon stick in each jar sometimes i'll cut a fresh apple put like one slice of fresh apple in each jar it's up to you that's not necessary but anyway you just put your lid on it and there you go there is your apple pie moonshine now one other quick note is this has a little bit of cloudiness to it because of the apple cider has some particulates in it because it's cider not juice if you wanted it to be crystal clear just for the look of it you could possibly run it through some kind of filter of some nature like a coffee filter or some kind of fine fine mesh strainer of cheesecloth or something i don't find that it matters i did that the first time just to get that nice crystal clear look out of it and it was a big huge pain in the ass and it didn't taste any different so i just leave it in there it being a little cloudy's not a big deal like i said it's made with cider insiders kind of cloudy so that's just the nature of the beast but that's that guys um i ended up putting uh about half of the second bottle in there i didn't want to go too crazy with it since like i said i'm taking it down to the the dagner pipe meetup and i didn't want to make it too strong to where it would turn people off but you can really adjust the strength of it just by you know putting more or less alcohol in it like i said you can play with the recipe yourself and find out where you like it i have buddies that make it that like to stick around uh the they actually get two 750s uh 750 a vodka 750 milliliter of this instead of the 1.75 i personally think that tastes like apple juice um but i think that's what they're going for so if you're going for more of a cannot taste the alcohol in it kind of kind of vibe um maybe stick with something closer to the original recipe which is like a liter um of the stuff i like to have a little burn you know i want to know i'm drinking something but it tastes good at the same time and you know if you load it up with a full bottle and a half of the the grain alcohol and a 750 milliliter of vodka i find it does have a little little slow burn to it which which is what i like um so anyway i'm going to keep jarring up all the rest of this i don't see any reason for you guys to sit and have to go through that but like i said that's what you end up with and you should end up with about 9 to 12 of these this size mason jar depending on how much alcohol you end up putting in it so one more time guys that's a shot of it apple pie moonshine stuff is delicious it'll get you in trouble that's actually one last quick note um be careful this stuff um you can uh you can get carried away with it real quick and end up end up in a prey into the old porcelain crown if you know what i'm saying about so uh just be careful with the guys but enjoy it play with the recipe let me know what you think and um", "tSqpQMDkJmE": "hello every and welcome back to another episode of beer brew review and today I'm pushing it up on you a little bit not only are we outside but we're going to make cider instead of beer hard cider that is what I have in front of me is four gallons of Whole Foods brand apple juice and even though it says apple apple juice it seems like it's more like apple cider but either way people have talked about having a really good luck with this stuff I've never made apple cider before I've never made hard cider before in my life so there's going to be a good experiment but I figured instead of just making one big batch of hard cider or one yellin of hard cider what I did was I got four gallons and we're gonna make four different versions of hard cider to see how these things turn out so basically today what I got for you like I said is the four gallons of the whole foods apple juice and the reason these are good is because they're little expensive they're $8.99 apiece however they come with their own glass carboy so it's a one gallon fermenter right here I coincidentally do have some airlocks in some Stoppers for them if you're wondering these seem to take about a size six a five six stopper I have three size six Stoppers in a size seven so we're going to see if that's going to work in the end but first thing we got to do is we got to find out what the current specific gravity of this juice is and as always sanitize everything I've already have a bucket of sanitizer down here on the side that you can't really see that I've got my cylinder for and my hydrometer for checking the specific gravity so let's crack one of these babies open and let's see whoo smell this thing first oh god it smells delicious not only am I going to pour myself a little bit of glass over here I'm probably going to make a mess when I do this I only have one funnel which is fine but there's very dry ingredients involved and my assumption is also going to be that each one of these is going to have approximately the same specific gravity that could be off but that's what I'm going with here today so basically I've got this full I've done one hydrometer out and see what my current specific gravity is this thing to get the bubbles off and allow it's actually higher than I thought it was going to be it's just over 10:50 already so if I just did this as is it's going to give me about a 6% alcohol rating when it's all said and done I want a little bit higher than that I want to get this up to between 1070 and 1080 and the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to add a couple different ingredients this is what I talked about making the different types of fighter I'm going to add some standard ol granulated sugar white sugar to one of them I'm going to add brown sugar to two of them and I'm going to add some blue agave sweetener to one of the fourth one the reason I'm adding brown sugar to two of them is what I'm going to do is I'm going to also add cinnamon to both of those and if one I'm going to do it some cinnamon before primary fermentation and the other one I'm going to wait until after primary fermentation I've been told you should wait for your flavors until after primary fermentation but I want to find out for myself how it actually go so basically now I'm going to take this I'm not going to pour this back into the cider that they came from because the the sugar is going to take up some room actually the sugar is gonna probably take out quite a bit of room so what I have over here is an empty one gallon carboy sitting with some sanitizer I don't know what I'm going to do with it yet but I'm going to pour that back into there put that back in here going to pour this into here I might need to pour out a little bit extra as well because I had to put probably about a cup of sugar in here I'm actually not 100% certain it's kind of like a guessing game it's really what it is so let's pour some more of this stuff out just to ensure that I have adequate room let's get over here sanitized funnel sanitized measuring cup start out with the light sugar the whole goal of this is to make all four of these have the same specific gravity at the end and then we'll kind of go from there so being that this is only a one gallon batch maybe I'll start with I'll start with a cup and we'll see how that goes it might be too much it might be too little I have no idea now you can do this by warming it up on the stove from what I understand but you've got to be careful not to get too warm because you can hear apparently ruin a lot of stuff that's going on in the side are already granted this is past your eyesight er but there's no additives you got to watch out if you're going to make this at home that you have no specific additives other than that score be capsids okay this is actually 100% organic pasteurized unfiltered apple juice is the only ingredient in here so it's the whole foods apple juice and I don't know if you can see the ingredients over here right there Organic pasteurized unfiltered apple juice that's all that we got in there but now a bunch of the sugar now on the bottom tonight I spend some time shaking this up to mix it in this is kind of good because it's going to aerate it so that the yeast can have the environment that they like to live as well when I get to pitching the yeast I got to make sure it's all shaken well I'm gonna let that actually sit let it settle to make sure all the sugar has gone in and in the meantime I'm going to start adding some brown sugar to gallon number two so let's pour out some excess should be good and I don't know how different the brown sugar is going to be when it comes to increasing the increasing the speed specific gravity but we're going to go ahead give it a try now a problem that I might have going with this brown sugar is that it's much clumpy err so it's probably going to be extremely difficult for you going the funnel I do have some sanitized measuring spoons over here hopefully I can use to spread it up it's enough to be able to get to go in here with my funnel we will find out it looks like we've already run into a problem here I'm going to have to do it clay or something that is small enough to get in here sanitize it and use it to shove the sugar through because right now it is getting nowhere so hang tight I'll be back alright I'm back chopstick thank you these get sanitized hopefully they're dry enough alright folks I apologize for some technical errors that just happen but didn't miss too much I basically finished putting my brown sugar into the brown sugar container I also relabeled it those properly the brown sugar container mixed it up test to the specific gravity it is at 10 to 68 so slightly lower than the white sugar but at 1068 close enough for me I then went ahead and put the brown sugar into the brown sugar plus cinnamon and then added a teaspoon of cinnamon on top of it I don't know how much cinnamon you're supposed to add and like I said I don't know people said it before primary after primary so we're testing that's what we're doing here I also did the specific gravity reading of this one and it is also at 1068 so my brown sugar ones are quite even I then went and filled the Blue Agave that I had in this one that's labeled Blue Agave so it specific gravity is ten seventy four and I used the rest of this bottle of blue agave here as you can see it was n it was about here was about a quarter maybe a little bit more than quarter use the whole thing it actually took up a lot more room than I thought I had to dump a lot more out of this one I thought I was going to sew through a couple iterations but we got it 1074 specific gravity by the way this is the cinnamon I used in the brown sugar with cinnamon it's just Kirkland Signature ground Saigon cinnamon says the ingredients are cinnamon I'm hoping there's nothing in there that's going to affect the yeast so go with that basically now that we've got these all set up and ready to go I need to add my my I see the yeast I'm going to be using today is a fighter how to eat it is specifically meant for sighters so hopefully you guys can see that let me try to make sure this is focused in and that is most responsible not sure if is actually getting focusing or not but Center how to eat right there it's going to be good I hope this basically is meant for five gallons so if I flip this into fourths I should be able to get for you Helens out of it pretty easily because it's going to be actually a little bit extra but I do have to split it up and find out how much is in here I need to get my teaspoons my measuring teaspoons back my scissors are in sanitizer this was in the sanitizer as well here's my measuring my measuring spoons we got to see how much is actually in here to know how much to do and then we're going to open this thing up now it says this what's in here is uh is 9 grams I unfortunately don't have a scale because I can measure it and it's just less than 3 grams of another one because like two and a half grams of these little less than two and a half grams apiece would be exactly what I needed but I don't have a measuring scale so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my towel here I'm going to get the teaspoon just measurement device the teaspoon measurement device where I take this we're going to dry it I have a bowl and we're going to find out how many teaspoons are in this and then I'll know how to put it forth there's one two okay so as just less than three teaspoons are in this package actually if I add the remnant so it's about three teaspoons that's in this package so that's unfortunate because if I do a half in each one that's only going to get me up to two teaspoons so it's like a little bit more than a half a teaspoon per so we're just going to kind of guess here but that's what we're going to do so let's start with my white sugar we'll put half a teaspoon of yeast in a little bit more we will add my brown sugar have a teaspoon a little bit more agave other 1/2 a teaspoon a little bit more half a teaspoon a little bit more and I'll start doling the rest of the stuff out until I get to finished I knew it wasn't going to be an exact science that's why I did it like this and the nice thing is I have a little bit of extra used to play with because this should be able to make five gallons and I'm only making four so even if I'm not exact on this there should be plenty of yeast in here to get these four gallons going now it's also make sure that we're going to get this thing going right I also purchased geats nutrient so basically this is going to make sure that the yeast have a good healthy playground to to thrive and it says that the specifically on this one teaspoon per gallon so that actually works out very well because I know there's exactly one teaspoon that goes in each one of these things and we're going to be good to go so I bought this from Amazon by the way it was not that expensive you can buy smaller ones I bought the 8 ounce I think you might like one ounce and three ounce packages as well but I figured I will be using this for a while I didn't realize that the way that they had actually sealed this in was not just a ziplock bag it's actually a ziploc bag that's been like seacrest so I actually I said cut it open that doesn't even get me into this stuff they sealed this thing in here good am i out the moon would do a different container after his all didn't done because I don't think I'm going to be able to keep Pete a seal if they have Jonah the next stoplight how jumpy happens when you record in the good old DC area I mean in DC it's plenty of plenty of action going on around here so one teaspoon per get out the funnel because the ones a teaspoons a little bit bigger least nutrients least nutrients Youth nutrients use nutrients there we go plenty of youth to treant left seal that up and now is when we get the airlocks all set up and ready to rock three of these are going to be simple well it's going to be a little bit rougher okay simple one basically keeping the filled with sanitized water here to make sure let's put this one right here over on my my white sugar one did you go we'll have this one different style airlock right here on my brown sugar one good to go we'll have this one on my blue got a good to go see that's the number six quarks those work great this number seven cork however it's going to be a tight squeeze to get it in there make sure I got enough water into the airlock a little bit less than the other one we go and this one make sure it's nice and dry our fly is trying to get in here so this is going to be a no-go on this so what I'm probably going to do is just wrap some foil around it to hold it on there the point of the airlocks is to stop things from getting into your cider it's not required to have an airtight seal for the fermentation process to happen so it's not the fact that I'm in the lead you can actually leave them open as long as you're not worried about things getting into them if you want to I personally don't want to leave it open however I do want to you know make sure it's sealed all the way as much as possible because I'm not going to be able to get a good seal on there with that seven number seven cork but either way I'm going to put these away somewhere cold and dark and you're cool and dark I should say and I'll see you guys as this thing starts to bubble well then here they are bubbling away this guy's not a mobile in the way but you know the one we don't have the seal on with the seven cork there but I'm pretty sure it's going to be fine if you can look close you can see all the the action still happening in there so the yeast is still doing its job doesn't need to be airtight it's fine but you know these things are working pretty hard this is exactly 24 hours after I originally did this this guy actually started bubbling about two hours after I put them in here these two took a little bit longer but hey they're working well let see how they do over the next 10 days or so alright everybody so it's been six days since we put these four gallons into our primary fermentation phase and the the bubbling has stopped as you can see our and opened one of them up I took a UH a specific gravity reading and we are sitting at one point two zero maybe actually a little bit less than one point zero I'm assuming the same is going to be the case for all four of them but basically at this point I need to get these into secondary fermentation so as you can see there's a huge yeast cake layer down here on the bottom of these things up this is focusing in right but you can see it in all of these so basically I got to get that cleaned up get these into secondary fermentation I'm going to take some specific gravity readings of all of them and I'm going to add the teaspoon of brown sugar to the receiving a teaspoon of cinnamon to the brown sugar one right here so that we're doing the test between the primary fermentation cinnamon and the secondary fermentation cinnamon add basically I won't bore you with the video just transferring these over to another bottles come back to you when it's done and are ready to go there's the white sugar specific gravity gate an exact reading because of the bubbles but oh it's right there about about 1.0 this is the blue agave so right there same mark pretty much finally the last one as you can see right there I won all of them were the exact same specific gravities Oh every single one of them right there at one alright so there you have it all four of these guys have now been put into secondary fermentation stage if you'll notice they're in the exact same containers as they were in before it's because I only have one spare glass container so basically I had to pour each one into that clean these containers and put them right back in so took me a long time to do because I very thoroughly clean them and then sanitize them all between doing this as you can see there's no more cake on the bottom there because they're all in new containers I did take this guy here this brown sugar one and I added the extra cinnamon the teaspoon of cinnamon into them you hinge em you can see it they're kind of hovering on the top even though try to mix it in you can tell it's definitely darker than the one that's been with primary fermentation with the cinnamon in there going but we'll give this a couple weeks in a secondary fermentation phase and then we will give these things a taste and see how they turned out see if they turned out well terrible who knows what these are going to do but all right guys stay tuned", "W3jfHsBmRyY": "[Music] [Music] okay you guys are probably wondering what the heck I'm doing here well I'm making hard cider of course then I guess your next questions gonna be why the heck am i poking holes and balloons with a needle to make hard cider I guess I should just back up a little bit so here on our farm in northern Vermont we're in the full swing of apple season apples are one of the crops that is absolutely crazy abundant here in Vermont everywhere you look you'll find wild apple trees that have sprung up over the years you find old apple trees that have been ignored and neglected you find young apple trees that people are nurturing and trying to grow into thriving orchards you find apple trees everywhere and it's so easy to grow them even here specifically on our property we easily have a dozen apple trees that are just out there in the wild doing their thing that I barely do anything to maintain and get in that abundance I've found it to be important to try to take advantage full advantage of the apples that we have here on our farm last year was actually a very weak apple crop and there was very limited apples and so to take advantage of Apple season my friend Rachel and I were forced to drive around the back route all over the region and find abandoned trees that we could then steal from by the way that practice is known as scrumping we had a lot of fun on our adventure we even ran into actor Luis Guzman but this year it's totally different this year there are apples everywhere there is no Apple shortage there are plenty of apples so over the last several days I've set forth to actually collect as many apples as I possibly can of it enlisted relatives to help me I've enlisted Allison to help me we have been working with friends to collect as many apples as we possibly could because our plan was to go to my friend Leslie's house impress a bunch of cider and I know you guys are saying wait a minute what does this have to do with the needle and the balloons but wait I'll get to that at the end you'll completely understand and it'll totally make sense just the act of picking apples is a lot of fun to me it's something that I've been doing since I was a little kid even this last go-around I spent a lot of time with my father picking apples all around our farm and we even drove around a little bit and found some apples too there's a couple different methods that we use to harvest the apples you know we've tried the method where you shake the trees and let them all land on a tarp but usually they land all over the place what I have found that's worked the best is to just go through and quickly grab as many apples as you possibly can and move from tree to tree as quickly as you can just focusing on the low-hanging fruit don't waste your time with you know the grabber thing or other devices just you know grab and go grab and go grab and go and so over the last couple of days we have completely picked gold shop farm we've also completely picked several trees all in the neighbor in the area trees that are known to be neglected and abandoned and nobody would have a problem with us taking the apples I know that you're supposed to measure apple and a bushel and I have no idea what a bushel is in terms of weight or volume and so I'm just gonna say there are hundreds of apples we were collecting them in feet bags and just holding them and they were just heavy all get-out do you like so after we collected all the apples though we decided to go to my friend Leslie's house now Leslie has this awesome Apple press you might have remembered seeing me use it last year but it's got a two-stage function to it it's kind of like an old-fashioned Apple press accept the masticator is actually got this old electric motor that drives it so you don't have to do the hand cranking and it's much easier than that and Leslie was even hosting essentially a little party for all of our friends and neighbors to get together and we were all working together to process the apples apple season here in Vermont it like only reminds me of one other thing which is maple syrup season where you have all these people coming together working to process the abundance of the trees in the area and use it for food for future times whether it be the maple syrup that we use throughout the year or the apple cider that we take in store and try to make into hard cider over the winter and it was so much fun hanging out at Leslie's with all of our friends it's funny we all get so busy during the summer that we barely see each other other than working on projects together and so to just have a day where we're doing some light work and hanging out it's a lot of fun I mean heck even some of the footage that you see here in this video was shot by the kids who are at the party I let them take a GoPro and go wild and they got some pretty interesting stuff and I know you guys are like dude just can it just tell us what the deal is with the balloons and the needle come on so our plan has been that we would take a lot of the surplus cider that we press from all these wild apples that we have scattered around here and use it to make hard cider we did this last year to great effect and you know we pressed it in September we stored it for a couple of months and then in December we had just a couple of great parties where we all got together and hung out and enjoyed the cider it was just so much fun and so we figured we should make this a tradition and so we started processing the apples to come this hard cider again that we would enjoy again as a group of friends later this winter so we took all the excess cider that we had and we poured it into bottles and when I say it poured it into bottles it now looks kind of like this we got about ten gallons of cider in bottles like this and I'm now getting ready for the final stage of making our hard cider now I know some of you are probably wondering that when we were grinding up all of the apples well what do we end up doing with the apple pulp well I've done a couple of different things with the apple pulp here like last year I took a an amount of the apple pulp and I spread it out on a bed this year we've had a lot of luck where I've got this one bed of seedlings that are sprouting probably two or three hundred apple seedlings at this point I'm gonna let them grow for another year or two the idea here is I'm creating my own future apple seed stock I can use those wild apples for pressing for cider purposes like you've seen in this video or I can use those apple seedlings as rootstock and I can graft on other varieties of apples to those so whatever it is I always feel like I'm gonna have a need for apple tree seedlings and so I've used a lot of the pulp from making the the apple cider as a seed stock source and so that's one use that we've used for the the matched-up pulp the other views that I've found that's been pretty awesome this years I've been feeding it to the geese so we have about thirty geese on our farm we've been raising them for meat primarily and I have been for the last couple of weeks feeding the geese a copious amount of apple drop so all the apples that fall on the ground a little too early despite being a little reluctant early on the geese have been absolutely devouring those things and so I decided to give it a shot and try to feed them the apple pulp as well and see if they'd like that at first they were reluctant but after a day or so they started to Mau it down and devour it and in they ate pretty much all of the apple pulp from that entire apple pressing party [Music] so what we're doing here is currently this hard cider has these black caps the only problem is as the cider ferments inside these bottles it's gonna start to explode you can even see it really bubbling and getting carbonated already these have been sitting for about a day and so the rule that the balloons gonna play is we're gonna put it over the mouth of the bottle just like so and that way as the bottle ferments and it puts out a gas from the fermentation process it's gonna go into the balloon the balloon will fill up just a little bit and then it'll vent the air out of the hole that I poked with the pin see I told you this stuff would make sense you guys you could really hear that one right there you hear that pop like I was opening a bottle of soda that's that carbonation so I got to give it a chance to vent out or else the bottle will absolutely explode last year I don't think I actually did this process right and I tried to gas it every couple of days by opening the bottle and just letting the the carbonation come out by itself but even then I don't think I was doing it effective enough so that's where I have some high hopes for this balloon method full disclosure this is the first time I've ever tried something like this now for you DIY types out there you might be wondering well how am I doing this like what's the recipe I'm actually going for here the only thing that we've done has been to process the wild apples I personally prefer wild apples I like the tartness that they often have look at this right this balloons already starting to get some air pressure to it so I didn't use any sort of yeast I didn't use any sort of sterilizer I did put our bottles through the dishwasher before I use them just as an attempt to slightly sterilize it but I didn't use any chemical sterilizers there are no yeasts there are no added sugars here yeah this process is entirely natural the the way that the fermentation works though apples generally speaking on their exteriors have natural wild yeasts on them and so I don't need to add anything for the fermentation to happen they will do that naturally that's why I like if you've ever picked up an apple like on the ground that's been a drop sitting there for a couple of days you'll smell it and it actually you can start to smell the alcohol in it so now what's gonna happen is I'm gonna take these bottles and I'm gonna bring them downstairs into our basement and I'm gonna store them and I will store them probably until about early December I might check in on them and do a little bit of a taste test come Thanksgiving time the fact that the balloon stays at exactly this size is how you know it's working in early December mid December they should be ready to enjoy I found that if I let them sit too long they start to go a little bad and you almost get like a vinegar instead of a nice sweet but alcohol a hard cider but to be honest I am merely a hobbyist I am a guy who just loves to go around and find wild apples pick as many as I can mash them up with my friends and family and put them in bottles store them and enjoy them with my friends and family if you guys want to see some of our Apple adventures from last year I made this little playlist right here just click on it and you'll be able to check it all out I will see you in those videos and thanks for watching guys", "uTZ3cXQ4Qzs": "why shake and [Applause] like the average is really I really liked apple pie [Applause] I'm just nothing it was an honor exercise [Applause] [Applause] my shape is [Applause] especially apple cider - anyway one month", "DpVdWGWtzGs": "hey what's going on them well I am Andrew if you all saw the very first video I did then kind of know who i am but for those of you all that just skips tricks this video i'm andrew i'm one of the personal trainers here for live well here in owensboro so again i'm going to be showing you all how to make a really really good drink it's one of my personal favorites and i have named it the liquid apple pie alright and so that being said here it is you get a mason jar why do you ask why mason jar because my mama said that we're from the south and you drink everything from a mason jar so I believe my mama so get a mason jar alright fill it up halfway what ice and then after the ice to fill it up with water half way only alright from there you're going to need a bottle of your apple cider vinegar Bragg's okay and make sure that when you get this you get the one that has the mother and that's where you're going to find all of the good stuff are all your nutrients and blah blah blah all right from there you are going to get liquid stevia now the reason why you should get liquid is because unfortunately I wanted the sweetener that had the maple syrup flavoring they didn't have it so I just went ahead and got the vanilla cream flavor it works just the same but if you can find the maple syrup flavoring get it and then email me and let me know where you got it from because I want it all right from there you are then going to get a thing up sediment alright you can either run it yourself or just be like me and just go to program just pick you up a thing of from there you are then going to get a lemon this is really important this is going to be the icing on the cake for this another thing that i would suggest you all get that i don't have as a straw because when you put the cinnamon in there it's going to get kind of calling your teeth or whatnot and that's not really all that good looking you're trying to make on somebody so if you have a strong get it alright so here we go you want to shake this up really good because I'm a guy and because I am my mother's son and my dance son I don't measure but for the purposes of this film I'm going to tell you how much you're going to need all right two capfuls of apple cider vinegar goals and to the mason jar but because i love vinegar i'm going to do maybe three to four because I'm a huge fan of rags apple cider vinegar make you feel good from there be really careful about how much you put up the sweetener here because if you put too much it can be really overwhelming so it's going to come into a little syringe like this usually i would put between four to five drops in here but because unlike a lot of flavor i'm going to add need for me six or seven from there you're then going to get water and you're going to fill it up and this is filtered water not water from the sink because that's kind of gross to me if you ask my opinion and then take your lemon you're then going to squeeze a little bit of juice on inside of it like so be careful about getting some juice in your eye because it burns and you will then scream like a girl like almost weird when I just and then the icing on the cake is going to be the cinnamon with the cinnamon it really depends on how far you want to go with the flavoring sometimes I put a sprinkle others I just put a little bit more than usual and this is why you're going to need a straw because I don't have one right now I'm not going to be gross and straight up from a finger because that's not light but you're going to want to stir that cinnamon in the drink once you have it done just prepare to be blown away because it's going to be a really good drink it tastes just like apple pie I promise you so that's going to be the drain there's your liquid apple pie all in about 15 seconds exaggerated 15 to 20 seconds maybe but um yeah just enjoy oh and one more thing I totally forgot about this when this video stops I would like for you all to scroll all the way to the top of this website a facebook and hit that like button it looks just like this hand with a thumbs up just like it all right you won't be sorry so anyway let the sunshine in have a great great day spread the love I'll talk to y'all later bye", "PK8mg-BL-IA": "This is a really simple one skillet supper. It's starts out, that's why it smells so good in our studio, with bacon, I'm gonna take the bacon out of the pan so we can cook up our chicken in the drippin's. On the chicken, again, I love bone-in, skin-on thighs. They're affordable, they're foolproof. You can keep a package in the freezer. They're a great go-to, and I liberally salt and pepper them. And then, you put the skin side down and let that skin render, let it get nice and crispy before you flip her over. We're gonna brown our chicken on both sides, and then, in the drippings from the chicken and the bacon, we are gonna cook up some big ol' beautiful Brussels sprouts and lots of shallots, and then we're gonna pour a maple mustard sauce down over the whole mass and cook it all in the pan. For the Brussels, just trim the very bottom of the shoo shoo, the cabbage, and I'm just gonna have them. And then, we're gonna place 'em in the skillet cup side down. Same deal with the shallots, I just have those. We're gonna take a quick break, and then, we'll make the sauce. (audience applauds)\n(upbeat music) Yeah, I'm still eatin' bacon. (audience laughs) Okay, so for the sauce, well first of all, put your Brussels sprouts in cup side down, so that in that dripping mixture between the bacon and the chicken, they're gonna get the most caramelization. They're gonna develop their color, which of course, develops their flavor. You wanna get nice and brown like this. Once they've browned up nicely, then you can toss everybody around. We're gonna slide the chicken back in, add the sauce, and let it all simmer 'til the chicken's fully cooked, another 10, 12 minutes. So for the sauce, you can use about a cup and a half of cloudy cider, fresh pressed cider, or a cup and a half of hard cider, essentially one can or one bottle of hard cider. Or you can do a little combo and have half a hard cider. (Rachael laughs) But you want a cup and a half total basically. (can fizzes) The hard cider will give it a little more acidity. The fresh cider will make it sweeter, so it's how sweet or tangy you want your sauce. Then, we're gonna add about a quarter cup of grainy mustard. Couple of fat scoops and about the same amount as maple syrup. (audience gasps) And a little nutmeg, already pulled one out. (nutmeg grates) (grater clinks) About a quarter teaspoon of that, and some nice, fresh chopped thyme. Whisk all that together to get that mustard incorporated. (whisk clanks) Then, we're gonna toss these guys around, move 'em around so the Brussels sprouts don't go too far. Our pieces of browned, but not cooked through, chicken. And pour your sauce over it.\n(audience cheers) Alright, we're gonna let her cook up. I'll meet you back here in a couple. (audience cheers)\n(upbeat music) So to serve this dinner, you need some charred bread. You wanna mop up all of those great, delicious flavors, so what I'm gonna do is rub our charred bread with a little cut garlic. And then, we're gonna drizzle with good, fancy olive oil. And then, we're gonna hit it with some smoked, flaky sea salt so it tastes kinda like the bacon. (audience laughs)\n(audience cheers) So you take out a couple of pieces of thigh. (audience gasps) And then, you pile up your saucy sprouts and onions. (audience cheers) Yeah, and you just jam it on. Yeah!\n(audience laughs) Yeah!\n(audience cheers) (wind chimes ring)", "5Lr6oSZfgts": "and this session we made apple pie moonshine for bartering purposes and we picked up the bottle of bucket that was part of our Sam's Club haul we used another variation of fresh apples picked up some cider at Kroger and with the strawberries Myers had those on sale for 4-5 so I had that but the strawberry one was a little bit difficult to tank had to strain it several times to get the pulp out and then I added some of that daily strawberry daiquiri mix turned out perfect this warranted us 20 jars and we enjoyed doing it stay tuned [Music]", "-Vy12e0LjX4": "\u266a Hey baby I hear the blues are callin'\nToss salads and scrambled eggs \u266a Mom! I'm home. \"Can I get you anything to go with that, Sheriff?\"\n\"Agent Cooper here might want to try a slice of that pie.\" \"Cherry pie?\"\n\"Best in the tri-counties.\" \"Done!\" \"Diving into his fifth pie, Lardass began to imagine that he wasn't eating pies. He pretended he was eating cow-plops...\" \"It's just after I see the movie I'd like to get a piece of pie and talk about it... sort of a little tradition I have.\" Do you like to get pie after you see a good movie?\" \"Yeah, I love to get pie after a good movie.\" Hey guys, what's up, it is the first day of fall and we are celebrating with a cinema and TV classic: pie. We're going to start off with 12\u00bd ounces of all-purpose flour that we're going to dump in the bowl of a food processor, adding two tablespoons of sugar and one teaspoon of salt. We're just gonna pulse that quick to combine, before adding 2 \u00bd sticks of cold, cubed butter that we're also gonna pulse until the mixture resembles wet sand. Then we're going to pour it into a bowl. Measure out six to eight ounces of ice water that you're gonna sprinkle over top and gently fold in using a rubber spatula, adding more as necessary until a shaggy dough forms. Now we're gonna tenderly turn this out onto your work surface. Pat it into a disc that we're going to liberally dust with flour, wrap in plastic wrap, and give a two hour nap in the fridge. In the meantime, we're going to prep our apples. You wanna start off with about 2 \u00bd pounds of good baking apples, such as Cortland, Honey Crisp, Granny Smith... Just make sure that it's tart and it's not mushy like those apples that shouldn't exist. Make sure you end up with about two pounds of apple slices, to which we're going to add \u00be of a cup of sugar, and \u00bc teaspoon each of cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and freshly grated nutmeg. Add two tablespoons of flour, give it a good mix... and now that we've got our filling ready, it's time to roll out our dough. Liberally dust it with flour and take out some aggression on it. Split your dough into two pieces and begin gently rolling out, dusting with flour as you go. You generally want to get your dough around about four inches wider than your actual pie plate. Use your rolling pin to lift up and drape the dough over top of your pie plate. Press it down into the corners and begin cutting your lattice... LA-tice... la- lattice. Let's see, we want 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, we want 10 one-inch strips. Fill the bottom of our pie and crust with our filling and press it down gently... and begin laying the lattice strips over top. You want to place five strips across the top of your pie, lifting two strips at a time and interleaving strips in the opposite direction. You can screw it up a little bit like I did and it'll still look pretty good. Trim off excess dough and tuck it in underneath around the edge. Then, crimp every inch or so using your fingers to create a decorative flair. Give the whole thing a good brush down with a beaten egg white. Sprinkle lots and lots of granulated sugar over top. Place on a preheated baking sheet that you've left in a 500\u00b0F oven. It should almost set your table on fire. Reduce the oven temperature to 400\u00b0F, and 35-40 minutes later you will have yourself a pie. You may be tempted to eat it now, but this thing's got to rest at least four hours. Step away. Good morning, everybody. What's this? Pie for breakfast?

Bowmont that's right pinkies out gotta be posh when you're doing these things [Music] you taste like apple cider both a lot of cinnamon in it I guess it could pass her apple pie the corn soda that I did before that really tasted like corn this it just tastes like apple cider with a little bit of cinnamon in it it's not bad but kind of disappointed so that's it it's alright you guys might like it apple pie I got more of these I'm going to do sometimes they're really good sometimes they're kind of not so good sometimes you're kind of yeah this one was kind of anyways I'll see you guys next time see round bye [Music]", "Eqpt6Xatquw": "okay this is going to be my first attempt at a caramel apple cider it's been a couple of years since i've done a cider we have six gallons of krogers breanne hundred percent apple juice no preservatives that's going to be our vase to that for the caramel flavor we're going to use four pounds of dark brown sugar I'm in kind of bouncing around between four and six pounds but I think we're going to try it on for my yeast is safe fail s0 4 i've had that blooming for about four hours just because i really want to take a running start at this we're also going to do five tablespoons of super ferment and and this is maltodextrin it's used to give body and mouth feel right now we've got two gallons of the apple juice on the stove heating up just so we can dissolve easily this brown sugar so Andrea is helping me out she's going to cut open the brown sugar just do it over the pots of it make a mess we've got this heating up everything is already been cast your eyes because it's been bottled of the store but we're just heating it up so that it'll dissolve really easily going to open up the whole thing in she's already sanitize the knife and all the tools were going to be working with ahead of time with starsan this may not all completely dissolve in the solution but we're getting up sorry this is not up to boiling the lighting is really bad kitchen fluorescent lighting or just getting enough high enough to be able to dissolve this stuff in the solution I didn't want to do the whole six gallons because there's no need to I think we can get most of this stuff in solution with just two and I'm hoping that will be pretty close to pitch in tville temperature by the time we dissolve this stuff into the bucket and then add the other four gallons so we should be able to pitch it immediately okay so all right since that's where we mix the stuff up go ahead and get five gallons of our five gallons five tablespoons of melted extern and then it's not boiling book super ferment which is also yeast nutrient use the teaspoons and we want to do five teaspoons like I said tablespoons earlier buggy games sanitized we got some starsan mixed up over there I love that stuff since it's no rinse and going to put five teaspoons in there and then start up to get into solution we've already got our fermentation buck bucket sanitize your stuff all over the kitchen right now because I'm kegged my cranberry cr\u00e8me mail today and it's in the fridge chilling should be able to get that for carbonated tomorrow once it's thoroughly chilled there you go for hunger grab your Santa thigh spatula I know the counter sanitary cuz I clean the kitchen earlier today with bleach so get that really rolling around in there to feel like most of its gone into solution how much grip super fun thanks then all production can be a little pain in the butt to make sometimes once you grab that wire whisk and grow it in the sanitizer over there real quick and then we'll we'll match up the rest until then asana father we don't want it the rest of that multiple decks criminal will melt no I want to do out of the bucket so grab the lid off of the bucket here and toss that and our buckets as little white floaties bit too that's the maltodextrin that hadn't completely melted yet we're going to solutions okay throw that I guess up on the stove and turn it off i watch that pot later and then toss the rest of the juice in a way to take a temperature reading to make sure we're not too hot you want to be ideally 80 degrees ish 70 to 80 for the yeast before you pitch I'm openin other jars here with my left hand as she's pouring got it no this is probably going to go in the new kegerator that I haven't made a video for you rather made a big video for you all right we gotta go get more apple juice we miss underestimated to use a bush ism our apple juice we only had three gallons now we have another three make it six so we're going to top that off go ahead and throw that in there there I'll hold that since it's already been sanitized put it upside down over there and we're going to clarify that just a little bit to get the rest of the higher density higher gravity stuff on the bottom with our sanitized spatula already been sanitized don't touch it with your fingers yeah just get a good swirl going in there there we go all right you want to get a trophy cup and sanitize the inside and outside really quick inside and outside yeah cuz you're gonna dip it in there bo burger you okay get you good two cups of that or whatever it takes to fill up the measuring reservoir you don't drip it everywhere let's see what our reading is I'm get the temperature so we can compensate set that in and you always want to spin it when you set it in spin it again you want to get it off the want to spin it to get any bubbles that may be on it off of it but that'll reset it too so we're sitting at forty percent you get that now we're sitting right at ten percent potential alcohol which is one point 07 2073 somewhere in there and let's get a temperature reading real quick go and throw that back in sit down on the counter that again I've got a probe the volunter we're going to get a temperature reading just to make sure its pitch of all right now just over her side sitting right at 77 degrees you can't ask for much better than that you guys see so what we're going to do is take our sanitized bachelor mix up our pitchblende real quick or you can use that now throw that in and we'll seal it and then about 30 days we will have caramel apple cider throw that on top and that's it i'm going to show you guys we're going to force carbonate this i'm going to top off the fermentation lock here real quick but we're going to force carbonate this when it's done and put it through the kegerator", "ErKUJgFbKzw": "great all right so hard apple cider time i'm here to buy good apple juice this one is an unfiltered make sure when you're buying your apple juice that it doesn't have any kind of sulfur products in it to preserve its any kind of preservatives this is literally just apple juice that is pasteurized nothing else so you can just add the yeast and these nutrient which is ammonium solvent and phosphate to this basically it gives the yeast to have a boost to it um but was that a little bit higher so i'm actually just going to have one cup of barking sugar barking sugar actually we're gonna do like a one cup of barking sugar you heard the barking to each one of these so it's actually about three quarters of a cup i can't really put a whole cup in here i'm good with that it's just gonna bring the alcohol contents up a little bit now if you want this really dry by all means let this sucker ferment for a month or so let's suck out all the sugars from it yeah bring your alcohol content up or you can have a little bit sweet pull it a little bit early what you got there so this is the ammonium phosphate which is a yeast nutrient cool one teaspoon per gallon so these are gallon jugs you said one teaspoon one teaspoon per gallon and that goes for when you're doing five gallons 20 gallons 100 gallons still one teaspoon per was that a teaspoon that's an old school nothing is ain't chunked oh yeah look at that it does say teaspoon teaspoon so one of these is going to be just regular old apple cider nothing fancy added to it one's going to be just cinnamon apple cider and the other one's going to be an old apple spider with spider apple spider i don't like i was drinking it yet so i was going to have allspice berries in it cinnamon and so the first one with the spices in it clove is very powerful how many cloves i'm putting two two cloves two all sliced berries three three all spice berries literally one this one i wanted to be a little more so the yeast i'm using is a premier blanc you can get an alcohol content up to around 18 to 22 depending but typically tops out at about 15 and depends on your feeding cycle you can do some nutrient feeds and stuff like that throughout the temperature feeds but i'm not doing all that what was that i'm not doing all that mess so this is gonna be as simple as it gets so one pack just can go for a five gallon bucket or six gallon carboy um so for these three i'm basically just gonna split it up between the three and you can see the exact measurements that i'm doing those are very exactly i mean this is like science and stuff wow bill and i would be proud i think that one might be a bit short i think it's just perfect okay so at this point this is going to be shaky shaky shake oh get the yeast okay cool part two part two so i just shook all these up you can actually make a simple syrup and add the sugars and all that crap to it with the simple syrup once it adds a little bit of water to it brings up your volumes decreases your these are premier dollar general party balloons so super fancy airlock it's a party so this goes on take a knife or a blue or a pair of scissors pop a hole in it literally just a little tiny slice so the gas can't escape it doesn't blow up like a balloon because the co2 and this will blow it up the cheapest airlock on the planet so i got a bag of 20 of these for a buck so we'll let these ferment for a week or two i'll chill out in a nice warm place 70 degrees or so in the closet there and then after that we'll touch them i'm not doing a hydrometer reading i don't care what the alcohol content is i'm not concerned it's gonna be a little spicy um if i was gonna take a hydrometer reading that would be the time to take a hydrometer reading so you get your initial and then you get your finish to find out what the alcohol content is but don't care um like i said you can let it go for longer to become dry let it eat all the sugars you can pull it early bottle it up put in the fridge and stop the process and kind of slow it down i really stop and slow it down what i'm going to do with these a couple of these is i'm actually going to bottle them let them firm into a little longer my back sweep them a little bit let them ferment a little longer in the bottles to get carbonation then i'm going to pasteurize them to kill the yeast so that's going to be in basically a canning pan that is off the bottom so you're not actually touching and it's 180 degree water you put those and you put your bottles in there and pour the water in and you put them in at 180 degrees as long as your bottles are room temp you're not you shouldn't have the thermal shock it should be okay but you put in a bottle with water same kind of bottle of water in the same canyon with it with a thermometer in that when that one reaches 140 degrees when yeast dies basically uh then you're going to go you're pasteurized the fermentation stops co2 production stops you're not going to have a bunch of glass bombs sitting around in your fridge which this is water kefir mint kefir that's been sitting for a very long time get careful with it gassing out yes that's scary because these have been sitting for quite a while dude this one especially you're safe little pucker factor but those can actually blow up we've had them blow up in the house before um but if you're using the proper bottles typically you're not going to have the problem these guard shark bottles they are made for this purpose for high pressure uh the flip top lids typically will release before the bottle blows doesn't mean that the bottles don't have imperfections and they can't go uh so i'll put these in the closet let them do their thing for a couple weeks and go in there and taste them and see where they're at we like it if we like it then we'll go ahead and bottle them up and put roughly half a teaspoon or so of sugar back in the bottles uh to give them their carbonation looking to do a second ferment carbonate up real heavy and then go ahead and pasteurize them and then they're good for shell storage or storage in the fridge and good to drink but other than that very simple part apple cider so i think these were eight bucks a piece nine bucks a piece also i get the glass bottle excuse me so now we can ferment other things in these um i got to buy some more lids and actually you can buy the uh corks for these if you want to or the ones with the holes once you actually put a bubbler in them but this works just fine so there you go folks very simple so have fun get drunk at home on your own made stuff about you for that way and you know what's going into it so stay happy", "nJIayBJmya0": "okay guys it's late uh 10:30 ish and I have a

cups feels gonna add one cup brown sugar add half a cup of white sugar to the apple juice in the apple cider I'm going to add a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of cinnamon [Music] [Applause] [Music] apple pie moonshine has been can turn up the heat and then leave it to cool completely when your mixture is cooled to room temperature it's time to add the alcohol now I use rum sailor Joey's because it's 46% which is a little higher but if you want something stronger feel free to use Everclear which i think is closer to an 80 proof or another kind of one that you enjoy I like this one too because it's also a little spicy and that just adds to the flavor you get a throw the whole bottle in inevitably as we are working in the forest some twigs and a few other things have gotten into the pot so I'm gonna just use a muslin cloth to strain it out if you don't mind twigs then just go straight for pouring it into your mason jars [Applause] the last thing you have to do is add a cinnamon stick put

of all I listen from a previous batch I have some very hungry East in the bottom right now and the East I'm using is now loving EC 1 1 8 this you can purchase Rea read cheaply from Amazon and their champagne East is excellent for this so that's gonna make it okay first half openness and apple juice too much in here I'm gonna pull out maybe a cup okay so put on some makeup and then I got I know this from last batch it's just easy in the bottom I'm going to hold it in there that's enough shaker area okay and then I put this I have a pure hole into the another cap and I put a airlock in their knowledge and now it's gonna ferment it will bubble bring hard for about two days and then after that your tub bubbling will cease and then you just little sip one of the maybe one or two days another so he settled down to the bottom they can you can drink it if it's too dry you can add some apple juice into it and and then close the cap tight and then the new extra apple juice will ferment in the in the bottle and create a combination if you if you like but you can drink it without combination so that's how you do it so this would be will be done bar for 5 days 4 days", "CKSiYoas6kQ": "hi this

we have so many judgments i i'm on the land we're getting our kettle washed out here ready for a brew date tomorrow so that's what we're doing so we use a potable hose here that's the white that's made for water never use a regular garden hose you'll get some funny tastes a white hose a potable hose is made for water transfer so we're going to gather about nine gallons eight and a half gallons here to heat up put it through we always get a little bit extra for sparse water just in case we need it and we're going to put an electric uh heater in here and let it come on early in the morning for us to get our strike water ready we'll get that up to about 172 degrees so i can't hear nothing with the water running oh that's better if i turn the light on you can see much better like i say we're going to gather the uh about eight and a half gallons of water here for the brew in the morning we'll be doing a blueberry beer batch number 105 today a blueberry bastard we call it so we're going to go in we're going to strike water really hot right here we're at 172. and you can always cool it down with ice if you need to here's the grain we're going to be using today and as the old norse brewery says you need to fondle you need to fondle your grain before you brew it so there the fondling is in and we'll be going in charlie and here we go um we'll just stir this in slowly here that we don't get a dough ball temperature check here 155 that's a good dolan 155 right where we want to be we're really good give this one so we're starting the loft on the blueberry bastard we're just gonna do two pitchers and then we're gonna get the kettle out on the ground here and we uh mashed in here throw it in at one now she smells nice it's pretty clear so we're we're heading off to the boil kettle here pick this kettle up awesome go to boil petals so one two ounces of citra is our first edition of hops here so they're in the cameras picking up on that whether it should or not who cares so our one ounce of citra are in and the second edition is going to be two ounce or two ounces of citra are in and the second edition will be glacier this is the blueberry bastard beer we got the mash tun all cleaned out already washed out and cleaned out first edition of hops are in i want to set the timer for 45 minutes mrs stoneyard i got it 45 minutes so usually three different ways you have a single step infusion which is a lot of uh what you see around just add the mash and the water once one temperature and get your extract from that for a german side we have almost two kettles and it's a step up um temperature mash so you start lower step it up to a higher say reduction if you want to put on multiple batches a day you're you're probably going to separate a hot liquor tank from your batch you're going to have all right our second addition uh last 15 minutes here is uh two ounces of glacier hops we'll throw them in and we'll train them when i uh pull them out pull them all out together so they're in last 15 minutes i'm going to get the work shoulder hooked up shortly but we're going to get our irish moss in always like to use a cap full that's a lot but we get the irish moss in and uh even at uh we're going to use furmate all this time and we're going to put that right in the boil i don't want to forget about it so even for the last 15 minutes it's going to go in the boil it's like dead yeast it's going to be an energizer so we're going to get that in now oh maybe a spoonful sorry nice siri set a timer for the it sounded like fostering hang on i was doing a foster brooks invitation for food for 14 minutes now we're down to our last 10 minutes or so got the word chiller hooked up into my hose here just got to turn the valve on for the water to come in i keep it in the bucket there under the sanitizer and i'll let the water run through the other hose out the garage door so this time we're going to be doing our own blueberries and they'll consist of our own blueberries no it's going to put them in the blender here and grind and find and grind it's cheaper to do it this way because the puree was like 28 for the three pounds you get four pounds of blueberries for uh what's the price of four pounds eight dollars about nine bucks is a big difference nine dollars for four pounds versus twenty eight dollars for three pounds the difference is just doing your own and grinding them up we'll sanitize everything and we'll get them going we'll probably splatter them all over the wall and make a mess because that's what happens when you do stuff yourself all right flame out flame out and get this work shoulder in without getting burnt see if i can do that and we're on and chilling off to the fermenter with the blueberry bastard so we got some of the blueberry puree we made and just cooked slowly let's go out with that oh there's huge berries in there yet oh dang it the lesson learned to let him thought we put the fur main o into the boil this time ah so while the wife watches this we're gonna go clean our uh are you today is bella say he's on my level on we've used it before they say to rehydrate it but uh i don't need to do that she'll be fine in here all by itself so she's in no stirring today and here's our cover and the blueberry bastard she owned the fermented corner she done we just got to get her uh clean up here we'll keep an eye on that uh make sure she doesn't blow off on us so we're gonna wash our kettle out we'll show you what we got left in here like that there's our trub tube and there's not much of it because i put the stuff in the bag all the hops batch 105 complete kettle's clean match tons clean we're from running in the corner there uh sanitizers put away garage floors been washed down yada yada we're done we're going to go relax have a have a cold one it'll probably be one of my hufflewises so off we go all right friends we're gonna sample a blueberry bastard here why wouldn't we it's probably a dirty glass we'll find out in a minute we'll fill one up here and see what we got this is a farmhouse ceson should be a lot more carbonated than that should have a better head not too good of a head you can force one in there how's that very small head for a season but i do believe she's totally carbureted we got a dirty glass why wouldn't we cheers friends from the rueland brewery at stoneyard vineyards we poured ourselves uh uh blueberry bastard cezanne farmhouse cezanne well we call it cezanne she's uh very uh very upfront she finished at uh uh .06 down from 10 60 something i don't have the sheets in front of me right now but she was a good one for dang sure so we're going to get a taste test on it i'm hoping she's fully carved the color of it is uh let's see here that's my wife over there she can come over here closer here and her voice better uh yeah it's an amber it's a shock it's a blueberry why wouldn't it be it's got a deep amber color with a reddish hue she says deep amber color right a shoe i'll tell you the hops in here where the uh i don't even know if i listed it in a video prior to this uh citra and glacier at the end two ounces center to enter glacier so i went to taste test it's very dry i'm hoping it's dry to finish at .06 it should be on the dry side yeah there is no sweetness left it's very dry i'm one of the worst taste testers out there anyway so i do taste a little what i think is blueberry because i know i put blueberry in here ah it didn't hold a lot of blueberry flavor no it fades into the the alcohol mixes with it and the bella says soon yeast is a i believe it's a british yeast i'm gonna forget that too as it says on that's in a farmhouse style it can ferment and at very high levels uh temperature levels it's a very wide variety type yeast and the flocculation i believe is on the medium side if i didn't i'm shirt but she attenuated very well very very well she attenuated down to zero six where's where we get the drying drying this over yeah that blueberry is very much in the background not a not a forward-facing way but flavor-wise you get a lot of good grain flavor a lot of really nice there's the grain in there but you don't get a lot of blueberries i i don't know if i would want to enhance this maybe with a blueberry extract well we did our own blueberries that's that's that's a little difference with one one pound extra i don't know if there's any difference my original blueberry bastard i looked at the video today it was made with more of a maras otter so she had more of a nutty flavor and you know that mirror side is a dang dang good multi are those guys out there that brew with it we know that so anyway um i'm happy with it she come in at six point uh i'm looking at my i'm looking at the i'm looking at my sheet over there i know so we're gonna say we're gonna try to end this video quick with the lacing on the low side the smell again i really stink at this i'm not a good reviewer the uh the malt is pushed more to the background and replaced more with the taste of the yeast that's staying in suspension uh that's all how i can describe it that way the blueberry is just often in its own little the licorice land i guess there's no sweetness the the taste on the tongue on the back side of the palate is dry banana all i can say the east the east i say that east the east the extras of the east how you doing uh come through so much on this beer it's only five pounds of two row two pounds of uh cara pills i think it's a pound of wheat in here of course i'll put it in the in the in the videos you should see it in the beginning of this video but i don't recall one of this i made it like four weeks ago the sheets laying over there on my uh my brew desk my brew desk it's a freaking table so once again proust i do taste the alcohol in there she saw 6.2 ah good beer to have when you want to have a beer i was staying in my backyard and i came across something so amazing and i called the police immediately man finds strange object in his backyard calls the fbi immediately man sees strange glowing object in his garden calls the nsa agency immediately", "EP3SIUOig8k": "Moreland folks something totally different today goodness I make some apple cider well Apple and Barry cider that these a pet all these myself last year we've got apple juice yeast sugar couple of boreholes it should be easy enough so homemade apple cider the first issue instantly ran into as my yeast when I did last year so I thought a retest though I feel that I miss some sugar and water but inevitable there's definitely still alive look so bubbled up so it should be fine okay so our supply on the first thing we're gonna do is mash these up and ablate nah no we're gonna pour all these these are knees and I don't know what they are to think they're clown berries they were in the freezer the wall enter back pot with some water and just summer long and tournament Amash and then I'll strain it all out and I'll go the next step this is gonna be amazing who made apple cider we'll see if it works right come back once I've a got these in the pan right with glass stir that up this sucks they'll come to a boil soon so let's chop these on and fire me but now Alex chocolate on chocolate on chocolate Bailey's are apples and whoops right I may have to add some more water definitely have to add some more water all right we'll turn these to Marshall come back and I'm gonna once while summer Dunaway okay what Bob Allen will be nicely look at that I'm just smashing all and I was gonna blame bless us in the blender but I'm not gonna bother just gonna mash up and sum it up look at the color of this stuff fact I'm gonna taste it oh it's quite better obviously there's no sugar in it anyway I'm just gonna smash this off for a while not sure what's gonna happen with a detect and say the things things will get my but we all just know and I don't even know God's sake I think you know what I do an open idea to exercise I'm just not sure if using that to metal detectors a good idea or not I'm not sure what's happening by that so today we're just gonna worry a bit making some cider yeah a nice will bubble this away for now not ten minutes I think botulism gets killed the 85 Celsius as long as we decide we're all right last thing I need just know his botulism all right come back lemon ah okay we've got off sorry Stu Lake mixture and I think it's ready to get strained not bad all the apples and berries will put for nothing they say their horses fueled they tore not off Oh empty that's my shop oh right away I'll have to D must you will just let us so any water in that one else are they I might have to squash it don't know but I thought that would be brave red yeah right right super nuts I will start squashing this dough must spin like that watch we'll see okay that was a lot faster Naboo but we've got our pretty clear Roy was 500 750 ml of less no so what we're gonna do I would love to have made that a nice by the way but you can't see inside them to see what's happening I may get an air lock and do something with these at some point great we're going to pour this and to here and from there and at the plastic bottles so I'm sure I can manage that life let me see right Jesus okay so from here no can I do this without spilling it I can't the track has to not look at the forward while you're doing this okay rinse and repeat until whoa we've got all that and see these bottles by the way I soaked them in like a mayo bleach and hot water solution just to disinfect them alright I'll come back once we've ever them in here actually no we're not gonna put all into one bottle we're gonna split between the two bottles change my mind the next stage I'm gonna truck some sugar into each one I'm not sure how much to use all right pal who's there gone let's go for that's just one of these things where you going then on it and every answer is different I'm gonna make up I'm gonna go 250 grams pill bottle I don't know if that's way too much or not fat now let's all for 200 what does I see one faith how is chop some more on that can only get stronger there we go 215 grams of sugar per bottle right I'll chalk that in and I'll come back I'm not sure if you can go overboard with sugar or not I know sugar makes it stronger alcohol wise but eventually and you can just knock all the yeast right let's get that in the bottle do you want to see it show a film that doesn't sound very exciting but me as well okay well chocolate sugar don't look actually was quite nice first walks and that turns out to be a 70% cider I'll be well chuffed okay we've got 215 grams of sugar let's just sprinkle that and don't watch the phone there we go obviously the sugar feeds the yeast I think I just couldn't figure it out easily how much to burn so I just we'll just putting this in mind that seems quite a lot and that does seem quite a lot sugar well we build in well they are right I'll do the same again with us one okay after say that this one to do 200 grams no 185 grams I don't know why but sometimes tell me it could be too much sugar alright that's the sugar sitting there that hopefully will get eat you're not bay the yeast it's not gonna be sweet when you drink up in fact if anything you'll have to add sugar once the Easter's Daanish stuff great next stage was that when our deaths when I had the East I hope I don't kill you pal I'm not using the stuff I mean the earlier it's been certainly for the ages now I'm gonna chop some new stuff and Zoey did by Stephan Utley still working for gas there we go okay that's baby ten pence ten pins for sweet-and-sour shotgun ten pins for two chocolate eclairs 20 P for was basically a Moo anyway hey add some yeast to these guys right just before I add the yeast I'm just gonna give a to try and get the sugar so it makes dinner but I'll eat the color of this and it's not dead excited pissed off it doesn't look like I'll make you feel Suckley we'll just get the sugar thing we'd finish see my gamer this guy sugar I don't know what if anybody s watching out on the water thinkin right now we can add the yeast and I'm gonna go through a parka between the two of them seven grams between the two I'm just making this up I don't actually really know all the exact stuff right inside the yeast looks like is for men and already right here's worth to say that did hundreds or sir 150 ml of lukewarm water and seven grams of yeast that's a seven gram packet which is chocolate and right I'm gonna put 75 ml in each bottle hopefully that's enough I don't know but fast oh that smells so nice I love that smell smells like a brewery right first I'll just give a lot of very general Starr there's no sugar in there buy anything because it's just gone straight in there but I just wanna mix up okay we've got our yeast mixture and try our best to split fifty-fifty forgot to say C last bread yeast thus best bread yeast that's not ideal I had champagne yeast which is meant to be way better for cider tastes better makes it stronger but that's two years old and when opened up it was all it was all pay today and we aren't the saw enough aboard so I if you can get decent yeast get on eBay or zarbor 75 nah not even course if you can get better yeast on ebay I with champagne yeast on sort of stuff meant to be way better not that I have a clue so just what I've read let's mix you up all right so what I add in the yeast know and what we'll do with the rest of the room I will top up with some more apple juice I'll give a quick rinse with apple juice and put it right back in so there's hope I look and the Easter Zen they are now with the sugar a couple hours there should be bubbles rising up should be  all right so we've got everything in there now the yeast is on there we'll just go out of any gen to mix up remember Easter's are loving a little click shot almost just spin it all a both people just spin it these X there yeah seem with us one oh hey guys enjoy your raid right one final step before we leave this this app that has everything done sugar fruit juice yeast max top final step we'll just I don't have a near a lot I don't even have a balloon so we're just gonna listen the car just enough for the gas to escape and that should be enough what man here walk on a balloon ideally but that as long as it's just loose enough for the co2 to escape shouldn't explored but I reckon and a few hours the big bubbles coming up they're all up the side you should start to come alive pretty soon maybe even before I get the video up I can get another shot in a few hours time if not we'll come back at least seven days make me drinkable this time next week but there will be updates through the week and if anybody has any other things you what they see me do that don't cost money give me a show I'm sure there will be metal detect in some ways somehow just has to be done properly make sure you're doing the right thing at the moment because things are getting mental right there we go update your nurse that could be four liters of strong up inside or for next to nothing like I said if there's anything else you may miss about where come our show see you next time Cheers", "LYBE12rIZgA": "hey guys welcome back to the arch we're in heaven today we're going to be working on making an apple pie this apple pie has been in my family for a pretty long time and it tastes so amazing so what we're going to be doing is peeling and cutting to granny smith apples and putting them in a bowl to then set aside after doing that you're gonna want to add fourth teaspoon of cinnamon 20 grams of sugar 40 grams of brown sugar and five grams of flour into a medium bowl with the apples and toss next up I'm putting my apples in a pan and dotting them with six small cubes of butter and then mixing up a sixtieth of an ounce of apple cider along with a twentieth of an ounce of Meyers dark rum for our fourth and final step I'm just lling my apple cider mixture on top of my apples before mixing 25 grams of softened butter 1/4 cup of flour for two grams of brown sugar and 20 grams of pecans into our crumble topping for our apple pie I'm then baking that for 20 minutes in my foreigner degree oven hope you guys loved the video please remember to Like comment and subscribe

right into it here so we're going to go ahead and start off we're doing a big batch because we love big food so we're going to start off with a gallon some cider and a gallon of apple juice so we're going to put both of those in together to make a big pot for a big party even on the ship after a big big big trip to see you we love to come back have a good time so we're going to get that in we're going to get some heat on it get that fire it up also to that we're going to go ahead and add for this particular recipe we're talking about a cup and a half of sugar we're going to do 1/2 a cup of the dark brown sugar right in a drink we're throwing 68 cinnamon sticks 2 tablespoons of vanilla we're going to get that simmering up and then we're going to come on over here we're going to slice up some ass [Music] all right so here we go with the apples any Apple you like I like granny smith apples we have to cover them up we're just going to slide these right inside our pot and we're going to bring everything here to the boil we're going to get it to where it's bubbling real good you can really smell that flavor already smells great this is going to be just like a hot apple pie but it's going to be full blues and it's going to get you drunk keep slicing some apples here [Music] and last but not least we're putting the cores and the whole thing seeds are inside of that so you're not going to lose anything but that's going to help give us is that much more flavor we don't let anything go to waste give it a good stir put your lid on that and let us just get to a nice boil right run break [Music] right now this is been boiling for about 20 minutes 20 30 minutes and come on in and get a look at this take the lid off now you can see that cinnamon everything in there and basically it smells amazing smells like fresh apple pie well that's cool completely so we're going to get leaving alone we're going to start getting the rest of our stuff ready Everclear this is this is the alcohol of the bunch this stuff this is like rocket fuel burns it's hot like fire but this is what's going to make this nice and potent get all the meat students at sea and draws it we're going to have a good time tonight come on back we'll start pouring it up so now we've had a good dinner we got our this stuff cooled off we're ready to make our apple pie moonshine now guys this isn't real moonshine I wish it work this is legal real moonshines obviously not but the next step now that we're all cooled off we're going to come in here and we're going to add our liquor now this is just this is Everclear this is as strong as we can find in the store there put that in we're going to give that a good stir [Music] we're going to take our mason jars I put that bad boy right in there fill it up just like that that's what you're looking like that's the finished back to apple pie moonshine right there yeah okay just like your mama used to make he catches next time guys we're going to be doing something great we'll see you soon pirate chef out [Music]", "lpSqH7xdjfY": "hello everyone gavin knext here and today i'm going to be making some tubo cider okay now to begin with i'm going to start by making a starter okay basically this is um just preparing the yeast getting it ready for the fermentation of apple juice okay so i have some store-bought apple juice here nothing fancy no preservatives so it's a good stuff this particular carton i kept warm and basically that's just to make the starter okay now inside this pint glass i have a tablespoon of sugar just normal granulated sugar okay everything here is perfectly sterile so now i'll begin okay so i'll begin by putting about half a pint of juice into this pint glass okay nice and easy no rush okay right now the reason why i haven't filled that glass is because when the yeast goes in and it activates it'll start bubbling and it'll produce a foam and it could um burst out with the top okay so now i have some normal sparkling uh wine yeast okay this is pretty good for me inside you can pretty much use uh baker's yeast um but i i want a bit of strength to this okay so normally like baker's east dies off at about eight percent i want to take it over the 10 so that it lasts a little bit longer okay so let's get to work sterilized kitchen scissors okay so i'll take the top straight off again nothing's fancy with this this has all been sterilized the packet's also been sterilized okay my hands are perfectly sterile and yeah basically that's it straight into the pint glass okay now a nice sterilized spoon okay and yeah i'm just giving a little stir okay and i think this juice is about 25 degrees which is good enough for the yeast there's plenty of sugar in there uh some people like to put citric acid or a little bit of lemon juice inside i think there's enough acid and enough nutrients in the apples there's enough vitamins and certainly to provide nourishment for the yeast okay so bring it a little bit closer to you you can probably see that all swirling around okay now what i'm gonna do and i've already prepared this i've made a little tinfoil hat okay now basically what i did was i tore a square off the roll of tin foil and i put it around the pink glass to make the shape and now i have a perfectly fitting yeah no okay so i'm going to leave that for about an hour and hopefully when we come back we should see some foam okay so see you in a few moments here we go there you starter should be ready you know okay as you can see there's a nice little foamy head on that okay i'll try to zoom in slowly and you can see that there's still activity in there and that's exactly what we want yeah isn't some nice phone there and that's more or less ready to use now okay so let's go everyone uh here i have my fermenting vessel okay the solder is basically an empty five liter water jug perfectly sterilized okay i have used it before but it's been sterilized washed out and everything and the cap okay i'm not going to be using an air lock and i'll explain why okay so i've measured out 350 grams of sugar okay this will provide a little extra alcohol i have a fully sterilized funnel okay just to get everything inside without making a mess okay and as you saw earlier on i have the yeast starter okay good and here i have four liters of apple juice okay minus the half a pint of apple juice i use for these starter okay good let's crack on okay so first of all i'll put the dry ingredient in first which of course is the sugar the reason why why i'm doing this now is so the sugar doesn't get stuck in the funnel okay so i'll put this lot in first okay you don't really have to be gentle doing this okay so that's all in now okay i'll give it a little shake to even out a little bit now what i'm going to do is i'm going to pour in the first two liters okay and there's no rush doing this okay you can do it at your own speed [Music] okay so remember everything here has been sterilized everything is nice and clean we don't want any nasty bacteria getting in okay so that's the first eater in can get the last couple of drops of the carbon let's not be wasteful okay so put the next one in okay and this apple juice has been left out in um it's winter here so the heating is on and the rooms are nice and warm we're in the kitchen which is always nice and warm okay don't use chilled apple juice because yeah you know it'll probably uh kill the yeast off okay and we don't want that to happen okay so what we've got here that's an empty one this is an empty one okay now before i pour the rest of the apple juice in i'm now going to put in the yeast starter okay now the reason why i'm doing this is because um i want to be able to rinse the glass out okay so there'll be yeast and foam stuck on the side i want to get rid of all that i want it all to go into the into the fermenting vessel okay so i'm just pouring this in now and as you can probably see there's some foam and stuff stuck around the edge of the glass okay so i want to wash that out now so just move this up the way so yeah this apple juice is warm and it you can really smell it as well you know it's a nice fragrant smell to it and this is just store-bought apple juice nothing fancy i think in the uk it costs about 60p a liter here in germany this um i think was 79 cents so about the same price okay so now this is all going in so we just stand up for a moment okay so i spilled a little bit there it is important to try to be a little bit clean and tidy when you're doing this okay so uh let's try and get the last bit of this glass i don't really like pouring out of pine glass because it is a little awkward but i would like to get the remaining yeast out of this glass okay okay and that's it now so i'll clean this here i haven't actually wasted that much just a few drips okay so i've put all of these things together now so that's empty too more or less okay and it's important to leave a headspace that's why i'm only putting four liters in here you can top it up then with some water later on okay it's important to leave a head space because if you have good fermentation the yeast will or the liquid rather will expand and you could have a blowout okay that's very very risky okay good so i think that's just about it so there's nothing left okay good so a little bit disorganized here right so now here's where you need to use a little bit of force okay put the top the cap on tightly at this point now we're going to give it to begin with a little shake a little up and down movement and the sugar at the bottom and then you can start being a bit more vigorous with it okay be careful that you don't twist the cap at this point because it will all come out um this will also aerate the liquid which is really good for the yeast okay now you may ask no airlock why not okay so here's what i'm going to do you don't really need any lock uh because i've done this many times before i know to leave this for about two weeks and you know it will be the perfect strength and it will be fully fermented okay um if this is your first time instead of using an airlock the best thing you can do is actually take a condom and you put a condom over the top and while the fermentation is taking place the condom will expand it will fill with carbon dioxide and then when it falls flat fermentation is complete now i don't need to do that as i said i know how long this is going to take so i'm going to do is i'm going to put the top on but not very tightly very loosely so it's screwed on but it's not completely tight okay so basically any carbon dioxide can escape but no bacteria or anything can get in okay good so that's just about it for now uh we come back in about two weeks and yeah we'll see how it tastes okay so that's all for now", "5Gneskdu0UY": "now you've read from the title of this this is your sign I'm not gonna sign it for a while excuse me I'm just there from the previous review and I love sign up there we go ol Benny calendrical whiskey drink log drink cider drink I love them all look at all stout guineas better lots of fun of bitter books you know hours of all that a lot more absolutely brilliant so I've been looking at these ciders and I like try and go for all the different ones for some reason I just don't want to be different because of people's eating habits and drinking habits and allergies and stuff that are seen to be happening more and more as we progress through this through this world people are having trouble eating and drinking certain stops me personally I can eat any kind of food any kind of drink and it does not affect me there must be something in my breathing in my DNA that I just I have absolutely I've got no asthma I've got no allergies I've got no eating deficiencies or anything I can absolutely honestly say the only problem is when I have fish chips and mushy peas it does let me fart really bad but that's just an axial you know that's just a hazard that the family has to put up with so what a bit I was looking through these ciders and I wasn't looking for this particular thing but I found this and he said angry orchard hard cider and I thought all Angry all always angry I'm angry everything just these things that just want me up east and I just sometimes I can feel me pressure I mean me head it's like you don't even put a lucky bag around your finger and it goes all pink and red and hard and I just feel like flip at any time right I'll pick this up angry orchard sire hungry orchard hard cider that's all started reading the label it says naturally gluten-free so naturally gluten-free which is got to be a good thing so people if you've got some kind of allergy to gluten this is for you obviously if you like cider the crisp and refreshing side and mixed mixes the sweetness of apples with a subtle drivers for a balanced sign it taste the fresh apple aroma and sweet right right Apple sorter see this is it now see I could absolutely flip now there is some times when I've gone wrong completely and I don't end it right I don't like to edit but I want an idea but I won't do it because that's how I am I could just throw this against the wall sometimes the fresh apple aroma with ants love the fresh apple aroma and slightly sweet ripe apple flavor makes this cider hard to resist its ingredients is hard cider I don't understand what the hard cider is right okay I should have done that before natural flavours carbon dr.

Hey, you're watching Preppy\nKitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. This apple crumble pie won't make itself, so let's get started. First off, I'm whipping up\nmy favorite butter crust. This is gonna have 2\n1/2 cups, or 300 grams, of all-purpose flour. I'm putting this right\ninto my food processor. Pop it on, 1/4 teaspoon\nof salt, in you go, and 1/4 cup, or 50 grams,\nof granulated sugar. Pop the top on, and just\npulse it up to combine. Now it's time to add\none cup, or 226 grams, of cubed cold butter. So cube the butter, keep it in your fridge until you're ready to use it. So add this in. And now we're gonna pulse it until we have little lentil-sized pieces. (processor whirring) Just to show you what it looks like. The rough mixture, small\nlittle crumbles in there. I have a big bowl of ice water and two tablespoons of fresh\nlemon juice at the ready. I'll probably be adding\nabout 1/4 cup of ice water, we'll see how it goes. Pulse as you drizzle. And the two tablespoons\nof fresh lemon juice. If you're using the food processor, after you pulse, as you\ntake your finger off, it should kinda just do this. (puffs) If that doesn't happen, go ahead and add a tablespoon\nat a time while you pulse. (processor pulsing) Okay, it just did it, it went (puffs). You know this is ready because you can take a\nhandful out, very carefully, place it in the palm of your hand, squeeze it together,\nand it holds its shape. Mostly. So this is now ready to roll out. Perfect. Dump the mixture out. This looks like it's a crumbly\nmess, but it's perfect, and all I have to do is press it together. I like to use a pastry mat just to work this a little\nbit by compacting it, and then, I don't need\nthis, but I will slide it, fold it over on itself, and\nthen slide it just like that. And then fold it over again the other way, and you can see it totally\nbrings it together. You're taking these\nlittle crumbles of butter and sliding them to smash them into more of a flake of\nbutter, which is what I want. That's good. And now you could either\nwrap this in plastic, or if you're using a pastry mat, you can kinda just put the\npastry mat into the fridge. So flatten it into more of a disc shape. I'll just put it in the fridge like this. This needs about half an\nhour to come together, although you could make\nthis a day or two in advance and just keep it in the fridge. While this chills, we're gonna make our easy and delicious filling. Into the fridge you go. To make the filling, you're gonna wanna peel, core, and slice\nthree pounds of apples. Today I'll use Granny Smith, but I often use some\nHoneycrisp, some Fuji, really depends on what I\nhave and what I feel like. Totally up to you. All right, let's get to peeling. If you have any helpers in the kitchen, now is the time to ask them\nto do something for you. My little toddler helpers are a little too small\nfor this at the moment, but as soon as their\nhands can safely do this, they'll be helping. In case you're wondering, three\npounds, or 1.36 kilograms, is about 9 to 10 medium-small apples. And this will fill up\na nine-inch pie dish. If you wanna make a larger, deep dish pie, then you'll add a couple more apples in and everything else will stay the same. Time to cut the flesh from the core. And we're gonna give\nthese a nice even slice. You want the apple pieces to\nbe roughly the same thickness so they all bake at the same time. Time to slice them up, let's\nthink about 1/4 inch or less. And as you slice, no, no, no, yes, yes, yes, use your\nknuckles as a guide. You don't wanna cut your fingers\noff. Pie is not worth it. If you saw my, \"We Planted\nan Apple Orchard\" video, which you can click up here for, you'll know that we\nplanted an apple orchard. But those apples are not ready yet, and we also have a ton of old\napple trees on the property, but they're also not ready yet. So these ones came from the\nstore, but I'm very excited to use some of my delicious\napples from our own farm. (knife slicing) Okay, take a breath, you deserve it. Now it's time to finish prepping this. For me, apples, lemon, and\ncinnamon go hand-in-hand. I love the brightness of the lemon juice, the warmth of the cinnamon, and the sweetness of the\napples all mixed together. So I'm gonna add 1/4 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice over this and just let it sit there. It's not really to preserve\nthe color of the apples, it's to add a bit of flavor in here. You could totally skip the lemon juice if you hate lemons for some reason, so it's somewhat optional. Now we're adding 2/3\ncup of granulated sugar, it's about 133 grams I believe. And then it's time for the spices. I'm keeping this really nice and simple, I'm adding 1/2 teaspoon\nof cinnamon, in we go. And I think just a touch of\nnutmeg can't hurt anyone, so a little pinch of\nfreshly grated nutmeg. If you wanted to, you could definitely add\nsome of your favorites, allspice, cardamom,\nginger, whatever you like. But now it's time to give this a toss. So get everything coated\nin spices and sugar. It's like a delicious salad. Here's the deal. I'm gonna take this onto the skillet and start cooking the apples down because I wanna release a\nton of juices from them. They have too much juice in there, and it's gonna make\nyour crust really soggy. No one wants a soggy crust. What we wanna do, take the juices, cook them down into a caramel, fold that back into the apples, and then we can bake that in our pie. It's gonna be delicious. So right now, we're\ngonna go onto the stove and get a big skillet out, let's go. Add 1/4 cup, or 70\ngrams, of unsalted butter into a large skillet over\nmedium-high heat, and let it melt, and then we'll add those apples in. Okay, after your butter melts,\nadd in all those apples. (apples sizzling) We're gonna cook this\nover medium-high heat for about two minutes\nwhile moving things around. I wanna give it a nice start. This smell is beyond amazing right now, you've gotta make this recipe, hello. After your apples have cooked\ndown for a few minutes, you'll see they released a ton of juices, and then it's time to add one\ntablespoon of cornstarch in. Just sprinkle it in, sprinkle,\nsprinkle, little star. And mix it in. Now it's time to reduce\nto medium-low and cover. This'll cook for about seven minutes, and this is a cover for those pans in case you ever wondered, I get a lot of questions\nabout these discs. Cover it up. While that's simmering down, go ahead and melt 1/2 cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter in a small-ish bowl. It's for the crumble,\nand it needs to melt, but cool before we use\nit, so just have it ready. My apples cooked down for seven minutes, and now it's time to strain\neverything into a bowl. 'Cause I wanna separate the\napples from their juices. There we go. This goes back over your burner. Now, try and get all the\nliquid out of your apples, and set these aside for a minute. Now, this liquid gold is\ngonna go back onto the stove and we're gonna cook it down\nuntil it bubbles and thickens. It's gonna smell amazing,\nbut you'll definitely notice the change in consistency\nwhen it's ready, so let's go. Pour the liquid back\nin, and get it all out. Now we're gonna place this\nover medium-high heat, and just stir frequently. You don't want any part to\nburn, it should cook evenly. You'll see it bubbling almost right away, but it really has to thicken up before it's ready to take off heat. (upbeat music) Ooh, it's getting close, you can see that it's taking much longer\nto come back together. Okay. One last swipe, and you can\nsee it's really taking a while, it's kinda bubbling together\nas opposed to flowing together. Dump your apples back into the bowl, and then transfer this very\nmuch more thickened liquid into the apples. And you can see, this consistency is like some caramel\namazingness over here. Give it a toss, because we wanna distribute all of this so it's even. And now this needs to cool down, it has to go into our pie crust, but this would just melt\nthat pie crust right away. So let it cool down. In the meantime, we're\ngonna make our crumble and then roll our dough out. To make the crumble I'm\nadding 3/4 cup, or 90 grams, of all-purpose flour into a medium bowl, 1/2 cup, or 100 grams, of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon,\n1/2 teaspoon of salt, and we're just gonna\nmix it up really well. You can either make a crumble\nmy way, with melted butter, or you could use the cold\ncubed butter and cut it in. It's totally up to you,\nboth ways are fine. I'll be drizzling in that 1/2 cup of melted and cooled unsalted butter. And now I'm just gonna\nuse a fork to mix it in. If your butter's too hot,\nit can melt the sugar a bit and you'll form one big glob. If that happens to you, just break it up with\nyour hands into crumbles. It's basically impossible to mess this up. So I love it. So my crumble's all mixed\nup, and as you can see, it looks like a crumble, but\nit's super soft right now. It'll continue setting up as we do the rest of the\nelements for this recipe, and when it's ready to use,\nwe'll just crumble it on top, so don't worry about it\nif it seems a bit soft. Set this aside, and now it's\ntime to roll our pie dough out. Take your pie dough out of the fridge. One of the reasons I love a pastry mat, 'cause I'm all ready to go. A sprinkle of flour. If it's really hard, which\nit very well might be, let it sit out on the\ncounter for a few minutes and just soften up. You don't wanna roll out\nrock hard butter crust because it'll crack. Check the bottom, a little bit more flour. And now it's time to roll it out. I'm using a French rolling\npin, which is tapered. One of the things I like to do is roll the side out\nfirst, just like this, and then roll the middle out. Once your pastry dough\nyields to the touch, it's ready to roll out. And just don't worry about\nthe cracking that much. It happens. I would much rather have\npastry dough that cracks than is completely falling\napart 'cause it's too warm. That's not fun. It's important to keep\nflouring your surface, as well as the top of the pastry dough, flipping it around and just moving it. You don't want it to stay\nin one place for too long. Okay, I have plenty for my pie. So to transfer your pie dough, roll it onto your rolling pin, or you can quarter it as well. And then re-roll it back in. That easy. Don't try and press the dough in. You wanna push it in from the edge, that's because we don't\nwanna stretch the dough, and we also don't wanna make it too thin. It needs to do a little bit of work and hold our pie together. Now I'm gonna trim the edge. I want a little bit of overhang because I'll do a very simple\nrustic edge detail on this. For the pie, we're going\nto fold the edge in. So honestly, this right\nhere is good enough, you don't have to do anything else. But you can just use your\nthumbs and index finger to make that simple pinched detail, which gives you a little\nbit extra, I love this. Look how pretty that is.\nI'm so excited already. Okay, we're ready to assemble,\nand this is an optional step, but I like to brush the\nedge with an egg wash. It gives you a beautiful golden look. And to make an egg\nwash, all you have to do is mix an egg with a little\nbit of water or cream, usually like a tablespoon. Brush the edge with our egg wash. Now it's time to add our filling in, and I did snack on this just a little bit, it is mindbogglingly\ndelicious, you must make this. Add that in. This pie really gives you\nthe best of both worlds, because you have the butter crust and that amazing crumble topping. Use your spatula just to\nsmooth out the top of it. Don't go crazy, but it's nice. Back to our crumble, which I pointed out\nbefore was really mushy, now it's totally set up and crumble-able. Isn't that nice? And now we can add those\nto the top of our pie, just crumbling as we go along. It's nice to have small\ncrumbles, not big ones. This is ready to pop into the oven, but I do not like handling\npies by themselves because it's kind of unwieldy and I never wanna crush anything in there. So place it onto a baking sheet. I have one more pie making tip\nfor you, and here's the deal. This bakes super slow.\nThis bakes right away. So we need to shield the outside so it doesn't burn to a crisp by the time our center's cooked through. To do that, we're gonna use tinfoil. (foil crinkling) Aluminum foil. Fold a long sheet in half,\nand this is a lot of foil, but you can reuse this so many times. Wrap it around your pie. You can just tear it a bit to fasten it. And now we're gonna fold\nloosely over the edge, so just crumple it up, make\nlittle pleats or folds on top. And take a look, you wanna make sure the foil's not pressing against your pie, 'cause it could get stuck. This is ready to go into the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350 and bake an additional\n50 minutes, five-zero. After baking the pie\nat 350 for 50 minutes, I removed the tenting and\nthen baked an additional 15. I wanted the bottom to be nice and golden, just like the top was. That's how you know the pie is done. If you're using a glass pie dish, it's gonna give you a little\nbit longer of a bake time compared to a metal one, just FYI. All right, now we're gonna cut this open, plop some ice cream on, and have a bite. If you like this recipe,\ncheck out my Apple playlist. All my favorite apple recipes\nin one playlist for you. But now, it's time for a bite. That was so good. The apples are cooked to perfection, they melt in your mouth and\nhave so much caramel flavor. I love the butter crust, but\nthat crumb topping is beyond. Thanks so much for watching.

to get a little bit festive so that we can be a little bit more prepared for the upcoming holiday which is Christmas I have decided this year I'm going to give away adult beverages for gifts to our adult friends we are going to make apple pie moonshine and I'm not talking about moonshine in the sense where I'm going to gather corn and make mash and you know use crystal clear mountain spring water we are going to basically make apple pie flavored or infused alcohol alcohol that I purchased from the local grocery store liquor store and other ingredients that I found at the grocery store now the reason why I'm drawn to this recipe in this method which I found from sparkles to sprinkles sprinkles to sparkles I'll have to put her link in the description below this is an instant pot recipe which is right up my alley because I love cooking in my instant pot I love that it's quick that the cleanup is a breeze because we're only using one part so stick around we're going to make some apple pie moonshine okay so these are the ingredients that we're going to use we have cinnamon sticks here some cinnamon sticks pumpkin spice Karm of Everclear and this is the 190 Everclear grain alcohol this is supposed to substitute moonshine we also have caramel flavored vodka apple juice apple cider and then it's also going to use some sugar white and brown sugar and this is this recipe that I'm following the recipe will make 10 to 12 pint-sized jars I'm going to double it and make 24 see if I can get 24 jars out of this alright let's get started okay so we are actually we're going to follow the recipe and I'm gonna do this twice so we are I'm making a double batch but you're gonna see me follow the recipe which makes ten to twelve mason jars okay so the first thing that it says we need is to put in the juices so let's start with apple juice we need 64 ounces of apple juice next we'll do apple cider same amount eight cups so after you put in apple juice apple cider we're going to put in the white sugar brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice and then add in our some cinnamon sticks so it calls for 3/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of light brown sugar and then next we're gonna do 4 cinnamon sticks so we got all the liquids in and the sugar we got the apple juice apple cider sugar light brown sugar and now we need our pumpkin spice okay so now that we have all the ingredients in here I'm gonna turn this to saute so that it heats up so saute for thirty or thirty minutes and that's just to kind do to heat up the liquid enough to melt all the sugars before we pressure cook it okay so now that it looks like the sugar is all dissolved we're going to take this off of saute we're going to cook this on high pressure for 45 minutes [Music] so now that we have our instant pot cooking on high pressure for 45 minutes I want to go over some tips some things that I've did to prepare for this was first of all I prepared my instant pot what I mean by that is I did a vinegar water high pressure cook for five minutes to help remove any lingering smells that the instant pot may have from previous dishes that you might have cooked in it because the silicone ring inside the lid tends to hang on to those scents and flavors and I did not want that to be infused into the apple pie moonshine that I'm cooking another thing that I did was because I bought 24 mason jars it was a lot to clean and I wanted to make sure that they were washed and clean before I use them what I did was I stuck them all in my dishwasher set it forget it so the jars are in my dishwasher drying the lids I hand washed though because I read that if you stick the lids in the dishwasher they tend to rust and I'm giving these out as gifts and the last thing I need is to give out rusty old mason jar lids so that's what I did to help prepare for this little project today just some tips and reminders that the silicone ring inside your instant pot lid can get a little smelly so do what you can to remove those smells I did the vinegar water I also used one of my newer silicone rings and if you have a dishwasher make use of it to wash all those jars for you all right so we're back i've waited several hours for this mixture to cool down completely so that we can now add in the alcohol and jar it up [Music] that's oh no that's really good oh don't mind me I'm just having a little taste test with my friend here I assure you I did not drink all of this by myself okay I shared what's that he says it's really good too all right well I guess that's a wrap we've been successful hmm that's good well I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please go ahead and hit like and subscribe and I'll see you again next time I hope you have a very Merry Christmas from my family to yours [Music]", "mNcP8HxbkBU": "we got about half a bottle of Everclear lift 190-proof we already drank part of it so I'm gonna make a half batch of apple pie moonshine we want to add that later first you want half a gallon apple juice sixty-four ounces of apple whew and you want half a gallon apple cider yeah then we would add Heat cup and a half or no natto two cups of brown sugar one cup of white sugar stir it up for about about 30 to 45 minutes on low heat all right I take back what I said you want to cook this on medium heat basically you don't want it to boil they could boil a little bit but you don't want it to boil a bunch and my grill it's got two settings its low and high so if your stove medium heat you don't want it to boil real hard for you want to cook a lot of water out of it gonna get thicker and basically get you a ladle and taste it and if it still tastes like regular old apple cider then you need to cook it longer keep tasting it taste it every five minutes get you a little bit take a little sip you can tell when it starts to get sweeter that's when you when you want to stop it I want you to once you stop it you know a lot of people say don't add the moonshine or Everclear when it's hot that's that's [ __ ] they just don't know how to add and subtract this there's no longer it's going to be a hundred and ninety three I just watered it down with a gallon so it's not gonna distill it's not gonna distill anymore you could add it in there and this ain't even hot enough because we kept it under boiler we just cook water off you can add that Everclear while it's hot it won't hurt you one bit I've seen a lot of people saying that in line that's [ __ ] I don't have no spices to this I put them on the jar I put a cinnamon stick in there and then I went on fancy and I ordered some vanilla beans these things are outrageous but I ordered some Madagascar vanilla beans for four looks I only ordered two of them so I got to make them go a long way I'm going to cut them up and I like vanilla in mine that's what I put my apple pie when I make it so might as well put it in the amplify moonshine and you can add clove but I hate clove so I'm not gonna put none in mine I don't like that black licorice flavor I think it's gross you wanted to you could put a bunch of clubs he put up a club in each jar for decoration I mean I'm gonna hand these out gifts to people friends I know or I'll probably just get drunk one night and drink them all myself run out of beer wake up hungover that's it I'll show you what it looks like I am gonna let this cool down before I jar it and I'm gonna add some some whipped cream flavored vodka so I like whipped cream on my on my thigh so why not I'm gonna do half with whipped cream vodka half without we'll see how it turns out we'll do a taste test or something I'll show you a me cutting up this vanilla and put it in the jar here in a second all right I got up got the vanilla bean chopped up I'm gonna put one in each of these little here little tiny baby jars are really cool you don't want to hand out big jars of moonshine or any type of liquor around here cuz we'll drink every drop so I hide these for myself and some of my friends because they're a little crazy I put one in each one of those jars and I saved the bigger one to go into this if there's any left over which there should be plenty left over and I'm gonna put some vanilla or nut vanilla some whipped cream vodka Smirnoff and four of these say just about a quarter to third we don't want it to be too even though when I eat pie I use half a cup of whipped cream that's about right I'll show you can work one just cools down I'll start putting it in here I don't wanna put it in here hot because if you put it in her hot and then you put it in the fridge or the freezer he's charged the break so I'm gonna wait till it cools down for about about half an hour all right so we got a whole fist we got eight of these little jars and these are partly these four are partly whipped cream vodka and then everything left over after that I'm putting this apple juice jar so that's what's gonna get drink first around here I'm gonna try and put these up and forgetting where I put them I might get some more of these and just stop the fifth and some little ones hand them out as gifts really put the lids on him yet cuz they're still a little warm I guess it's safe to put the lids on him I just I know from Canon stuff that you can't put the lid on something when it's hot and put it in the freezer coz that jar will break I had to clean up a whole freezer worth of Wedding soup when I was a kid my dad made that's it apple pie moonshine next time I'm gonna make blueberry or pumpkin I think we're getting into the pumpkin spice season with all the basic [ __ ] out there I might do a pumpkin pumpkin pie moonshine or something and next time I got a friend that makes moonshine I might get something from him and these real moonshine instead of Everclear I know that 190s usually it's usually lost than most moonshines getting stronger than that and then did a poison again but I know how to test it I've been drinking this [ __ ] for years check out my other videos", "af8Zxlg3gos": "you alright guys well it's Friday night and let me tell you i am so glad he is because it has been the week from hell i have been working in my socks off those of you who watched the channels at Wrigley will know that I've mentioned that I've been off the booze because let alone our work and that's all kind of come to a head pretty much this week it's been like this I won't going to the exact specifics but let's just put it this way some cheeky bugger put on Twitter this week someone I don't know how I thought I'd like James Corden Joker's unnecessarily abuse but there you go that is just kind of week it's been but it's all behind me now things are going back to normal polishin didn't give a hungry Wednesday this week and in fact there has been quite a lot boobalay going on in the past week I just didn't have the time to do a video so we'll do a bit of a catch up next wednesday but that's not one here to do i mean as i said i have been ok i'll tell the truth largely off the drink I do have one during all my little episode if it gets like one last Saturday I cracked it was a fantastic day there are some great football on I'm sure this money you guys are they won't agree the settings to great especially the Chelsea boys out there but and yeah and I decide over caught up in the moment boil eggs cost was on that was pretty cool of some tunes so I had a few beers but apart from that loss at I haven't had a beautiful LOL i'm stopping that long really three weeks or so something like that so here we are friday night time to put all of the last few weeks behind me crack open a brew and i've been saving this one for this very moment and and this is Harry 369 manners sweet apple pie side of sweet and sour cider now part of reason I wanted to have this for like it's not quite yin to my survive sup abeba drink but and is because I remember when he did his fairy days sobriety challenge which was quite a long time ago now thinking was well it would have been last year but possibly new year before that I remember in that one of them yes youtube videos I've never seen was the hairy 369 back on the pop and he had one of my memories in that video so I thought I'd do the same except i'm not going to be doing it in my pants and i'll be doing in a slightly less dramatic fashion so here we are but put on the other part of the reason why i say this one is this is no turbo cider no ordering homebrew cider this is quite a first well is a first for me it's got it's a very special brew and because this is in fact homebrew cider made completely from scratch from apples and I've never had one of those before and never done one myself because it looks like a hell of a lot of hard work pressing those apples getting the juice out I know there's a few of you guys out they have come in but never got round to it myself when I remember when Harry is just before you send this to me he put a picture of this up on YouTube not YouTube Facebook and proper proper mouth-wateringly good in that picture and then when he sent me the other bruise the commercial bruise that he's been doing his brewery including this water cider for me very kind so thank you harry and really really been looking forward to this well what else can i say well you know he collected this from trees around by where he lives and there is a video if i remember i put the link to live not just go to his channel Harry boo 69 you'll know he is and if you're interested on how you make is he did it with a mixture of uses and yeasts even uses some people over drink it Oh laughing ec 1118 sided yeast and ferment is safe side of yeast so I believe that both dried side of years but use those and then left Italy mature for eight months that's quite you had a spoon around for a while any backs we've been with his boil down apple juice I think it's fizzy because it was a bit settlement in the bottom six point five percent medium dry so not talking skillman keep it I have been looking for a long long time they look swell carbonated absolutely crystal clear and I intend to keep it that way I mean it's really just pulling out now it's super super pale it almost reminds me of my Perry's I've seen and I went for a big loss I thought we'd be big enough but hey well I'm not going to cloudy up I'll come back for that lady i think but super well carbonated that is a beautiful sight that actually people and I can smell the apples from here hold that up magnificent that is achieve that that smells good that doesn't smell like any that doesn't smell ittf outside I've ever proved and if Julia binds me off it reminds me of em appetizer you know the soft drink appetizer on your OMA we really nice so cheers Harry cheers guys going for a little taste Bloody ell daddy-o undoubtably I've had some great terror signs do not get me wrong but I'm damnably that is miles it's the best not just hungry site that's one of the best cider something a little red that's really nice hey bro my face we at least got a nice sweetness to it but not too sweet nice little crunch it's got that proper video silent a stomachache it reminds one of my favorite commercial size is export Premier Cru and if you haven't tried it it's quite easy to get hold of it they've got in most supermarkets and get yourself a bond of that it's about to quit ababa one listed doing on a special but that's an exception cider this this reminds me of that in many ways and so many of you guys at Ryback you'll know pretty much what this tastes but because the alcohol is six and a half minutes i think the premier Cruise up in the seventh there's a little you know it's a little bit more palatable less alcohol burn on this big smoother really really really delicious I should have read save this for the summer but that's really nice m and there is absolutely zero none of that turbo side of time at all not even a small bit now the best side and I think i brewed is when I use the old Rosie Easter harvested that was pretty close to not having it alone but I think you could still probably tell it wasn't quite refined heard good things about the wlp 775 funnily enough I have got a bottle of a cider brewed with that from hand with homebrew which i'll do a taste and test on in the coming you know days wheat whatever and really looking forward to trying that one too to see how that yeast cuz you know how that turns out cause I've heard that really good gives really smooth finish but this has been brewed as I said with the mixture of the which slides it on so on that side the EC 1118 Elvin and the fermented cider and you would not know that at all there is absolutely no east eat when whatsoever bleiben so guys I'm people can I go on any longer about this perfect really good and it kind of makes me think you know if I can get my hands on some decent apples I don't don't have to look into it I don't know what sort of apples you need whether they need to be very sharp lines or sweet who knows I mean you guys can't even comment and tell me but I think maybe come on when you know apples are in sort of plentiful supply if I hit some cheap yeah I'm like this ago I know it looks like a lot of a hardware which is always what's put me off but blimey resolves are fantastic so choose Harry thank you very much for sending me this has not disappointed at all and to the rescue guys thanks for watching as always as i said hi bri wednesday hope feel i'll be back this week I've got plenty to update you on and so I speak to you in guys stay lucky over the weekend cheers you", "hWrFSGswXQQ": "oh hey have you been spilling to a stunning cocktail book much like this one and thought oh that's an amazing

people who's afraid of simple syrup or maybe you just want to learn how to make different flavors of simple syrup well you're all in luck today i'm going to show you how to make simple syrup simply and also the three most popular flavors of simple syrup in cocktail chameleon plus i'm going to show you two all natural sugar alternatives we've got a lot of work to do so let's get to it [Music] hey everyone it's mark addison welcome to our new bar basics series well we are breaking down all the basics of home bartending so that your drinks at home will be the best they can be and also make sure you tune in to our series shaking things up every week where we shake up a new cocktail or two and hit that subscribe button and notification because you'll be notified every time we post a new video so today on bar basics we're talking about simple syrup and it really is simple the basic proportions for simple syrup are one part sugar to one part water which you heat up just enough to melt the sugar and voila you have simple syrup simply you can also infuse your simple syrup with different flavors and also choose different types of sugars to ultimately make your syrups there are a number of sugars you can use you can choose a white granulated sugar or a natural turbinado style sugar or even a dark brown sugar but just be mindful of the type of sugar that you use because it'll deepen the flavor and the color of your syrup and ultimately affect the outcome of your cocktail and as you go up the spectrum of color of sugar you're going to be adding in caramelized flavors and even a darker deeper molasses flavor to your cocktail now you can also use sugar substitutes such as maple syrup or honey and today we're using our very own vermont pure maple syrup and our natural raw honey which is also available on our website now when it comes to flavoring your syrups you can use dried elements such as herbs and spices and you can also use fresh elements like lemon and lime peel and other citruses as well as an array of herbs and even ginger once your syrups are complete you'll need bottles to store them in i really like to reuse or upcycle spirit bottles like this little rum jug or a 375 flask style spirit bottle and i also like to use more professional style bottles when storing them in the refrigerator like these little hot sauce bottles or these taller juice bottles and don't forget to label your bottles so you know which syrup is which i also like to use a label maker and when i'm keeping them in the refrigerator or in a pinch a little masking tape and a sharpie marker will do just fine as always we'll be linking below the products that we use in our videos as well as the full recipe so make sure you go down there and check it out first i'd like to show you how you can make simple syrup very simply in the microwave so you'll take a half a cup of sugar pour it into a microwave safe glass like a masonry jar here and a half a cup of water so that's our one to one ratio you're gonna give it a little stir just to get the sugar off the bottom and then go ahead and pop it in the microwave set it for one minute and wait oh it's hot safety first oh much better there we have it simple syrup simply made in the microwave as easy as one two three our first flavored simple syrup is going to be the most popular simple syrup in cocktail chameleon the lemon lime syrup it has so many great uses from not only cocktails but iced tea and also a splash in some club soda will make your very own lemon lime soda pop we're going to use a pot on the stove for all of our flavored syrups because we want to bring the sugar and the water to just under a boil and then add our fresh ingredients let them steep and then we'll strain them into our bottles when they're finished so to start we're going to take a small pot with the lid again very important and to that i'm going to add a half a cup of water and then i have a half a cup of granulated sugar and we're using granulated sugar in the lemon lime simple syrup because we want to keep that bright citrus color without mutting it down with a darker and darker flavored syrup so i'm going to give that a stir just to combine the sugar and the water somewhat and then i'm putting it on the stove top uncovered for about five minutes five to ten minutes until it just comes up under a boil now our water and our sugar have come up to temperature and now we're going to add the peel of one lime and about half of a lemon so we're going to give that a little stir and then i'm going to put the lid on and let it sit for 20 minutes or let it cool down to room temperature and then your syrup is ready to bottle our cirrus has been sitting for about 20 minutes and it's pretty much cooled down to about room temperature so i think it's ready and it looks absolutely wonderful so to bottle it we're going to first strain it and i like to strain it into a measuring cup first because it makes pouring into the bottle much more clean and easy to do so we're going to take the contents of the pan and pour it through the sieve into the measuring glass and i'm just going to use a small spoon to encourage everything to come through and get every last drop of that delicious lemon lime syrup so to bottle our syrup i'm going to use a small funnel that fits into the neck of my bottle and just as a precaution i'm going to hold on to the funnel as i pour the syrup into the bottle and look at that gorgeous lemony lime color and trust you me it tastes as good as it looks all right we're going to give a little top and then we have the cap and our lemon lime simple syrup is all done and i highly recommend that you keep flavored syrups in the refrigerator because it keeps them fresher longer and you can enjoy them all throughout the seasons now we're going to make our apple pie spiced simple syrup and i'm making a larger batch because i'm going to be using this simple syrup and a video coming up on shaking things up where i'm making my baked apple martini so stay tuned for that now we're going to be using turbinado style sugar because we want a little bit more of a caramelization type flavor in our simple syrup and we're adding some bold dried spices to this simple syrup so we have about three quarters of a cup of turbinado style sugar and we have a variety of dried spices like four cinnamon sticks i have two vanilla beans that are cut in half and i have three star nice and eight cloves of garlic we're gonna be making this recipe on the stovetop again so i have a little bit larger style pot again with a lid very important and we're gonna take our sugar and put it into the pan and then we're gonna add three quarters of a cup of water which is equal part to sugar and water again next we're going to add our dry ingredients so i'm going to put all of the dried spices in here and we're putting them in in the beginning because they are dry they're going to take longer to impart their flavors in the syrup so we're going to let them simmer in the water and the sugar when it comes up to just under a boil so we're going to take it put the lid back on it and put it back on the stove for about five to ten minutes i allowed the syrup to sit on the stove just long enough so that the syrup came to just under a boil and then i left it covered and let it cool to room temperature and now we're ready to strain it so we're going to take our syrup and we're going to strain it again into a measuring cup through a fine metal sieve to get all of those spices strained through and it has this beautiful dark rich caramel color do the turbinado sugar and of course all of our delicious spices and now we're going to be using a large funnel again and we will just simply pour it in through the funnel into our bottle and i can see all the little bits of vanilla bean and spices filling through oh this delicious smelling syrup as well and here we have a adorable little flask filled with our apple pie spiced simple syrup all ready to use for our baked apple martini this simple syrup uses honey in place of sugar for our honey ginger simple syrup today i'm going to be using our very own vermont pure 100 natural honey that we collect here on our farm and we're going to be using three ounces of roughly chopped and peeled ginger to infuse into our honey and of course a little bit of water to thin it down just to make it a nice pliable syrup i have a pot that already has my honey in it and to that i'm going to be adding a half of a cup of water to about three quarters of a cup of honey because honey has a little bit of more of a liquid consistency already so we don't want to water down our syrup too much but we do need to loosen up the honey a little bit and we're going to add our three ounces of roughly chopped and peeled ginger so we're going to cover the syrup and then put it on the stove and bring it to just under a boil and then we're going to let it steep for 20 minutes and bring it down to about room temperature i allowed the honey water and ginger to come to just under a boil i covered it and allowed it to sit for about 20 minutes or till it came to room temperature i really want the ginger to sit in the honey syrup for as long as possible to really fully impart its gingery flavor into our honey ginger syrup now we're ready to strain it and pour it into our bottle so again i'm going to be using a measuring cup for this and a fine metal sieve and i'm going to pour the contents of the pot into the sieve and give it a good tap just to get all of the delicious honey gingery syrup out and then we're ready to bottle now we're ready to bottle our honey ginger syrup and i'm going to be using a small five ounce hot sauce style bottle today and a mini little funnel so i'm going to put the funnel in the bottle and hold on to it just as i pour the honey ginger syrup into the bottle so i don't knock the bottle over because it has happened before and we're going to fill the bottle all the way up to the top i like to use the honey ginger syrup and hot or cold tea and i also used it in four cocktails in cocktail chameleon including the green mary the bourbon ginger brew and the highlander collins as well as my version of an old fashioned the old pal so definitely check those out this flavored syrup uses another sugar alternative maple syrup this is my rosemary cider maple syrup recipe and it's a totally different syrup where we're replacing the water with apple cider vinegar this was inspired by our farm here in vermont and i'm using our rosemary that i've grown in the farmhouse garden and we're using our masavot farm 100 pure vermont maple syrup which we have available on our website and i'll put that link below and we're using a vermont apple cider that is 100 organic and unfiltered so that cider is going to cut back on the sweetness of the maple syrup and the rosemary is going to impart a nice deep herbaceous quality for my vermont inspired northeast kingdom punch that we're going to be featuring on shaking things up this week so definitely check that out to start we're going to add 2 cups of vermont maple syrup and to that we're going to add 1 cup of unfiltered apple cider vinegar and then we're going to add four tablespoons of roughly chopped rosemary and then we're gonna cover put on the stove and we're gonna allow it to come to just under a boil then we're gonna take it off the heat and let it steep for 20 minutes now i've allowed the rosemary cider maple syrup to steep for 20 minutes and it's come to about room temperature and we're ready to strain it and put it into our bottle so we're going to take the lid off and using a larger measuring cup today and a fine metal sieve we're going to strain out the rosemary from the syrup like so and again we don't want to press down on the herbs because it'll release more of the bitter flavor and there is a lot of rosemary going on in that maple syrup right now now we're ready to bottle our syrup but i'm using this old rum bottle i love the shape it reminds me of a maple syrup jug so i'm putting it into this bottle for a little bit of whimsy when i use it for my northeast kingdom punch this week we'll pop on our funnel and pour the rosemary cider maple syrup into our rum jug so here we have a nice jug of our rosemary cider maple syrup and it's all ready for the northeast kingdom punch that's coming up on shaking things up so stay tuned for that thank you so much for joining me today i really hope you picked up some tips on creating your own flavored syrups at home remember always start with a basic simple syrup it's great to have it around the house and then build with flavors like citrus peels and spicy ginger or dried herbs fresh herbs even florals they're great for not only cocktails but iced and hot beverages alike and stay tuned to shaking things up with mark addison because we're going to be using all of these syrups and upcoming cocktail videos and as always we're going to have all the recipes and product descriptions down below and if you'd like a copy of cocktail chameleon i'll even personalize it for you and you'll receive all of these recipes and so many more thanks again for joining me today if you like this video do me a favor hit that subscribe button right there we have a lot of video so here's what's coming up next", "sy1a3U_HLWY": "everyone threatening here so today I'm starting a new fermentation project and wanted to show you guys what I'm doing so I'm using these apples and I'm gonna make a batch of wild fermented hard cider so the first step is to juice here is my apple stash I've around 15 pounds and I'm trying to make one gallon the cider okay so here is what we have you can see this one here on the left is a lot clearer the second jar filled has a lot more sediment in it probably just from did research you still had a good amount of pulp in it so what I've done is I've just taken and ran it to your colander so I ended up with just shy of a gallon of fresh apple juice and use this fabric here now put it over the top of both with the rubber band and once or twice a day I'm going to come in and vigorously stir this in a couple of days we should have visible signs of fermentation so stay posted it's day three and I'm beginning to see signs of fermentation you can notice all the little bubbles forming this is a very big sign and see a few more bubbles in the inside here now we'll continue to stir each jar vigorously between like two to four times a day day four morning of day five I'm gonna rock these into a garli later today it's the afternoon of day five and both jars and I it's an active so we're gonna transfer the liquids from scare into this one gallon growler so we're just gonna pour it in the two calendars so we didn't have enough to fill up the one gallon jars we're actually gonna switch it to a half gallon there's too much airspace in here and you don't want that when it's fermenting just because we you know we didn't pour the stuff with the dead yeast into it so we had less liquid we'll go ahead and transfer that now pour it off some of the hard cider in here to mix in sugar so since we're doing half a gallon we're mixing in half a cup of cane sugar look to see where the liquid crosses the mouth markings right down there reading this is your starting gravity there's a 48 and attend some with the sugar it should be more right mm-hmm sounds to write down the gravity what is the grab it okay so now we'll make sure that the sweet sugar cider is cool enough okay we're at 82 degrees so we're good to mix it in this might be a little bit too full but we're just gonna roll with it throw the airlock on top okay so the next day checking in you can see we've got lots of active bubbling and these two are hard ciders that I made with store-bought pasteurized apple juice and I added commercial yeast into them and I think it's really cool to see the color differences so this one here I've actually done a secondary fermentation with ginger in it and then this one I'm gonna rack and do a secondary fermentation with those yeah this is looking great it's really working it's been 13 days since I rock this into here and we're still getting a lot of bubbling the airlock is bubbling like once every or twice every minute or so heard cider has really lightened in color from where it was when we first started it and I asked me it'll be another two weeks or so until it starts to slow down it has been 28 days since I started my wild fermented hard cider and you can see it's really slowed down at this point I think it's pretty much ready to be siphoned off and consumed it's been 24 days since I put it in this jar it's very very slowly still bubbling it's time for me to go ahead and rack it so it's been 29 days since I first began this cider I'm just gonna transfer it into the southern half gallon jar right here okay so here is my half gallon of wild fermented hardside now I just need to give it a taste oh wow this is definitely the best one I made so farts in flavor it's way superior to the ones I added the actual commercial yeast - it's like tart sour is sort of but kind of dry that I'm not a expert at describing flavors but I will definitely drink this happily and I'm just happy to report that you know it started with a bunch of apples you juice them and here at the end of it you can have a delicious homemade hard cider without buying any commercial use or anything like that so I hope you guys give this a try I'm very happy with these results now I have a half gallon to drink and be merry so cheers you guys and I hope you give this ferment a try", "OfvkLoZtO8g": "hello to our fabulous internet friends and welcome back to Blue Frog bars on this gorgeous spring day here in the UK we're going to be showing you today how to quickly very quickly create an incredible song a drink and you are

day and we'll be back later in the week with there's some more incredible drinks for you see you later", "V9dU57uOmQ8": "alright I'm feeling pretty silly today so I thought I'd make a silly video now lately I've been seeing lots of advertising for hard apple cider or Apple ale so being the sucker for advertising that I am I thought I would try a couple of these drinks and maybe do a sort of like a taste-off or in this case an apple off so the three most prevalent advertisers right now in this space are Strongbow which has some pretty cool advertising that features a nice beach a couple and a slow-motion horse that's pretty cool I don't know what a slow-motion horse has to do with apple cider how do you like those apples so the second variation is the angry orchard the angry orchard is pretty cool just the name itself angry orchard that was pretty cool they have like this old guy and he looks all hard and angry again not so sure what that has to do with drinking an apple cider but hey and the third choice and I think the most prevalent advertising you're gonna see out there is Redd's Apple ale the highlight of their commercials is somebody pulverizing an apple now they have strawberries that they're pulverizing that goes back to that guy I think his name was Gallagher who used to hit the watermelons on stage there's something cool about watching an apple explode that stays in your mind so advertising does work those are the three most popular advertisements for the apple cider segment and they got me alright so I'm gonna do the apple off taste test but I see how these three Apple drinks compare side-by-side between drinks between testing I'm gonna have ladies bill pickle chips to kind of cleanse the palate so I can get a sense of how they stack up let's get going I'm gonna start with the angry orchard first so there's the bottle now it's a brown bottle so you're not seeing the nice and bur few of the drink well it's cool about this bottle is if you're kickin it with friends that are beer drinkers and you want to do something different but you don't want everybody calling you out pull up one of these it looks like kind of like well one of those independent beer distributors angry orchard now to get into the angry mood I'm gonna bring out my hat and I'm gonna make the angry look alright angry face so it has like a beer smell with a hint of apple it goes this is pretty good definitely taste in the Apple there's just a hint of alcohol in fact all these 5% alcohol by volume so you're not getting hammered with alcohol not too sweet not sweet at all actually but you definitely taste the Apple upfront angry orchard pretty good tasty I'd enjoy this out with the guy if I didn't want to have beer learn something crisp and refreshing alright that's on the board very good cleanse the palate number two Redd's Apple ale nice old school graphic some gold everybody likes gold plain old school retro look about it nice amber hue Apple ale all-natural apple flavor and caramel color heart let's take a crack at this alright now this doesn't smell like a beer a very sweet smell to it five percent alcohol by volume again okay Wow again there's not a heavy alcohol taste doesn't taste like a beer to me it's very like very faint even the Apple is kind of suppressed in this so I'm not getting as much Apple as the angry orchard crisp refreshing that's something I would have on like a summer day spring day there's a fait apple taste upfront more sour than the angry orchard all right it's in the clubhouse let's go for the third variation the strong Bo and for the strong Bo's segment gonna have to go see a man about a horse now this is a medium art I don't have a big budget for special effects and all that jazz but I do have a buddy that has a pony just might work and his name is Sparky buddy what some Strongbow no all right I don't think Sparky was enjoying the looks of the Strongbow but I'm ready to test it out I like the packaging here it's nice and simple nice amber hue again honey apple flavor with a picture of a bee which is always nice again 5% alcohol by volume but this says hard cider so let's see how hard it is all right this smells like a nice blossom come on bro all right this spells nice and sweet sit down this smells nice and sweet like a blossom I'm ready to taste it let's go of the three you definitely taste the alcohol it's got a very fruity very sweet but it has a very fruity very sweet taste upfront and then you're hit with that alcohol kind of feel so if you like if you really want to know you're having some alcohol this is the one to go with definitely it has a harder taste Strongbow so this is gonna be an interesting decision here do I want something that's fruity and strong something that has a little bit of a sour note or something that tastes the most like an apple cider with the benefit or the added benefit of alcohol alright guys from my 7 dollars and 75 cents come on I'm going with the angry orchard hard cider nice crisp refreshing up front ever slight hint of alcohol makes for a nice day go with the angry orchard but try all three take it from the average guy I told you this was gonna be a silly video today let me know what you think about Redd's Apple ale the angry orchard or Strongbow hard cider as always thanks for watching drink responsibly and I'll see you next time you", "3G0tuO_JtZ0": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's my friend [Music] [Music] for our suits big E's so bye for now comes in tablet and now we are gonna put in our eats nutrient lake [Music] so this is one level teaspoon of the each nutrient per gallon forms of the forever [Music] so that is how we get east and straight and then we're gonna put the patties or lakes in which you definitely supervisor you only slightly be clear because I have a lot affected in them I'm a tiger is warm level teaspoon per gallon [Music] so just stay with us paralyzed [Music] all right cubism nemesis we need to do [Music] so this Saturday will do from $1 to $5 so we'll sit ups whistle the whole thing on top as it reads next week on top because each to like the oxygen so we're just gonna leave that on top and wick is gonna pull the lid back on [Music] it's not just gonna use this about basically order does this just go over it [Music] I'll just eat beer [Music] and then we'll close by in and then we'll leave this now for a week this will be a quite a big rest fermentation or percolate so with a frog for quite a lot and that's the reason why you don't want to fly too high in the bucket you wanna keep the liquid quite loads give it room to experiment [Music] so we'll come back a week the dog that's they're dating this fake three [Music] cigarettes for man and then we're just gonna do it again [Music] [Music]", "iIriESwXy2c": "[Music] hey I'm Ryan I'm the cider maker here at angry orchard today we're making cider for us cider making starts in the orchard at harvest time for testing fruit for sugar acidity and tannin here in New York the season is basically September to November we use some fruit off our own orchard specifically Rome apples and then we also pressed some Baldwin apples and some Rhode Island greening apples from around New York State somethings apples stay on the tree a little bit longer they develop more complex aromas and higher sugar sometimes we'll be picking fruit right off the tree and sending it right through the press we also will store fruit and cold storage and that'll allow some use the fruit kind of into February and March so the first step in our process is dumping apples into a sorting tray what we're trying to do here is just get a visual inspection it's the first part of ensuring a quality cider we want to know if the apples are in good shape or you know they're a little rotten like this one and if so we toss it to the side so the apples go through they get a basically get a shower and are cleaned by the brushes that you can see spinning and there's a second wash they get to soak in water so we get rid of any stone sticks anything that might be on the apples and before it goes up the elevator we get a final wash right here to really clean the apples up mmm next we go up the elevator and we're going to mill the apples into pulp so what comes out is basically an apple mash and we that through the press the belts fighting over the pulp and squeeze all the juice out and we see come out on the back end as pumice and that's what's left over after we removed all the juice takes is about a half an hour to process a bit of apples and that gives us somewhere between 60 and 80 gallons of juice we just got done pressing and filling this tank with juice this particular cider is going to be fermented wild or native or natural we're not going to pitch any yeast into it so the yeast that will bring it to dryness is on the Apple skins in the air from the orchard that's really an expression of terroir of this place then we also play around with different wine yeasts different combinations of wine yeast different fermentation times temperatures it's sort of limitless what we can do in the cellar and we're always looking for new and interesting ways to ferment after about a month and a half to two months we'll have a dry cider at that point the cider is destined for oak so we'll take it out of this tank and we'll age it in some oak barrels so the cider that you saw us making a few months ago has finished out in tank and been aging in these used wine barrels for the last couple months these barrels gave the cider an opportunity to kind of develop and mature and turn into an interesting and complex cider so it's got an unfiltered character to it still still pretty cloudy we'll probably end up filtering this it's got some really nice wild fermentation character a little bit of funk a little bit of phenolic like a nice bitter sweet apple aroma [Music] it's totally dry at the moment definitely we'll do some blending on the back end with this but all in all are really nice Snyder the next thing is to get it to drinkers we're kegging on those kegs go pretty short distance from our keg machine here in Walden to our tapped room here in Walden and then we also bottle some of this cider and it's available in our in our bottle shop in Walden and Walden only so come visit us Cheers you [Music]", "QyCeAVNMRXA": "today we are trying out the angry orchard hard cider we've tried the Reds apple cider was it apple cider just reds Redd's Apple ale now we're trying out the angry orchard and now this comes in at 5% alcohol by volume and they're out of Walden New York okay now they're out of New York is that why the apples are angry or does the farmer say you love the Lord worthy love you okay anyways five percent alcohol by volume we tried that the angry orchard in a mixed drink that we had with whiskey but we never tried the angry orchard it was but we never tried this we got this where'd we get this I think we got a corner store for like 10 bucks for a six-pack you can boy for 30 minutes yeah so we got it was like $10 for six-packs not that bad 5% alcohol by volume that's not that bad so we're gonna try this bad boy out yes and the smells kind of like apple juice just no one tasted more like rotten apple juice now this has a nice Apple smell to it in fact it smells like the green apples even though it shows a red apple doesn't it oh really to your teeth right you're supposed to smell it then try not just okay did you smell it before you drink it you did what if it does smell really Apple II and and they're right it smells like a rich Crisp apple it's a little bitter and tart but the app will come I know you're almost done with yours luckily we've bought a six-pack it's it's a little bitter little sour but that's expected in an apple so I was right and it's got a red one on yeah you can get a little hint of the alcoholic taste but it does taste like a good apple it's not like super sweet it's just the right amount of sweet just the right amount of tart and bitter to give you that you just ate apple taste do dog bag at me these are kind of tart though that's pretty close the apples a little sweeter yeah a hare know if you add just a slight hint of alcohol to this know the rest tastes like bad apple juice yeah yeah I like this one oh you like it too that's amazing we had to buy the six pack to get one because we bought it at the corner market so now you can enjoy the rest yeah that is good I can see why people like that cuz I like it you like it we hate him angry [Laughter] do you think they're pissed off because I have their cousins like right next to him no pretty decent I can drink this no problem so you know what would be good injecting this into ham or something like when we have our barbecues or because to make them all juicy and stuff like that assistant inject an apple bang we got angry ham oh yeah pork roast Oh anyways that's what we got for today that is the angry orchard hard cider Crisp apple and it's a five percenter clock volume and they are out of Walden at New York we're doing them angry alright here I'll piss them off even more there we go I'm gonna drink that now leave it alone don't touch my stuff alright see you guys next Friday", "NTSVS7bdJiQ": "right here we're making seven quarts of apple pie filling so I cut 24 cups of apples and the reason is 24 not 28 is because you don't fill the jars all the way full so you don't want 4 cups of sliced apples in each one you want about three three-and-a-half so we got these apples all peeled cored and sliced up and we soaking them in water and cider vinegar to keep them from browning too much and over here my daughter is getting these filling ready and in that pan is four and a half cups of sugar one cup of cornstarch two teaspoons of cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 1 teaspoon of salt and now we have to add 10 cups of water to it and you don't turn on the burner until you start adding the watch so we're going to turn on the burner and that's only six cups so she needs four more cups in there and in the meantime I'm getting the canner of water ready because it takes so long for it to get hot you get the canner of water starting to get hot now so my daughter is going to I guess not going to what my daughter's is she's better on the camera than I my daughter is going to stir that until it gets thick and bubbly and after it gets thick and bubbly we will come back and let you know what we do with the with the sauce and the apples okay look you back at you a few minutes okay now this is thick and bubbly as you can see it's thick and bubbly now you add some lemon juice I just don't measure it this keeps it preserved and nicely colored we stir that in and now we are going to put it in jars I put the Apple of the sliced apples in jars and you don't want to fill it all the way to the ring because they will pack if they're over full so just just down below where the first ring is and now you just take this apple pie filling can you pour it over there we go then you take a knife to get all the air bubbles out of that and then you want it a little bit fuller than that you want to all covering right about to them and wipe the top off in case any filling dripped on that clean out then you put the lid on then you put the ring on just tight but not real tight and then you put it in the water and we're going to do that to all 7 quarts then you let it water back once it starts boiling again let it water bath for half an hour 30 minutes and then you take it out and when they are all done this is what they look like and these all sealed to know what they seal you push the top and they're all sealed let them set for 12 hours before you move them because if you move them before the 12 hours they may pop up again to where they're not sealed so this is it so then you make some pie crusts grab a couple of these and you'll make an apple pie delicious okay my daughter and I will see you later", "HAcLmMF6Y2o": "now I'm ready to make my apple pie filling I'm just going to add these apples some brown sugar lemon juice we'll cinnamon and some nutmeg I'll give all of this a quick stir after this I'm going to cover it and let it braise for about 20 minutes then once they're tender I'll turn off the heat take off the lid and let them cool and once they're cooled I'm going to stir in some cornstarch the cornstarch is just going to thicken all of these braising juices great making caramel doesn't have to be tricky let me show you the simplest method that I found today I'm starting by using some brown sugar butter corn syrup and salt I'm using a heavy four quart saucepan for this which i think is the safest way to make caramel now we just need the corn syrup and then I'll turn on the heat great so I'm going to turn it on to medium heat and here is the most important trick about caramel you only want to stir it for the first two to three minutes of cooking so all of these ingredients can combine after that stop stirring and let it go for nine minutes over this medium heat you'll see around that time that'll be that beautiful golden brown caramel color okay it's been nine minutes and you can see that this caramel is bubbly and golden and beautiful it's great so I'm just going to turn off the heat and take this entire pan over here before I stir in the cream and because this can bubble in sizzle I'm just going to start by pouring in half my cream first just to be safe oh my gosh it smells so amazing I love that there's brown sugar in this caramel recipe it just adds this other depth of flavor we can just stir in the rest now now I'll just let this cool a little bit before I mix it in with my apples", "1BCTxxyF-Cc": "[Music] well hi knick-knackers alright so I thought I'd bring you guys along for something that I just got done making a couple of days ago and I thought it was absolutely amazing it's so good very potent so you have to be very careful with it but something that I am definitely gonna make again beginning to be handing out for Christmas gifts I think and what that is is apple pie moonshine so the recipe that I used called for a lot of juice a lot of cider a lot of sugar and a lot of alcohol I kind of modified it a little bit and I am a sweet alcohol drinker I don't like a really intense alcohol flavor I want to hardly even be able to taste the alcohol Eric on the other hand is the opposite he felt like the drink was too sweet and didn't have enough of the alcohol flavor in it so what I'm going to be doing today is I'm going to be making a different recipe that has a little bit less sugar and less juice so that more of the alcohol flavor comes through I don't know if I'm gonna enjoy it but I think that Eric will enjoy it more and I do have some people that said that they were interested in trying it who also voiced that they thought that they might like a lower sugar content one so that's what I'm going to be doing today so I will link the website where I'm getting this apple pie moonshine recipe from and I'll also link my original that I just did a couple days ago let me turn off the dishwasher um now I will tell you that I'm gonna modify this one and I modified the last one as well and I'll tell you how I modified them so the this recipe will call for a gallon of apple cider and just one quart of apple juice where the rest see I did the other day called for an entire gallon of apple juice so what I'm gonna do first is I'm going to put in my court of apple juice and we're gonna get that heating I honestly am Not sure in fact I might not even heat it up because when I made it last time um I didn't heat it up and everything really melded together nicely I don't feel like heating it up as a necessity that's more for just getting the sugar to dissolved but if you stir it enough the sugars gonna dissolve so I I don't know if you're in a hurry to make it don't feel like you have to heat it up because I don't think that you do I did not heat up my last batch and it turned out fantastic so there is my quarterback of juice you know what I might just for the sake of the video go ahead and get it up so it the recipe calls for you to heat up the apple juice and the apple cider together what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna heat up the apple juice and the sugar all together and get that done and then cool it off with the apple cider that way we can get this go in and I can get everything jarred up and done so once this is heated up let's see we can throw in a couple of other things I need three cups of brown sugar [Music] so I also I'm going to need one cup of white sugar so I'm gonna get my cup of white sugar here and get that in and then post four three cups of the brown sugar and it doesn't say if it should be packed down or not that's normally when you see unless he's calling for brown sugar it says packed so I'm packing it there's a little bit of space left in there so let me get my other alright there's the three cups and I'll get my ladle here to kind of stir it around now the other thing I'm going to do that was not listed in either one of these recipes but you know this is called apple pie moonshine and to me apple pie calls for spices so what I did with my last faction I'm gonna do with this one is I added a quarter teaspoon of allspice so I'm gonna do that and I added a quarter teaspoon of ground nutmeg so I'm gonna do that as well brand new one and this is supposed to make six ports so we'll see how it's only noon and it makes me want to drink already it is really good I hope you guys give this a try and all I'll have to bring you back and for a taste test and see if there's really a difference between either one or which one we like better I have a feeling they're gonna be pretty similar just because other than one having more apple juice well and actually you know it's weird because with the gallon of apple juice and the gallon of cider that I did I I added extra alcohol so that probably makes up for it I don't know we'll have to see we'll have to see like I said I'm gonna do a taste test and I'm gonna link you to both of the recipes that way you can decide which one you want to do or maybe you want to modify it a little bit yourself okay so now what we're gonna do we got that in sugar is pretty much melted we're gonna move this over off the heat and I'm gonna go ahead and pour in my apple cider now the apple cider it calls for a full gallon of apple cider so we get to go ahead and put this whole thing in and you're probably wondering why I'm just not using my home canned apple juice that I just did the other day and I just didn't want to I just can't it and I just wanted to use this so that's what I'm doing but you know what if you have your home canned stuff and that's what you want to use then go ahead and use honk and stuff all right Oh mmm now the important part before you add any alcohol you need the pot to cool down you need to let it set be patient and let it come down to room temperature because if you put alcohol in with too much of the the hot stuff that alcohol will just evaporate right off so what I'm gonna do is I am it's like 50 degrees outside right now so I am gonna put the lid on this and I'm gonna set this outside and let it cool and once it comes time for the alcohol I'll bring it back in here and we'll move on to the next step the mixed is now at about room temperature maybe a little cooler than that I had it setting outside for an hour and a half two hours and it's nice and cool to the touch now so adding the alcohol will be just fine so the recipe calls for a bottle of Everclear so I was able to find this bottle it is the 190 proof what I've read says that if you your state doesn't have the 190 that you can use the 151 but I have the 190 so we're going to go ahead and add that alright there's that and now what I did last time that I'm not gonna do this time is I added a full bottle of vanilla vodka and a whole bottle of the same size and section 750 ml spiced rum so the recipe that I'm following today cause for a cup of spiced rum and then it says but two cups tastes good too so what I decided to do was I think I like because when you're making an apple pie you usually put vanilla in with your apple pie so I'm gonna put a cup of the spiced rum and a cup of the vanilla vodka instead of a second cup of the spiced rum [Music] another thing that I did different with this recipe then when it calls for is this actually calls for you to put these cinnamon sticks in with the mixture as it's heating up and I'm not gonna do that what I'm gonna do is I'm going to stick a cinnamon stick in every jar and just leave it in there that's what I did with the last batch I did put it in but I of course I already told you I wasn't mixing this warm now I will say I did use oh that's the difference - I told you that already the gallon of the cider versus the gallop the gallon of apple juice so the apple juice gives it a more cleaner look I guess and I'll show you what I mean by that so what I did was I filled it to about an inch of head space a little bit over no biggie and then since we're not canning this we can just put a lid on it and there it is now according to what I've read there's a cinnamon stick in there according to what I've read this is shelf stable and as it sits it needs to sit for about a month or so and then it will kind of mellow out a little bit that alcohol flavor so let me I'm gonna get a spoon because I kind of like to try that right now and see if I like the flavor this one actually does have quite a bit more of the alcohol flavor it's good don't get me wrong it is very good and I think with the cinnamon stick in there and it having some time to really permeate the the moonshine will be very very tasty but it definitely to me has a little bit more of a alcohol flavor to it which is really weird because with the other batch I put in more of the spiced rum and vanilla vodka but it's very tasty I honestly I don't think that you could go wrong with either recipe so with that I'm gonna continue fly wants to get a little buzzed I'm gonna filling these up and Oh before I do that let me show you there's that jar I'll grab the one not the one but a one out of the fridge just so I can show you the difference between the two both of them are very very good I think I preferred this one just because there's not quite as much of an alcohol flavor to it it's a little bit sweeter but they're both very tasty and like I told you the Apple more the apple juice kind of clears it up a little bit the only difference with this one I'm not so sure that this one would be shelf-stable I am not quite sure just because of the gallon of juice although I did use more of the alcohol maybe it would be okay but I'm with this one I'm following the recipe that was posted this one I kind of wind it a little bit more and I did actually end up I think I had more apple juice or cider than what called for in the recipe and I wasn't paying attention and I added it all in so I am leaving this in the fridge but this one I'm just gonna keep on the shelf so anyway there's that I'm gonna continue filling these up and I will show you what it looks like when I have all the jars filled and let you know just how many I got out of this there we go we got seven jars and just a smidge left in the pot there and what we'll do with that is I'll just end up putting it in one of the jars that is open in the fridge that needs to be added to it and that should be just fine well there you go I will make sure that I link both of the recipes that I used and if you guys have made this let me know if you think you're going to try it let me know I'll tell you I don't think you can go wrong either way thank you so much for watching have a great day", "LAUCVZprnEQ": "[Music] hey it's John at Mike brew - dudes calm and today we're well I got a cider I have a cider to try but this isn't any other cider I made cider every every year for a couple of years now and this year now that I have a kegging system I think I finally cracked the cider code because well because I think I've started off with good juice I think I've had good fermentation practices but the thing about fermentation in cider is it's very hard to pinpoint exactly where you want to be and if you bottle condition your cider it's hard to get carbonated cider and back Sweden - and or even just any kind of flavor adjustment that you have to make I'm getting excited where this is going so so this time around this year because I caked I was able to ferment down to where I thought you know I was tasting towards like the end of a two-week period and when I felt the taste was exactly where I wanted to be just not carbonated I stabilized it as they say and the old cider making world is yeah I actually used sulfites for the first time ever and then some potassium sorbate as well to help preserve to kill the fermentation yeah and then I did so actually there's some the other thing that I did cuz I was I was in a rush I don't know I just was impatient I wasn't in a rush it was just impatient I got some sparkle oyd and that clarified that cider like mad now your and see that camera yeah your yeah so that's the whole new frontier behind everything because I so we started this videos you know talking I get too excited but I still source the juice from the same place I always Soares it this wonderful farm in Amesbury Massachusetts side Hill farms and the juice that you get from that place I mean unfermented just out of this world really good stuff it's funny I I always go through the line with six gallons of the stuff like five gallons per men like one for drew me yeah before the drinkin right away and I love when the cashier is I mean like what do you do with all that cider you know what I'm doing so I got the juice in the same place but and the and I put in some use nutrient before fermentation and I used a just an American ale yeast safe a low five I've used other ones in the past I've used nottingham yeast and then like a read some articles that you know wine Easter I really taken up for people who really get into you know dry cider and stuff like that but I've always stayed with beer Issa I know that some people say like oh there's like a beer aftertaste to it oh I lost that question of you later but I never picked that up so I thought it was just fine and I like the way that it ferments the juice because it does leave some residual sweetness without me interfering with the final fermentation anyway so really when wasn't it was it was pretty much 95% the way there that's when I intervened killed the fermentation with a couple of additives and then I like cold crashed it and then put Sparkle air in it and you know in a week everything just settled out and it was crystal clear and then I've transferred that to the cake and then carved it up and I just put them in these bottles to bring over to your house today so that is my big cider reveal for you the audience and for Michael sir what do you think of what you're tasting here I just I'm kind of really I'm very happy about this because the signers in past there's just been something off about them like they weren't sweet enough they didn't have like a good balance like maybe they were really busy but they were they lacked flavor there's some do you know what the gravity was when you sort of shut it down it was it was you know right - it was like you know one point zero zero if not a little bit lower than that I did not take an original gravity reading I was just pouring all the jugs into that big fermenter and away we went so would you call this semi dry uh yeah yeah cuz it's not it's not really sweet but but it's not I think the fact that because you're able to sort of capture whatever was left before really dried out to that point nine something range yeah and so I shut it down at that point which could easily be done we just by cold crashing as long as you were always taking it or something right if people at home didn't want to use sulfates or something that yeah I've got no problem that I think it's great um I just want something brave I think there's just something maybe it's a nice interplay between this juice when it's fermented and still having some of the original juice as the sweetener as the backing yeah as opposed to back sweetening with table sugar or honey or something like that it's you know maybe you get a nice blend versus the juice but this is this is all in itself so I think it's a pretty wonderful balance between being crisp and super drinkable and is the Apple character is like fresh apple yeah like almost Granny Smith like I there's a little bit of uh like the acidity isn't isn't the procedure City isn't isn't bad but it's it mean is it high but it's it's brightness Chris I get like almost a little bit of like a like a grape or like a green melon quality element to which I it's still 80% Apple it has a little bit of a sudden yester profile that came through so that's a nice tannin at the in the aftertaste to that I did not add anything to get that yeah I know that a lot of my some apples skin there yeah I think a lot of people do put in some lick tannins or yeah you know dry powder tannin yeah you're right when my mother used to make up a pie and she would she peeled the apples I would always eat the Apple skins was just a little bit up and that's what you guys whatever yeah it's really nice the width is us l5 I mean I think that's a man it's a workhorse yeast and I don't get any beer equality out of this at all well that's the thing that I've read online them I think it's dry and it tastes good I don't know I don't know I I would bet if you put this in competition in the cider competition I'd be interesting to see if anybody picked that up made that type of comment yeah but I don't think it's there I don't think it's very beautiful well I'll try it you know I think that maybe now that I have the capability to carbonate without needing to add sugar and bottle carb condition up that maybe this is where I start using cider specific yeast rings like that start experimenting yeah and see how that goes because I've used those in the past and I wasn't happy with them and I've used champagne yeast and I've used to other align these strains that wasn't happy with those either but maybe this is where you start playing around with it you can definitely make good cider totally serviceable cider completely naturally fermented bottle conditioned just the way nature intended it but it's great now to employ a little technology a little new hardware yeah that you've already invested in for beer making into this process and now you can make something better I remember I was either a podcast or an article I read drew Beecham talks about I think in his cider but he's a tall guy Siders he always says in that book that great cider is made after the firm right you can smell about adding whatever his feeling is that you can almost have any quality apple juice ferment it and then it's what you do that afterwards or terms of either back sweetening or ya aging it or adding other flavors to it that makes something great but this I mean that aside this is just the juice fermented captured at the right that's it man so just a little bit about these bottles I don't know if you guys have seen these but they're just gross style like high carbonation they've got like a very strong cap to it heavy I made by Otis classic I got this you can find them on amazon.com but they also make some kind of whipped cream dispenser but these are pretty so where's the whispering what I was looking for Otis class icon on Amazon and that was coming up I was like that's interesting Grolsch style bottles you can find these are funds on 16 ounces I get a bunch of them and thinking like maybe when we get that that's our beer going and we blend and then you know highly carbonate yeah I mean the other the only dream is like the cork um and then like do the wire cake and all that I mean we can give these a go as well I mean they're they're heavy they're already heavy here strong nice cool alright that's what I got what do you think I think it's great I mean it was great to have cider on tap for Thanksgiving that was that was priest it was pretty cool you know and you know even though there was plenty of things drink like harbour sail yeah and this I even ran out to the store bought cider because it was Thanksgiving easier like I needed some sadder yeah that's great alright so there you go so I think the key to making cider home is to keg it that's what I learned I mean I just had really mixed results really makes results with bottle carbon dating anybody makes results your sliders in the bathroom pretty good well yeah yeah I didn't think good like really good not to humble brag I just I did win a medal at the I'm a man home brewing kasi first I see yeah not like that say anything deal but yeah but I just never I'd never was personally happy with him I think that's the big deal is that yeah I never was like this is great and I really feel differently about this I feel like this I had it like you taste it as the fermentation ends and then I packaged it and I taste and I say to myself yes I finally fulfilled the promise of what I had yeah every other time I put it in the bottle and waited a couple weeks open it would go yeah you know that's my reaction like it just didn't work out so alright well thanks a lot for watching appreciate your time your effort and please subscribe like and or comment below I know that ciders aren't really for everybody I know this is kind of like a home brewing beer type thing but we're about for minimal right yeah cheese fermentable yeah coming soon cheese dudes calm all right pradana my brew - dudes calm brew on chairs", "16JK34-WiGA": "Hi I'm Tricia an organic gardener I grow\norganically for a healthy and safe food supply for\na clean and sustainable environment for an enjoyable and rewarding\nexperience Hard apple cider is a traditional early\nAmerican and European drink thats easy to make I'll show you how To\nmake hard cider you're gonna need the following two glass gallon jugs or polyethylene\nbuckets a stopper an airlock four to six feet of plastic\ntubing an auto siphon brewing yeast and brown\nsugar or honey Optional tools to have on hand would be a\nwing capper and a hydrometer This beer brewing kit\ncontains all the equipment that you'll need including the optional equipment If you want to make\ncider with your own apples check out our video on making sweet apple cider for\ndetails on processing apple's and blending the flavors Making hard\napple cider can be really easy or it can be as technical as making a\nfine wine Today we're going to use a process that's a little bit\nmiddle-of-the-road but where the cider still tastes really\ngood Everything that comes in contact with your cider must be cleaned and\nsanitized use an iodine rinse-less sanitizer like\nthis Star San Iodine is more effective than bleach and it won't give your cider an off\nflavor make sure and follow the instructions exactly The old fashion way to make cider\nrelies on the native yeast already present on the apple's but that can yield inconsistent results\nand sometimes your native yeast taste great but sometimes it doesn't We will be using this Nottingham ale yeast\nto make our cider taste great To start out you'll need one gallon of apple\njuice without preservatives and if you can\nfind one from a local farm stand thats even better if it's not pasteurized\nyou'll have to pasteurize it You can pasteurize your homemade sweet\ncider by heating it up to one hundred and sixty degrees fahrenheit and then cooling it Don't let it go over\none hundred eighty-five degrees fahrenheit because that will give it a cooked apple\nflavor The Nottingham is a dry yeast so I need to rehydrate it before adding\nit to my cider Add one ounce of yeast per gallon of cider to four ounces of warm water To liven up the\nyeast let it sit for fifteen minutes Now that\neverything's clean and sanitized this is the time that your hydrometer\ncan help you brew If you've pasteurized your juice once its cooled you can check the specific gravity it\nshould be between 1.045 and 1.050 if its lower then 1.045 it won't be stable you can add 2.25 ounces of brown sugar\nor honey to bring it up to five points This gives\nyou a cider with about six percent alcohol Pour your cooled and pasteurized sweet\ncider with the yeast into your primary fermenting container Try to aerate the juice as much as possible at this point putting your air lock and stopper that\nyou filled with sanitized water After putting the airlock stopper in it's\ntime to let the fermenting begin the yeast will do its job Just store the juice\nfor about two and a half weeks in a cool even temperature location: Our cider has turned into hard cider so\nnow it's time to rack it into a secondary fermenter and this is going to be done at 1.005 on the hydrometer A few days ago I put\nmy cider up on the counter to make sure that I don't get any\nsediment when I rake the cider Make sure you clean and sanitize everything that youre gonna be using for\nracking Attach your tubing to the auto siphon and then put the\nother end into your sterilized fermenting jar Start the siphon and\nwatch carefully leave about an inch of cider above the\nsediment don't be greedy or you could ruin the whole batch and put a little in a glass to taste You\nalso want to set some aside so that you can test the alcohol level After sterilizing the airlock and\nstopper your gonna put it in the secondary\nfermenting jar At this time give your cider a taste it should be strong and\nbitter at this time it's gonna go through\nlactic fermentation to mellow without all the sediment You can let it\nmellow for one to two months or you can rack it again after that and\nlet it age for three to four months The minimum before bottling is three weeks When it comes to bottling you have options\nyou can leave it as a still dry cider like I'm gonna do or you can add a\nsweetener and carbonation and there's instructions on how to do\nthat on our blog Sterilize the bottles that you're going to use you can use beer bottles as long as\nthey're not the twist of twist on type If your doing a still cider you can use these nice swing top bottles\nYou wanna rack your cider one more time and don't worry if it's a little bit\ncloudy that's just natural apple goodness Once you've finished racking\nthe cider fill your bottles leaving one inch of headspace Plant a pear or apple tree make some hard cider and grow organic\nfor life    ", "bWxYuhK1kA4": "tonight i have a special treat and literally a special treat tonight we are making juice pie what is juice pie sounds so strange what it is is a concoction for people like me who love to enjoy apple pie but can not stay in those soft mushy apples so tonight i'm going to teach you how to make something that tastes just like apple pie but without the apples hence the word juice pie and as you can see thanks to my dad i want to give a shout out to reginald mccoy for my special embroidered coat masterchef jelly only video so without further ado let's get started okay guys we are back had to change out of my jacket didn't want to get anything messed up but i want to give a special shout out to mrs bridget and her son ronald thank you so much for my apron they made this for me and they always make the video watch the videos i really appreciate it so we're going to get started juice pie first and foremost you are going to need some pie crust frozen pie crust from the grocery stores i bought marine calendars doesn't have to be murray calendars you're also going to need some apple juice okay simply apple's good because simply apple juice is good all right then you're going to need a half a stick of butter i mean excuse me a full stick of butter i have two little fourth sticks you're going to need some lemon juice you're going to need some ice cream you're going to need some corn you're also going to need cinnamon and nutmeg and last but not not least you cannot forget about the sugar the exact measurements will be below in the comments okay so make sure to check that out so let's get it started okay guys so first and foremost we're going to take out our pie crust you'll heat the pie crust to whatever the directions specify these say to 400 degrees so first and foremost what you have to do for a pie crust is you don't want the dough to rise so you have to stick little holes all in the pie crust to prevent the dough from rising too high when you cook it you want it to be a nice flat pie crust after i finish doing this to the pie crust i'm then going to add my apple juice my cornstarch my cinnamon my nutmeg my sugar my lemon juice i'm gonna add it all together in here okay now once you've got the ingredients in which are below in the comments section when you should mix what whisk it all together over medium-high heat until it boils once it boils you're going to add your butter you're going to add your lemon and then you're going to enjoy okay so i'm about to take the crust out but before i do i want to mention that this recipe comes from joanna alcorn my mama joe who made this now the best part time to assemble and eat so we got our golden brown crust here as you can see they're just absolutely beautiful what you're gonna do is you're just gonna take some of that flaky moist crust and you're just gonna take it right out and put it right into your bowl and don't worry if it looks crumbly it's supposed to take some of that good delicious crust then after that what you're going to do is you're going to take the juice that you just made spices butter oh it smells so good should be a nice consistency like that and you're just gonna scoop some of that juice right onto your crust oh man it smells delicious in here then lastly but definitely not least bluebell gotta have bluebell homemade vanilla ice cream take some mine got a little soft but that's okay a nice scoop on the top maybe two scoops since it's the holidays and then last but not least we're gonna take our cinnamon i'm gonna pop the top and we're just gonna garnish it really nicely like that for a beautiful presentation i would want to eat this i think anybody would want to eat this but let's do the taste test let's see if this really does taste like apple pie but without the apples let's give it a try i hope you enjoyed this holiday favorite this is definitely one of mine see you later thanks for watching belly updates", "ky_4cgW5JTI": "remember at a party when someone says like sighs like I'm gonna shut down I'm Alison Drummond senior associate food editor at bone Appetit come with me as I discover some of the secrets behind my favorite sweet spots hi guys I'm here at pies and thighs in Williamsburg Brooklyn where they make not only some of my favorite fried chicken in the city but they have ridiculous doughnuts insane biscuits but the reason why I'm here is because they make the best apple pie in the city in my opinion you can't have a great pie without a great crust and here they have totally nailed it my friend Sarah is inside and she's going to teach us all of her pie secrets so let's go meet her scheduler I actually used to work here for a brief time Sarah was kind enough to take me in I didn't know how to make hide actually I think she thought that I was young but I was you taught me everything I know when I make pie I make enough pie dough for one pie but when you make hideout you make pie dough for the dough is the fun part and I think the most important part this is the dry ingredients we're going to use it's just flour sugar salt so your butter is super cold cold butter it melts it creates steam you want like all these layers of the flour and the butter that's what gives you complete there are a million ways to make high dough our trick is using your strongest force to squish it together at hand yeah so you're hosing like as little water as possible like three tablespoons at a time okay so that feels good to me take a bite of the dough you made a mistake in the dough you want to know now they always do that people are like did you just eat raw pie dough and the answer is yes I did mmm YUM there's a lot of water in the dough her head but I think that can only mean really good things for us later that would terrify me to handle dough like that but you're just like a boss like a bow remained an apple says Keeler's here's there when you have to peel a lot of apples it's kind of fun to make a game out of it grace oh wait you didn't know okay judge Tojo nose down I would be terrible and any of those cooking competitions we have apples for our apple pie obviously what else goes into the apple pie okay we're gonna put in cinnamon sugar light brown sugar butter flour nutmeg and lemon juice when did you open pie we opened the first one four years ago in the back of this like really wild drive bar possible it was a front for some other business that this is the wacky part we're gonna let this sit overnight if you put sugar on fruit it's gonna draw the juice out want to draw that juice out so that we can thicken it and then add it back so a lot of happening in that juice Wow and you want to get that around so here are our apples you can see there's a lot of liquid we're gonna do is pour this off into a pot and then hook that juice down basically reduce it by half this is the reduced juice okay and this happens really quickly I'd say it gets here in five minutes this we've tossed back with the apples can use your hand I think you should use your hand I love apple pie because like it's kind of over liable it always seems appropriate like when in doubt apple pie yeah a baby shower apple pie no one's boned fourth-of-july apple put this down so I'm just gonna tear off the edge here you're just gonna fold over all the way around like that okay go cramp you're gonna take two fingers crabs so pushing with your left and then squishing around your finger okay yeah done if you see any spots where you goofed go back right biggest at the end of the day you're still gonna have an apple-pie gonna pop this in the oven amazed oh I thought timers I heard the pie okay it's bullet up it literally looks like a croissant there's a lot of caramelization we have good color on the crust you can see that it's sort of like shattered and croissant II if you want to eat this I mean I'm definitely sorry looking back you can see that like the juice is thick and the apples aren't super cooked so it's all like dark applesauce okay that's a pie perfect I literally can't wait any longer so wicked if we could start we can move it align it's really good it's so good it's really speaking to me right now so for more baking tips and ways to make that your pies and
