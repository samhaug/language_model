{"idWbXdUMAic": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "D7dRglBPZIc": "[Music] what is up you guys before Oh back again showing you guys what is up under the HL g550 BR choose currently [Music] week five of edge for most of these plants this is a day 18 for the two odd jobs and the gorilla butter times two with the fresh Coast sea and check you out on an EP plant a little bit pretty good stacking we had a problem with the peat moss cups that we transplanted in originally they were actually dry on the outside and since then I I went around tonight tore off what I could of the remaining cup and then proceeded to water at the base of the plant to then help decompose the peat moss stuff that's underneath it and also with the organic way that we've been going we've brewed in our compost tea the organically done grow mix also the bloom boost for right now they'll hopefully make sure that it's going to be active wanted me to be but they say the whole thing about organics is it [Music] [Music] you", "6VtzVHhrvXc": "Blue Dream in half ante mix okay what originally started rock up that's what that's what my dad tells me because he had weed that seated out before okay but like what's house monster it's growing organically you know I don't know it's crystally right this is late the most crystal stuff it's got decent good density there is hmm very interesting these ones were in a fifteen gallon container i think fifteen gallon genetics uh he got plenty of seeds of this stuff yeah I was gonna bring you some seeds of this but I actually with this plant I it's all it's it's non feminized seeds right I got so actually one one I grew to the odd job and then two of the gorilla butter and only one ended up being a female and that was this girl of butter so yeah it's a grueling so I check out the odd jobs and I left the male gorilla butter in the room but with a big bag over it Oh three minute is folks but like it didn't it definitely seated in some areas but to me that's a benefit to have more seeds of something like this and then be able to grow more of it that's for sure I mean it looks I mean it's in the special [ __ ] jar to shoot a jar you know fast I couldn't believe it hey and then it didn't didn't rain it at all and it even itself out we did some LST at the very end just a minor end over and threw it in the bud and then pretty soon a stud turn it's like a girl and her I know it's kind of stretcher it went from Ashley like 24 inches at start of flower to over 48 weeks of just literally grab an easy car man for 120 I think they are for a 16 cloner you have to change the water out every six days cuz they're small and a will warm up you got a tick you can keep them clean and it cleans them too when you change mouth another thing that you have to do is always make sure you use a brand new sleeve that they use in them because if you used old ones they just don't hold like because of the way that plant sits in there it creates a divot and that divot let a little bit of light in just a little as light will start creating algae and you'll just get the black rock remind your [ __ ] you just [ __ ] some bleach you have at least you if I then one is that when you're drying in and if you're not just in a cloner but it's in the clothes so if you could take a cut throw in a clone I mean I'll show you the corner down right I saw like a DIY cloner on YouTube I was trying that's how I started with ocular cloning was with a DI I took a black container like a black heavy-duty boxes are like 17 bucks they come with this yellow top and if you cut holes in it you can do that you can actually hard to make it's just a matter of effort versus yeah yeah it's all part of an expense and in my mind it's part of an expense so it's one of those things but if you have a system I mean I'm gonna actually try what was that weird [ __ ] all right after I figure out why that was up dude he showed me what so I'm gonna try cuz we did a see a green test out and I think one of the issues I have is going from a water clone to a dirt that quick you know you need that extra time it's like shocking kingsday shocking the plant or if I want to do the cute because I've done cubes to the no well I've done rock wall to with when I first started but the like root cubes and stuff like that like that to use in a container with the darling [ __ ] I think we're gonna try that with some clones and actually see if we can get a better result from see a green cuz that and I think I'm using too much light no just in general you got your meter I that's what I need to get ya the meter because it's I've a lot of people talk about how you have to like a thousand micro moles of intensity near the tops of your tops the problem is is with the screens that we're using it's creating a hollow that's creating at least 25 tops and that means instead of having one top thousand you now have the thousand top light you know get at a thousand we're not no 25 at a thousand which changes the amount of radiation the plants getting for the day itself and too much radiation in the day causes the plant to stress oh really yeah too much Sun will cause the plant to stress for sure we we actually run supplemental UV lighting for 15 minutes a day at the entail and two weeks that's the scientific research is supposed to say that it builds more trichomes at the plant like you saying the plan is stressed and actually the trichomes work as I did I use B block so it wants to inherently grow more trichomes but there is a negative side which I fail that okay that one day I just plugged my [ __ ] in plugged it in and I left a nominal these are literally like it's a four-foot it's a grow light but it's it's a t5 you know yeah thanks Jerry yeah yeah it's like a tanning bulb I left it on all my head in the dark cycle for probably for eight hours came back to my plants tan the base of the stalks were were burnt and yeah yes and that was you know four feet in I mean it was one of my first times growing I just yeah try Hitler [ __ ] air Miller and is the only way to learn effective you learn [ __ ] here I'm ready one you got him down yeah all right we're not asking you I want to hear your most critical first Larry Moore and I'm gonna say a six because it's smooth was sliced eight okay I don't taste anything so I'm assuming it's kind of a cookies phenome in a sense of it's probably creamy or fruity you know but I taste a sting and a smoothness at first I didn't be kind of I was a little worried and then as it got into it a little more I was like oh no this just was sting mm-hmm that's what I got so cuz you know me I don't take [ __ ] unless it's [ __ ] something it's gotta be pretty [ __ ] he's got to be tangi or something on that level but it's not there's no off-putting taste and it's smooth I don't know what the flavor is that's all I can't I can't figure out and you gave you those six yeah okay boys mm-hmm what do you think um it was smooth I got a little bit of a earthy taste from it and I gave it a 5 and a half all right that's why yeah I thought it kind of had it kind of has to me a cookies taste like what I every time Emma was like oh this is creamy and cookie is what it tastes like to me yeah it's it's it's musty moldy yeah right almost nasty that's what I mean when I said earthy yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's it's more of a deep tone I I gave it a 6 I really enjoyed it I absolutely like if that was still lit I would have I was about as close to to giving you the seven no I'd like to smell it burnt really clean which is great because that's it was a problem that I have with a lot of weed is that it's not a clean burn and I end up coughing from that instead of actually coughing from the weed because unless it's a type little pretty [ __ ] these are similar right it's one into be very similar to me when this was like just seems to be a little strong I know when this was ten days older dude I loved it dude and I it almost to me it lost a little bit of smell to it that seems to be a little more pungent ass you know and this one looked worse while growing oh yeah yeah and way smaller playing yes yeah you tell mom but it could be dividend sir but Orson just say was kind of it's got a lot of crystals right both on plants did and but one of the plants of the in the far right in my videos didn't have much dry homes or smell at all hmm so I was like and then and then the back three were 30 gallons actually like it's nice to say that you guys already yellow 30 gallons these these yep I'm gonna he'll be good on the far too on the right I have two hlg pretty much thousand water but LEDs and one plane is Thompson saw him again that was 230 s in the middle book the middle 30 only had five point five or five point six but doesn't had 10 and 10 and 12 okay and then and then I had it was kind of like a staggered Grove to it wasn't like all the same time the same grow so there's a little bit like manipulated numbers yeah I'll definitely put an asterisk on that because one time I threw some of the butterly so they got their own light but they there's a whole scenario where they my thousands water HPS went down so we had to switch to like some just t5 lights and we ended up putting bowel back into the bug room and let him but out but well all together this whole row I had almost a little bit of over three pounds how many plants is it seven okay eight plants eight plants with this one and this this plant you know got its own treatment in its way and this one got ten ounces but another thing if you guys saying about the smoothness of it it's like this plan isn't flushed at all Oh business organic organic but you never gave it any news all right besides just top amending with dry amendments and we did weekly tea blossom leaf yeah you had a lot of some top cover leaf yep for a little bit you didn't eat yeah compost tea with the compost tea and uses cheese yeah I mean I spend there's a scientist soil scientist I follow and listen to her name's Elaine Ingraham mm-hm and she'll go on like you know a three-hour talk into a big open forum on YouTube you know I'm saying about like soil science and microbes and you know what it's doing and she's not even like a person a plant person yeah plant a person yeah like the science all goes the same you know like in no way I think like this is the best weed like I said but like this is the most this is the best food I've thrown so far so like that's applause and the one thing we failed actually on the last grow because we we didn't duties and we did rear end and we didn't like what test our soil and it was complete offset humble doubt little buds what kind of a show you use leds leds just a different brain right there's a michigan brand and i would recommend anyone going to because they're half the price of h LG it's called a budget LED yeah they use the boards - right it's all about boards which means it's great because you get this you get such an even spread in the space you want and a good spectrum yeah yeah it's supposed to be an inspector yeah I I don't know I'm waiting to see cuz I had to get the and to get I don't want to say the wattage I had to get to Paro whatever you want to call I had to get the lights up to where it was giving enough you know I'm saying rate enough radiation throughout the plants life because that is I just didn't have enough when I switched over from HIDs LEDs I did it straight up ten for ten okay yeah I can tell you that much they were not like if I have switched from how to use graffities and got ten graffities that's a different story I did too many but I got 10 of these Vipers and they were just not you need to eat one pro-life plant basically mm-hmm for it to work would you work effectively there there's not enough wattage to really get what I want out of a plant in that sense I like the way the one was looking in the last in Instagram picture man you know nice oh dude up raised their foot in the flowering she's called this is a blood orange okay yeah it's uh I got two more three more coming that are seeds so I got four or five and six four is tiny it's like ah it's literally like from the table this tall plant like this big not stunted it's just in a fire it's in this five gallon pot so I didn't like okay put in a 10 gallon and let it grow all the way around and running a five gallon to kind of like just to see what the [ __ ] is he is but uh it's then that one next to it is tall like the exact it's double the size mmm one stretched and one did basically like that big where the other ones like stretched out like this with seven ones mm-hmm yeah it's like it's insane they're completely they're the same plant but completely different and completely different than the other three that's deep the smell I'm the short one isn't that there's no smell yet but in the second one do you smell that lot tall one yeah sour and there I it's super sour I actually just had my face by it earlier and I was like damn something smells good right here it's sour hello you'll find out you don't like sour like these little like diesel I like diesels but Dunn's not sour and I don't know I don't know we'll see we'll see what do you guys got you got it down I'm good all right let's go in chapters well I gave this a 6.5 so it definitely a smelled a little stronger me I smelled a little higher like touch fruitier like just a sharper nose but it definitely definitely smoked a little bit a little bit better man yeah yes done the first one like I felt a little bit more staying in the back of my throat both both occasions coming around the table yeah I give it a 6 to it to me it's the exact same thing I feel with me it's third thing because I can't tell the subtleties so it's gonna be there they're smoothly smooth with some statement mm-hmm not too much thing that you can actually get a real big hit but if you take a little bit too much in it's gonna hurt you know say if you get down in that lower a long area it'll sting cut I had to give it a little bit better so I gave you six five two and I thought it was better because it's a little sweeter to me it's a difference between your boob area and like Zach so I like what is sweeter than the other thanks great I got no no bad aftertaste and um I gave it a 7 nice it tastes a bit on the first first seven on the board yeah here we go I'll give this right back to you then Rudy thank you sir that's great I have not given out very many sixes and above on any of the videos that I've been alive been hiding [ __ ] harsh most of the most of the weed that's come from the dispensaries there's only been a couple of them that I that I've been like man I would have been happy though to smoke this and I definitely wouldn't have been happy to [ __ ] pay to dispose for it done it no go [ __ ] yourself price yeah to me it's just like night and day like me nah we stick here yeah turn purple the last like two weeks was like I'll be happy to see how it's marks but like I'm not gonna lie to you yeah I'm a purple over - oh yeah this doesn't smell like purple we at all I'm just saying I am a purple of I'm wealthy restrain I've ever smoked so hurtful Spock man Oh Grape Ape you ever had that I have it's purple Durbin poison and it tastes just like race I do have purple punch yeah I'm gonna flower with that ss4 okay in the same you know I'm saying coming around together that's one flower it's only in a threeway you look like you know you wanted to be separate cuz as they grow they're gonna need to be moved around and shifted and twisted guess what it's a pain in the dick looking for something yeah that's what we're doing deal what the [ __ ] is deal with the pain and guess what you could find gold it'll pay off in the air do you think the [ __ ] guys were looking you think the guys that were looking for gold back in a day we're just like filly farting I'm trying to think of a fight where that was really funny a second come on was Millie [ __ ] what's up you [ __ ] dude I give up either way they work there well they will a lot of people stole it they just watched some dude was it that I said there was a movie that that was pretty much what I think it might even it not it was all about this dude protecting his cold this old guy I think it's a short story and he's like he finds some gold and he has to protect it and it's like oh god damn it I think it was by the Coen brothers he did like movie with like a bunch of one of them was about this gunslinger who never got killed and then he gets killed at the end at the end of it but he's a singer it's like they're singing the whole time it's like a Western musical for oh it sucks short yeah short moving the guy had a white hat on yes all day it was crazy with a [ __ ] Indian yeah yeah girl shoot yourself it was crazy yeah but it was a musical wasn't it where he was no no just the first one was music he writes it he's like right and then the dude took over that shadow and start singing any cowboy yeah yeah we're talking about [ __ ] no one has any evidence some people are gonna hear that go yes I think yes and most people that are watching this have the YouTube skills to YouTube you probably find it cuz he's a kind of a nerdy actor he's yeah he the show a guy who really he was too clean to clean yeah yeah I know he's in the Old West do it won't even touch you I never understood wearing white man it's like good for one time I get food all over myself I have no you know what help is no restraint for the [ __ ] food you know what happens when I wear white ends up with marijuana ashes all four or four fives SC I don't get out the house clean I get out with some ashes on me or that seed that pops out and burns a hole in you oh yeah I got my shorts I gotta buy new shorts and it's just like it was a lot when I was smoking hash happen a lot when I'm smoking hash mm-hmm there's a little hash drop instantly melt before me I gotta make some hash I gotta make some hands she's saying that but you never do don't bring that stuff over you mix a mesh I can make it in the basement don't you want to freeze your dick off mm-hmm look at it out there I'm gonna go coming down still wasn't it we didn't get the three or five inches but no it's just a hassle that's all one day they do this in Florida oh I hate Florida - never mind listen just take Jemaine guy Hawaii [ __ ] that Jamaica Callie Oh Jamaica little world somewhere tropical let's put it that way I'm telling you I read anywhere that doesn't have legal weed i'ma ask my friend about that he's in Bali he's in Bali and they'll have any crime there I was told I was no crime there now if you could smoke weed here I don't think you can we're volleys Thailand no no Lee is in Asia yeah look it up cut has Google what am i what are the weed laws in Bali let's teach these people today heat loss and Bali yeah yeah Indonesia Indonesia be cool as [ __ ] that's a Buddhist country - plenty of temples to go clean floors my friend eat with someone the strictest in I guess we're not going to Bali would I say some of the strictest it said what some of the strictest because it goes legal down there are not legal sorry anymore why wild so they like usually places where it grows wild like cuz dude it grows like Nebraska it's everywhere you see it on the side of roads oh yes hippo ragweed like Central Park until the 50s or something but it's but I wake you up and I would imagine what a tropical climate like that absolutely probably caused a really good [ __ ] there oh yeah that's like Vietnam like Thailand yeah yeah yeah mm-hmm I have this guy that I know his name's we call him O'Connell and blue boy old man blue he looks like old man blue from the movie oh yeah so he's been smoking since forever and he says the best way the ever smoke was in Thailand or not Thailand yeah yeah Vietnam cuz he was in the war yeah and he had fun he's one of those students that like you asked him why doesn't that detect you got high his buck but so [ __ ] just saw a just when we had to do it so I did it got it over with got high walls over there hmm most of those guys probably got a high wall new over there mm-hmm you have to get high yeah hey I get [ __ ] up it goes all right so on a scale of one being very illegal to five being virtually legal we give it a two point five because you can bribe the cops I was listening to this girl talk about Venezuela in a weird way when you mean in a weird way she pointed out something she's like Cuba and Venezuela are like two of the last social technically socialist countries down there and that technically I guess I don't know I don't even know what I'm talking about but she had said that it makes sense in my god look at his eyes he's trying to get it out but did you say cup hell it's in his head but now well it was a chick talking on a podcast it was just your opinion chick lady a chick a lady she's journalist and she's like she's on my point of view about anti American imperialism over and her basic argument is that one of the reasons socialistic countries like Cuba and Venezuela are failing is because they're basically being crushed with sanctions and unfair tariffs and all kinds of [ __ ] from you know so much pressure from the US uh uh the fact that they've even done anything in the first place like Cuba I guess puts out doctors like you wouldn't believe oh yeah like you can go there you can go to kuba kuba go to cook you meet Sammy Sosa you go to Cuba you can become a doctor there yes like for free yeah it's like part of their whole thing they like teach people to be doctors Cuba it's something so else down there they produce more doctors yeah other country tons of doctors man well I gave it a 7 I thought it was a good stinking flavor I can't pinpoint what the flavor is I just it's good you know any sweeter of them it's not sweet to me it's pepper spice yeah complexity we've got some complexity in the taste go ahead sweet pepper yeah I gave it a 7 and thank I'll give it a seven and a half this better than the last every time the 75 is gonna give this Sweden even seven across the board I gave it a seven as well yeah I thought it was a real lemony citrusy high no veg taste um and that came after after exhaling that was great and I thought the sting was great ball times again it got better this with the second hit I'm sure it's not get better again here with the third yeah that's the best one so far tonight like I think like the only people I kinda burned a little less clean than the other two I'm outside outside of actually not trying though yeah that's that's what no i'm did yeah you want to hit it harder that's what i think i just i'm said you don't have them no more which one i need oh oh yeah you trust me you don't my dad doesn't think highly opposed I don't think highly seems like that's a lot different I think highly a seat or depends what you need them for I'm saying finding what you're looking for but if you find something you like like this right here but these you're now completely different yeah I had one one out of the seven technically of this plant same plot of seeds that didn't smell it all only produce two ounces mhmmm in the same spot only difference okay so you", "FjqHb7n38hk": "[Music] what's poppin yo this is be real AKA dr. greenthumb for another strain alert you want him we got him today we are introducing the butter cake into the game gonna be available at all the dr. greenthumb dispensaries from Eureka San Francisco Sacramento Los Angeles Sylmar yes all the shops will be stocked with this butter cake insane butter cake by sea junkies genetics you know what I'm saying this [ __ ] is poppin it's like if you when you open up the jar and you look at these Nuggets and it's a nicely fresh batch of this [ __ ] it's like a snow-capped Mountain you know I'm saying there's so much frost in this [ __ ] [ __ ] right here and listen when you pop the jar open or open the bag delightful I mean listen um these the the the the trichomes on these Nuggets are ridiculous I mean it's just like I said they're frostbitten it's uh you know certified grade a fire in a jar this jar is [ __ ] hot in my hand you know what I mean um the the Nuggets are tight and dense and I gotta tell you you know you ain't gonna want to share this with nobody because it's too [ __ ] good you know just to make it pop off from the [ __ ] blaze this butter cake right here and I'll pop I'll pop the jar open and pull out a few Nuggets but when you see it or when it hits the counter and our dr. greenthumb dispensaries for now temporarily they will be in these white and orange dr bags we do have custom bags coming for the butter cake but this is what they will be in for now so when you go to any dr. green thumb stores and you asked for the butter cake they should be in these bags right here all right they won't be in these fly-ass jars cuz do you know though non-compliant and whatnot but I got to tell you this [ __ ] is flavor anything that you get from seed junkie genetics if the farm is right and the farm is tight everything is gonna be alright this [ __ ] is so pungent so flavorful and it does have that cake flavor when you know on the exhale even on the inhale if you take like little hits not not big pressure hits like Jeff Spicoli hits where you [ __ ] take a hit and half the join is gone in like five seconds now if you if you take a slow hit low pressure savor the flavor neighbor because this [ __ ] is fire and look if you close up if you get it close up on this here joint you will notice the white ash popping so clean so nice such a great burn on this 10 mill funky field tip that's all we roll on glass tips over here you know say we don't [ __ ] around you know if we're gonna be tested flavors or alerting people of the Bombers flavors you got to have funky field tips on that [ __ ] not all the knockoffs that you see and all the copies that you see but the real [ __ ] funky field tips helps to promote the flavor of this insane butter cake if you will I got to tell you this is uh one of my favorite exotics coming into the game right now if we were doing strain reviews I would give it 120 thumbs up my bro a hundred and twenty not just ten this [ __ ] is flavor I'm trying to tell you this is the [ __ ] that like if you're in the recording studio and you blaze this [ __ ] up all the rappers from all the other [ __ ] recording sessions and even some of the R&B singers are like god damn who's smoking that [ __ ] yo is that dr. greenthumb over there yes it is so I suggest you take your ass down to dr. green thumbs when this butter cake becomes available in these bags right here and go get yourself some flavoring you know I'm saying cuz nothing but the best thank you very much for watching this strain alert go get it stay blazin keep the fire lid [Music]", "SaRinEXnPYA": "hi everyone hi today we are going to cover the best kind of sources and condiments for a low-carb keto lifestyle we're going to go over store-bought ones ones that you can buy online and my favorite ones the ones that you can make at home yes your favorite a lot of them i enjoyed them nice um yeah i think excuse me i do make them i haven't made the mayo i've made the pesto wow i think condiments can be a hard thing for people to move away from particularly with kids i know that my 17 year old nephew douses everything with barbecue sauce so it is good if you can like perhaps work in some options that still kind of tastes like the original but have better ingredients do you think it helps like how you know dear like we're condiment people they just without my thing where condiment people sausages steak yeah hot dogs hamburgers hamburgers you're gonna want some of this stuff even bacon and eggs yeah sometimes so we'll start off with store-bought now this is a bit of a minefield it's kind of hard to find low-carb options that don't have a lot of sugar and vegetable oils in them but we do have a few go-to's so first off erica will talk about her favorite yeah so this is the heinz 50 less added sugar no artificial sweeteners tomato ketchup um so this is probably the least favorite option in terms of ingredients that we have but it's the most like regular tomato sauce it basically tastes like regular tomatoes yes and it looks like i guess tomato sauce if you put it on the table no one's gonna be like what's that so i really like the flavor of it but it's probably not the best one kind of ingredients and carbs wise it's two grams of carbs per serve so i mean it's a better option than the regular one it's probably not the best option but i think it's a good transition yes definitely also in the health food section you can get these celebrate health they have a barbecue they have a tomato and they have a sweet chili they're sweetened with stevia so if you're then wanting to move away from any that have sugar you would transition from this over to the celebrate health they are in the health food section i found this at coles but i'm pretty sure they have them at woolworths as well the ingredients are pretty clean there's carrot juice concentrate which probably adds some sweetness and it uses stevia and the carbs are 2.3 and there's 21 serves but it does a serving size is 20 mils what was the soup 15 mil yeah so you're getting a little bit more for about the same amount of coffee barbecue sauce is normally a bit higher in carbs than tomato sauce as well because it's normally pretty sweet yeah so if you want to transition to a sauce with stevia this is the one from the soup yeah that one has no sugar this one just has less sugar this one is my favorite and this is american style new york american mustard new york style mild it's heinz now i have looked at all of the ones that are this american style and a squeezy bottle because you can get dijon and stuff which is pretty fine but it's been hard to find one without sugar and this one has no sugar which shocked me because we were doing the reset in august and we were having burgers or something and i wanted mustard and i turned this over and i flipped it it's white vinegar water mustard seeds salt turmeric natural flavor and spices and the carbs are 0.6 for 10 mils so you're not eating you're not eating much of this and this is great for burgers and hot dogs and we often try to have this in the cupboard so keep an eye out for that if you're a burger fan for sure so that is the supermarket options unfortunately you know it's great we have things but not that many things compared to what you can get online there are a lot of online options some of the things you can't find at the supermarket that have good ingredients are things like mayo and dressings i will say though someone posted in our facebook group that they spotted the good um this brand i think they have good oil good fat they have mayo they've got undivided food coloring yeah at woolworths it was in a metro location we haven't seen it at our worst but how good would it be if we had all of these options at woolies so good sauce is probably our favorite online option we buy them from low carb emporium and they have dressings which are reasonably new this one's a balsamic and then they have an asian one and the good thing about the dressings is that they're with extra virgin olive oil so most dressings you're going to find at the supermarket are going to be vegetable oils so this one is the balsamic one and it's extra virgin olive oil balsamic vinegar dijon mustard sea salt garlic and pepper so pretty clean ingredients balsamic is going to have a little bit of um sweetness to it anyway the serving size is 25 mils and the carbs is 1.7 so 25 meals is really like you probably wouldn't have that much dressing on one bit of salad either this one is asian flavored and it's sweetened with a bit of monk fruit as are their sauces so they have sweet chili which is delicious and we have a stir-fry recipe on our youtube channel and website that uses this sauce and it is so quick and easy and like a really family-friendly dinner and they also have barbecue and tomato so these are probably our go-to sauces in terms of ingredients so the carbs on the bbq is 1.4 so a little bit better than the store-bought one from celebrate health the tomato is 0.9 and the sweet chili is 1.3 so and the serving size is 15 grams on these ones so as part of this same brand also they have good fat mayo which is made with olive oil again not something that you know the store-bought mayo's at the supermarket are made with and they have a chili one a garlic one and an original one and they're really yummy we get them from low carb emporium but again if you see this brand in your woolworths please let us know in the comments below because if they're coming to woolies that is really exciting and if you find them in newcastle definitely let us know because we've got a bit of a problem yes we like sources so so then we move into more what you can buy on iherb iherb is an american website but they do ship to australia very quickly we use iherb a lot yeah and if you spend it varies but between over usually between 40 and 50 dollars it depends on the exchange rate you get free shipping and it always is quicker than what it says it's going to be because sometimes it says it's going to be like 25 days or something it's i mean at this time of year maybe but it's usually pretty quick um and we really like this so kensington um products that you can buy from there so they have this avocado oil mayonnaise and then the avocado oil ranch so we usually have those in the fridge or the cupboard we also enjoy the primal kitchen stuff they also have a mayo and a few mayo based ones and they also have some dressings like this thousand island dressing one and this is a mustard um they have a whole range just check out iherb we'll pop a link in the description below for um the different iherb ones that you can get yeah and i think you can get some of the primal kitchen stuff at um low carb emporium but their mayo is really nice and they have like a chipotle lime one that's really nice you can only get that on iherb but we'll pop we have just um discount codes for both low-carb emporium and iherb which will pop in the description below if you're thinking of making an order so that's probably the end of the um online ones and then we move into the homemade so there's heaps of homemade sauces that you can make and these are probably more sauces than condiments but there's some mayo's and things like that but um the thing i love about the homemade sauces is they're actually a really great way to add fat to your protein yeah particularly if you're having something clean yeah like chicken breasts or something like that so we have we'll start with some of the easy ones to make like mayo you can make your home own homemade mayo we have been doing that a lot more lately because it is expensive to buy the ones on iherb it's quite easy to make we have a recipe for that we also have a video so we'll pop some links below um hollandaise sauce yeah so both of those the hollandaise sauce and the mayo recipe are using like a stick blender method where you just like putting everything in and kind of using the stick blender and they are so easy and delicious honestly every time someone makes the mayo for the first time oh my god it blows your mind so with mayo we use that like you know on a hamburger or you know with some chicken like sometimes for dinner just have chicken thighs grilled on the bbq with some mayo very simple but you can also then use it in things like making you know tuna and mayo or egg and mayo and that's really great for pack lunches and then you can use it as the base for dressings like we have a ranch dip that's really delicious you use mayo and sour cream together or you can flavor it up you know flavor up your mayo with herbs and garlic and all that type of thing hollandaise of course eggs benedict very popular in australia if you can make your own you're definitely going to save money if you're not spending 20 to 25 on a breakfast when you eat out um it's super easy to make and you can just pop them on your eggs and it is a winner yeah really yummy but some other kind of sauces that we make quite regularly would be like a romesco sauce which is like um red capsicum and almonds kind of blended up and it's like a really kind of sweet and tangy sauce it's really nice with chicken or seafood and it's a great dairy free option with steak i love a mushroom sauce we have a good mushroom sauce recipe on our website i'm pretty sure we've also done a video of it and it is great on steak or you can do it with chicken as well if you need to add some fat but i really like it on steak another one we use um like we eat quite regularly is the satay sauce which is easy we have some in the freezer it's easy to make keto friendly and perfect again with just like grilled chicken grilled veggies all that type of stuff yum and kid approved i would say another one is pesto we actually have some in the fridge at the moment i might show you okay so look at that and smell it and smell see it is so fresh it's i make this myself um in the food processor um we grow our own basil um and this is so easy to make and it's so much better for you than the ones that you can buy at the supermarket because they you add olive oil instead of vegetable oils like at the supermarket so i encourage you to make your own pesto um because your salad pesto is it's super versatile it's not just like mushroom sauce where you have it with your steak so you could mix some of that like a bit of that in with some mayo then it's like a flavored mayo you could mix it with cream cheese then it's a dip we had a grazing platter on the weekend we just put some of that on there as a dip you can mix it through pasta or zoodles to you know as a sauce you could mix it up with some like shredded chicken cheese on top bake it in the oven like there's so many dishes in our meatballs yeah we put yeah we have um oven baked meatballs that have that in it and it really does we should make that i know we should dinner is organized we haven't covered probably our favorite or our most popular sauce from our website the cheese sauce yes the cheese sauce is great by itself in terms of you can just put it on any protein also it is used in quite a few of our recipes loaded cauliflower tuna mornay yeah like a cauliflower bake it makes that really cheesy and delicious we have i'm gonna go out on a limb here and say we have the best cheese sauce recipe on the internet we do erica won a minute it is very popular and i think because it's easy and everybody loves it and it doesn't need anything to thicken it because we see comments in our group all the time what do i use to thicken my cheese sauce you use cheese to thicken your cheese sauce in our recipe it is the bomb anyway all of these recipes that we have mentioned we will link below because you should definitely get on the sauce train sauce is just such a great way to add flavor and fat to a protein throw aside you can even use some of these sauces over your vegetables cheese sauce over some broccoli is also delicious so give these a go try making your own or if you need convenience we've showed you that as well hopefully you found this video useful if you have guys remember thumbs up subscribe to our channel and thank you so much for watching bye", "-9LTXO00aYY": "[Music] so today we're talking about stools now I kind of like the four legged bar stool myself I find it's very stable it's it's easy to sit on and what Oh we're not talking about that kind of stool oh and now for a different kind of stool twelve things your poop says about your health well as gross as it may sound the color and shape of your stool can reveal a lot about your health any changes you might notice can be a sign of a serious disease don't ignore them watch this video till the end to take another step toward good health poop color as you probably know the normal color of stool is brown it may vary slightly from time to time depending on what you eat but a sudden color change for no obvious reason can be a warning sign so let's find out what's what what whitish grayish or clay colored stool indicates a lack of bile bile is what makes normal poop brown lighter poop may hint at problems with the liver and gallbladder as these are organs where bile is produced and stored it can be anything from blocked bile ducts and gall stones to cirrhosis gall stones can give you some serious abdominal pain or show no signs of their existence making it trickier to diagnose as for cirrhosis it gives your liver irreversible damage so early detection of it could be life-saving white mucus on brown stool may be a sign of Crohn's disease which is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease number two green are you a fan of spinach kale and broccoli or maybe your diet contains avocados cucumbers zucchini Kiwis and other green foods then you probably don't have a reason to worry about green poop a green color may be caused by the consumption of vegetables rich in chlorophyll which makes them green or green food coloring and drinks and iron supplements if food is not the reason it means your stool passed the digestive tract too quickly and didn't have time to get enough bile in bilirubin are you guys still with me on this trek through the poop great number three yellow have you noticed that your stool looks yellowish is covered in greasy film and even leaves drops of oil in the toilet bowl yellow stool can be a sign of blocked bile ducts and poor fat absorption when your digestive system fails to break down food the way it should too much fat goes out with your stool another reason is a lack of enzymes produced by the pancreas which may hint at chronic pancreatitis cystic fibrosis and celiac disease people who have celiac disease can eat gluten so bread and pasta along with other foods rich in gluten give their intestines a hard time but don't panic yellow poop can also be a sign that you ate too many carrots and had a lot of yellow colored drinks yes they could make your poop look golden number four black number four black stool may appear because of medicine intake like aspirin ibuprofen and iron supplements or bleeding in the intestines the latter is obviously a reason to contact your doctor immediately a more common cause again why is in the food you eat black and blue foods like blueberries licorice dark chocolate cookies and grape juice can give this shade to your feces iron supplements and nicotine could also be the cause of that poop change in color if black and blue foods as well as iron supplements are not part of your diet then you should probably alarm number five red red stool is usually influenced by your diet beets jell-o colored drinks Tomatoes just think about what you've consumed recently two bowls of tomato soup well you shouldn't be surprised however if food is not the cost it's time to call your doctor blood in your poop is obviously an alarming sign and maybe an anal fistula or something more serious like hemorrhoids ulcerative colitis or even cancer that's the word no one likes to hear before you get really scared note that bowel cancer normally has other symptoms as well such as losing weight feeling extremely tired and breathless and needing to strain as if you wanted to go number two even after you've just done it shape if you still don't believe that watching your stool is normal some scientific research may convince you to distinguish the types of poop and help people stay healthy scientists from the Bristol Royal Infirmary created the Bristol stool chart Wow say that five times real fast it describes seven types of faeces and what they mean number one if you see separate solid lumps reminiscent of nuts or goat feces in your toilet ball it is likely a sign of severe constipation this type of stool means your body lacks fiber to fix it try to consume more fiber rich products like fresh fruit and vegetables grains nuts seeds whole wheat pasta beans and lentils yum according to the American Dietetic Association Americans get about zero point five ounces of fiber a day which is much less than we actually need the optimum amount is one ounce a day for women under fifty one and one point three ounces a day for men of the same age also if you experience constipation don't forget about the natural laxatives prunes those dried plums have enough sorbitol in them for a good desired effect mmm [Music] number two sausage-shaped large and lumpy poop speaks of constipation this type of stool is also caused by a lack of fiber non dietary reasons for constipation may include long term anti diarrhea medicine intake and lack of physical activity the advice is to eat more fruits and vegetables and perform exercises it will help you avoid constipation because your body will need less time to move food all the way through the large intestine aerobic exercise like running jogging or swimming also makes your heartbeat and breathing faster which means better natural contraction of muscles involved in the digestion process don't exercise right after a big meal though wait for an hour to avoid bloating and excess gas stretching certain yoga positions and even simply walking at least 15 minutes a day can help healthy digestion number three if cracked sausage-shaped poop is what you usually have there are no reasons to worry that's a normal stool you're doing just fine don't forget to walk and drink more water since constipation is related to dehydration in the colon you need to make sure you're drinking lots of water when your body is properly hydrated less water will be withdrawn from the colon this will keep your stool soft and easy to pass just what we all need number four if you stand with those whose feces are soft sausage shape and smooth congratulations your stool is as perfect as a stool can be try to maintain a balanced diet and avoid stressful situations to keep things as great as they are we all know that feeling when you can't let yourself go in a bathroom break during an important meeting exam or family event suppressing your urge to use the toilet is bad for you since if you keep it tight once and twice and thrice custo patient may become permanent not to give yourself that constipation try to avoid stress and keep healthy number five soft lumps with clear edges are a sign of light diarrhea it could also mean that you are experiencing irritable bowel syndrome the short name for it is IBS it is a chronic condition which needs long-term treatment people with IBS can normally control it thanks to a healthy diet and lifestyle to make it better try eating low fiber foods like bananas crackers and potatoes if you want to find out about the food combinations you should avoid because they are really bad for your health watch this video number 6 if your poop comes in fluffy pieces with ragged edges it looks like you're having mild diarrhea remember how we told you to have more fiber well in this case it is just the opposite maybe there's too much fiber in your diet drink more to avoid dehydration and stick to boiled potatoes and bananas you may want to try some OTC like imodium or pepto-bismol they will help to slow down the movement in your intestines and shape more solid stools if the problem lasts for more than two days consult a doctor number 7 liquid without solid pieces type of feces is what no one likes to say it speaks of severe diarrhea this may be a sign of food poisoning lactose intolerance bacterial infection or medicine in take antibiotics heartburn and acid reflux medications and chemotherapy drugs are often the cause of it drink plenty of water to fight dehydration and try over-the-counter medications severe diarrhea normally doesn't last long if the symptoms don't disappear in two days or if you feel pain and fever consult a doctor so do you take problems with your stools seriously do you consult doctors when needed feel free to

found at audi yes so if anyone's watched our channel before you know we're not big aldi shoppers but we were i was pretty impressed by what we found and we even like came out with a bag of things that we purchased with no intent on buying so we will say at the start first of all we are all aware that the fruit and veggies and the meat you know regular steak and chicken are all available to us and they are the best keto options in the supermarket by far yeah but we're gonna just highlight some of the things you may not have looked at yet or um picked up yet at audi i will say probably if you only shop exclusively at aldi it doesn't have a lot of the products like keto products that you get at the other places so you are probably more sticking to the basics do you think which is good that's a good thing yeah i will also say this is not an exhaustive list of everything that you can find at audi it's just the stuff that we were like excited about or was like oh that's so cool that they have that so yeah and the ingredients will vary so it's up to you if it suits your version of keto or low carb or not we just want to show you what we found because there was some interesting things that i think some people will be excited to try i agree so we didn't look too much at the fruit and veg section as we said that's you know this great low carb stuff there but it's pretty similar to what you can get at other places probably a better price but i'm not sure but we went into the meat section to see what we could find there and they actually have grass-fed mints and it's 7.49 for 500 grams so that is a really good option for getting good quality minced beef we were also really surprised to see that they had a similar setup to what coles have um with what they're calling ready set cook yeah so like in kohl's they had kind of i can't remember what it was called meals in minutes or something in the raw meat that's kind of prepared marinated and it had you know you picked it by the time it took to cook so it said big you know five minutes ten minutes they had a similar thing at audi and they had quite a few things that i thought you know would be suitable to low carb one of the things that i picked up because i thought it looked really great was the scotch fillet steak with like a mushroom and truffle butter um it looked delicious um i think it was about 28 a kilo scotch billet is expensive anyway but it looked really really good yeah and they also had kind of marinated lamb steaks where they kind of mint and rosemary so they were pretty low-carb um and one thing that we um have been enjoying we saw there which was like a whole boneless marinated chicken which is dan cooks them on the barbecue and they're really good we normally get them at the farmers market but they had them there and there was two different flavor options and i think they were between two to three grams of carbs when you're picking up something that's got a marinade on it um there's always going to be carbs in spices and whatnot so yeah and um to have it that low in carbs is really good and like erica said i would just pop that on the barbecue and that's our protein done and we might pair it with a salad or some veggies or it's like a whole butterfly boneless chicken so it's like a flat chicken it's good they had a couple of different flavors they had a greek flavored one and like a hickory barbecue one and they were ten dollars for a whole chicken that's marinated yeah there was also kind of some other marinated options like pork like a butterfly pork and there was a few different things so you just needed to check you know which ones had the lower carbon as dan has said on previous ones kind of avoid anything that's called honey or sweet soy or sweet chili you know those are going to be higher in carbs so look for ones lemon herb sometimes the barbecue can be good or not good because sometimes they will sweeten the barbecue um greek is good all of those are usually pretty good you just got to flip them over and check for yourself something that we've always loved from audi is their range of krantzki's so the brand is called berg and they had i think four or five different options and they usually about less than one gram of carb per sausage um we really the cheese ones are probably our favorite but they are really delicious and you know a good good option they're great to make kind of hot dogs with so um you can kind of just put it on a plate top it with more cheese um gherkins some sugar-free tomato sauce and you have yourself how could we not the thing is i have not seen bacon chops anywhere other than aldi yeah and they are one they're delicious but i cook them on the barbecue and they're so easy to do and so delicious yeah it's just like a super thick piece of bacon yeah it's delicious believe me if you haven't tried a bacon chop before get to audi and try these bacon chops because they are so so good they also have a pretty wide selection of like you know ham turkey slices all that type of thing and some prosciutto like um that looks probably the cleanest ingredients was like the prosciutto and the parma ham but they have like a good range very good range then we kind of moved into the seafood section um and we found these um marinated and cooked prawns so if you're a little bit unsure about cooking seafood they're already cooked the instructions said to pan fry them for two minutes so you're just kind of warming them and um kind of cooking the marinade a little bit i guess so there's two flavors chili and lemon and garlic and they're seven dollars and it looked like you got six skewers i think yeah it was a bit hard to tell with the packaging yeah but a good option if you're not confident with cooking seafood and you want to try something different and there are about 3 grams per skewer so you'd need to weigh up whether that fits your macros if you're candy macros something else in the seafood section that we were interested to see was hot smoked salmon which we've talked about before in some of our other videos so it's not those thin kind of slimy ish slices it's like a whole fill it a whole piece of fillet of salmon that's been hot like it's more it's cooked it's cooked and cold but it's really delicious and we love having it um for lunches and stuff and it was 6.49 for a 150 grand portion which is the cheapest i've seen i think the worst brand one i want to say is nine dollars yeah i think it was nine dollars yes so that's a really good option and it's if you're not perhaps a huge salmon fan maybe try that it is a good way of eating it that yeah and i tend to take it for lunch so we might grab um a packet of that at the start of the week and then by thursday making my lunch i'm over it i can just chuck that in some mayo some salad and that's my lunch done and it's vacuum packed so it lasts a while so that's why i think it's good when you move into the cheese section i'm really impressed by the sliced cheese varieties that they have they have like jalsberg eat them a whole bunch of different ones and they're 3.49 for a pack of 125 grams that is another good thing to have in the fridge i will chuck some of those into lunch again they can be good for a snack as well for kids too yeah and all that different variety yeah that you don't um sometimes choose those varieties but jarlsberg and eat them they're delicious we also had a tip to try the halloumi from ali apparently it's some people have said it's their favorite halloumi we have actually done a video trying it a couple of days ago so go back and check that out if you like but it is pretty good price 4.99 for 250 gram block of halloumi and if you have never tried halloumi make sure you watch that video because we show you how to cook it and everything it is so good we would often add it to breakfast like if we're doing like a cook-out breakfast on a sunday we might do a couple of slices of halloumi as well so continuing on in the dairy products they actually had a few kind of organic dairy products which is really good to see and such reasonable prices compared to organic products at the supermarket so they had a kilo of organic natural yogurt that was 4.99 that is a bargain they also had a lot of butter and cream and you know all those type of things they also had a coconut yogurt which if you are dairy free and you enjoy yogurt you might want to choose the coconut yogurt for 500 grams it was 5.99 so a bit more expensive than the dairy one but if you like yogurt and your dairy free try the coconut yogurt and the first time we have spotted this at aldi is the two good yogurt they only had two flavors at our audi whereas at kohl's they have maybe six flavors i'm not sure but i think they had strawberry and vanilla and they also had a couple of flavors of yopro so exciting to see some of those brands in ali as well we've done a whole video on the too good yogurt so if you want to know more about the two good yogurts go and check out our um review of those we did a taste test of every single flavor in the supermarket these are 2.19 at audi which is cheaper than coals but coles have them half priced quite regularly which is a dollar 25 so the last thing in the refrigerated section was they had an unsweetened almond milk which was only 0.5 grams of carb per serve the ingredients were pretty good for an almond milk it's kind of yeah there's always stabilizers and gels and stuff in them that was 269 but the same brand also had a long life version that was cheaper so i'm not sure what the difference is between the refrigerated and the long life they were both unsweetened almond milk and they also had an unsweetened long life coconut milk yeah so they were new products those almond milk so the refrigerated one yes keep an eye out for the refrigerated one i'm not like erika said i'm not sure what the difference is but if you know comment below so if we know what the difference is now my favorite thing as we all know is chocolate now they don't have a great deal of options at audi but they do have one 85 percent dark chocolate i have had it before it's quite nice actually the thing i like about it is the portion control because i struggle with chocolate and portion control is they come in a little bar like um it's five portions of a wrap yes two squares in like a portion yes yeah so they're already kind of each they're all wrapped you could if you wanted to take something to work or something you just take that and then you're limited you're not going to eat the whole thing which is normally what would happen you wouldn't need a whole block of chocolate would you maybe so the price is 2.99 for a 125 gram um block oh so let's only a hundred grand yes so much more value for money there because you're getting more and you're spending less because the full price lint is a lot more expensive yeah they also had an almond butter and a smooth and crunchy peanut butter that were just nuts only so good clean ingredient nut butters so the almond butter was 4.99 for a reasonably small jar yeah and the peanut butter was 2.99 just for a regular sized jar they also have a paleo granola which is somewhat similar to the pharma joe's granola would you say yeah it's pretty good yeah and it's 6.99 for 300 grams and yeah it's pretty pretty like we've we've tried it it's nice the carbs is 7.6 for a 50 gram serve we would eat it like a topping not like a pour in a bowl and top with milk um so we might sprinkle a little bit we probably wouldn't even put 50 grams onto like some yogurt or something like that that's how we use it yeah so that's the paleo granola but they also have a paleo mix which is more just like nuts and seeds without any like flavorings or sweetness sweetening or anything like that so i definitely prefer the granola over the paleo mix but the paleo mix is very popular you find the paleo mix in a different spot to the granola it's not even where some of the regular nuts are so there's a nut section in audi and then kind of at the end like a bump in them yeah it's kind of at the end there's a range of nuts walnuts and all of that it's in there so there's a range of different trail mixes and stuff as well they're in a reasonably big sized bags so if you've looked in the regular aldi nut section you might miss it you need to look at the kind of end part so the paleo mix is a cheaper option and also a lower carb option but less tasty option so it's 4.99 for 400 grams and the carbs is 2.4 for 50 grams if you're comparing it to the granola yeah and the granola's in like the regular cereal section i have a really good range of nuts and seeds that to me seems to be well priced i'm no expert but they also had hemp seeds chia seeds all sorts of you know nut and seed options which is awesome to see they also had almond meal which is also something people are looking to get as cheaply as possible so it was 6.99 for 400 grams which i want to say is a lot cheaper than that lucky one you buy it cold yeah unless you get them when they're kind of half price at kohl's that is that's a better option i was also interested to see that they did have some flavored mineral water options so those ones that aren't sweetened it's just a sparkling mineral water with a hint of lemon or whatever but they had two different flavor options there which is good so now we move into the frozen kind of vegetable section and we actually bought some stuff from this section because we were super impressed with what they had well every a few people in our facebook group aussie low-carb community have been talking about these roast pastas so we were keen to give them a try because i think it could be a good kind of christmas meal option um i was just interested so they are nine grams of carbs per serve and there's six serves in this bag they're honey glazed so you need to make a decision around whether you're willing to eat them or not um for a christmas thing i am willing to eat them yeah and they had rave reviews so we were interested to try them so the parsnips are 2.99 for the bag and i definitely think these would be a hit at christmas so they also have these kind of cheesy bakes so there's a there was a cauliflower version and a broccoli version they're about seven grams of carbs per serve and it seems like you just tip this bag into an oven dish and bake it in the oven which i thought would be super handy to have in the freezer because how quick would it be to put that on cook a steak and there's a delicious dinner that the whole family yeah lovers would like kids would love this and it's 4.99 for the pack yeah so there was this one and then there was also a broccoli one but we thought we'd try the cauliflower one now we also spotted these flavored cauliflower rice kind of quick steam sachets so they had three flavor options this one is oriental there was also garden herb and mediterranean the carbs were a little bit higher on these so this one is 13 grams that's a that's a 100 gram serve though so you know i guess it depends on the other veggies yeah but yeah i thought it was interesting to see some flavored cauliflower rice options which is probably a good option for families particularly if your kids don't think they like cauliflower rice having something like this that to me that's lots of flavor it looks different and it will be more flavorful and for the bag it's 2.99 also in the frozen section they had a really big range of frozen seafood at a good price and heaps of different stuff i saw lobster tails yeah prawns a whole like a side of salmon with like a um kind of marinade on it they also had portioned up phillips of salmon which are great to have in the freezer on a can't be bothered dinner night you can just pan fry those and you're good to go yeah and i know the cost of seafood can sometimes be prohibited prohibitive so that was some good more cost effective options than coals and woolies also along the same seafood lines they have a really good range of tinned seafood at aldi which if you watch our other aldi grocery haul we went into more detail in that but they have some really good options of like tuna and i think even trout fillets oysters and stuff and sardines in spring water which is what you want to aim for if there's not kind of option of olive oil because quite often the tuna and things is in vegetable oils that we're trying to avoid so they do have some really good spring water options even if it says olive oil turn it over and check that it's not canola oil and olive oil and just a dash of olive oil this is so much easier to choose spring water and add your own fat in my opinion yeah and last but not least the probably the most popular low carb option at aldi is they have their kind of low carb high protein loaf of bread and they also have bread rolls so the loaf of bread it's a small kind of very compact dense seedy loaf and it's 4.99 the rolls are definitely less seedy less dense more carbs more carbs and they're 2.99 for a two pack so the carbs on the bread for two slices is about five grams of carbs and the roll is about seven for one roll we have done a review of the bread on another video so if you're interested in what we think of the bread we'll um we'll pop a link in the description below but if you've tried the bread and thought it was too seedy try the rolls because they're definitely much more bread like lighter and not acidic by any means don't rule them out we have made burgers and stuff with them bacon and egg rolls with them they're pretty they're pretty good yeah but again they have wheat other undesirable ingredients so they may not suit everyone but make your own decisions yeah choose your own adventure there and don't let us know in the comments [Laughter] please do comment be joking hopefully you've found this video useful we're definitely sure we've missed some things that you love so pop them in the comments below the things that you find that we may have missed or that we didn't highlight in this video we need to be going to aldi more often oh actually that is for sure we do need to be going to audi more often um it wouldn't be a place where we could do our full shop but to be honest we don't do our full shop at woolworth circles either yeah because we often have to go to the other one so we can just throw aldi into the mix anyway thank you so much for watching and we really hope that you're

today we are doing a kind of product taste test this is a new product from low carb emporium um it is what's the brand great low carb bread co it is this is their penne so they actually have a few different kind of pasta varieties um i wanted to get macaroni because i wanted to make macaroni and cheese but that was sold out so we went with pennies there was a few there was a few other things but they've been super popular from local emporium um so we definitely wanted to give them a try so it's actually made in the us i think and they're importing it but it actually like it really looks like looks like pasta right so that's what it looks like so this packet is um 56 times four how many grams is that this packet is 227 grams and it's four serves so i'm interested to see how much it expands because it doesn't look like a huge amount but we will see and so for one serve it is seven grams of carbs um 12 grams of protein and one gram of fat so that's seven net carbs it doesn't have does it have the fibre yeah but it's taken off like yeah so 18 grams of fiber it's a lot of fiber so that's 25 grams total for one serve or seven grams net for one serve um now the ingredients not that great in my opinion but there's p protein isolate oat fiber wheat fiber egg whites wheat gluten and semolina so you've got pea protein so like legumes you've got oats wheat wheat gluten so all things and the semolina is probably not graded yeah like pretty inflammatory um inflammatory um yes so probably more if you're a non um fussy kind of low cover like if you weren't focused on your ingredients and you're focused more on just keeping the carbs low and you miss pasta this is probably for you yeah i'm interested to see what it tastes like but i can say based on the ingredients it wouldn't be something that we would eat regularly but i know some people you know that i care about ingredients they just care about the carbs so seven grams of carbs is definitely workable into a meal so what we thought we would do is cook up a bag of it and we'll try some of it just when it's cooked and then we're going to make some macaroni and cheese and some penne and cheese and see how it turns out so the directions is just like cooking normal pasta so bring water to a boil and cook pasta for approximately 10 minutes so i have seen a few people say on instagram that it took a lot longer than that to cook get soft yeah so we've got some water on the stove so let's get cooking so the price is 13.95 for a packet so not like pasta it is a lot more expensive than the pasta that you're going to be buying at the supermarket yeah so what's that a serve then so what's 14 divided by four 3.50 yeah 3.50 so we've got our cheese sauce on the go over here our water is boiling so i'm going to add in our pasta and then 10 minutes it says so we will check on it in 10. okay so that's been 10 minutes that it's been boiling i'm just gonna say it feels very firm um let me just cut it it's not it's still pretty hard so we'll keep it cooking for a bit longer see how we go so we've done another five minutes it's still pretty firm so i'm gonna keep it going it has softened a bit and i can see the size of it has grown um but i still think you'd want it like it's still quite firm okay so i guess that's roughly 20 minutes i forgot to put another timer on after the 15 minute taste test still feels pretty firm let's see i mean i don't know maybe it's just food oh that's probably better what do you think jim oh yeah that's close done another couple of minutes i will maybe give it another three or four minutes and we'll probably call it a day then we're calling it it was about 23 minutes i'm gonna drain it and then we're gonna try a little bit before we make the macaroni steaming in here so it's definitely increased in volume so that's the size of the packet and this is the um they've gone from like yeah that big yeah they've and they're much yeah they've definitely swollen so that was twin about 23 minutes roughly that we boiled them for and they're still firm like kind of they're still like pasta though we'll just kind of taste it it tastes pretty close to pasta the texture is probably not quite the same that's it touch firmer no not firmer but but it doesn't it's not rubbery or anything like that no it's just a different texture like a slightly different texture in your mouth yeah probably less spring maybe because like when you eat like a lego's pasta or something it probably has a bit more yes to explain how to spring yeah so it's kind of full like you can see it's kind of falling apart and a few of them have kind of fallen apart um but the flavor like that's the most pasta like flavor i've had once you make it into your pasta dish whether that be bolognese on top alfredo carbonara mac and cheese the pasta is a vessel to get the sauce in so let's see how this mac and cheese goes so what i was going to do is i've just made some of our cheese sauce which we will link the recipe for below it's super easy and really delicious so i'm just really going to stir the cheese sauce through the pasta pop some grated cheese on top and bake it in the oven i can't wait to try it it smells pretty good in here it looks good too pretty good did you show it yeah you want to slide off but it looks pretty good looks like i mean it looks a lot like mac and cheese yeah it does it's going to be hot so yeah well it's not not dry it's not dry pretty good i mean you wouldn't know that wasn't regular pasta i mean in terms of pasta substitutes that's probably the the best one i've tried i mean there are a couple of things that make it a little bit prohibitive the ingredients the price and the price so it's definitely not going to suit everybody definitely isn't something i would probably eat regularly yeah i mean particularly if your aim is weight loss yeah but i think you could feed that to people and they wouldn't know that it was not regular pasta all right don't you reckon yeah it's pretty nice really held its shape well um it probably was good like even that extra bit of time cooking in the oven i was worried it was going to dry out um but it doesn't happen it's pretty good well we hope that you found this video useful if you are interested in what the great low carb bakery co great low carb bread coat great low carb bread co pasta substitutes or like they have a whole range of different pasta varieties um this was just the penne one but yeah honestly i reckon i mean it just tastes like regular pasta to me if you had seen it on low carb emporium and weren't sure about whether it was worth the price um or whether you would eat it it tastes like regular pasta so if you want to have that regular pasta feel without eating the regular pasta and the kind of heavy feeling you would get from the regular pasta i think this would be worth trying for sure anyway we hope you found this video useful we'd really appreciate it if you would give it a thumbs up let us know in the comments below if you would give this a try or not subscribe to our channel and we'll see you next time bye", "LWxQusT1xrw": "[Music] hi everyone hi we just got our favorite delivery from low carb emporium and we're going to show you what we ordered erica does the order i have no idea what's in it she just said she doesn't need that kind of a while ago i also have no idea what's in it i know that i normally look at the new stuff and i want to try some of our old favorites and then i just yeah add some things that i know that we'll always use um i will say we have a discount code for low-carb emporium which is have butter5 so make sure you use that if you're going to pop an order in and i'd recommend kind of if you want anything for christmas entertaining to jump on and do an order asap to make sure you get it before christmas because australia post seems to be i would order the apricot jam to make our bait come and be because that is a winner okay there's no apricot jam in there no [Laughter] probably not but i was insane i don't think they wanted a recommendation for christmas i would make that camembert with the apricot jam from paul fallon hill farms okay i can see and mingle i can see what's probably going to be vital works or something chocolate related do you want to open that up okay let's have a look they always package everything really well um because especially with chocolate yeah summer you can if you like you can add on ice creams i think you pay like a dollar or two to make sure that it's not melted but i was like well if it melts ah damn will still eat it anyway so all good and they also have a pop-up in summer saying stuff melts when we send it yeah be aware that it's summer so okay well this was in the what's new section so it is the vita works raspberry and macadamia bar which we have not tried before um we love their like original bar which was just plain so raspberry and macadamia sounds delicious so i had to give that a try um and i also uh the uh the only protein bar i like are these smart protein apricot and coconut so i got a few of those i just like to have them in the cupboard um i can you know chop it in my handbag if i want something to eat and i like them so i've i only like that flavors i don't know we might have to give this a try later then oh okay yeah that was another new thing okay okay so we've got le caco chocolate and peanut butter mousse oh what that sounds delicious i know so it's like a dry mix and you add coconut cream and make it into a mousse so i was like i love this erika doesn't like mousse so i'm really excited but it's peanut butter so you know i'll give it a crack but i also thought oh maybe i could do something with that for christmas like you know put it into little um glass things with some whipped cream on top and i thought yeah i was just like oh i'm interested to try it and it might be something cool for christmas what else have you found in there oh another video so these are keep keto keto crackers sweet chili so these are new yep we haven't tried the sweet chili so this brand used to be keto kitchen corner actually grab out of the cupboard we've got a packet of their old label so these garlic bread crackers are delicious and we always have some in the cupboard and the brand is keto kitchen corner but they've now changed over to keep keto is the name and this is their new packaging and they came out with a new flavor that's sweet chili what are the carbs on this so the serving size is 25 grams so there's three serves in this package that's pretty decent one gram of carbs per serving per 100 grams it's 3.9 so that's really good we haven't tried interested in the sweet chili cracker i was just like oh they smell nice so they're kind of this like small little round crackers but they're pretty sturdy i'm a crumb oh yeah they're good garlicky they taste quite similar to the garlic bread but there is a little chili at the end i like them they are good we usually have those in the cupboard oh they do have a bit of kick at the end don't they yeah and then like that's so easy to get some dip you've got those if they do have a kick at them yeah just hit me okay next up we have the monday food co granola this is crunchy peanut butter there's a theme here guys very good under order peanut butter so that's what the packaging looks like and there is the serving size is 60 grams and it's 3.8 grams of carbs per serving it's pretty good 60 grams that's a decent size service and 6.3 per 100 now we would use a granola like a kind of topping for yogurt we would have some yogurt we might put some nut butter on that yogurt a little bit of berries and this and that is delicious it is a massive burger that's a very good card for granola as well what's a sweetener xylitol oh maybe there is some jam in there okay i also need a jar i usually just chuck um some of these taco seasoning from mingle in we have a taco pie recipe that i'll make quite often that recipes on our website uh also just if i'm making taco mix like when um my niece and nephew came around for dinner a few nights ago i just made mints with this and we got low-carb rats and they were happy it's not jam it's chocolate hazelnut nut butter so i like nutella yeah so the ingredients are hazelnut caramel coconut coconut blossom nectar and cacao powder and one tablespoon is a serve and you get 2.3 grams of carbs per serve that's the packaging there we've never had that we've never it's from melrose okay i wonder if that's a new one or if i just who knows what i'm thinking when i do this so this is strange oh yeah so they haven't all transitioned over to the new that's just the garlic bread so we bought the garlic bread and the sweet chili so we're all set for our crackers our win our christmas christmas raisin butters um next up we have the beach harvest um coconut chips these are so good these version is the smoky barbecue and then there's just the plain kind of salt version the carbs are the whole packet is a serve as well which is excellent i love that 3.4 on the plane and 3.4 on the bumper you probably wouldn't need a whole packet but i just like it it's not nice and weak oh there's 10 serves in a packet but these smoky but if you like barbecue shakes yes they are good and they're like crunchy like they're really really crispy and crunchy they're delicious this is another new thing that i hadn't seen before so this is twins pantry keto smoked paprika nutmegs so we have tried their pesto almonds before and they're really delicious so i was interested to try this and i love anything smoky smoked paprika so this is 1.3 grams per serve and a serve is 25 grams so you'd probably have two serves let's be honest at least but yeah there's almonds there's all sorts of nuts and seeds in there yeah and it looks really kind of you know very well seasoned i started i think there are some pecans in there so yeah pumpkin seeds almonds all sorts i just spotted something very exciting i have been making one 80 cakes cinnamon donuts look at those they look amazing i have been meaning to get them from they came out with them a while ago and they've been sold out of low carb emporium every time i saw that they were there and i was like we have to try these so to make these you need almond milk cream or coconut cream dried yeast which is a bit annoying to have to add that um two large eggs butter or coconut oil and a doughnut mold to make and they've got the micro breakdown if you use cream and butter or coconut cream and oil so you've got a dairy free option yeah that's good so the carbs on the cream and butter is 2.2 and the carbs on the coconut cream is 2.3 correct coconut cream for one donut wow okay and i did see like i don't have a donut mold and i probably don't want to buy it just to make this so she did say you could do it in muffin molds and kind of no just shape it into you know roll it in the cinnamon kind of stuff um and yeah you get the gist of it but do you think you need a do you need a hole in your donut okay we're at the end last thing this was another one that was in the new new section so these are low carb wraps so there's six grams of carbs per wrap and they do have wheat and what not in them but they look like a regular right they're pretty good they look pretty good what were the carbs six grams of carbs per wrap so that brand is ancient harvest this was another product that was in the new section and i thought i'd just give it a go because people usually ask us what those things are like what are you most looking forward to trying can we try maybe i could make a christmas day we could have a donut truffle i think we should try some of this actually i'm interested i think these will be really yummy we should save them for christmas maybe there's some serious now i will also say that we have tried the um raspberry white chocolate from world naturally and it was okay but there's a little now we can do it right there is so many raspberry bits in there notice you got the bigger bit down well you really get the raspberry flavour this is nicer than 100 100 nicer than the one actually the texture in the dish is nicer that's good so the servings on this is two per packer and it's four grams four point four grams i like that it's two per packet as well because you're likely to two two little squares that is delicious i don't get the macadamia no but the raspberries really nice yum so if you want to know the prices of any of this stuff it's best to just go on to the low-carb emporium website um if you're looking to place an order as erika said don't forget the have butter five for a five percent discount place your orders now for christmas if you aren't going up to chris hopefully you found this video useful guys give it a thumbs up subscribe to our channel and thank you so much for watching [Music] bye", "4arVWlUKaog": "hi everyone hi today's video is a product video maybe is what i would say and it's pretty exciting it is sweetened yogurt like with flavors which you can't haven't really been able to get for a while right for ages yes so these two good yogurts we have seen them our us friends living living their best life loving these on their low-carb lifestyles and we haven't had an equivalent here in australia normally we would just eat plain greek yogurt and then add some like berries or something but these are like kind of one portion little flavored yogurts and they're only two total grams of sugar per yogurt um so they're all about 11 grams of protein 75 calories and about 3.3 to 3.5 carbs for the whole thing that's pretty good yes now we have one of each flavor so we've got mango vanilla mixed berry cherry salted caramel a bit of a curve ball all the rest of fruit and peach and we are going to give them all a try and let you know what our favorites are and what we think of them so these are available in kohl's we had looked at a couple of different coals before we could find it but it is at our local one in newcastle um they are on special at the moment a dollar 25 each but they're normally 250 for one of these yeah so i haven't seen them at woolworth so i don't know if they're only specific to coals um yeah and they're only relatively new to australia so if you're choosing a flavor out of these which one would you choose cherries i love cherry cherry's my favorite flavor i'd probably choose vanilla that may be boring you're not a big fruit yeah or maybe berry like if i was yeah berry or vanilla i would probably do cherry or peach i definitely would not choose salted caramel for some reason that just sounds i don't even thought of that with yogurt well let's give them a try which one are we going to start with let's start with mango okay so as i said they're all 11 grams of protein and about 75 calories for the whole house thickness that's what i want to know oh it's thick it's pretty thick so we recently tried another brand of um sweetened yogurt that are using monk fruit to sweeten their yogurt and it was really thin almost like the yo plays are whereas this fit looks to me a bit more like a greek yogurt in thickness so i'm already excited because um i like a thick yogurt yeah and it's sweetened with there is some stevia in it if anyone's wondering so mango put your spoon down thanks give it a try we're gonna have a lot of yogurt to eat today i like that it's pretty mangoey at the start but then it kind of goes to nothing or something do you know what i mean it's not yogurty to me yeah it's probably not it doesn't have the strong sourness yogurt flavor it's just like well i can see how like kids if you wanted to have a a better sugar option for kids kids would like that because just like a yo player yeah because kids don't well not all kids we don't have kids so how would we know but they're not gravitating towards the group they're not making the kids in my family and i'm going to choose greek yogurt i know that much all right hello jim jim wants some yogurt so what it i i mean it's very mangoey it tastes like mango at least because you know sometimes you don't get the actual flavor in it it's all just may as well be plain yogurt yeah so let's try the vanilla i do like the the texture of it it is certainly thick it holds its shape so this is the vanilla smells very sweet oh i don't like that one you can taste the stevia to me in that one that's got a real it's not as sweet as the mango one though it's more yogurty but there's can you guess there's something i think it's the stevia that you can in that but it doesn't taste nice to me okay mango's winning let's try it what's this mixed berry oh it's very pink so there's not like fruit chunks in it no eric doesn't like fruit chunks it's just like pureed yeah like or maybe it's not even real fruit i don't know yeah that's my my favorite so far it at least has more of a yogurty flavor than the mango one it's probably the winner so far for me but yeah i can taste the stevia a bit in some way is it only sweetened with stevia yes okay here's the cherry this is the one that i was looking forward to it looks quite similar to pink the other one yeah more purpley i don't usually like cherry flavored things like i like cherries you won't like that oh no it tastes like muffins and tastes like medicine don't get the cherry one guys are you disappointed by the cherry my biggest concern is we've got to eat things i give her one special what flavor next salted caramel oh i'm very good i reckon you'll like this you'll like this more than the cherry no no because it's also that caramel that's like caramel flavor no no no i don't like that don't get the salted caramel don't be tempted to think it's going to be like salted caramel ice cream because it's not don't be fooled guys don't be fooled okay last night i'm feeling positive for the peace i'm feeling positive feeling good about the peach oh it's more it's peachy oh wow really peachy doesn't taste like peach okay if i had to rank them i will go the mixed berry the mango and then the peach and don't bother with the other three yeah i'd probably put mixed berry at the top they're nice i mean what would you would you buy them again i wouldn't buy them again because they don't actually have any fruit in them it's just fruit flavors and they so the ingredients skim milk water rice starch cream lemon pulp natural flavors salt stevia live yogurt cultures this is on the mango one so there's no actual mango in it i would personally prefer plain greek yogurt with some berries or with some like even sugar-free jam or something like that to me i would enjoy it more but i think these are great if you're used to having like i mean i didn't eat a yo-play type yogurt before but if you did this is like an awesome just like easy substitute in and you're better off like there's less sugar and probably even less ingredients even though these ingredients aren't super great they're not that bad um and for kids or like definitely you you know you could swap that out you would eat that yes um but yeah i guess they kind of taste a little bit fake yeah to me what what do you think i'm i don't want to sound like debbie down well i was so excited when i saw them there when i might buy them is if i've had like a a day at work and i'm just like thinking i'm going to go and have some chocolate or even like a um the sugar-free donuts what are they no sugar yeah i would probably be better off choosing something like this because at least you're getting protein it's not that many calories you know yeah so i'm probably that might be when i choose it when i'm at the supermarket before i leave work and i'm just looking for something kind of sweet to tide me over till i get home that doesn't happen very often either and certainly if you're on the go and you just wanted something or even like at a service station i know you probably can't get them there but that would be a good option that you know because of the protein it's probably going to fill you up a little bit and it's not you know like eating a big bag of nuts or something but if i was craving yogurt i would go with the green chabani for with a scoop or two of um sugar-free jam and either some paleo granola or um some berries that's what i would do over these but they're an option we wanted to tell you guys that they are now available in australia so if you've been looking for something like this i would definitely give them a go just buy one of your probably very kind of flavor don't go the salted caramel don't do it or the cherry don't do it um but the peach mango and mix berry then yeah yeah we're nicer hopefully you found this video useful guys please give us a thumbs up if you've liked the video subscribe to our channel if you're not already subscribed and thank you so much for watching [Music] bye", "l6QeXbAC2EU": "hi everyone hi today we have another kind of delivery to show you from a company called eat with love yes and we're going to be doing a taste test as well so not just a delivery um so eat with love is a company run by samira who was on master master chef australia what a few years ago now um anyway she's got like a keto food business and i think she's most famous for her wraps right like one gram of carb wraps that's what i'd seen online and that's what prompted you to order it someone had shared it in our group and i got really excited so i placed an which we have here so i was just going to say um they get shipped from melbourne express post where in newcastle which i guess would be classed as regional maybe so it didn't come overnight it took two days um and some of the kind of keto treats looked a little bit worse for wear so maybe in summer it might not be the best option because there's not any kind of cool yeah it's not in a cooler bag or anything it's just in the box so that was just something to be aware of i'm sure the wraps would travel fine year round but chocolate and things in australia in summer is a bit tricky so we ordered two things we ordered the thing we're most excited about are the wraps they're one gram of carbs and there is six in here i think yep six wraps six wraps the size i would say you know about the size of my hand i do have a big hand smaller than what you thought yes yeah so yeah oh they're cute in my head i was probably expecting a mission size wrap erica wasn't she was probably expecting them to be small but they were still a bit smaller than that yeah so what's the ingredient so the ingredients are organic coconut flour organic psyllium husk water baking soda olive oil and salt you could definitely make these yourself because i know people are going to say that yes you definitely could make these yourself but for convenience well it's nice to have a wrap that's clean ingredients because the ones at the supermarket all have wheat and grains in them so carb wise ingredient wise they're spot on gluten free it is six wraps six smallish wraps for twelve dollars so they're two dollars a wrap yeah um also nut free so there's no almond flour in this as well so another kind of nice thing to note so the other thing when we went on to buy the wraps dan's like do you know that she does like desserts so they did have it was like a sample dessert sampler um so how much was this then it was forty dollars and how many like there's a lot there's a lot of pieces in it let me just check hold the low carb sugar-free taster pre-mixed desserts so it's a sample of all of the things that they've got okay and it doesn't say how many pieces but we'll see that so what i might do is put all this out on a plate so we can have a look and we might kind of heat up one of the tortillas so we can try that what do you reckon let's do it so we got everything out so there was actually 12 things in that dessert um mix box so there was a couple of couple of double ups there was also some granola in there and i would say they're pretty big portions yeah so you could probably even just have half and make them last further so try i toasted the wrap it's very pliable and it's extremely thin but it's also like it would hold together now obviously you're not gonna eat it by itself so it's welcome to style doesn't taste eggy because i know a lot of people are concerned about that was there again kind of salty very similar to the nom nom wraps that we like i mean i could see yeah using that to make a taco yeah um even breakfast wrap some egg and bacon in that it's not very big so you're not packing a lot of stuff in it but yeah i'd be pretty happy to have those it's it's got a different flavor it does but you gotta remember you're not gonna eat it plain no yeah but i'll do like the kind of flexibility of it yeah and i feel like it would be relatively strong yeah to hold up to something and it's not crumbly so sometimes they can be a little bit crumbly and not withstand holding something in it this feels like to me it could hold something in it so definitely salty though i'm getting a saltiness if you have been looking for a like a wheat free wrap i haven't found one at the supermarket yet but this would be a really good option um you can order them online i'll pop a link in the description below okay so now on to these and it actually did come with a teeny tiny little nutrition information we just need to probably work out what is what but i assume this is the caramel slice it didn't fare well in the trouble yeah so the chocolate kind of came off the top of it and it's melted a little bit in the travel but it looks very i'll cut you a little piece down with a little bit of chocolate so the carbs are 1.1 grams per serve and it is a big serve like i don't think you could even eat all that because these things are normally like very rich about 90 butter i will also say it look like she used um sugar-free maple syrup as a sweetener yeah i can taste it because to me that has the aftertaste the supermarket one it doesn't taste like a caramel slice to me to me a caramel slice has to have gooey caramel and that probably doesn't have that yeah it's kind of like a sweet butter yeah it's yeah not my not your favorite what are we gonna try next let's try a little bit of the cookie so there's two different cookies um this one that i'm cutting up now is the peanut butter one i think yeah that one peanut butter cookie and the other one's like a coconut cookie it looks nice it's got a little chocolate swab drizzle on top oh sorry you're giving it to me you know i love peanut butter things so definitely got peanut butter in it very moist moist yeah it's quite a wet cookie um there's no crunch there um but it's better than the caramel slice it's nice if i was having a cup of tea and i wanted a biscuit with it i mean that admittedly these had just come out of the fridge as well so the peanut butter flavor is nice so we need to compare with the other cookies okay it's massive this coconut cookie is very big for a keto both of the cookies were quite big and the carbs on the peanut butter one was 2.8 i'm a bit intrigued on the carbs on these because for that caramel slice i can't believe that would be 1.1 for one a piece that size only from creating recipes myself even if you're just using small amounts of almond meal and stuff like that it still adds up so this is a coconut cookie looks very coconutty i like coconut it's got kind of shredded coconut in them it's like a macaroon it is like a macaroon i like that and it's 0.9 grams of carbs wow for that big cookie okay i'm assuming per serve is the whole cookie it doesn't say anything else so it's nice it's not too sweet it's just coconutty it's nice yeah i really like it that's my favorite so far coconut cool that's nice yeah okay so we should go into what is the coconut i feel like this is going to be the bounty bar oh yeah i mean i like coconut so um she's obviously definitely latched on to the coconut and the peanut butter so the bounty bar is 2.1 that's funny because it's all it's also like the smallest one it's really crumbly a little bit falling apart but that could be from the transit there's something there i don't like hmm i can't pick up what it is i think it's the chocolate i'm not sure what she just said sugar-free dark chocolate i'm not sure what dark chocolate it is but the filling's nice i like the coconutty filling the chocolate just has a bit of a funny flavor maybe yeah there's something i would say the coconut cookie and the peanut butter cookie so far are the winners this one's peanut butter as well i think peanut butter slice coconut slice peanut butter coconut slices ah pbcs right i was like peanut butter coconut sliced two of my favorite things together so it's three layers there's like a layer on the bottom and then a peanut buttery kind of layer and then chocolate on top and it is 3.2 grams of carbs per serve that's nice peanut buttery gooey kind of yeah i love that one the sizes of them are very big you definitely wouldn't be able to eat a whole one which would be good because you can maybe just cut them in half put some in the freezer and then you've got them there if you just want something small so i'm not i can't remember if i mentioned but the kind of sampler pack was forty dollars um for 12 pieces so really it could be 24 serves because they're they're quite big they are quite big i think this is the snickers sneakers yum okay peanut butter definitely playing into erica's favorite kind of flavors here thank you so there was chocolate all the way around that i actually think she does well with the peanut butter flavor there's no caramel in it like a snickers but it's yummy i like that one yeah i like the snickers last one is the brownie it's in the middle so it's going to be a little bit looks fluffy it looks like a good brownie texture to me like dense like you would expect oh that's nice that's good it's like a regular brownie to me probably a shame we started with the caramel slice to be honest because all of the others have been pretty good yeah i like the brownie probably the brownie and the snickers i like the coconut cookie i wouldn't bother with the caramel sauce because i mean you can i don't know if you can can't really see i guess but it's like really pale like it just looks like butter to me i think maybe that's what i had in my head and we've tried a few different caramel slices and quite often that's the case where it has been because you don't because sweeteners don't caramelize like sugar does so it's hard to get the caramel and you can just end up with like a sweet butter now the last thing we haven't tried yet which we got a sample of in the thing was her granola which looks delicious it looks really crunchy so it's got coconut flakes seeds there's almond flakes in there from what i can see oh yeah there's some little clusters that's the test of a good granola for me i like my clusters it's a lot of almond it's nice what's the carbs on the granola is this a three three for this serve it doesn't say what a serving size is on this packet right i can only assume it is what we got it's nice it's nice i still probably prefer yours i just don't like with the the maple syrups from the supermarket like those ones i get an aftertaste with them it's not that bad but i just am aware of it okay what's your favorite of the sweet things of the sweet things i would say the brownies probably up there that coconut cookie i would definitely halve the servings like i would probably only eat half if i wanted a sweet treat um but i would probably say top three brownie coconut cookie and maybe the peanut butter bar actually what would you say i yeah i really like the snickers the brownie and the coconut cookie was probably been my top three i did really like the wraps if i was going to order anything again it would probably be the wraps just for convenience purposes even though i know i can make something similar at home here it would be nice to have some of those in the freezer for you know just be able to grab it out would it would you order anything again um i don't know that i'd probably order the sweet stuff again just because i'm trying to stay away from the sweet stuff more anyway so that's not a judgment on the quality of the products or anything just that i'm trying to the more sweet i eat the more sweet i want so um definitely i will do the wraps again um purely for a convenience thing we can make our own but we don't often make our own so um that would be like erica said really good to have in the freezer you know if we wanted a brekkie wrap or um tacos or something like that so we will put all the details about eat with love in the description below if you wanted to have a look and maybe put in an order so i think they ship out mondays and tuesdays express posts from victoria so definitely check them out because it's awesome to see some you know different keto dessert and wrap options available here and when i was ordering them it did say that the desserts would need to be kept in the fridge so i was a little bit if it was coming by express post they wouldn't be in the fridge so it was probably my own fault i probably would only order them in winter if i was going to order them all the cookies and stuff would be fine yeah true well hopefully you found this video useful if you have please guys give us a thumbs up subscribe to our channel and thank you so much for watching [Music] bye", "PbhXAGTN_o0": "hi everyone hi we're making a frittata today kind of like a mediterranean-style frittata maybe you could say that it's vegetarian we love frittatas and we will quite often make a frittata on a sunday and then i can portion it up dan can take some to work we'll pop some in the freezer and it's a really good grab-and-go option you can eat it hot cold it travels well i like to heat mine up in the microwave at work just because i like it like a little bit warm but you could definitely eat it like straight out of the fridge or even on the go so sometimes i do a lot of driving for work and if i wanted to eat breakfast this kind of thing is really good because i can eat it while i'm driving yes and you can use whatever flavors you like in a frittata like it's a good way of using up kind of any leftover bits of meat or veggies that you have at the end which is quite often what you would yeah um but this one is really yummy and it's really delicious flavors of like salty creamy feta and then kind of a sweet roasted capsicum and i think it's really yummy um now roasted capsicums you can roast your own um we'll we've got instructions on how to do it on our website how butter will travel i'm pretty sure i've done a video as well yeah it's it's pretty easy but if you don't have time you can buy them at the supermarket but it can be a bit tricky to find ones that don't have vegetable oils and or sugar in them so this is the one that erica found was the best and it's late press um fire roasted red peppers so there is a little bit of sugar in it but per 100 grams it's 3.7 grams of carbs so like that's pretty good and the ingredients are red peppers water food acid sugar and salt so there's only a small amount of sugar in there yeah we couldn't find one that didn't have sugar in it unfortunately but um we didn't want to roast our own so this was the best option that was the best option and at least didn't have vegetable oil and sugar like the other ones there so i went with this one but if you don't you know if that concerns you you can certainly roast your own or maybe have a bit of a hunt around for better options that was just the best option at our woolworths so we've got all our ingredients here so we've got some eggs a bit of cream and parmesan cheese salt pepper the feta that we've crumbled and our roasted capsicum and then we've also got some fresh herbs so we've got some chives and parsley that adds a really nice flavor and freshness to a frittata parsley just adds freshness like yum so we're gonna make kind of the egg cream base mixture first now normally i would do this in a blender but our blenders having some issues at the moment so i've got a jug here so i've got our eggs in it so i'm just going to add in the cream and the parmesan cheese and some salt and pepper and then i'm going to try and whizz it up with our immersion blender um obviously if you do it in a uh in a blender that's going to probably be an easier option but i do like the consistency of this frittata rather than whisking it by hand because it makes sure that there's no kind of bits of white or bits of yolk like it's very smooth and creamy consistency i have to say i'm pretty excited about the fed up i couldn't tell you the last time i ate feta like three months plus because we did the clean and simple reset for every couple of months well past that and i haven't had feta so that is looking at me going yum okay so in here i've got eggs cream parmesan cheese salt and pepper and i'm just going to try and whisk this up i'm a bit nervous because of the size of the jug okay so you can see how kind of smooth just that you know little bit of blitzing with the immersion blender it's not like there's the you know if you just whisk it by hand you get the cereal you have the stringy white bits in it yeah so that's why i like doing it in the blender or like with a stick blender just to make it nice and smooth but now what we're going to do is we're just going to take like a pyrex kind of pie dish that's what we're going to use to make our frittata in and i'm just going to pop the feta i kind of spread the feather out on the base the immersion blender worked alright yeah there was one little incident in distance where i thought it was going to blow but it stayed together and then i'm just going to sprinkle the roasted capsicum over the top so this is a good way of doing it is to make sure it's all kind of evenly distributed so everyone gets some capsicum and some feta in their piece oh imagine how disappointed i would be if there's no february there's so much better in the stand and then we're going to sprinkle over our fresh herbs and i just love the colors of this already like how delicious does that look it looks so fresh so i've got parsley and chives there okay so we've got all of our frittata fillings in here and now i'm just going to pour over the egg mixture so we've got the oven on at 180 degrees celsius ready to go okay so that's all in there so now it's ready to go into the oven so that really didn't take that long enough to come together did it um so we'll pop it in the oven about 30 to 40 minutes until it's kind of golden brown and it's all completely set like you don't want it to be jiggly or liquidy in the middle also this serves six so i guess it's up to you you're gonna get six herbs out of this so yeah you could eat it like i would normally cut it into eight serves so i would normally eat a quarter i'd cut it into eight and give you two serves that's what i mean hey here is our frittata so it's all golden brown and it will set through now it was a bit puffed up when we took it out of the oven and we've left it to cool a little bit i would probably suggest even if you're not eating it straight away to let it cool completely cover it pop it in the fridge and then cut it up when it's cold it's much easier to cut when it's cold but this is still a little bit warm but let's have a go [Music] so funny even though you put all of those bits on the bottom yeah they've all just floated to the top like you can see so there's kind of nice fluffy creamy looking egg and then you can see the feta and the capsicum in there and then the herbs just make a nice little bit of green on the top as well yeah delicious it's nice and light it's nicer than like a regular it'll mean it's egg it's still a frittata but it does have that lightness because of the way you mix the mix the eggs in yeah that's yummy delicious so as you can see frittatas are pretty easy to pop together they do take a bit of time in the oven but now you've got you know lunches for your week or breakfast or whatever you know they do freeze well we just wrap them quite well pop them in the freezer and then get them out to defrost on the day that we want to have them and you can literally use any of your favorite flavors inside it even if you liked like quiche lorraine or any of that you just do the egg part and it it's keto friendly without the crust delicious yeah for sure so definitely give this one a try i think it'll be pretty family friendly as well maybe not the feta and i don't know some kids do kids these days they're more advanced than we were i'm sure they get better thanks so much for watching guys remember thumbs up and subscribe to our channel bye", "gSm_Ie6-Itk": "hi everyone hi today we're going to make keto crackers yes um these are super easy basically only three ingredients and they're not too seedy because i know sometimes with seed crackers some people find them a bit too on the kind of bird they've got seeds in them bird food side so these ones don't have any seeds then they're made with almond flour and they're very easy and they still have a nice kind of crunch to them and my test of a good cracker is how much deep can you load onto one cracker so it's got to be ready very sturdy okay so we have our ingredients here so we're going to use the mingle all-purpose seasoning to season these um this one you can actually buy at kohl's the um it's in different packaging but it's this kind of blue color and we also have one egg white a cup of almond flour and some salt and that's how i mean so we're just going to put everything in a bowl so we've got our almond flour i'm going to pop a tablespoon of the seasoning now if you wanted to use a different kind of flavoring for them you certainly could like you could use a different one of them any really yeah or your own you know seasoning mix at home this is just one that we like just going to put a little bit of salt in and then i'm just going to toss this around a little bit so we've already got the oven on 160 degrees celsius 320 fahrenheit so that's ready to go and now we're just going to take our egg white pop it in now it might seem like when you first do it that it's not going to come together into a dough like it seems like there's not enough liquid but keep going it will so there's a bunch of different popular kind of keto low carb crackers that you can make at home we like the salami crackers and the cheese crisps they are a little bit more fragile than this so can't hold a great dip and erica jasmine luckily we have about 45 spatulas [Music] [Laughter] so you can see at the start it seemed like there wasn't enough liquid for the amount of flour but it's come together into this nice dough now so what we're going to do is take the dough and roll it out between two sheets of baking paper okay so got our baking paper here and then i'm just going to pop another sheet on the top this is just the easiest way to roll it out and i usually just kind of push it out a little bit first now i guess with this it depends how kind of precise you want to be about it i don't really mind rustic yeah i don't mind rusting that's a good way of putting it down when it doesn't look you know like a perfect perfect but if you want you could get the ruler out and kind of make sure the edges are really straight and that you have um you know very uniform size and shape of your crackers i like it rusty you like it right yeah that's good that's lucky [Laughter] your aim is here to try and get it into a rectangle and we want to try and get it pretty thin because the thinner it is kind of the crispier your crackers are going to be so as i was saying before the cheese and salami crackers are really good we have recipes for those we'll link them in the description below um but they don't hold up to a big heavy dip um another popular option is a cheesed based cracker that has almond flour and cheese so it's a bit like a fat head dough that's made into a cracker we did that only once a really long time ago and um we didn't like the crackers so we haven't really made that again and we used to make seed crackers a lot so seed crackers are also super popular um again for me they're a little bit fragile they're crunchy but they don't quite have the um hold of a of this cracker in my opinion what what do you prefer i think i like this one that's what i want it for i don't mind a seed cracker if i'm having it for like lunch with curry league or something on it or something you know like a decent sized one whereas this is more like if i'm having a grazing platter or or dips and crackers i prefer this type of one yeah um so i've got it fairly thin and fairly even now it's not in a nice rectangle but you could certainly kind of cut it all off around the edges and it does kind of just you can just push it back together if you want to make it into a nice um square you know rectangle shape but i'm just going with random um so now you want to score it to the size crackers that you want at the end and my tip here is to kind of just press down and then pull up like don't try and drag the knife through it or it won't it'll just kind of tear down yeah so just you just want to make like it doesn't have to be perfect but you just want to make sure there's a line there for it to break once it's cooked and by doing this it means that they are easy to make into crackers once it's cooked right yeah otherwise you're trying to just try to break them apart so you could do whatever you know triangles i'm just going with kind of rectangulary squares here okay so we've got them all scored here so just now take this and pop it straight onto your tray like this so it's like it's very easy to do you don't have to try and handle them now or anything um probably if you had a slightly dry or make it a bit more rectangular if you're better at rolling than i am um but we're just going to pop it in the oven now for about 10 to 12 minutes and you'll see it'll start to kind of go golden brown it kind of depends on your oven a bit and what you might need to do it might look brown around the edges but still be quite pale in the middle so you could just take these ones out and pop these ones back in for a minute or two because you do want them to kind of crisp crisp up a little bit but we'll pop them in the oven and see how they go okay so that was about 12 minutes we've just got them out of the oven and you can see it's kind of golden brown all over but now we just want to let them cool down completely so they might not be like they're not going to be crisp at the moment you need to let them cool down and then once they're cooled down we'll have a taste test so when do you separate them when they're completely cool then you kind of pull them off yeah that's what i would do okay okay so our crackers have cooled down completely now is the fun part because you get to break them apart they should come apart pretty easily where you've scored them um so you can see what i mean we end up with some rustic ones and some perfect ones so it depends how in-depth you want to go with it i'm just going to break them up and pop them on a plate and you want to get them try and get them reasonably thin you'll see that's when you get kind of the oh crispiest option okay so to prove my point i've got some dip here this is just some cauliflower hummus that eric has been experimenting with i will go with the perfect shaped one i like the look of the seasoning in there as well yeah i know it looks like a really good cracker yeah that was a good amount of dip i'm always going to load as much as possible so you just want to store these in an airtight container and they will keep for a while so um you could definitely make them a couple of days ahead if you are having a celebration or something but i think they're perfect for a grazing platter or to have with um you know some dips um or with cheese even because there's no cheese in them they would go really well with some nice um mercy valley cheddar cheese or um something like that if you had um christmas drinks and you're just putting out nibbles they would be perfect as well and they're honestly so easy to make they're not fiddly at all like you literally just mix everything together roll it out and score it so i think they're a real winner

chocolate recipe yes leading into East on this one we did last year we did it's kind of at the top deck yeah basically it's a kind of keto friendly top deck and it works well in the little kind of Easter shaped molds you can get pretty easily now it came out or coals we did a little on a half egg shape while this last year like this and they were really yummy so the chocolate we like to use is the violence chocolate they have white chocolate which is the best and they also have milk chocolate we definitely prefer the white top because you can't get white chocolate in the supermarket and you can get these at low-carb Emporium now there probably is a supermarket option if you wanted that no shoe now have white chocolate kind of top tubes but they are sweetened with now turtle where is this is a cleaner sweetener you know xylitol you can also use the milk chocolate well naturally if you needed to find some milk chocolate that if you don't want to use it by the woods but for us this is our favorite also we have found rider works local health food shops and even our IPA at Neil Anton stops this earth your newcastle hot tip and we've got two ingredients per layer basically so for our white chocolate layer like the top is the top is the white chocolate on top on the top deck yeah yeah so we're gonna use half white chocolate divided about to our chocolate and then some coconut oil and then for the bottom layer we're going to use milk chocolate combined with 90% chocolate so that just makes you buy two eggs go a little bit look further because it is a bit expensive and it makes it not quite as sweet as having the chocolate donuts are yeah so what we're gonna do is do the kind of white top layer and then we're gonna have to pop it in the fridge we'll probably leave it overnight and come back tomorrow and do the next layer and then pop it in the fridge again so we're not going to get this so we're gonna do it upside down water in the bottom but when you pour it out because of the shape of my okay yeah the bottom will be yep yep you can turn it on basically I've got 50 grams of coconut oil in here that's just liquid because it's hot here today and then we're gonna also add in 50 grams of this Vitamix white chocolate which is half of the block now put the link to the recipe in the description below it talks about fun of stove top directions but today I am going to do it in the microwave so I'm just gonna break this up into little squares and then I just like to do it in the microwave on kind of like a 50% power and I just do it in thirty-second increments and kind of stir between because you don't want to do it too high or it can kind of burn or splash or something like I can see that coming yeah so I think it's best just to do it at a like medium temperature 50% power these are my microwave and I was doing in thirty-second increments so I'm just gonna melt this so we are going to use this mini muffin mould so we're going to kind of portion it out between nine of the holes with the white layer then pop it in the fridge and then put the darker layer on top if you didn't have a mould like this you could just do it in like a loaf 10 like that but it might it might be a little bit difficult to cut just depending on how hard it is so I think this is good I mean and we got this from Kmart I think it there easily dollars that came out they pretty cheap they're awesome I highly recommend getting them but just make sure before you start you pop it on something that you can put in the fridge because once you've got stuff in there if you're trying to move it around it's very difficult to keep it I'm pretty sure there's been teased before so our white chocolate and coconut oil has all melted together as you can see so I'm just gonna use a teaspoon just to make it easier to handle portion this up we want about 2 teaspoons of mixture and for us that only took 30 seconds to melt that yeah cause the coconut oil was melted and the chocolate was pretty square melted but it was pretty soft yeah it's quite warm here today okay so that is the first layer of top deck so as I said we're just going to pop this in the fridge overnight and then tomorrow once this is set we'll work on the second layer okay so little top thick tops the little white part has set hard mouth so we're going to make the second layer so we've got 50 grams of 90 percent chocolate and then we're going to use 50 grams of this it's like a sugar free milk chocolate some butter works if you didn't have that one you could use another sugar free milk chocolate but we like the combination of the milk and the 90 percent cleaner gives you a middle ground between really sweet and yeah it's a good mixture because you get real chocolate enos from you % but some sweetness from the milk yes so again on the blog the recipe has the instructions for doing it on the stove but I'm just going to do it in the microwave so you want to make sure it's on a like a medium or 50% setting and just do it in thirty-second increments I'm just going to melt this okay our chocolate is all melted now this is it's not very hot so it's still like I've just melted and then I've stirred it together to get the lumps out if your chocolate is very hot it's a good idea just to leave it to cool down because remember this we don't want to melt this other layer so we want this melted but not hot yeah okay so now we are just gonna do the same thing yesterday and portion it up to put the job at my half of the top layer okay so we want to pop this straight back into the fridge again we want to make sure it cooling it down straight away because we don't want to melt that bottom layer so it's been probably a couple of hours since we put the chocolate back in the fridge to set the second time definitely set look at that little top that looks perfect I know it does oh my god it's come straight out of the freezer perfect it is really like hot day because you get that nice chocolatey but then you get the white chocolate bit - hmm good Easter for sure do you want to have a treat throw these will put the full recipe in the description below so definitely check it out make sure you use our code if you're gonna order some vital eggs from local Emporium but we highly suggest you do make these as a little Easter treat or any time really doesn't have to be a stuff well hopefully you found this video useful guys if you have please give it a thumbs up thank you so much for watching bye [Music]", "747yGJ3a-u4": "hi everyone hi today we are making a brand new recipe it's not even been on the blog yes a brand new recipe and it's a really easy but yummy creamy baked eggs i've eaten it a couple of times already as a recipe tester and it is really really delicious now i'm not sure if it's just because i haven't been eating dairy for a month but it is very very very good it is yummy and i think i like about it is you can kind of put it all ready and then stick it in the oven have a shower because it takes about 15 minutes in the oven and then your eggs are ready you don't have to stand over the stove cooking them or anything so if you're in a hurry it could be a good option also i think eggs are just such a good breakfast for low carb they're very filling they have a good amount of kind of fat and protein and you can usually pair them up with some other things and i think they're so versatile right i could eat fried eggs for breakfast every single day for the rest of my life some people are not like that but i literally if i eat breakfast which i don't all the time um it's usually going to be fridays yes and the the thing about eggs is like you can have them so many different ways because i know people like oh i couldn't look at another egg but there's so many different options to um like include them in your breakfast like a few weeks ago we did our mediterranean baked eggs so similar to this but with like tomato and olives and feta flavors which is really yummy um also you know a frittata or a crustless quiche great way to use up any like leftover meat or veggies from the week you know you can just chuck it all in you know whisk up some eggs some creams and cheese chuck it in the oven and we've got recipes for like a roasted capsicum and fennel one or chicken and asparagus but you can you know you can literally do anything you can also do omelettes yeah so we have like that cheesy taco omelette recipe which is like omelette on like you know upgraded yeah but you could just do an omelette with anything um quite often on a sunday we erica would make an omelette just with like kind of what we've got left in the fridge from the week so there might be some sausages yes any veg that we've got kind of cook it all up throw it in an omelette it's so good yeah or like boiled eggs boiled eggs are great like make a head option because you can eat them cold you can mash them up with mayo i mean honestly eggs what can't you do with our egg muffins we've got a cool like egg muffin recipe it's got like a little piece of salami on the bottom and a tomato on the top imagine if you were allergic to eggs oh i'm sorry my sister-in-law is allergic to eggs and that would be very difficult right okay that's good so you are going to want some sort of ramekin for this dish because we're going to bake it in the oven um this one is about a one cup one so that's what we're going to start with and then our ingredients i mean you obviously want eggs and i think that you need cream the other things you get are optional i like salted like you need to season eggs in my opinion so we'll put some salt and pepper and then we're also going to put some fresh chives in but you could pop other fresh herbs or even like some garlic or onion powder or something but i think it gives it a nice bit of flavor and then we've got some parmesan cheese we're going to pop on the top but you could use any other cheese as well we just like parmesan cheese is quite strong and not very liquidy kind of it's quite dry and you're only using a tiny bit in this recipe so i'm going to start with a quarter of a cup of cream and i'm just going to put half of that kind of into the bottom of the dish and then keep the other half more pop it on the top and then we've got our two eggs here so this is one serve this is for one person but obviously you could do as many of these as you want as well so it could be a good way if you were doing brunch with a group of people you can kind of have all these ready to go and just pop them in the oven and then you know the brunch is already at the same time you're not kind of like slaving over the stove yeah like you can pop them in be a part of the brunch and then yeah and it's something that seems a bit more special than like a fried egg or something so i think it's good if you've got your eggs to kind of crack them into something else so that it's easy to pop them into there because we want to try and keep the yolks together because we're going for a runny yolk if you don't like a runny yolk you're probably going to want to cook it a little bit longer so now i'm just going to pop some salt and pepper onto the egg so i was just thinking this must be like we haven't worked out the macros on this recipe yet but it's got to be pretty low pretty low-carb yeah so yeah the carbs from the egg and the cream and the cheese and the cheese but um so i've put some salt and pepper on here i've got some chives it's really just about half a teaspoon it's just it it really gives it a nice flavor and we have these in the garden so that's nice um then i'm gonna pop on the rest of the cream really makes it super creamy decadent and delicious and then we're just putting about 10 grams of parmesan cheese on the top so it's not a lot of cheese probably a couple of teaspoons would be about 10 grams there we go that's how easy it is to put together so now we're going to pop it in the oven we've got the oven preheated at 180 degrees celsius which is 350 fahrenheit i'm going to pop it in and it takes about 15 minutes but you do want to keep an eye on it because we do want the yolk to be just set and the sorry the white the white to be just set and the yolk to still be runny because also when you take it out of the oven because it's in this kind of ramekin it will keep cooking so you can't really get it out and set it aside if you want a runny yolk so let's pop it in the oven okay you can smell it our egg is out of the oven now it's gonna look a little bit like you don't want it to be set hard like a frittata or anything it's still gonna look a little bit wobbly because it's got the cream in it so just be careful transfer it onto a plate and then tuck in the smell of the chives and the parmesan and the and the egg yeah and kind of even smell the egg smells really good i want to try and find the there it is see the egg is the egg is runny the yolk and it's like it looks like it might look a little bit watery but it's not the white that's not cooked it's the cream and when you go into it with the spoon yeah you can feel it when you get to the egg um like you can feel the the firmness of the egg so it's don't panic about that liquidiness yeah that is definitely the cream yeah it's creamy it look at that yeah the yolk is great um you'll get a little bit of yolk that's more cooked than some that's runny but that is um really delicious um so creamy so creamy yeah completely different to the mediterranean baked eggs that are much more of a tomato olives this is completely different yeah and just as delicious definitely give this a go i mean for us this would be ingredients that we would have on hand a lot of the time so just try something different you know even if it's a special weekend breakfast and you could have a side or something with it if you want but it's actually super filling on its own because of the cream and the cheese hopefully you've enjoyed this video guys if you have please give us a thumbs up make sure you subscribe to our channel and thank you so much for watching i'm gonna go and eat my breakfast bye guys [Music]", "Wkt5seRHxvc": "hi everyone hi today we are going to talk about fruit and keto it's quite a like a topic that people ask about a lot yes it's very popular topic of conversation in our facebook group so we wanted to i guess compare the fruits by carbs per 100 grams to see what really are the best fruit options for keto the reason i like to do it per 100 grams is that you kind of this comparing apples and apples like a lot yeah exactly so you know exactly what the carb count is per hundred grams so you can make a decision around what's going to work for you and your keto lifestyle yeah because everyone does things differently some people are super strict with their carbs you know almost carnivore not really having any fruits and vegetables because that works best for them some people can be upwards of 50 grams of carbs a day and still you know have what their version of success with keto so i guess for us it's about being as flexible as we can be while still reaching our goals you know what i mean like we don't want to be the aim isn't to limit as many things as possible is to include as many things as possible so let's get started so one of the first fruits is avocado is it a fruit you know we're not going to get in here we're not going to get into that debate but a hundred grams of avocado is around two grams of net carbs per serve now something to note about avocado is it does have a lot of fiber it does so if you're planting total carbs you might get a shock as to how high an avocado is yeah because of the fiber but we love avocado we probably eat it most most days it's really good it's got lots of healthy fat fiber you know it's good we love avocado and if you're candy net carbs there's not a lot of um carbs too yeah so it's not sweet so that kind of makes sense yeah some respect compared to other fruits so another thing that's probably not traditionally thought of in the fruit realm is coconut so you can buy fresh coconuts pretty easily at the supermarket in australia can't you and for the coconut fresh coconut flesh it's 3.3 grams of net carbs per 100 grams so that is something that would be nice actually we've never even done that yeah no it seems like something you do in fiji or whatever but yeah you could eat it like that you can also buy the chunks frozen in the supermarket which would be nice to put into a smoothie um but yeah so coconut is another good option and it also is compared to avocado it does have a sweet some sweetener yeah slightly sweet taste next up we have lemons and limes now the thing with counting carbs with lemons and limes is unless you're eating a lemon like you would an orange you're not consuming all of those all of those carbs anyway so lemons and limes are around 2 grams of carbs per 100 but we're mainly using the juice um like in a sparkling mineral water yeah or you might use it in like a marinade or maybe a dessert like a cheesecake or something the zest i don't i mean i've tried to look into it there's not like you know hard evidence anywhere as to what carbs are in a zest of you know which is just you're really really eating yeah but that's where you get the flavor of it from so i like to include zest in like marinades and desserts and cooking and stuff because it really gives that lemony flavor and i don't think it really it hasn't been it's negligible because it's also such a small amount yeah so with lemons and limes you've got a it's hard to really calculate how many carbs you're having because you're not consuming the actual flesh yeah so i guess normally you'd be looking at juice rather than yeah yeah okay next up berries the darling of the keto world very very popular we love berries so strawberries are really your lowest option at about 4 grams of net carbs per 100 grams bear in mind though like 100 grams probably is less than you think do you reckon well if you think about a punnet of blueberries those punnets that you buy will worse they're 125. yeah so so the strawberries are probably 200 they're 250 i think right yeah so you're not getting a lot of strawberries for your 100 grams but i still think it's totally workable when would a lot of the time when we're talking berries in the keto world we're talking a handful you're not usually going to be consuming especially blueberries because they're the highest they're closer to 10 grams per hundred so if you're like me and you eat the whole punnet you you're eating like more than you might think you are yes so i guess what you're right you we use it like a garnish so a handful on top of a chair putting a handful on top of a bit of yogurt or something or you have some nuts with a few blueberries not sitting down to eat oh i mean you could eat i mean what would a punnet be it would just be over yeah if you're doing it depending yeah and the thing is you can work out where you want to spend your carbs i guess that's right yeah so it's whether the um berries are worth it for you for some people it is not and for other people it definitely is and for a lot of people in the keto world it's the the one kind of sweet thing you may be having so you might be doing what we did a lot at the start was a couple of spoonfuls of the real double thick cream that you can buy worse and coles and a few blueberries and some crushed nuts and that was like our sweet dessert possibly after our meal and that really got us through yes and i definitely think i i think it's a better option to have some berries as your sweet thing rather than having something like a low carb protein bar or something yeah something that's you know more noxious i want to say artificially sweetened but like yeah okay sweetened with keto friendly sweeteners i think a fruit is a better option personally so that's the berries now controversial topic when we looked into this this is a little bit controversial because these don't come up on keto food lists very often i don't know that i've ever seen it on a keto food list so a lot of people would say that these are not keto but per 100 grams they're lower than some of the berries a lot of us are eating on keto and that is melon mmm i was shocked yeah i guess because it's got sweet to me yeah but it also has a high water content compared to something like a banana that feels really dense yeah so rockmelon and watermelon were actually comparable to berries right 100 grams yeah i will say probably the difference from for me is you're buying the berries in a punnet of 125 or 250 and you spread those out between two people we'll eat those over a few days the watermelon you're buying like you know even if you're buying a quarter of a watermelon that's still a lot of watermelon yeah you know how much one piece of watermelon is probably 100 grams ish yeah so it's it's less easy to kind of probably not over eat it in my in my opinion so the watermelon is seven net carbs per hundred so better than the blueberries and the rockmelon is five which is close on par with strawberries i am shocked and i want to go and buy a rock melon now i wish i liked rock milk i love it i really like it i really like berry so i'm super happy to stay in the berry lane but even some things like peat you know stone fruits you could like it when we were looking at the carbs per 100 grams you could probably factor you know half a peach in here and there if you wanted to and not feel like you know i know some people have fruit trees and things so i don't i guess i'm just saying don't write everything off it's up to you if you want to factor it in and eat you know other low carb things throughout the day and in the keto world i know some people take the approach that if it's mango season i'm gonna eat one mango and enjoy it and you know and that is fine i'm happy to work that into my week instead of day people will look at it that way as well so fruit is up to you you make the decision around what works for you if you're unsure test your ketones and see what reaction you have yeah and definitely if you're someone who's more in like a maintenance level or like low carb high fat versus keto or like really you know trying hard to lose weight you could be in a different situation as to how much fruit you can include so i think don't write it off forever that you can never have fruit again i'm sure we've also missed some because we didn't look at every single fruit that exists on the planet so if you have a fruit that you like to incorporate in your keto low-carb lifestyle please pop it in the comments below tell me what the per 100 grams um net carbs per 100 grams is so um i'm aware and then yeah i'm happy to try different fruits yeah i think some others that kind of popped up was star fruit which we don't really eat kiwi fruit yeah kiwi fruit another good option so there's definitely some out there and i guess anything that's more sour less sweet less sweet tasting probably grapefruit even um yeah but let us know do you include fruit some people probably just find it easier to avoid it all together so i mean again it's one of those what works for you things we love including berries dan's probably going to get a rock melon today maybe not today but maybe next week um hopefully you've enjoyed this video if you have guys give it a thumbs up subscribe to our channel in december there is a lot coming your way so make sure you subscribe so you don't miss out thanks so much for watching bye [Music]", "In_FWhgPyBg": "Hi, I'm Mike Hutjens Extension Dairy\nSpecialists at the University of Illinois.  Today we are going to talk about feeding to\nreduce your carbon footprint. Certainly this is a logical place to\nstart looking at our consumers because this is not going to go away. But, the good news for both \nproducers and consumers this is a win-win topic as you see when\nyou go through the various points looking and greenhouse \ngases and certainly we know that these companies are going\nto be looking at carbon footprints here in the future. Lets begin by looking at the different\ntypes of emissions that come from livestock farms. Listed on the left side of the PowerPoint\nyou can see this reference from NRC 2003. What is really interesting to\nme is I'm not going to walk you through all these, but if you look at the impact or the most major one that was made \nhere is ammonia as far as  impact goes on the environment. You can\nsee odors and particles sizes they are insignificant. So, then you go to the next column \"Neighbors\".\nWhat do the people or the consumers think about? Look at this folks this this \ntable is inverted. In other words, they do not worry as much about\nammonia because they don't smell it unless you get really close to certain\nlivestock facilities, but of course odor is a big one at this point. Then the 3rd column says what do\nthese emissions things do  to the environment: climate change, quality of life,\nand health you can see it as well. Ta=hat is a very important PowerPoint\nto kind of study to see what are the big players, what are the\nconcerns, and then what are your consumers thinking about these\nvarious emissions.  Now lets look at the big 3. We look\nat greenhouse gases and throughout the entire presentation will be using GHG standing for greenhouse gas.  Carbon dioxide, everything else is pretty \nmuch converted back to carbon dioxide equivalence because this is what the\nstandard is as we would kind of say.  The smoking gun of course is Methane. This\nis one where the ruminate animal gets involved with because it produces Methane \nfrom the fermentation of the rumen gases and rumen\ncarbohydrates and then also as far as fecal emissions as well. Of course the big 100 pound\ngorilla is Nitrogen oxide. You can see that is even bigger although not \nquite as big a player when it comes to the dairy farm.   This data from South Dakota State \nlooks at agriculture contributions so we are part we are a\nplayer. Obviously, so are coal emission plants and \ncars and buses but certainly we are a player. You can see at right around 30 percent\nthis data summarized and presented from the South Dakota\nSpecialist here so  a we have a dog in this hunt as \nwe would say.   Now, lets look at the mil carbon\nfootprint. Brand new data coming out of our think-tank group out of Chicago. You can see that there are 5 \ndifferent areas. Feed production, as far as greenhouse gases and carbon\nfootprint about 20 percent comes from feed production.  That is production of alfalfas, \ngrasses, forages, and grains. Look at the big 100 pound gorilla \nhere, milk production, it's big. So that is us and we can simply say\nsince we can effect with 52 percent of the carbon footprint. What we do about that?  Then you can see transportation/processing\nof milk and dairy products, the retail stores, consumption of people driving to \nthe stores, and of course people disposing of the products that are not being consumed. \nSo, basically this powerpoint says we have opportunities to \nimpact carbon footprint and we will see why that is a win-win\nsituation here just a few minutes. Now needless to say, the government \nis not going to be silent on this. Lets just look ahead here a bit and in 2012 the European Union \nis looking to implement imprint the carbon footprint labels on the\nproduct. So, when you get your gallon of milk or a\npound of butter it's going to tell you calories, percent fat, the daily requirements for human and then \nit is going to say carbon footprint.  This will happen as well as with your\nbeans, peas, or in your soy products.  So, they're going to tell consumers you\nknow what this numbers going to be. This would be important to look at such\nthings like organic milk versus the traditional milk. I call that green milk\nwhich has the smallest carbon footprint.  Our Secretary of Agriculture signed an accord \nin Denmark a couple years ago saying  that the dairy carbon footprint \nwill be reduced by 25 percent and I believe by\n2020 was the deadline. So you say how are we going do this?\nThe answer is a very easy and of course New Zeland ready has\nimposed a tax on animals to conduct research \nto try to reduce greenhouse gases. A couple of years ago our government got \ninvolved with the Clean Air Act and Carbon Council Initiative \nto tax our animals and you can look at the scope of this.\nNow some of our dairy people think about this 2009 was \nan ugly year in dairy. Most dairymen lost 3 to 5 hundred \ndollars and then the government said, by the way we \nare going to tax you another 175. This one went away \nvery very quickly. A tremendous effort by the livestock groups across\nthe United States and consumer groups as well. But, the point is the government thought\nabout this and it may not be in the front burner but I think it's \nstill on the stove. So lets talk about this change ahead and carbon footprint. 3 take home points and we will\ngo through them slowly. Number one, hypothesis number one says express\ngreenhouse gases per unit of dairy product. What do you mean by that? It simply \nsays lets not do it per cow. Remember our cows  s you can see from this \nPowerPoint here gave a lot less milk back\n40 to 50 years ago. You can see here over the last\n20 years approximately or 15 years you can see that greenhouse\ngases increase about 3 to 4 percent, but look at the production. Meat, milk\nand eggs up 50, 20, and 30  percent. So obviously just see as we \nincrease production we end up reducing greenhouse gases and any emissions. Remember that and don't ever\nforget that. Take a look at the bottom one.  This is from Cornell University in which\nthey look at the greenhouse gas per pound of milk: 7.7 pounds in 1944 and in 2007 2.8 pounds. There is well over a 60 percent\nreduction in greenhouse gases and primarily led through improvements \nin genetics, feeding, and management of dairy cattle.  Hypothesis number 2, high producing cows is what you are \ntargeting to reduce greenhouse gases. Don't forget that at this\nstage of the game. Why does that occur? Well, primarily in high producing cows\nwill do this backwards, in yellow, \"high producing cows dilute down the\nmaintenance tax\" which will talk about here just a second. Remember every cow that \nweighs 1400 pounds has the energetic requirements or\nmaintenance as her neighbor down the road or next to her in the barn or in the\nfreestyle and that is important. So, the more milk I get the small percent of nutrients or dry matter in\nthis case is committed to maintenance. Then you can look at another very\nimportant point that I call of the feed tax.  Every morning your Holstein cows\ngets up she has to take the first  13 pounds of dry matter to maintain her body,\nreplace tissue to worn out cells,  to breath, to cool, to keep warm,\nwhatever maintenance functions, to walk you want to perform. For a Jersey cow it \nis only 10 pounds.  Well folks, that is a big number and\nthat is going to come back to something we are really going to think about \nin the future. I'm simply saying smaller cows will have a smaller\ncarbon footprint and they'll be more efficient. We will have some vivid discussions\nI'm sure about this one in the future. Hypothesis number 3, which is actually\nthe rest of the program, what can you and I as dairy managers, \ndairy nutritionist, veterinarians do to reduce the carbon footprint through\nnutrition. So lets look at some of these\nalternatives. The first will be forages. What can we do\nin the forage aspect of it? Well, lets look at some research\nliterature and I think clearly some take-home messages will emerge.  This comes from Scotland and they used equations.\nNow, I have put that in orange because some of these are modeling  and are not actual cow data.  They look at Methane expressed in terms\nof liters of milk rather than pounds like we do or gallons at this point and 2 take home points.  Unfortunately, the higher \nproportion of concentrate this reduced methane production now and\ncorn gets up at 6 or 7 dollars a bushel that has an interesting ramifications.  \nThe good news is however in this study  is that high forage quality also reduces \nmethane production produced to low quality. So, there's 2 important points to\nwrite down if you were to take a test in terms of how are we going reach the accord that was signed by our\nSecretary of Agriculture.  In another study from Denmark\nJohannes et al and they looked at methane production. Here\nthey were looking at again forage quality and here are the hard \nnumbers. You can look at early maturing grasses verses late maturing \ngrasses and also comparing that to corn silage.  So, there is another take home message. Even though \ncorn silage requires fair amounts of nitrogen and other fertility it still wins when\nit comes to greenhouse gases. Remember we are working on that production end of the\nforage element that we talked about a bit earlier. Of course, highly digestible forages\nreduce methane production. For my producers that means NDFD's. We should be looking at feeds \nthat have high NDFD's. We did another simulation using data\nfrom some Pennsylvania dairy farms and here we're looking at production\nsystems. Alfalfa production in this study was somewhat more efficient than corn\nproduction. We did not say corn silage. We did not say what form it was but, looking \nat the actual production other crops. In this study alfalfa had a slight \nedge. Corn silage won over permanent grassland studies in \nthe in this one here and then of course they did \nlook at the breed affect. This has been published in the Journal of Dairy\nScience. Now, that basically says small cows and I think that is the key. Not saying \nJersey and they are using Jersey's but, small cows had a 20 percent\nimprovement in greenhouse gas and therefore carbon footprint. We then go to an Irish study that looked at pastor based systems \nand this is kind of a mixed slide in which it says they can be profitable\nand they can decrease greenhouse gases. But, management becomes important, the type\nof cow we have on this and stocking race becomes a management factor. This is going to be true when \nwe look at all these hints in greenhouse gases. A quick word about fats and oils. The most useful study just recently\npublished by a group out of Canada looked at Meta analysis.  A Meta analysis looked at \n27 published studies using added fats and oils. \nSo, this is a powerful study and good news in some respects. There is\na linear relationship as you increase the fat content \nor oil content in the ration you lower methane production. You are impacting the rumen fermentation and remember that because that \nis going to come back a number of times now as we are wrapping up and look at\nother alternatives. Now, their guideline was for every \n10 grams increase in fat/oil they had a 1 gram decrease of methane\nproduction per kilogram of dry-matter intake. The last one was surprising to me because\nI thought there might be some impacts if it was canola oil verses say tallow.  Fed at normal levels the form, meaning \nseed verses oil, saturation verse unsaturation or fat source\nwas not impacting the results. That surprised me a little bit but that\nis what the data came up with. Just to  show another study this is \na canola study coming from Denmark. You can see this research is not confined \nto the U.S. In fact, it is probably more European research going on \nthan in the U.S at this stage  of the game.  This reflects that same \nimpact that the Canadian meta-analysis shows, that as we fed oil but this case reduce dry \nmatter intake. Write that down on your piece paper that is on the take home\nmessage. Anything I can do to decrease dry matter intake and maintain milk production always is going to increase feed efficiency,\nwhich is always going to reduce carbon footprint. You can see the amount of Methane \nthat the  reduction was at.  Lets go to another one protein. Some maybe\nthinking about it there is not a lot of action here. A very nice study done looking \nat the impact of dietary proteins this is a Spanish study done in a tie stall barn. They looked at very typical \nprotein levels in the diet and the good news no difference in\nnitrogen oxide production. That is  huge because remember that was the 100-pound gorilla\nthat can really drive  greenhouse gases. No big surprise that as you feed more \nprotein you have more milk yield in terms of of protein yield and that is \nalways good news. However, as you see more protein you decrease in efficiency and that would be another discussion in the\nfuture looking a protein efficiencies in high producing cows.  Obviously, we lose some protein however there was an increased\nlinearly of ammonia gases. Remember consumers? They would be nervous about that so\ncertainly ammonia gases well not a big player grease on gases certainly affects the types of \nemissions that come from dairy facilities. Now, lets go through what I kind of like to call \nthe speed round looking at feed additives and other inclusions that could impact greenhouse gases. Well, here comes the first \nbig one Monensin or for many our listeners we \nwould call it Rumensin in here. A study showing a decrease in\nmethane production and at this stage gaming an \nincrease in feed efficiency. PEM is a European essential oil and it too had a big impact. Certainly, Rumrnsin  and organic oils are \ngoing to be big players in terms because they really impact rumen \nfermentation. Anytime you and I can impact rumen fermentation that \nreally means that we are really going to have some \nimpact in greenhouse gases. So, those 2 are winners no question\nabout it. Why would you use Monensin\nover the oils? Probably 2 reasons about 1/3 \nthe price per cow per day and we're not quite sure \nwhich oils and how many  grams of those oils \nwe have to feed. So, a lot more research on the essential\noils need to be done. That work will probably come from Europe because of\ncourse Rumensin is not allowed to be fed to dairy cows in the E.U. Oregano, this a Pennsylvania study and I'll let you read this. It's a big\ntime  player first notice a 17.5 ounces. That is a pound of oregano and notice on the bottom bullet\nthe economics is prohibitive but, these studies are being done to\nkind of getting an idea of what can work. Again, we're coming to the essential oils. There are 40 different oregano plants and \ndoesn't that make you feel nervous knowing which one is the winner? You can see the various essential \noils and various kinds of concentration that you can find in those oregano extracts. Again, you can see a big impact in \nterms of methane production. Glycerol work and is coming now\nfrom a by product from the  bio-diesel area. A Korean study done invitro here and you can see that glycerol \nreduced methane production and increased rumen propionate. So, this\nreally mimics the concentrate story so not a big surprise here. In some cases\nglycerol can be cheaper than actually looking at starch coming from\ncorn or barley sources. So again, it says were impacting \nthe rumen fermentation and we decrease methane production. What about hops? Hops is a product \nused in the brewery industry. You can see it did have some impact\nhere in total gas production, methane production at this point, and\ndid change the VFA production in the rumen. These are simulations with 3\ndifferent varieties of hops. The bad news is not all 3 studies performed \nthe same way. So again, interesting data but not very\npractical to go to the dairy farm today with. Here comes a study looking at some other\nproducts like nitrates. It is actually a couple in here. They look at 4 different levels of \nnitrates. Those extremely high levels and if those were coming from feed \nstuffs you would have toxicity concerns but, it did have an impact. However, it\nonly occur in one of the studies that was really significant. So again, interesting study but tough to repeat \nand the levels pretty scary as far as that goes. In this same study these invitro analysis \nthey looked at sulfate with no impact,  corn gluten did not have any change\nin methane production as well and you might expect that because it's fairly\nhigh in fiber. Lets  at these other elements quickly,\nthese are a coming from other animals in some cases. Steam flaked corn had a lower methane\nproduction compared to conventionally processed\ncorn and probably reflects rumen response. It looks like we can reduce protozoa \nnumbers reducing our methane being produced. Again, that controversy and what role\nprotozoa play in here because obviously protozoa metabolize \nin the rumen and in many cases they metabolize bacteria. So you can\nsee that if we knock that out we could reduce methane production. Unsaturated fatty acids is lower methane\nproduction and I think that is a winner. Even though the Canadian data did nit pick up \non that and I think you'll see more of that. Saponins which is a product in forages. You can see they reduce and Tannins \nboth of them have impacts in terms of methane production and rumen VFA's.\nAgain you know their variability  in the studies have to be pointed out. If you're into cashew nut shells \nit looks like that is a winner.  I'm not quite sure how practical\nthat is going to be, but certainly you can see we are looking a lot of \ndifferent approaches in this area. Lets go and apply this as we wrap-up.\nI want to show you 2 examples and case studies in which this carbon footprint really has a win for dairy producers.\nFirst, lets look at his feed efficiency and greenhouse gases. Hopefully, your\ncows are not burning quite as hot as  this cow is showing here, but she is flaming off all \nthe methane from her rumen. That is supposed to be a joke.  Here comes your feed efficiencies. We've got this on our websites and you\ncan come back and actually listen to an entire discussion on feed efficiency if\nyou wish but, simply shows and terms of the amount of milk 3.5 fat corrected milk \nproduced per pound  of dry matter consumed. Of course\nthe key here course is less dry matter makes a smaller carbon footprint and also means less of a carbon footprint\nper pound of milk, per pound of butter, per gallon of milk or however\nyou want to express it. The equation the bottom is there if \nyou wish to make some conversions. That is fat corrected milk and you \ncan also use energy corrected milk there are equations for that as well. The real take-home message \nsits here of course and we look at this case study. 70 pounds of milk with todays feed \nprices this would be in 2012 and this is around 12 to 13 cents \nper pound of dry matter. You can see that same 70\npounds of milk with a  feed efficiency of about 1.2 would\ntake 58 pounds of dry matter. If I could do for 1.8 which \nis extremely high only  39 pounds. So, you can see a tremendous drop in dry matter \nintake which also means there is a savings. Look at the cost savings \nyou would be seeing there for the dairy farmer. That is a win \nfor the dairy farm, but it also means less methane being produced. Here are some guidelines from Norman \nSt.Pierre from Ohio State University looking at what these numbers \nshould look like. Feed efficiency looking at \nrolling herd averages and then you can look at bulk tank\naverages as well. So, you can see the higher milk production we end up getting greater feed efficiency \nand of course we've already stated it clearly that it also \nreduces carbon footprint because of a 13 pound tax if they\nhappen to be Holstein cows. What are the factors that \naffect feed efficiency? Well, we could spend 10 minutes and on\nthis whole PowerPoint, but we will just click them up here slowly for you. The orange ones are big players \nand I call them heavy hitters. These are ones that can really\nimpact feed efficiency and so you can see there are 4\nthem highlighted here. There is data in the research on every\none of these that say you can change feed efficiency which means lowering greenhouse gases. Days in milk would affect \nreproduction and milk yield.  Forge quality looks at rumen\nfermentations and dry matter intake. Mastitis of course indicates milk\nquality and milk production. By the way on the Ohio State people excuse \nme, the Iowa State people indicate  when cows have a disease challenge their maintenance requirement \ngoes up about 40 percent. There is another one of those \ntaxes you get to pay their. Of course there is rumen acidosis which simply\nmeans that the rumen is not working very  efficiently. All of these other ones are players as well. This is a herd here in the Midwest,\nsimply showing what feed efficiency numbers can look like. \nIf you look over here, some of you may want to print this \noff,  a very good herd by the way a very good Midwest herd. Here you can look at the feed efficiencies\non cows in early lactation, mid lactation  late lactation  and on heifers. Of course, here is your\nhospital pen reflecting the Iowa State data. You really lose efficiency there because you lose milk \nand you also increase some of the immune function \nrequirements as well. A second area to look at quickly is up \nolder heifers. A real opportunity for greenhouse gases again. Basically, there is interest\nin limit feeding animals. This is a dairy farm simply saying  if they can feed less dry matter \nand  I'll be able to feed these heifers cheaper. I can avoid fatter\nheavy heifers which continues to be a challenge on many dairy farms  because they are not on pastor running around\nanymore they're more in confinement.  I can reduce feed costs  and I can look at different ways to get\nthis accomplishment done out there.  So, this is a dairy producers slide.  Now lets take a look however \nat feed efficiency. Pat Hoffman did this study several years \nago. It is classic guys, it's classic. We look at this, C at 100,\nwhich means basically a control diet at 100 percent intake.\nRestricted means at 90 percent of the feed at the 100 percent level. \nSo we  restrict these animals by 10 percent of dry matter or  at 80 means 20 percent \nof the dry matter. Now, there is a ton of data on the slide.\nI think the thing you want see however is looking at the top one is \nthat we maintain the protein, the mineral levels, and the non-fiber carbohydrates. So\nwe don't under feed the animals, we just pack those nutrients \nin fewer pounds of dry matter. Then you come down to the next one, \nyou can see energy intake is very similar in all 3 cases in terms of the\namount of energy expressed as TDN or the net energy system. So what we are doing is \nrestricting dry matter, but in most cases that is fiber \nor carbs, not proteins and micronutrients. Here is the data. Again, a very very complete slide in rather than \njust give you bulleted items you can study these or you can print\nthese out. You can see the initial weights and \nthe final weights. The bottom line in green or \"Growth\" it simply says these animals, much like what beef \npeople told us would happen, when on restricted feed intake these \nanimals actually had a better average  daily gain and a better conversion of\nfeed efficiency. Now, if you are looking at carbon footprint there it \nis down in blue, \"Excretion\". Notice we're getting out of the manure \nbusiness by almost 2 pounds of manure dry matter. I didn't say 2 pounds of manure but, 2 pounds of manure dry matter. A lot \nof manure is at 80 to 85  percent moisture. So you can see you know we are talking about \nbig shovels, big shovels  at this stage of the game. Now does the behavior change?  Yes, certainly eating times, standing\ntimes. They will be quite vocal especially the first couple weeks at\nthis stage of the game because they are hungry until they adjust to this \nat this stage the game. You can see that the behavior \nof the animal will change as well, but the good news is they grew and grew\nvery well. Now, the question is well what \nhappened to milk production? So, we did this old bar graph\nhere looking at 305 day milk  in the first lactation. That is the last at data I have seen \nfrom Pat Hoffman there, but you can see why these are not statistically\nsignificantly different. Pretty interesting trend isn't it? The trend does not go down but,\nactually goes up a little bit. So, suddenly you don't\ngive up any milk. You might enhance it, but as a researcher\nyou cannot make that claim. It is kind of a win-win at \nthis stage of the game. Another approach was done by Doctor\nJohn Heinrichs at Penn State and they look limited high \nconcentrate diets. Similar  to what Pat Hoffman has done. We also \nhave a third one in which we look at using very bulky feed ingredients.   While that will reduce costs, the problem is you get a lot of manure, a lot of manure. The same thing happens with the \nhigh concentrates. You limit feed of higher concentrates diets and they see a higher digestibility of organic\ndry matter and NDF because it means that feed and more effectively used, and we see improvement in nitrogen\nretention in other words, we lose less nitrogen  from the animal in terms of growth in this \nstage of the game. Why do we think about this? Well, certainly Dr. Hienrich points out that\nin some years when there  are scarce forages i.e 2011.  We can use some lower commodity \nfeeds  prices such as some of your  corn gluten feeds and distillers grains.\nObviously, this whole CAFO issue comes to mind. The whole  thrust of this PowerPoint is \ngreenhouse gases and of course the ability to reduce this manure\nvolume and ammonia loss which are really going  to be pretty important. We just bulleted the data because \nit is very very complete. Feel free to contact Dr. Heinrich \nif you really want to  see the data. The high forage diet you can see\nalmost a difference there of about 1.2 pounds dry matter \ndifference. Now you know, ding ding ding, greenhouse gases win\nat this point no difference in growth and performance which is important. The second trial they want \nfrom a 75 to a 25 percent  forage diet. I'm not sure you and I want to go \nquite that low, but the point is we do see a cost reduction when this study\nwas done. We would probably have seen in 2011 as well. We already talked again in this study this\nnitrogen inefficiency and that will be another story in the future besides greenhouse gases and feed efficiency \nwe are going to look at nitrogen efficiency.  Manure out out, look at that folks,  a tremendous difference\nin manure output  and again on optimal \ngrowth was occurring. Now, if you are going to manage heifers \nI thought we should talk about a couple of important points.  Bunk space is critical. Everybody better\nbe on board when the feed comes there because it could be gone in 1 to 3 hours as far as goes.\nWhat is left is basically refusals or sorted feeds.  We want to make sure we adjust the\nrations so nutrients requirements in grams or pounds of minerals, vitamins, trace minerals, and protein. \nGrouping heifers is going to be critical because obviously a big heifer really can eat a lot of \nfeed and you don't want to be limit  feeding different sized heifers. Vocalization can be occurring and my\nmother would never allow that our farm. S he would not allow that\n to be honest with you.   Cost of forages, grains, and by-products will \nbe important. In some years it can be very beneficial and  in other years maybe \nless of an advantage. The real opportunities looks to be older\nheifers probably in that 10 month to  to calving age as \nfar as that goes. Lets summarize  what we talked about here. Well, the data we produced is\nnumber 1. A big issue and probably  should be in green letters, increasing milk yield is no question.\nAnytime you can do that you going to reduce greenhouse gases and you are also going \nto make more money. The use of rBST no question that\nreduce greenhouse gases by 8 percent  think about that. I think we see some of \nour processors and  milk bottlers look at \nthis and simply say you know we want to be green. That is\nthe new name I'm using green milk.  So, if you are producing green milk  then you are actually \nusing the rBST.  Monensin/Rumensin  and essential oils are\ngoing to reduce greenhouse gas by about 7 percent. We race to optimize rumen fermentation.\nYou could do that with a microbial, a yeast product, \nyou could be doing that with Rumensin, you could be doing that with\nLasalocid, you could be doing that with Glycerol or some of \nthe other essential oils. The feed additives you saw that data\nand they can be players, but you have to check the economics \nand the research on that. Of course the bottom one, if \nyou increase forage quality, increase grain levels, and feed more fats\nand oils will also reduce greenhouse gases. That pretty much summarizes every thing\nwe talked about in the last 30 minutes, but I'd be remiss if I didn't have\nmy biases in this presentation. I said, okay  our Secretary of Agriculture said we are\ngoing have to meet this requirement, therefore I'm going to pass the Hutjens law. It says we can only have\nhigh producing cows. So any countless producing less than\n19,000 pounds of milk will have to be sold. All cows will be \nmilked 3 times a day because they will be more efficient. We're going to \nlook at smaller framed dairy sized cows. All cows  will have to be injected with rBST\nand that could  be pretty controversial. All cows will have to be fed an ionophore\nunless of course you're feeding organic milk. Excuse me, producing organic milk. All\nheifers will calve in at 22 to 23 months  of age because all they do\nis make manure from 23, 24, 25, 26 months of age and that is \nwhere many dairy farms are at today. Only cows that produce a somatic cell count\nbelow 400,000 will be allowed to be on the market place. That will start to happen anyway, but\ncertainly it is going to be a winner will greenhouse gases.  All cows in the United States \nwill be artificially bred to the superior bulls. Some Scandinavian \ncountries do that already and simply said we want better genetics\nhere because they produce more milk. All cows will be enrolled into \nsome milk recording program  so we know which cows  are real winners on the dairy farm. In summary, folks it is here. We need to understand\ngreenhouse gases, the relationship, where they \ncome from, how they are produced, such things as the taxing, the \nmaintenance requirements, higher milk production, and then of course effects on feed efficiency at this point and how we measure it.  This is going to be important and\ncertainly I think in the future you're \ngoing to see this revisited. We look at dairy technology. For example,\nthe lack or inability in some markets not to use rBST versus the ability to have a\nconsumer friendly dairy  product. Some of these consumers in \nsome of these markets may say we are not going to be as quite restricted\nin some of the technology we have out there. That completes our program for the day.\nThanks and have a good one!", "uIpje2wW1hU": "hey guys so today I'm going to be searching my second from a six gauge to a five gauge five games is really hard to find but I'll leave some links down below in the description box in case you're needing some five gauge to get to a four gauge Siam it's going to be stretching my ear in this video before I start though I kind of want to clarify some things about ear stretching um the best method to stretch your ear lobe is to use single flared glass one millimeter every three months or so that's the perfect way to stretch I've been using that way to stretch and I can tell you how much it saves you the hassle using tapers spirals hangers and tape and all the other crap has nothing compared to this you think seeing a flared glass is one of my favorite ways to stretch or it's like the best way to stretch there are less complications when you use single flat glass any oh enough of my ranting and let's get started okay so I've got my vitamin E oil here so I'm just going to take this out live up my earring wheel up my clog and yeah not to movie and now I'm going to take that overhang off and and if you can't see it's actually open light - it matches my bottoms these here got from Diablo organics they are great I love these glass all blades and I've even started trying to match my plum so I got so that's why I got nobley but here we go I don't know if you guys can see it cuz I can't see from the back of this camera so maybe but I actually just went straight in oh my gosh they went in perfect oh my gosh that was imperfect I am so excited one step closer to four gauge I know I was gonna stop at six gauge but I can't I have to go and I love it I don't know when I'm not stretching just getting an eerie feeling I have to have some type of piercing now I'm stretching me I've even thought about stretching my tongue when I don't know if I will actually do that but I've thought about it anywho thank you guys for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it and got to see a little bit of ear stretching I know a lot of people was asking me for more you're stretching videos saying here's another one I know I uploaded some years ago that were awful and they were crap so do not watch those I'll probably actually go back and delete those but yeah so thank you guys for watching hope you guys like this video I'll leave a link down below in the description box if you want to purchase some five days jewelry Sam leave some nice comments give this video thumbs up and subscribe to me for warned by", "tmO65u7UG0I": "hi guys hi today we thought we would talk about what the difference is between Kido and Lokar because it's January there's lots of new people coming coming to Kido and coming to low-carb and it is a little bit confusing what the difference is and what the benefits are and things like that so I thought we'd cover them today yes and we have on Facebook a Facebook group and it's called Ozzy low-carb community and I think a lot of people had drawn to it because they think it's not gonna hide key topic you know it's low carb and then we're mainly keto and a lot of the people in the group who follow us are also keto so they kind of tends to be the tension yeah between Cato and low-carb which I don't think is really unnecessary so long to perhaps talk about it and give out a peepal opinion yet so we'll touch on what is low carb first low pub is kind of a much broader scope in terms of it really in my opinion is anything lower carved in the standard Australian American diet yeah and I guess in general we would say under a hundred grams of carbs a day would count as low carb and there's obviously within that a big variance between different people and keto comes under that so if you are kiddo you are low carb by default yeah so it's not like you're one or the other if you're trying to get your body into a state of ketosis which is what the ketogenic diet is that means you need to eat low carb to get yeah so you're automatically local yes so there's not necessarily this big difference between the two quino's perhaps a more stricter version of local where for people to be in a state of ketosis which is the aim of the ketogenic diet you generally need to eat 20 rows of carbs or less per day so some people they can eat more than that and be in ketosis some people that may need to be less it just depends on you but the ketogenic diet is a low carb diet that's the point yes and we don't need to you know tension amongst local business kiddo we're all kind of trying to do the same thing we're all aiming for a similar outcome yes health improving our health by restricting our carbs so I guess sometimes you hear about all that's not Kido and that type of thing keep-keep there's not a food that's Kido Kido there's foods in a low carb and not low carb and generally you need to eat low carb to be in the state of ketosis but some people can eat pumpkin for instance or carrot that people might say is not a kick not keto and be in the state of ketosis the gold the diet is to be in ketosis not to have foods that are not kita I mean ideally the more metabolically flexible you are you could perhaps eat higher carb things and still be in a state of ketosis depending on your health and well-being that would be ideal yeah right that's right but that can take time so the other thing that I was going to touch on is that sometimes you might be low carb for a little while and then you might be keto for a little while labels seem to be really important to people yeah but to be honest it's really what works for you yes and like really all of us are just trying to avoid you know pasta bread all of those kind of mainstream foods and stick to you know more vegetables meats no seeds yeah so what would you say was the benefit of someone saying they're low carb versus kiddo I would say it's probably the flexibility like there's a little bit it's not quite as strict it's not quite as knuckling down to that 20 grand or forcing your body to be in ketosis so I would say the benefit is there's a little bit more flexibility there yeah you can certainly a probably a wider range of vegetables and things it probably is it a little bit easier I guess if you had you feeding your family and that's you're trying to fit in amongst things there's less probably need to track yeah I'm a hydrator and whatnot like on a ketogenic diet you probably need to be fairly aware if you can't count to keep it in check I mean over time you come to know but at the start certainly that's probably a little bit more work to you know if you try if your aim is to be in ketosis and it's probably easier to transition from a standard diet to a low-carb diet then a standard diet to a keto diet like it's a much bigger jump and seems almost like really unrealistic almost for some people yanking if you're coming from bread packet of rice every cat to like you know a cabbage has 10 grams of carbs whatever that's not a good example but yes to having to think about what carbs are in Benegal's I think it's too big a leap whereas I feel low transitioning from standard diet to low carb might be an easier transition and then maybe you roll in taquito as you get more confident that's and I guess a lot of people tend to come to this from perhaps payment yoke so maybe they go from a regular light to paleo where they're having more sweet potato maple syrup and then they like oh and learn about other things I think maybe I need to cut those out so yeah come here a progression and the Paleo diet is still generally quite low income as well what would you say the downfalls or are of a low carb diet versus a keto diet I guess for me personally I noticed the difference if I'm not in a state of ketosis yeah yeah like that is an awesome feeling it definitely improves my hunger signals like I'm definitely I know when I'm in ketosis I'm definitely less hungry I have more energy I have more money yeah better mood more mental like I just feel more alive yeah and there can be that stage where your low-carb like for me because I need to be quite low comp to being ketosis if I was doing say 50 grams of carbs a day I would probably feel in this what can be known as like a low carb purgatory you're kind of restricting your foods probably hungry but you're not getting the benefits of ketosis whereas if I just went a bit lower with my carbs I would actually feel better which seems yeah great but that's probably for me what about you one of the other downfalls of low carb especially if you're not tracking is carb creep so it's very easy to kind of transition away from your standard diet going into low carb and snacking creeps in karma creep easily caked in and this happens to me because I feel when I'm in maintenance which is where I am now that you know I can eat a little bit more low carb than keto but the crab carb creep happens really quickly for me and in particular if you're then as part of your low carb diet having all the low-carb substitutes and like the low carb rate low carb pasta that the sweet REE add up yeah whereas in Quito those things are generally off the table or pretty limited because of the couple much more of a treat than sometimes in low carb they easily become an everyday thing again so what would you think the benefits of keto are versus low carb yeah I guess what I've already said it really helps me with my appetite suppression which i think is a big thing for you know if you try to lose weight that makes what that makes it easier also it makes it easier for me to fast which I want to do for my health and well-being and I do feel better when I do that and if I'm in ketosis that's easier easier technique I wasn't it's much more difficult to fast I just feel better you know more energy mental clarity all of those things just make it easy and then when you're feeling good it's easy to keep momentum and motivation because you're like wow like I'm feeling the other way then what are you doing this yeah and I guess we've been doing this a while now so it's not as challenging for us as if you were starting out so over time it does get easier we can eat out most places and find something that's suitable and we you know we don't have any of that other things in our house so it's it's easy to hear from that perspective I know not everybody has that you know flexibility the downfalls of Cado I guess as you said it is more restrictive than the locale particularly when you're eating out it can be a little challenging and you have to be that annoying person that other and none of that you know side of avocado but you know what who cares and usually now at most places people are happy to accommodate your needs as well one of the downfalls for me with Quito is Quito breath bad really bad and nothing really helps brushing my teeth sugar free means I even use a tongue scraper it's pretty bad for me I also Quito dreams I have some serious Quito dreams but they're all manageable - is it worth it for the positive it is for me yeah I mean guys definitely we we would probably say we've more stick to a ketogenic diet but if we're traveling we're not tracking out carbs so we probably are more low carb sometimes than others so nice wings and round your hats for us Quito sometimes other times it'll be a little bit more low carb we're not that strict on the labels yeah just don't get hung up on the label I think that's the message the number one key for us is always you have to find what works for you Quito works really well for some people and low-carb works really well for some people and don't get into a mindset where to be one of the other because I think that's where you can get caught out we like oh I couldn't possibly do Kido I could only do low-carb well maybe try low-carb see how it works for you if it's not working great or you're not getting the benefits that you want maybe try keto like all vice versa yeah like if you think you're out for dinner and there's a bit of pumpkin on your plate the world's not going to end if your keto and you eat a little bit of pumpkin yeah so just don't be so hung up on labels and remember let's not get like caught up with arguing amongst low-carb and keto people we are the ones who you know have a shared vision about what a healthy diet either and we should be you know banding together to communicate change with most people who are still eating standard diets so just remember whatever works for you is the key we hope you found this video useful if you have please make sure you give it a thumbs up and thanks so much for watching guys bye [Music]", "CfTzmJBRfzc": "hi everyone hi today we are going to talk about the kind of results and i like the word results yeah the outcomes and how the clean and simple reset went we had a few people ask us to do an update on one how it went for us and also how it went for the people that went through the first round in august yes so in august we had our 28 day clean and simple reset so basically it's like a low carb whole food kind of program um so there's guidelines kind of lots of recipes food list resources that type of thing that we gave to everybody we had a support and accountability facebook group um and that ran from the 1st of august to the 28th of august this year and we're going to be running it again in november which is exciting yes we actually started on the first of july um and went right through to the end of eight uh august so we did about two months following the like reset program how did you find it no dairy no sweetness yeah so a couple of the main things that are different from keto and low carb by themselves is the no dairy and the no sweeteners and i was really nervous about removing both of those things they're a bit of a crutch for us um i know when i wanted to snack or anytime i wanted something i would go for cheese or keto chocolate and so i was nervous about how i would find it but really it didn't take long for me to feel really really good but also really not feeling like i missed that stuff yeah i was definitely worried about like feeling more restricted and because you know that's been a problem for me in the past where i can feel really like i've got too much restriction and kind of go the other way um but yeah i think having the kind of recipes that were delicious we didn't really feel like we were missing out and probably the biggest factor was that once we got through that initial week of not having any sweet things i didn't want sweet things as much as i thought i would um and things like berries or some pumpkin or something was like super sweet yeah so definitely the sweet cravings went away really quickly um and because we weren't eating the sweet things we didn't want the sweet things as much i definitely agree with that so were there any kind of takeaways or things that you learned from the reset um well i guess since the reset finished in august um like for the first bit of september we have been having some dairy and sweetness again because we've been working on some recipes for have butter will travel and you know we wanted to have some again after being on the reset for two months and i have found that i've noticed some of the kind of annoying symptoms that i thought might be related to dairy like my my asthma and sinus issues not that they went away but they were a lot better when i wasn't like my asthma was a lot better when i wasn't having dairy so it's kind of a bit of a bittersweet but maybe you know i do need to just not eat dairy going forward that's probably a big takeaway and just that i probably when i wasn't having dairy and sweeteners i was less focused on being hungry or like i don't know i've just been more aware of like that i wanted to eat things you're thinking more about food yeah i know which is weird like this yeah i don't know how to explain it for me it's probably been my moods have been a lot more stable without the sugar cravings i think was probably you know the even though the sweeteners are keto friendly i think they were affecting my kind of mood swings interesting yeah so it was interesting just all the people in the group as well the different little takeaways they had related to that so a lot of people felt you know just felt more energetic their sleep was better some people had blood pressure improvements and that was in 2018 i mean we did it over a longer period yeah everyone else did it over 28 days and some of the things that people were reporting is excellent so we wanted to share with you some of the outcomes that people had and shared with us in the facebook group so you can see what other people experience not just us so we do have our computer here in front of us with some of the um kind of comments and reviews that people had put on facebook around what they found improved and this was a really awesome one thank you erica and dan for an amazing and worthwhile challenge i lost 4.2 kilos and found a whole new way to eat my blood pressure reduced i've had less hot flashes flushes and my sleep has improved i now have so much more energy i mean that's awesome low you know reduction in blood pressure less hot flushes i can imagine that would be good i'm not looking forward to that sleep improvement and more energy i mean aside from the weight i mean 4.2 kilos as well is amazing but all of those other benefits i just think are awesome okay so this next comment the first line i just love just got back from my dietitian video and she's so impressed both with my progress and the awesome dietary content of the challenge dietitian approved the thing i like about that comment it's quite a long comment i'm not going to read it all out but um my blood sugar levels have been amazing which you know is obviously going to get the approval of the dietitian also like a body fat has decreased without losing lean muscle mass which is obviously the goal one of the big takeaways was that the simple part of the clean and simple challenge so there was a comment there about how um she felt quite overwhelmed with all of the information that is out there this was all provided for you and you literally just had to stick to the foods that were on the food list yeah that's it you don't have to count macros worry about your ketone levels or any of that it was literally the main principle was eat the food on the food list and then we gave you some kind of guidelines around that so yeah i love this one just because they had the best 28 days ever i mean wow when you're not having cheese but also you know lost 4.8 kilos 40 centimeters from their body and this is while they're in stage for lockdown in melbourne which we all know like this is you know the most challenging time a lot of people have had so yeah um another good one here seven kilos down didn't realize how much dairy i was consuming that's been a super common theme that people like it's been a bit of a dairy free-for-all because it's keto friendly and it's like i probably didn't need to be having you know cheese and cream with every meal now i can just have it selectively yeah and i think a lot of the takeaways people had said was that they were going to be eating less dairy even if the dairy came back in they were going to try to avoid it being an every meal every day kind of thing yeah so we just wanted to share some of the comments this is just a small portion of from what everybody posted in the facebook group on the last couple of days which you know obviously just made us feel pretty we absolutely loved it um and dan you've done a bit of calculating on some of the weight loss side of things yeah so we had over 200 people do the first round of the august reset and from the people that provided their results so i guess it's a little bit skewed because but there was as low as a hundred gram weight loss and there was high as the seven grams seven seven seven kilos sorry um and so i tallied all of the ones that people provided up and came out 100 people yeah and came up with an average it was about four kilos lost but there was lots of other things like people had done measurements lost lots of people had dress sizes yes you know improvements in sleep blood sugar blood pressure all those type of things but i know what people really want to know is did people lose weight and overall most people were happy with their results um but we got an average of about four kilos lost in four weeks so that's a kilo a week and that's the pace that is a good pace to be losing at in my opinion and i will say a couple like i think there was a good portion of people who hadn't been losing weight like they'd kind of lost weight and then not been losing weight and then taking out the dairy had helped them kick-start their weight loss again so there were a few people who were in that category that were super happy that they'd lost weight even if it was a smaller yeah yep now with dan and i we didn't take our own advice and do all the measurements and everything we just weighed ourselves um and in the first 28 days i lost 4.5 kilos so i was super happy with that and i lost 4.2 so we were bang on with the average of the group yeah we were we're pretty average so i guess from all the feedback that we got and ourselves the biggest um the things that people found most popular you know or most helpful as part of the reset was like the recipes and we are working on even more recipes for the november one so that's going to be awesome um and the support group like it was a really active group dan and i were in there all the time answering questions and you know being cheerleaders so that was really nice lots of people were posting everything that they ate every day um there was it was such a positive place yeah there was close to 200 of the people in there so almost everyone that was doing it was in there the other thing that people really liked was our weekly lives so we would go live in the group once a week we would answer your questions we would um go over how our week had kind of been we kind of each week um had a topic yeah had a focus so yeah people really enjoyed the lives as well yeah and we talked about strategies for helping with like eating out and dealing with your family and all that type of thing so those i think were super helpful too anyway that is our little recap of our clean and simple reset because a few people did ask how it went and how we went and whatnot and we are so excited to be running it again in november with even more you know clean and simple recipes that are delicious and fixing some of the things we learned from running it the first time um there was some errors in the book we'll fix those and so if you are interested in

we did on some rosie from kippy's go and check that video out i'll leave a tag somewhere i card or something somewhere so today we're going to review some vegan snacks i'm not a vegan but i do dabble sometimes all right yes yes you need to project your voice thank you very much we speak loud in this show all right so we have some vegan items from two different companies um we have some cookies from new england and we have some items from um raw gorilla i've been meaning to do this for a while but things things happen so now we're doing this so which which items do you think we should review first so let me tell you a bit about this company i don't know anything about them they're not paying me we're just tasting their food so i'm not going to go deep into anything so raw gorilla says that it is 100 organic plastic plant-based and vegan all right sugar-free naturally sweet snacks so i got some of their raw gorilla munchies whole food breakfast i thought it came assorted but it was the same um the same ones the same maca and cinnamon i thought they were gonna mix it so i could see um taste try the different ones but it's the same one so and then i got their raw chocolate as well they're raw chocolate somebody's saying that's nice let's see what they say here it says if you notice we have speckles okay so it's not so they're all handmade so which one should we try first chocolate from us okay okay guys listen if if our reaction upsets you i'm sorry but we're going to try to be very honest with our okay sugar-free gluten free and grain free and they have added probiotics ready that's an interesting smell i don't even know what maca is i know what cinnamon is but i don't know what my face but okay let's eat the whole thing all right right um it tastes like yeah dates did taste better with seasoning no it doesn't have a nice taste to it you feel like i'm eating the ear what does that it taste like i want to try and finish it it tastes like dates not to finish your food it just tastes like dates when you season dates maybe it might be the maca i don't know what the maca is it might be that yeah because i don't know what that is you just have a little sweetness to it yeah just have a little it might be an acquired taste item but i have to make yeah my mom likes it so if gorilla happens the wrong will come if you're watching this don't feel bad my mom likes it all right the next one we're going to try these chocolates this is almond um salted almond chocolate you go with the ingredients as well cocoa cocoa let me say c-a-c-a-o i guess it's supposed to be cocoa butter [Music] you know they say you shouldn't eat food i can't pronounce the stuff you can pronounce it but we just don't know what these are but that's made because we're not vegans and so we don't really read too much into what we keep friendly this one's good it's more like purple it smells like proper dark chocolate yeah i'm trying this okay hold on please [Music] i feel like my health has improved within the last minute also this tastes this might be another acquired taste item another quite a taste one okay okay all right yeah i'm gonna try it again okay tastes healthy now for the breakfast for the muesli chocolate chip by the way everything here is keto okay so if you're on a keto diet you can get these items okay i i have high hopes for this one battery this is how it looks inside the box okay okay i don't think i can um get the pieces okay ready something is right i normally eat healthy sometimes you know that means that means in the real healthy stuff vegan is different from health no some vegan people will say they must be doing some i will all right so we got in what we have in this one let me see what we have in there i think we got a bit of something sorry my audience is also trying it behind the scenes the chocolate chunk there so let's see that and i think pumpkin season yeah i can see a bit pumpkin so let's see if we're right it says sunflower seed coconut chips and we didn't see that cocoa paste flaxseed locomotive pumpkin seeds chia seed organic ingredients okay what do you think i think that i'm gonna actually help this one i can live with this one i could actually put this from the sunflower give it an extra boost i need it i like it so it's brilliant yeah this is good that's a nice snack yeah eating this watching the movie yeah the top is a bit strong though oh it's very strong um that's actually nice everything except the chocolate everything is upset the chocolate it probably tastes better in milk drink the water okay so what's our verdict on the raw gorilla snacks i think um give it to them a rating from i can't give it i can't give it i have good reason because i think that a proper vegan person would have to be the one to rate this stuff because to me but suppose you're deciding okay i'll become a vegan and you're looking for snacks i would say if you if you're a new vegan don't try these snacks wait until you become a seasoned vegan and then you can try it this to be honest i can work with this one yeah yes i can i can snack on everything else it's a no for me yeah i'm sorry well if you're on a keto diet you shouldn't be having sugars on stock yeah so i guess your body will get accustomed to not having a sugar and having any snack would be tasty to you so you might enjoy i don't know but please don't be mad with us if this comes we just it's too strong i think it requires us to work ourselves in yes and acquire the take a slow journey yes i think we just jump straight into deep end with this one yeah all right so now we're going to try some cookies so the first thing we're going to try is the fruit short bread yeah this one was open already let's try the orange orange i'm not orange you want to try the orange first so we can get the taste of my mouth we're gonna try to go wrong with that video orange chocolate chip so i must get a bigger okay oh it's not bad as a cookie that's quite good this is good but i'm guessing it has sugar so you know when you have sugar in thing it will be good no preservatives artificial colors or flavors that would help but it's good so let's see what's actually in this so we've got anything to follow so we got wheat flour calcium carbonate iron nineteen time vegetable oils sugar is in there thirty-five thirty-five potassium [Music] that's a lot of sugar okay whoa um okay we got cocoa sunflower orange oil salt all right not bad but yeah it has a lot of sugar in it so i'm gonna try the salted caramel one now i don't think people love that because from that one [Music] [Music] she's doing it on purpose all about the ingredients then okay so this one is salted caramel flavor this is probably the same thing but with different yeah as i say basically yeah it's the same thing yeah how much sugar is in this one this one [Music] didn't say this time yeah oh they did 27 grams oh yeah there it is okay these are cookies oh my gosh this one is actually good i like this one what do you think i'm still dredging is better than the last one and i prefer this to the the orange one that really found all right very sweet i'm not saying that that one is very sweet yeah i'm not sure which are the balance of the orange kind of flavor with the sugar that's why they put in there but something can make it too orangey so it's a bit too tangy so i think they probably try to cancel that out but this one the salted caramel is actually my favorite so this one is next one is the chocolate chip and the ingredients are basically the same thing but just have um the chocolate bitty things that makes it chocolate but this one has less sugar 26 grams all right please i don't want you can't break it this is chocolate chip [Music] this is nice well my i think my favorite is this after caramel it's quite nice mm-hmm we're right there to come in this one yeah oh we get the one okay let's have one more the fruit short bread i tried this one already so you couldn't try it this one has the least amount of sugar 22 grams you could try that one let me try this one me and ladies i was hungry oh this one actually softer than the wrist because i opened it just like a proper shot but i'm not really shocked my friend okay well yeah the salted caramel is my favorite this one i don't know because it's got sugar in it that's why i like it yeah but i think you have to like lessen on the sugar more sugar yeah but maybe it won't taste good if they reduced it because it is vegan i'll substitute it for something maybe like honey or something like that vegans don't eat honey because honey comes from oh living creatures actually living oh yes yes we didn't have to kill them together you could argue that with them not with me i'm not a vegan you have a good point but anyways um i guess they will say that you you are killing them because you're killing their hives i don't know that's another all right okay it's the ratings so start to come and definitely it's top of the top dogs with this one here everyone good i'm not sure because they have enough sugar in there well i like it so to be honest yeah yeah so new england cookies definitely i would kind of get that for snacking bits i recommend over there gorilla i'm not sure maybe if i eat more of welcoming gorilla i probably might get used to it yeah but the i must say from out to the two this one i definitely like to get that's what good of a key to what mighty musically stuff mostly chocolate chips yeah and then for new england sauce one of my favorite yeah the with the raw gorilla i think we have to slowly get ourselves i'm thinking i think that's like um i call it like the pro leagues of veganism yeah i think that's control people once yeah for like five plus years yeah yeah yeah yeah sure i advise you if you're just starting for three months as a vegan avoid one gorilla no don't say avoid it i wouldn't say avoid it that's a bit harsh okay all right slowly introduce it into your diet yeah that's what i would say because it is healthy it's a healthier alternative to new england because it has no sugar no added sugar it has all natural sugars so if you are watching your sugar and you're on key to that and you want to watch your weight like yourself definitely raw grill is the ideal size it will take some getting new soup but it is ideal to be honest yes it's good for you yeah because it's healthy anything healthy is what always good food but if you're looking for vegan because vegan doesn't always necessarily means healthier you know because this has lots of sugar this is why i don't really buy snacks but if you're looking for vegan snacks and you can control yourself and just have like one cookie a day then i'll recommend new england cookie thank you very much okay guys thank you once again for watching my video thank you for having me once again you're welcome it has your new so many releases yet no no we're getting there slowly very slowly slowly slowly it's all because of a lot of things happen while my producer couldn't finish this thing because um you know about antigua and stuff like that so they flood out so yeah we should be up and running soon so be patient i'm patient we have been patient yes don't worry it's all coming all right so there you have it guys it would be worth the wait don't worry just work the way you know that too so don't get make us in a twister that says english people don't get your knickers in a twist twist not in a bunch no don't get in a no in a twist okay all right well just don't wear knickers then okay anyways guys i'm gonna try to oh yeah listen i'm not very consistent next year next year that's my goal every yes it is this is my goal for next year to be a bit more

and bye", "CdqiK2-5VSQ": "Hi, I \u2019m kimimaro. Today I would like to introduce you to the butter coffee diet that I succeeded in losing 5 kg in 3 months before. This butter coffee became popular a while ago, so many of you may know the name. this butter graph at that time that we were able to lose weight 5 kg in the coffee diet I think is seen that the Tteyuu quite an instant body weight in such a feeling is here is going decreased by tried in fact I also at that time Kedomo is it At that time, I had a lot of dietary personality and skipped exercise, so I was gaining weight steadily and I 've been on various diets until now, but this is my body and life. I've been practicing this for a while, thinking that it suits my style, so as you can see, it became -5 kg \u200b\u200bin 3 months. When I lose 5 kg, it's still light even if I'm walking. I felt it clearly, and the three holes in the belt were squeezed, and the waist became thin at a stretch, and the clothes that I could wear, such as the pants that I could wear, changed quite a bit. After all, I lost weight and lost weight. When I change, I feel lighter, so I thought that there are various effects other than weight loss on a diet . However, I seemed to be a weak-willed person at that time. After doing a butter coffee diet, I lost some weight and lost weight, and I started a happy life like that, but when that happens, I think my body will not gain weight even if I leave it alone. It's a little confusing, isn't it? That 's why I eat more, eat sweets, and eat sweets late, just like before I went on a coffee diet. To be honest, when my diet consciousness diminished, my life became quite sweet, so I'm a little embarrassed, but my weight has returned to the same level as at that time. So, after a long time, I'm thinking of restarting this butter coffee fee in earnest. What is this butter coffee light? There is a book written by an American entrepreneur called Silicon Valley style, the strongest meal that can change you, and it comes out there. The rules of meals are very simple, and you drink a cup of butter coffee in the morning. You don't eat anything at lunch. It's a basic rule to eat normally at night. Those who are a little worried because they eat nothing until night after drinking butter coffee in the morning. I don't think there are any, but I was hungry until the night when I couldn't do anything because I was hungry all day long. However, I think that this is an individual difference, so everyone does not know the same thing, but this is the easiest diet I have tried so far, so how do you make the putter construction cost? I will explain that. When you hear the word \"putter coffee\", you may think that you should put butter in the coffee and drink it, but if you put in normal salted butter, you can't. is. Rather than losing weight, you will gain weight. This butter coffee has a characteristic butter that you use, and this is the glass fet butter, but first of all, this glass does not contain any salt . What is characteristic of fet butter is that the milk used in ordinary butter often uses grains, nutritional supplements, or the suction taken from the fed cow as food, but this glass. Since pet butter uses milk squeezed from cows raised only on grass, it contains more fat-soluble vitamins than ordinary people, and it is written as a vitamin that dissolves oil and contains a lot of fat-soluble vitamins. It also contains a lot of unsaturated fatty acids, so it has the effect of reducing cholesterol in the blood and neutral fat, and in simple terms, it's a butter that makes it easier to lose weight . Unsaturated fatty acids are contained in olive oil, so I think you may have heard of them . Butter itself is quite expensive. It costs 2500 yen for this one, and coconut oil is added. It's called mct. Use 1 tablespoon of this . 10g of grassfet butter. 1 tablespoon of mct oil. Put this in freshly brewed black coffee and stir to drink . Let's actually make it. Yes, I will boil the water first, but I will use about 150cc of water . First, boil the water, and in the meantime I will draw beans with a grinder. First, I will add black coffee, but in my case, the grinder at home. using the Sonokoro heard in the grinder the beans just before we paper drip because there are. I think that there are quite a lot of people who do not have a grinder, so I think that those people can grind the beans at the shop and use it from this state. Since the hot water boiled and the powder was drained, paper drip I'm going to make coffee with. I tried using this transparent glass to make the glass easier to see, and the way to paper drip coffee normally does not change much. Here, 10 g of Rograss Fet Butter Add 1 tablespoon of MCT oil. Stir with something like this milk former. If you go with a small glass, it will overflow or scatter when you stir, so use a large mug as much as possible. I think it's safer. It looks like a latte. Yes, the coffee is ready again. It's pretty easy to make like this. It tastes like a sugar-free latte. It's not hard to drink at all. is the morning solids until night Kedomo moisture head family is okay and at all I drank tea Toka drink your water of course the way since in the form of do not eat anything until the night by far the lunch drink it to the mouth put not and form a so still Haramochi a was or Toka rest is pretty ne butter coffee I'd think as such Toka work of the head with a become a form that does not take to complete the carbohydrate see the Tteyuu those who are worried drink first after you or was not at all withstand hunger Kedomo I be lying when saying do not say that at all can withstand course hunger until the evening with respect to Haramochi earlier, without breakfast or was another replacement diet I used to just do things like skipping coffee, but the biggest problem at that time was that my head didn't work at all during work, but I thought it was completely different from other diets. It's really refreshing, isn't it ? I don't know if it's because of caffeine or what, but I thought that the good thing about this butter coffee diet is that it doesn't adversely affect the rotation of my head. So, it's a coffee for the evening after lunch, but of course if you care to some extent, you should bear the fact that the coffee is not high in sugar and you want to have a modest amount of salt. However, in my case, I didn't really care about breakfast and ate it normally. Butter coffee diet For the first time, it's been a long time for about three days. For dinner, the calories are low, and the focus is on vegetables. The rest is [gentle] beans, sesame seeds, wakame seaweed, vegetables, fish, shiitake mushrooms, and potatoes. It's good for you to eat a meal centered on this, and this is the information I got when I was on a different enzyme diet. For the first three days, I was also concerned about such things, but after all I drank this in the morning . I like to eat because I'm almost out of the day, so I'm lonely for dinner, so from the middle I ate what I liked rather than worrying about it. I did it after eating a little, but I drank this and almost skipped the day, so I like to eat, so I feel lonely if it's a little bit, so don't worry about dinner so much from the middle I was eating what I liked relatively. To be honest, I ate a little sweets. What I did after that was a simple exercise indoors. I was doing about 5 minutes of exercise in the morning and I got as much sleep as possible. It was said that it was better to go to bed as soon as possible and wake up quite late, but during the diet period, I slept properly around 12 o'clock and woke up around 7 o'clock the next morning. I've been trying to do it I've heard that getting sleep also has the effect of dieting, so it's important to sleep, isn't it? The reason I thought this might be important is to record the weight properly every day. I think this is probably this. I think you saw the graph earlier, but I just wake up in the morning, weigh and record it with the app and do this every day. For example, the first day is 68 kg and once butter. If it was 67.5 in the morning when I went on a coffee diet for one day , it would increase my motivation if I lost 0.5 kg in a day. It's natural that I got motivated and said that I lost another 0.5 kg the next day. I keep going on, but if I say that I ate a little more food there and my weight suddenly dropped to 0.8 or 1 kg, I can realize that the diet at that time had an effect. When you realize that, what is the cause of the effect of eating on your weight, such as skipping exercise, sleeping for a whole day, eating a lot of snacks, and gaining weight at such times ? It's very easy for me to understand that my weight has returned a little, isn't it? This has passed without recording anything for a week. So when I measure it a week later, if I say that it's plus 2 kg, I don't know what was the cause of the plus 2 kg, so it's difficult to adjust. For example, I often say it even when I'm not on such a butter coffee diet. I've heard that you should adjust in 3 days, for example, when you're on a diet, such as having a drinking party at work at a company or having a drinking party with friends, but you have to ingest calories unintentionally. I think that there is definitely something to do , but I heard that even if you eat and wait that day, if you reduce the amount of food or adjust the calories the next day and the next day, adjusting in 3 days will make the book tail to some extent. that is there to challenge me also that the Tteyuu adjustment of calories obtained, but because or there really me of like a meeting drinking inevitably certainly I'd was a time tried even that sort of in two to three days it was I think I was able to maintain my weight. So by recording one day a day, you can see your average, you can see the approximate decrease, and you can also know what you should do to increase it, so I think that the recording diet is such a method. However, if you make a detailed note of how many calories you ate that day and how much calories you had in that meal , it will be difficult to make a note, so on the contrary, this will not continue. After all, I think that continuation is important, so if you are on a diet that does not continue , or if you enthusiastically overdo the management method that does not continue, you will not be able to continue and as a result the diet will not go well, so adjust to your own pace I think it's easier to mix in with habits a diet that can be continued as much as possible without burden and less burdensome . I think it's quite important to make it a habit, so naturally a diet that suits each person is also suitable. I think there are some diets that I don't have, and I think that there are things that don't suit my lifestyle, such as my constitution, so I think there are of course individual differences in that area. Of course, this butter coffee diet also has individual differences. I think that people who do not lose weight at all will not lose weight, and if I say the bad point, I think that there are people who are not in good physical condition or who have a headache, so that's right for me. If you're on a diet, don't force yourself if you don't like it. I think it's important to diet stress-free at your own pace without putting a heavy burden on you .

See you in the next video.", "kC1c3io9bRg": "yeah what's up everybody goodie beats here and today I'm doing a cooking video guys so I know a lot of you've been watching my videos letting this but a bunch of workouts but a lot of people are requests when I do a cooking video now I'll be the first one to say yeah I'm not the best cook but I'm gonna try my best so what we're going to cook today is some keto cookies first thing you need is one cookie like pan I guess I don't know what the word is some Kerrygold butter some eggs and 1 pack of cookie mix now this cookie mix I got from my aikido snack box it was like a little care package I got and it was inside of it looked at the macros really decent macros so I'm going to try to cook these now this will let you guys know that I'm going to one take Drake this this is not even hoping it so let's open it up enough talking that's good to cook it okay so after you get all your ingredients the first thing you want to do is preheat the oven to 350 Jack check [Music] whoo and we're done so got this all mixed up what I ended up having to do I had at half an ounce of butter just because as you guys can see it was just way too dry I think I made a big mistake by adding all the I guess the cookie mix because it made it really really really dry and I was like how the heck am I going to get this like all freaking mixed up so again what I had to do is just add a little bit more butter so I the recipe calls for two ounces of butter so I had to use 2.5 so no big deal but as you can see going to put this on the cookie sheet and then put them in the oven and Thiago [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so the cookies are done check them out man I think they came out pretty decent guys I mean by all means I am a rookie so you saw the rookie mistakes I made when I was making these cookies so you guys are probably much better cook than I am so whatever mistakes I made just don't do those but I'm pretty impressed by these cookies man what's up little pat on the back man chef goodie in the house ah what up kiddo connect what's up cut out the key I'll connect though I'm good people good people let's do a taste test let's kill these bad boys taste I did let the cookies cool for a little bit so they did harden up as you can see boom so let's sell these case a home man Wow Wow phenomenal hmm these things are amazing guys not just saying that these are really delicious you guys are going to absolutely love this I know you probably want to know what the macros are it's a little hard for me to estimate I'm going to let you guys kind of do the estimating yourself so each one of these cookies I try to measure about 2.5 ounces per scoop now I'll put the macros right here now you can either screenshot it or I'll just take a picture of this and I'll put it right there so there are the macros 2.5 ounces there pretty decent now I will say this guys can you eat seven eight nine cookies and still be in ketosis art still be considered kid-friendly absolutely not guys these cookies are not meant for you to go and have 8 9 cookies I would definitely recommend having one cookie a day so you can either have it at dinner time when you know when you want your sweets or you want to have it at lunch just have one cookie as you guys can see these cookies I can go put them in a jar and a little cookie jar whatever you know whatever you want to put them I could put them in Tupperware it doesn't matter but they're good to go they're going to last for a couple days and they're good to go so I can just have one just bring it on for my lunch every day or just have one when I get home for dinner but that's going to be it for this cooking video guys I hope you did like this video if you did give it a thumbs up I begin a lot of requests about cooking videos guide now you know me I'm not a very good cook I kind of joke around with the home chef goody but the only way to learn is I got to

low carb we make them pretty regularly a great way of using up leftover meat or veg that you have but this one is chicken asparagus and goat's cheese it's really delicious yeah and it's perfect i guess if you have people coming over for lunch or something it could be a nice lunch to serve people that feels a little bit special um and still keep it low-carb because it's only one gram of carbs per serve so very low carb but you get about eight serves out of the kind of dish that we're going to use yeah but you could eat it for any meal really like we've eaten at breakfast lunch or dinner and i take this type of thing for lunch a lot like to work for for lunch yes and because it's so easy yeah once you've made it it keeps and reheats fairly easily and you can eat it hot or cold that's what's good about it too so we have all of our ingredients here so we have eight eggs a cup of cream we've got some of our homemade basil pesto which adds a really delicious flavor to it made in the thermo mix oh my god what a game changer um we have some asparagus that we've just snapped off the kind of woody end and then chopped it into small pieces so it's not cooked or anything it'll cook in the oven and then we have some leftover shredded chicken here that we've just kind of chopped up a bit some salt and pepper and some goat's cheese so we really love goat's cheese and it goes really well in this cage but if you don't like goat's cheese you could use feta cheese you could even use tasty or any cheese would work do you know it would be really nice busan or like a herb and garlic flavored cream cheese or something that would work really well even probably like kind of cut up in it would be pretty nice so it's very easy to throw it all together we're just going to make the egg mix and then lay the chicken and asparagus in our pie dish which is this is what we're going to be baking it in dan's just going to grease it now unfortunately we broke up with our whisk died on christmas eve so we haven't replaced it yet but i've got a fork here and i'm just going to break up the eggs dan's just greasing the dish with some avocados yeah so i really really like this avocado oil spray if you've watched our cooking videos before we use this a lot you buy it at coles or woolies and um it's non-aerosol so it doesn't have that real it but it's just avocado oil it's really good so i just put some salt and pepper in with these eggs and then i'm gonna add the cream and the pesto and whisk it all together now we will have the full recipe linked in the description below if you wanted to make this at home it's really delicious we also have a recipe for making the pesto so we'll also pop a link for that in the description below the reason we prefer to make our own homemade pesto is because we can control the oil that we put in it the ones that you find at the supermarket i haven't found one that doesn't have vegetable oils in it we use olive oil in it's really easy to make you we used to make it in the little kind of food processors that came with our stick blender um now we've got the thermomix so we've been using that but it's pretty simple to make you can make it in any sort of food processor or a blender or a ninja bullet even but it is honestly making it easier it's so much so much fresher and nicer than the supermarket ones so you should definitely give that a try and like it's great to have in the fridge like you can use it through just even like um veggies i'm trying to say spreading it but like tossing um veggies in and then baking in the oven that would be really good you can even like coat chicken breast in it and cook cook that in the oven um you can use it as a dressing yeah um mix it with some mayo and you make like a really delicious it's pretty versatile um you don't have to like eat it with cheese like crackers you would probably use it more in things and things like dan makes a dip that's just cream cheese and pesto i think it's good um we also use it in the meatball so it's really good to have on hand um and just make some up it's really easy also if you make scrambled eggs just oh yeah honestly make it back to the cake so we have got our egg mixture here so this was the eggs cream salt and pepper and the pesto so that's kind of our base of our quiche so now we'll grab so we've got our kind of it's like a 9 inch pie dish there i'm just going to pop our chicken so with the chicken you can get a barbecue chicken and shred the like pull the chicken off it and shred it you can cook your own chickens this one was one that i've done in the smoker we i did a couple of chickens in the smoker and this was just what we had left over and it was perfect amount for this recipe so and then we're just going to pop our asparagus on the top pour over our egg mixture we also have the oven on 180 celsius 350 fahrenheit um and it's gonna go in the oven for about 45 to 50 minutes because the asparagus isn't cooked so you want to get that cool and obviously the eggs you want the egg to kind of cook through you don't want it to still be like runny in the center so just pour all this on so now we're just going to sprinkle the goat like crumble the goat's cheese up a bit and sprinkle it on the top and as i said honest you could use literally any cheese probably not halloumi actually but you could use most cheeses and it would be fine just whatever you prefer if you haven't tried goats cheese maybe you should give it a try okay so our quiche is all ready to go into the oven um so we'll show you once it's cooked okay it is been out of the oven a while so when it came out of the oven it was puffed up and it kind of sank back down but that is normal and we've had it cooling for a little while it's still still hot on the bottom yeah it is still warm um so i'm just going to try and cut into it so as i said before you can serve it hot warm cold however you like thing the thing i like about crustless quiches and frittata for me is if i'm like on a long drive and i need to eat breakfast it's really good because i can just kind of unwrap it and eat it um and i don't have to heat it or anything like that yeah and i guess if it's cold you don't necessarily need a fork no because it's still quite held together so you can just kind of handle it and eat it usually okay that looks delicious all the chicken in there at the bottom bit of goat's cheese smells good that's really good it's got our smoked chicken in it oh yeah smoker adds an extra element to it you obviously do not have to do that but it like honestly try some try something good come on try it you never try on camera how good is the smoked chicken in it it is delicious and the goat's cheese and you get like a bit of um basil and garlic from the pesto it's really good it is really yummy and no one's going to know this is low carb if they come over to your place honestly for a meal if you're having lunch putting on a lunch even if you're doing like a bring a plate yeah perfect that is yeah perfect slice it up people will eat it they will not know that it's keto unless you're reading it and they know you keto but it's basically just delicious definitely give this a go and it's perfect for a meal prep so like make this on a sunday you've got your breakfast or your lunches or whatever ready throughout the week hopefully you've enjoyed this video guys please if you have give us a thumbs up that really helps us make sure you subscribe to our channel and thank you so much for watching bye [Music]", "jAtE97YnMlU": "hi everyone hi today we have another product review this is an exciting new find the brand is called halo sugar and they make keto milk chocolate yes so we know there's a lot of people out there who aren't huge fans of dark chocolate yes we don't mind it yeah and you kind of get used to it i guess um the longer you know if your taste buds change but i thought it was exciting to see a keto milk chocolate and what i thought was different about this is there's actually a range of different flavors it's not just you know plain you know with dark chocolate yeah it's hard to get if you're going for like a pretty dark one it's hard to get one that's flavored whereas so we've got a range here so we have creamy milk which is just i guess the standard one now it's sweetened with a combination of sweeteners so there's erythritol allulose stevia and inulin um i'm surprised how you lost because i didn't know that they're both in australia i didn't know it was approved for use in australia yet but this is an australian brand so we've got creamy milk we've got protein crackle we've got toffee coffee deluxe and we've got very berry deluxe so these are kind of the standard range and then they always have limited edition flavors it seems and this is the limited time hazelnut crisp and it's got kind of like um some hazelnuts on the back now let's have a look at the macros and the ingredients on the creamy milk because that's probably the best that's going to be your baseline right so erica read out the sweeteners but the ingredients are organic cacao cacao butter milk powder skim milk powder erythritol allulose inulin organic stevia and sunflower sun flower lethin the carbohydrates per serve are 3.7 and on this one there's four serves in a pack so you're getting 20 grams per serve on this one yeah they seem to vary depending on what one you get with lint it's about 20 grams like for two squares isn't it yeah just a little bit higher than dark chocolate but very good for milk chocolate yeah very good for milk chocolate are we going to have a look yes i was just going to say at the moment i think the only place you can get it is directly from them order online and they ship it out i did like that they had branded tissue paper that it came in it looked a lot nicer before but we've rubbish and it comes in like a cooler yeah well it's not really but it's probably to protect it from the heat and i know they only ship out on certain days to try and make sure you get it the same week so it's not sitting over the weekend so the website's halo sugar.com.iu but yeah if you're interested in checking it out but we have to try this has been sitting around for a little while because we've been doing the clean and simple reset and we haven't been having sweet now yes but the reset has finished now so we're excited to give this a try oh it's got a good snack so this is the creamy milk hmm kind of tastes like easter eggs it does taste like okay seriously it's not super super sweet that's true because it is still 48 which i think if you're compared to like cadbury or something what's the percentage on that very low i think it's nice i like it yeah it's um it doesn't it's definitely not bitter like dark chocolate but it's not super sweet where you know if you eat like cadbury milk chocolate it kind of just coats your tongue with sweetness this isn't doing that and compared to like vita works where you know it's got protein in it you know you can you just know that doesn't have that there for me i think it's nice okay that was the milk protein crackle so what's the so it's protein crispies looks like they're made from whey protein isolate oh and it's got little sprinkle sprinkles on the back as well not very many don't panic you probably wouldn't eat heaps of it either no it is yeah it is rich for a milk chocolate i guess not just sweet you have some kind of milk chocolate get a little bit it's just sweet we've got a lot to try you guys don't want to go too hard i like the idea of this if it's kind of like you know because i like a crunchy it is more oh we're choosing i like the texture with the crispy bits in it it's like rice bubbles [Music] it doesn't add flavor no can't taste it it's just textured to me looks nice flavor is the same but it's got those kind of rice bubble treats in it all right toffee coffee deluxe what makes these deluxe delights i think they have the on the back oh wow the wheat okay i saw this on instagram this is where i found it on instagram this one is not fed so well in the transport it's a little bit crushed it's been around for a while but it's got a bunch of stuff on the back tilted that way it is reflecting yeah so yeah there's like pumpkin seeds goji berries freeze-dried strawberry freeze strawberries all sorts see and i love the idea of this because there's not any kind of even if you go to like gourmet type chocolate shops it's very difficult to find ones that are either low in sugar or like super dark that have like fun fun things on them yeah i wanted to get one with the the strawberry cranberry i like that i'm surprised we like it with the coffee do you get the coffee i get the coffee that's delicious a little bit but not bad that is really nice i like like fruit and nut though so i like that part i really like the idea of that on the back it makes something special i'm getting the coffee but not in a bad way no it just kind of accentuates the chocolate flavor so far that one's winning definitely i'm a big fan of the deluxe so far oh yeah damn love fruit anything fruit dried same thing on the back as the other one but this one is well very very very i'm not gonna have that coffee flavor so they're about eight or nine dollars i think or nine or ten dollars per block so it's not an everyday thing but it would be nice to have for like a special i mean it could be an everyday thing depending on your budget i would definitely buy some of these for easter so i can yes enjoy chocolate like indulgent more so than like 90 chocolate i got a freeze-dried strawberry then did you get the berry ironing some not in the chocolate but but you don't have the coffee so you probably like it more i really like the coffee one that's the best ever but i love the pumpkin seeds and everything on it makes it like the texture i really like that berry one that's my favorite so far so are these ones higher and because they've got all their numbers oh three point eight ah the servings 15 grams though whereas the serving on these ones was 20. oh 15 grams so there's 5.6 serves in that block i mean come on guys who are we getting here they're just what they've done it's not 5.6 grams they want to get what they're trying to do is keep the carbs the same now there's no macros on the hazelnut christmas it's a limited edition thank you i will say as well there was some extra little bonus kind of um tree little miniature treats in there that didn't make it um to the video so that was nice though i thought this might be nutella ish isn't it no it's just tastes like casein that's nutella to me though chocolate and who's not that's nice that'll be my second favorite i think the coffee toffee deluxe that was delicious if you like coffee and even if you don't like coffee they are really really really good super impressed with the quality of the ingredients um yeah for a keto milk style chocolate these are good and like a perfect gift for someone if you've got someone who's a low carb you know friend or family member that's such a special gift like because it just looks like they look such a tree the boxes i like the packaging yeah um the flavors on point so this one gets a big thumbs up from me yes definitely yes this is this is one of the nicest kind of low-carb milk chocolates that i've tried and i love that they're kind of more gourmet in the flavors yeah definitely check out halo sugar if you've enjoyed this video guys as always give it a thumbs up we're trying some doing some more product reviews so if you enjoy this kind of product review style video make sure you give us a thumbs up be subscribed to our channel so you see more videos like this and thank you so much for watching bye [Music]", "lgh2zeG5kBA": "hi everyone hi today we are going to show you some of the new kohl's keto low carb products that we have found and also there are some of our old favorites in there as well yes and if you are a kohl's shopper you should definitely check out we have three other videos dedicated to keto products at kohl's we also have grocery hauls from woolworths aldi costco all australian supermarkets so definitely check those videos out and we are going to be doing some more grocery hauls coming up so subscribe so you don't miss out on those i will also say we're not going to be filming in the supermarkets because we've been kicked out and we don't want to go through that and i can't handle the nerves i get so like yeah anyway we're not filming us talking in coles anymore we filmed some things there i'm going to go over them now heading in there to see what is here are you ready there's a lot of new stuff too i think the other thing i was going to say is these are products so we all know that you can buy meat and veg at the supermarket it is mostly what we buy when we go to the supermarket but these are products that will fit a low carb or a keto lifestyle okay so the first thing we came across in our calls was the fancy cheese kind of section um and they had two really good keto friendly cracker options so um they the brand is called obs finest and they have a newer one is a three seed cracker and it's actually like a small seeded cracker and they also have those really yummy parmesan crackers that are super expensive but also delicious so the parmesan crackers are 10.50 for a packet so that is definitely a splurge item the seeded crackers are 6.50 for a packet and the carbs are under a gram per serve so definitely low carbon keto um but price on the parmesan we're aware very splurged item okay next we went straight to the cold meats section and a new product that's just popped up at our cole's other cook with curtis curtis stone who's cole's ambassador chef he has a range of flavored mince meats so there was italian mexican and chinese um so there was the three options the italian the mexican ones the ingredients were awesome just spices and mints the chinese one was low in carb but some of the ingredients you might want to avoid depending on your version of keto but a really quick good option to grab like a the mints has already got the spices in it get a tomato or lettuce you know an avocado and you've got like a mexican taco bowl pretty quickly each packet was nine dollars for 500 grams of mints and they range between two to three grams of carbs per serve so really good and the clean ones very good okay now we love the cleavers organic meat range they seem to have an ever increasing range of items at our supermarket which is awesome to see they have hamburgers they have sausages there's hot dogs on the market yeah the hot dogs are super clean ingredients i mean they all of their products have really clean ingredients some have honey so you just have to pick and choose what suits you um but they also had a marinated leg of lamb that had really clean ingredients and very low carb the leg of lamb was 35 a kilo lamb is expensive we all know that but the thing i like about that is it's all marinated ready to go and you can just pop it on the barbie and your protein is done and it was less than a gram of carbs with marinade so that is very good yeah so definitely check out cleaver's organic meats so still in the beef section coles have started making these kind of flavored meats that you would cook in the slow cooker and they had a beef madras and a beef bourguignon that were both one to two grams of carbs per serve twelve dollars for it you needed to add some of your own ingredients like a carrot or an onion or um something like that but another great option if you couldn't be bothered thinking about what you were going to make for the meal the next day i think it's already cooked it was oh it was cooking but it was slow cooked meat to save you the time of having to slow down okay so i think it was already cooked and then you were just putting it together with some other ingredients and you put it in the pot for five times just heating it up okay yeah so a super quick and good low carb option so another section of alcohols that seems to be always growing is the kohl's made easy section so it's in next to the refrigerated meat section and it is kind of prepared not cooked meats like marinated lamb chicken wrapped in prosciutto so something that you can easily like it's already prepared you just need to probably cook it at home and it has quite prominently on it the time that it takes to cook so like 40 20 10 15 minutes or whatever um so they had quite a few options um and some of them were actually pretty low carb i found some that ranged between one to three grams of carbs with the marinade or the sauce or whatever was with it when you're choosing what you're looking at you're gonna know if it says sweet or honey they're not gonna fit but you can really pick out greek style or prosciutto wrap chicken you can kind of go maybe that will fit turn it over check it um cost wise it ranged from around 10 to 12 for the meat yeah and i think they most of them serve two people and you just need like a side probably to go with it like a salad or some cauliflower rice now the sausage section definitely choose your own adventure because a lot of them are going to have lots of ingredients and fillers and sugar and things that you're trying to avoid so that's up to you we did see a good option which i hadn't seen before which was from the premo brand and it was a pork and beef chorizo so the carbs on the sausages were one per serve which i'm guessing was one sausage and that was seven dollars for a packet okay something else we wanted to mention not necessarily a new product but something we have been having a lot lately is hot smoked salmon so it's in the normal smoked salmon section at kohl's it's not actually hot it's a cold product it's just means it's been hot smoked rather than cold smoke so those thin sliced smoked salmon the thin pink slices that you think of are cold smoked whereas this is hot smoke so it's more looks like a fillet of cooked salmon so you can get like a a piece that's been vacuum packed and all the ingredients on it is salmon and salt they also have a pepper version that's really yummy and it's just salt salmon and pepper so it's a really great option for us to have in the fridge and it's just like a quick grab-and-go lunch with some salad for dan i've been taking it for lunch quite regularly lately and it's really handy to just have a packet of that in the fridge um for those days where we don't have leftovers or something and we're like what am i going to have for lunch we'll just throw that together for a packet you get kind of two small salmon fillets and they're seven dollars and one gram less than one gram of carbs so the carbs not an issue so next we move into the more pantry aisles section of the supermarket and let's talk wraps because wraps are very popular um slash controversial yes um one of the best ones at the supermarket that you can buy is the simpson pantry wraps they have two versions they have kind of like a light and low carb one and a higher protein low carb one um one is just on eight and one is a little bit over eight grams of carbs per serve so still quite high um for a wrap in that you've still got to put things in it and then eat one or two other meals for the day so yeah probably not a keto option but probably a good low carb option also something we probably wouldn't eat ourselves because they do still have wheat in them and we try to avoid wheat products because of the inflammatory effects it can have on our body yes and speaking along the lines of wheat and whatnot they also have the alpine bread alpine bread at kohl's which is probably taste wise my preferred kind of supermarket bread option but again not something we would eat regularly because it's full of wheat and inflammatory products if you're following along the low carb wraps the simpson pantry ones are five dollars i want to say there's six wraps in there yeah and they're quite fragile yeah probably but they yeah they're fine there was actually two really good almond butter options at our coles there was actually a coles brand one which was the cheapest option and then nutty bruce had one and they were super clean ingredients just almonds and salt that's what you want to look for when you're looking for a nut butter you just want it to be the nuts and maybe some salt um yeah the um coles one was cheaper so the cold one was about seven dollars and then only bruce one was closer to nine dollars and the place to find those is in like where you find peanut butter yeah and they were both less than one gram of carb per serve so in the health food section one of our favorite pasta sauces that you can get in the supermarket is keep it cleaner now if you're looking for them they are in the health food section not where the domios okay um they like it says in the name the ingredients are super clean and they're four dollars for a jar that's gonna serve make a four of spag bowl or something like that yeah but they don't have sugar or like vegetable oils which you're probably going to find in the more traditional pasta sauce brand so that's a really good option um also in the health food section they have the olina's seed crackers so they're kind of the long rectangle ones you might have seen there's three different varieties but you want to get the sunflower seed or pepita options they're the the lowest carb ones and i think they're five dollars a packet a relatively new product are the whittaker's brand whitaker's chocolates have a kind of dark gourmet range now in alcohols it's not with the regular chocolate it's away in a separate section so you might have to scout it out at your calls but they have a 76 percent and 86 and a 92 percent so there's three different options and they're five dollars a block and we really like the flavor of them more so than lint chocolate even though they're a bit higher in carbs just keep in mind the higher up you go in the percentage the lower down you go in the carbs so the 76 was about 9 grams per serve and the 92 was about between six and seven per per serve so it's a it's a little bit high in carbs but for us it's a special occasion um kind of something if we want that special yeah and it's a really nice chocolate it's really nice something else we usually have at home is a flavored sparkling mineral water so it's not sweetened at all it's just a sparkling mineral water with a bit of fruity flavor in it um and so some good options are like the mount franklin sparkling they have they have like a lime and a raspberry i think um and i really like the frantel kind of can options they do have a new one that's passion fruit in like a purple box which looks really good i haven't tried it yet and i really like passion fruit so that's probably the next one i'm going to try but yeah sparkling mineral water can really hit the spot rather than having a sweet like even like a diet soft drink yeah so if you're looking for a broth a bone broth at the supermarket the best one that we have found is the campbell's bone broth it's in a little gold bottle it's about that big um and it's found where all the other kind of stocks and broths are it's seven dollars and it's under a gram of carb per serve but really clean ingredients no sugar or anything and i think it's only the chicken flavor i'm pretty sure the beef flavor had some sugar in it um but it's really only the clean ingredient bone broth i've seen you can get at the supermarket there's plenty of bone broth options online but that's the only supermarket option i've seen you can always make your own which is what we do most of the time so one exciting development is we can now get the lacanto monk fruit and erythritol sweeteners in kohl's we used to only be able to get them at woolworths and coals even have their own brand of monk fruit and erythritol sweetener so it's great to have some competition in that section and the kohl's one is cheaper than the canto i'm not i haven't compared the flavors of them but i'm sure they're pretty similar the kohl's one is seven dollars so it's about a couple of dollars cheaper than the la canto one so if you've liked the coles one let us know in the comments below because it's something on our list to give a try another product that is really exciting to see in kohl's is the mingle seasoning we have loved this product for almost our whole kid probably more than our keto journey i think four to five years what we love about them is the ingredients there are no fillers there are no sugars and they have some great spice blends yeah so i think in coles you can get there's like a curry in a hurry there's a taco seasoning and a few other options they don't have their whole range there but you can get others online but awesome to be able to go into coals grab a seasoning mix that you know doesn't have any crap in it and you can easily make dinner okay avocado oil something else that's relatively new to coals and coals also even have their own version now so they have a extra virgin avocado oil and it's six dollars for 200 mils which is half the price of the other brand that they sell which is ex pretty expensive i will just say both of the options that they have at kohl's are like a really kind of thick green oil i think because they're extra virgin so they're not like refined at all um so if you want to use it to make mayo you may or might have a bit of a green tinge or quite a strong flavor um so the best avocado oil i think for making mayo is the chosen foods one which is only available at costco in australia so if you have a costco membership definitely stock up on avocado oil or you know beg your family or friends who have a costco membership to hook you up so now we are moving into the kind of cold fridge section something that um was pointed out in our facebook group were the raw protein snacks and it kind of had three little sections and it included chicken breasts almonds and cheese so i think they were about five dollars for a packet when i would grab that was you know if i was hungry and i needed something to eat in the car when i left the supermarket yeah and i think there were about four grams of carbs it depended which version you got because there was a few different ones um another good grab and go option that they had in the same section at alcohols were some little kind of prosciutto salami prosciutto or salami wrapped around cheese sticks so they had they're like four little rolls in a little packet and it was seven dollars so coles in their refrigerated section also have ready meals like fresh ready meals and they have a low carb range but beware we had three options in our coals a butter chicken a chili con carn and a thai green curry only one of those would actually be classed as low carb so the butter chicken was eight grams of carbs the other two were over 40 grams of carbs the um thai green curry had rice with it and the chili con khan had beans with it and we have had people in the group complain to coles about it because they are all branded low carb and coles came back and said anything that is under 50 grams of carb is low carb in their opinion now in our opinion that is not what we would class as low carb so the real takeaway from this is you have to turn it over and check for yourself what the ingredients are and what the carb count is because they are trying to reel you in by naming it low carb and it's not even what we would what you probably would even class yourself as low carb yeah but the butter chicken are good the butter comes with cauliflower yes go with the butter chicken we now have multiple low-carb yogurt options in our supermarkets can you believe it [Laughter] you we have the two good yogurts they are very new to our coals we did a whole taste test video on those so you if you're interested in finding out more about the two goods yogurts they we've done a whole video so go and check that out yeah but they're quite low in carb and they're about 2.50 per single serve you can also get the single serve yo pros um which are a little bit higher in carbs um but they're still like a low carb option right yeah and people in our facebook group do enjoy the yo pro and the two good yogurts but if you've watched our too good yoga's video we weren't big fans we really love the tamar valley like plain greek yogurt it's super creamy and yummy and you can just add fruit to it so but we were excited to see that they had a tamar valley um like a fruit flavored yogurt that said no added sugar and it was actually sweetened with stevia and erythritol so it was just there was carbs a bit from the fruit and the yogurt i think there are about six to seven grams of carbs per serve which is pretty good for a yogurt and these were there was like passion fruit blueberry or strawberry i think yeah and they come in like a bigger tub so that was about 700 grams for the for the tub and you kind of portion that up yourself we did try it and we preferred probably just the plain greek yogurt and add our own flavoring because it kind of watered down the creaminess a little bit but still good to have a fruit flavored option that's not sweetened with sugar now in case you don't know in australia at cole supermarket the best keto friendly ice cream hands down is donata we have a whole video doing a taste test of all the flavors it is delicious but we've talked about that in lots of videos so we're not going to go into that today but there is a new ice cream just in time for summer um a licks it's called licks and it's like a icy ice cream on a stick like a paddle pop well people have said in our facebook group it tastes like a chocolate paddle pop well based on what people have said i'd need to taste it for myself but yeah definitely check it out so it comes in like a box of four and it's 8.50 and each paddle pop wow paddle pop already in the head each um individual serve is about two grams of carbs per serve yeah and there's two different flavors so vanilla latte and double chocolate so definitely something to look out for and probably a good option because you've got built-in porsche yes which you don't have in the dinette so that is it our wrap-up of our latest kind of keto friendly options at kohl's and some of our old faithful products we hope that you found this video useful and can you know get on the lookout for some of these products at your coles i will say this is by no far an

on instagram if you haven't already that's where i primarily update folks on upcoming videos as well as take polls or questions and just gather general feedback on new content pieces so without getting too far into the intro i know all of us love a solid cookie dough recipe i gotta say it's probably the quintessential dessert snack treat whatever you want to call it on everyone's cheat list but i must say within the anabolic world it has been a difficult road i've tried a lot of different cookie dough recipes they've either been too oily too sticky or just not really fitting the balance between the macros and the overall taste and flavor but i know nick has been working on this recipe for quite some time and has absolutely poured his heart and soul into this one so i'm really excited to dive right into this and see what this recipe is all about and as always give you guys an honest full 360 review on this recipe and nick no matter what said tonight i absolutely love you buddy but otherwise let's get into this all right so to kick this recipe off we're going to use 90 grams of flour next up we've got two scoops or 66 grams of a whey protein then we've got 24 grams of a swerve brown sugar next we'll use 24 grams of a granular sugar then we've got 1.5 grams of salt next we've got two whole large eggs and you know we love ourselves some extra butter we're gonna go ahead and use 42 grams or three tablespoons of a light butter next we've got one teaspoon of a vanilla extract and then we've got ourselves one and a half servings of chocolate chips now guys for the first step of this recipe we're going to take 90 grams of our unbleached flour and then heat it up in the microwave he's also suggested using the oven it's just another option but today we're going to make it easy on ourselves and throw it into the microwave get it to the point where it's about 160 degrees fahrenheit now definitely get yourself a food related thermometer it'll help you guys to actually measure out and make sure you're getting the right temperature and obviously temperature is going to be very precise in terms of 160 to 165 degrees in order to really make sure that we're killing any type of microbes or bacteria that are in the flower and again the flower is technically raw you can also buy heat treated flowers at i'd say most type of grocery stores you're more than likely going to come across it like your whole foods or sprouts type of groceries but we're going to go ahead and measure out 90 grams of flour throw into the microwave i'll see you guys back in a second [Music] and just as a heads up guys today we're going to actually use a candy thermometer now i picked this up off of amazon for like 10 bucks and so just so you guys know the difference between a meat thermometer and also a candy thermometer you're just gonna have a larger range and the temperature that can be measured so this one goes up to roughly about 400 degrees and i think most candy thermometers will go up to 400 whereas your meat thermometer traditionally will go up from i think 120 140 all the way up to 220. so these candy thermometers really just give you a large range to work with so right now we're at almost 120 we'll probably throw it into the microwave probably two or three more times to get it up to roughly about 160. all right guys so we're just a tad over 160 so i think we're in a good spot we're gonna go ahead and let this cool for a little bit it's definitely a little warm and then we'll get into adding the other ingredients in so next up we're gonna go ahead and use 66 grams of a whey protein now we're not using a whey protein or casein mix i'd imagine that would be probably easily substituted but we're going to go ahead and use transparent labs cinnamon pastry whey protein obviously my absolute favorite anything cinnamon but we're gonna go ahead and measure out 66 grams so we got one scoop that's roughly about 30 grams there all right money 66 grams of protein so since i don't have a micro scale i'm just going to eyeball this but we're going to go ahead and add 1.5 grams of table salt now that we've got all the dry ingredients in here guys we're going to give this a nice mix again really the point of this is really just to make sure that we're preventing any type of clumping but otherwise we're going to hop into the wet ingredients so now that we've got the wet and dry ingredients ready to rock and roll we're going to go ahead and take our dry ingredients and split it into four parts and mix it into the wet ingredients so we'll see how this goes but in terms of you know the overall volume that i'm seeing here it's looking to be a pretty good amount so after putting the first set of dry ingredients into the wet this is what the consistency of the cookie dough is looking like it's a little runny but we'll go ahead and continue to add in the rest of the dry ingredients and this will definitely thicken up and we're back the cookie dough absolutely smells delicious so i'm ready to dive into this but you guys know the deal let's get into the three categories anabolics taste and craving now for anabolics let's take a look at the total calories and the macro breakdown for this entire batch which is roughly about 350 grams in total weight we're looking at a total of 838 total calories with 22 grams of fat 80 grams of protein and 80 grams of net carbs now just as a reminder guys since erythritol is the only sugar alcohol being used in this recipe we can go ahead and actually remove the carb count from this overall macro breakdown which gives us 80 total grams of net carbs but with that being said if you're not familiar with erythritol erythritol is very popular amongst diabetics especially because the sugar itself does not pass through the body and into the gut which like 90 of the actual sugars flow through the bloodstream and allows a lot of diabetic folks to enjoy desserts and sweets using erythritol and this is one of the main reasons why quest nutrition really made an impact on the protein industry not just necessarily for their flavor but because this was extremely popular amongst diabetic folks and having taken a look at that total calorie and macro breakdown let's take a look at what one actual serving of a store-bought cookie dough looks like today we're using nestle toll house's edible chocolate chip cookie dough as a point of reference here we've got 28 grams of each cookie dough nestle toll house and exercise for cheat meals but in terms of total calories and macro breakdown four nestle toll houses chocolate chip cookie dough we're looking at a total of 140 total calories with four and a half grams of fat one gram of protein and 25 grams of carbs so overall definitely a little high on the carbohydrate side and now let's take a look at 28 grams of exercise for cheat meals cookie dough in terms of total calories and macro breakdown we're looking at 92 total calories 2.4 grams of fat 8.8 grams of protein and 8.8 grams of carbs now i don't know if i need to say any more or paint this picture any clearer but that calorie and total macro breakdown is just absolutely pristine especially when we're talking about cookie dough and cookie dough is just traditionally a lot higher in sugar and fats to really just give you that consistency and the overall texture that you're always looking for right and that buttery goodness is just very hard to beat now this is a point of reference guys 28 grams we've got store-bought cookie dough versus exercise for cheat meals cookie dough and i gotta say when you think about the macro and calorie breakdown eight grams of protein versus one gram of protein in these same amounts we're looking pretty freaking good so we're gonna go ahead and rate this as a solid 10. and now on to taste and here's a quick look at nestle toll house's edible chocolate chip cookie dough just a little thicker less runny you guys know i gotta feed you so here's what the cookie dough is looking like after sitting in the fridge and having cooled down for about an hour to an hour and a half you can tell the cookie dough is extremely silky smooth and texture is a little sticky gummy definitely not your traditional type of cookie dough that you would see at the store but for very good reasons we'll get into that in just a second but this is what we're dealing with and about you but i'm dying to try this out all right cheers boys hot damn whoa gotta go in for another taste test cheers let's go where do i begin the nestle toll house is probably one of the easiest brands to reference this cookie dough recipe against and usually when i think of a cookie dough i think of something that's going to be extremely thick tons of chocolate chips and then also a slight grittiness to the overall texture and for me that brings back a flood of memories especially when we're talking about cookie dough now with that being said this cookie dough by exercise for cheat meals is absolutely buttery silky smooth and to me really comes off more as a batter than an actual cookie dough and i will say that there is definitely very good reason for the actual consistency and the texture that we've got here now i'm definitely not taking away any points from that but i think it's important for folks to know that you're dealing with more of a batter consistency so now in terms of overall taste i'm going to say that this really hits on all cylinders guys the overall balance and flavors and the ingredients just absolutely blend extremely well and you get a very even very even flavor now for me i personally prefer a thicker cookie dough but at the same component i do think a lot of folks are gonna absolutely enjoy this recipe this recipe really does the anabolic cookie build justice and you guys yeah i'm gonna leave it up to you guys to try it out and let me know what your thoughts are of this recipe but at the end of the day this really does hit on all cylinders in terms of overall flavor texture and consistency and also a very good point that has been brought up in his video is that texture does not always equate to the overall flavor and just being more awesome of a cookie dough now with all of that in mind we're going to go ahead and rate this as a solid 10. and actually you know what we're going to give this a star this definitely deserves a star now is this going to satisfy your craving you 100 better believe it now for all of you looking for a lower calorie higher protein anabolic cookie dough look no further guys this will definitely satisfy your craving especially when you're looking for a sweet treat and i gotta say it really doesn't take a whole lot of time this is absolutely easy to prep and gives you a decent amount of volume but with that we're going to give craving a solid 10. well guys we just smashed through three categories and a box taste and craving for a total score of 10. i think this is probably one of the very first recipes that we've hit a total score of 10. i'm absolutely impressed with what nick has done with this recipe and for those of you who are just wondering i mean just think about the total amount of protein in one serving 20 grams versus 28 grams store-bought versus exercise for cheat meals 8 grams versus 1 gram i mean that is a pretty steep difference and in terms of overall fat we're cutting it about half for all of you guys who have made this recipe let me know in the comments below what has stood out the most to you for those of you who weren't fans of it let me know in the comments why i could definitely see both ends of the spectrum in terms of overall texture and consistency but for me this is an absolute no-brainer when you take a look at the complete package of calories macros and overall taste and texture inconsistency it's just really a done deal a big dub right there but i hope you guys enjoyed today's review on an awesome recipe one well deserved for the anabolic community if you guys are new to the channel make sure to subscribe get tons of anabolic recipe reviews coming up along with original recipes and some more fun content related to full days of eating eating and training life and all that good jazz but otherwise thank you so much for tuning in absolutely love you guys stay safe stay full and i'll see you guys next time peace", "RNo-K6N07KQ": "hi guys today we thought we would show you our day vini and it's like keto basics yeah just keeping it at evening in this weekend yeah yeah so it's Sunday morning for us we've been up for it's about 8:30 and we got up at 6:00 so we already had a cup of tea we like to have black team this is our favorite Lady Grey we just have a black no sweetener or anything and we've had a big glass of water each before and then we've just been for a walk and now it's tier and - great and I am in the process of my are doing tea and number two this month and it's a green tea with Garcinia cinnamon ginseng and acai berry and it smells really nice I've already waited post festival cleanse me I'm Ben and we're also gonna have probably now our electrolyte this is the one we prefer the raspberry face flavor of Ultima I've got this large one from iHerb where you can get it in Australia or you can get the smaller ones from the low carb Emporium but yeah that's where we're at at the moment we're just hanging around we don't have much on today we're getting our Christmas tree delivered we're getting their real Christmas trees so I'm riding up the deck because it's gonna stay outside the tree means I destroy the Christmas tree when it's up so we thought we've got Erica's family coming so we thought we wanted a Christmas tree but we're gonna have it outside so I got to tidy up the deck in preparation for it that's how they that's the song about day anyway okay so I am making my drink that I have sometimes when Erika has her coffee so Erika have got a copy with almond milk right yes so I got an almond milk coffee today because that's what I normally do on the weekend but I really like to buy coffee that during the week I just make my own cold brew then I make myself and a bit of cream but yeah so that's my almond look on me dad feels a bit left out no why do is I've got some coconut milk and I'm gonna add a half cup of water cuz it's very oh yes coconut milk out of the can again so it's much pretty much it's much thicker than the kind of one you get out of a cotton I'm gonna add in some MCT order to meet something called Isis in a consistency break up some of those chunks of the cream so what do you make them so you didn't write this gypsy cha it's sweet we don't see really having that if it if we're doing nice things get away with it this one so all the thinner by seeds were not going to be having sweetness right now but this is actually bring him before [Laughter] a couple of teaspoons of dizziness so you might be having this in January they won't be having this in January but I'm going to put some in CT oh this is money because I'm trying to get a little bit more fat into your calories because you're maintaining not trying to lose weight that's right and Dan does cross meandered stuff so so that was just some perfect keto powder MCT oil just a plain one not the flame you know playing it because the flavors coming from the shine yep if you've all checked out our pantry videos if you haven't check it out because we have a lot of good stuff around keto what you would want in your pantry so how much of the child you put in now I'm a couple of tablespoons good let's do a tablespoon cuz I like the play a bit local sites maybe with a ray patrol so it's a good option and it's really it's really delicious isn't it this one tablespoon and I also like to pop in a little bit of salt does I bring down the flavor so there's a bit more flavor make it sound like I came up with that and this is little scare the place on the scratching palm down by Connie did you see stuff that lease is our other fun baby gym she's just sitting here looking out at all the birds in the tree favorite spot to see it and yes gout and jam for any tequila Mockingbird fans out there so it's pretty much he don't smell I can smell it now used to be a big hot chocolate like if I got a coffee those when Erika has coffee yeah it's not good so no so this is a much better opportunity well you could make you cater friendly hot chocolate as well and you have done that yeah yeah also you can get this from Roy carb Emporium yeah we got a I think it's an Australian product and they also have a website that you can order from directly cool look what arrived i christmas tree now we're gonna get it in his day and it's gonna be staying outside because these total munchkins would probably destroy it if it was inside but luckily we're in australia so we'll be outside anyway we probably should've just filmed australia for Christmas train trial yeah as you can see not perfectly straight but it's up and now I think we should have something to eat I am hungry after all that work of trying to get that funny thing to stand up and we won't be doing it again we branches the back okay so it's better here twelve o'clock and we're gonna have our first meal of the day we're gonna have eggs mushrooms and bacon now we're tracking out micros at the moment so I'm gonna have three eggs and everything's going to have to we've got 150 grams mushrooms each and 150 grams of bacon each and I'm adding on half an avocado so now we're going to have some butter a tablespoon of butter each in the mushrooms yeah I'm not sure if we mentioned at the start but we're eating different amount of food because I'm maintaining areas losing losing losing in inverted commas I'm having about poverty than 500 calorie calories in Erica's on you have to put a bit more fat into my meals yeah than whatever does okay guys so bacon is on the barbecue and I'll be close cooking the eggs on here as well I like to cook the bacon and the eggs on the barbecue it's easier cleanup and it's a beautiful day today so it might as well be outside Eric is inside cooking the mushrooms I just do a shot of that you dinner hold up do you know the first meal of the day it's not really your breakfast lunch or dinner mine's got the three eggs and the fork wait Erica's looks pretty fool yeah it still looks very full yeah I don't have that Africa I put a bit of this mingle Sally which is like a ranch seasoning in with the mushrooms when I often they were pretty much cooked so it's like garlic onion dill salt pepper parsley it's really yummy it's probably one of my favorite ones of these and needs us a really good option because there's no sugar there's no fillers yeah everything in them so we've got this from below how important but you can obtain within like specialty grocery stores and you can buy it directly from them as well though yeah we highly recommend especially on my cheese or in like a tuna like a bit of tuna and mayo and this yeah also 525 and we're just gonna start to get dinner ready now we usually try and have our eighteen window close by about six o'clock I might be pushing it today we're probably running a little late cuz we did our live yeah so with every Sunday straining sometime 5:00 p.m. we do a Facebook live so we just did one about alcoholic drinks because it's a common question at this time of year around Christmas anyway so 50 now we're gonna make like a Bolognese type sauce so we've got 500 grams of mins so we went with the extra lean one this time because it's easier for me with tracking macros to add fat to it if I need to like so I can add a bit of butter rather than having like a high fat mints and then it takes up too much of my sauna calories and then we're going to just use these organics tomato sauce pasta sauce that we got from like a Emporium there's all Pete Evans brand one which is a good option you can do it soon I say for Michael we couldn't find it looking for it and I think in the US there's one called browse under popular yeah that's like a good option as far as like a load come so we're going to make that sauce just with the meat pasta sauce and some butter and cheese and then we're going to have that with some broccoli broccoli here so this will actually be it'll make enough for four meals so we'll have this tonight and they will have it another night during the week so that's a super handy thing to do I think if you can make it double meal put it in the freezer for a night you can't be bothered or we'll just have this like on a night where we go to trivia or something where we have a bit less time in the evening and we do that a bit like freezer meal yes yes they will have the sauce the meat sauce over the broccoli with some cheese on top then we'll probably have a bit of extra butter on here broccoli as well just to add some more flour in between the two needles okay so dinner's all ready so this is Dan's we've just added a bit of butter on top of her broccoli and this is mine so it's the same just without the butter and then I've just dished up the other serve this will go in the fridge for another night later in the week and so total kind of roundup of today without my crows and our calories and stuff so I mean Erica's chronometer and she's done just over 1,300 calories for the day and it targets about 1,500 and her net carbs is 18.6 so she's under her target for me so if we had some of them farm fresh strawberries I might have a couple of strawberries later on tonight and so me my calories is nearly 19-hundred and my chocolate is 2,000 my crops is over because the avocado yeah 22 net carbs but I mean that's right for your carb tolerance it's much better than mine and you not trying to lose weight yeah so sometimes I go a little bit over the 20 net carbs yeah and yeah I think that's it oh okay so we're gonna gun it out Tina now that's our keto basics day of eating just pretty straightforward bacon eggs breaking and some meat with veggies and cheese for dinner pretty like really we don't do anything most of it is that is what we're eating yep and really had the idea of making two meals at once while you're cooking and then you've got a meal there for the night when you can't be bothered or you're home late or you're in a hurry it's such a good idea to have that in the fridge or freezer ready to grab out yeah I need you tracking I recommend chronometers the easiest way to track you don't know me now we'll put the link down below yeah yeah that's us for the day so thanks so much for watching and we hope that you found this useful yeah so if you like this video give it a thumbs up and if you want to get more videos from us make sure you subscribe thanks so much", "I4mIQrZieGQ": "[Music] hi everyone hi today we're talking low-carb bread yes probably the most popular topic in our facebook group which is aussie low carb community feel free to come and join us um is bread low carb bread options so today we are going to be talking about the supermarket bread options from kohl's woolies and aldi that are low-carb and we have loaves of bread bread rolls and wraps so we have all of your supermarket low carb bread options covered here i will say that there isn't really an option in the supermarket that doesn't contain wheat so if you're gluten free these are not going to be an option for you and if you are like really strict with the ingredients that you consume these are probably also not going to be for you but we do feel like they have their place if you are craving bread and you are on the verge of buying some wonder white these are the better options yeah for sure and a lot of people have great success including these so choose your own adventure as we like to say if you are looking for some low carb bread options that are grain free gluten free you're not going to find them at the supermarket but there are plenty of options online some ones that we really like uh polena fresh or primal alternative so definitely check out both of those websites and there's lots of um recipes online for low carbon keto bread as well if you want to make your own there's also some packet mix ones like the protein bread pro and a few others as well but these are just ready to go pick up from the supermarket and eat so sliced bread options we have one from woolworth's one from aldi one from kohl's so the kohl's option is the alpine bread so it's in um this kind of long life packet i would guess like it's kind of vacuum sealed and it looks good kind of probably a little bit smaller than a regular loaf but more the most like a regular loaf of all the options that we have here and i guess you would compare it to a multi-grain bread out of these three options if i was eating one i would choose this one so the alpha bread is 7.2 grams of net carbs per serve and each serve is two slices of bread and the loaf costs 5.95 in my opinion like erica said there's more bang for your buck here because there's probably more slices than what you get in the other two now at coles they all some people have posted um i think it was vitality which was like a home style low carb bread we've never been able to find it but it's definitely the lowest carb option i've seen so if you find that at your cost let us know the next option is the audi bread so the aldi bread is pretty much the o.g aside from the hermann brot and they're both very similar to each other they're pretty much the same bread in a different packaging it's a heavy dense loaf like if you compare those two this is heavy and it's like looks like it's half the size what's the grams on that just what does it mean though 600 grams that's the grams on this it's about 600 grams as well but it's like much smaller both about the same weight but this one is like basically seeds glued together with a tiny bit of wheat yeah it's it's like a rye like it's very very heavy um but we have been having this for quite a while we would eat you know if we wanted bread we would eat this um it's definitely not something i would eat every day but um we would eat this you know we haven't had it for a long time this used to be the only option and now there's other options i guess so the alley is five grams of carbs net carbs per serve again two they're all two slices for a serve and it's 4.99 so it's a dollar cheaper than the audi then the alpine sorry yeah so then the third bread option is the woolies macro brand 85 low lower carb linseed and sunflower bread so again you can see it's a much smaller loaf this isn't even as big as a regular loaf so it's a small loaf but it is less um it's a bit more bready than the audi bread but it's a little bit more cardboardy than the alpine brand it's also a lot less carbs so it's 3.2 grams of net carbs per serve two slices five dollars for the loaf so if you're really just counting your carbs this is what you want to go for i would say yeah so that is the bread options now aldi and woolies also have a bread roll option which is based very similar on the actual bread yes so again this is the woolworths one so it's the macro linseed and sunflower rolls this is what the packet looks like so you get four bread rolls in there and then the algae one you get two bread rolls so it's their low carb high protein bun but i'll get them out and we can maybe compare what do you reckon okay now if you have had the audi bread before and you didn't like it because of the seeds the buns definitely have less seeds in there so give the buns a go but just to have a look at these two next to each other like to me this is definitely more bready yeah it's probably what's that i think it just came out all right so this is the wool macro bun and this is the aldi so you can see this one's a lot smaller like flatter i guess this one seems to have a bit more height to it and it's more the bread part is more pale because this is quite similar on the inside but what's the carbs and so the macro one is 3.6 for the roll and the audi one is 7.7 it's not worth it in my opinion i would definitely go with this because you're going to if you're going to have a bread roll it's all about what you're putting inside it in my opinion so if you're making a bacon and egg roll or if you're making a ham and cheese sandwich or i would probably go with this one because of the carbs and you get to add the flavor anyway yeah let's have a look on the inside i'm in trees now to me a huge big difference in the carbs looks like a seeded roll this honestly it's a bit more um kind of yeah i would that's the the difference in the options and price wise price rise you get four rolls here for five dollars and you get two rolls for 2.99 so this is a winner price wise card wise and flavor and texture and stuff as well the ingredients are similar i mean we haven't tried those but i assume they're similar to the bread so two bread rail options either at aldi or at wooly next up we move into the wraps what are we doing with all of this i don't know i just went on a massive like grab this stuff expedition and i was thinking our freezer is full because we went to planner first yesterday i have no idea what we're doing take it around to my family um your sister's kids our nieces and nephews will at least eat the wraps and things yeah that's true and abby might eat the bread so anyway so now we've got the wraps we've got three options we've got the simpson pantry now they have two and i just grabbed the lowest carb of the two they have like a high protein i don't think this is the high protein yes they have a high protein one and they have this one this one was 0.5 grams um less carbs so i just chose that one um we also have the um these are pretty new 65 lower carbs um i grabbed the grain and seeds but they also have a wholemeal one we have had the wholemeal one before and i also grabbed these ones because they are popular in our group but they are the highest carbs by far and those ones the mission low carb wraps are available at both coals and woolies might be as well we got these at woolies but i'm pretty sure you can get them i got those ones at cole oh okay but i couldn't find them at woolworth so they had this brand but they didn't have any of the low-carb ones there but it was just the woolworths okay so let's talk carbs yes so carbs that one is 7.9 grams for one wrap yeah um and cost wise they're all five dollars so you don't need to worry about the cost or five dollars five how many six five okay so you're getting a little bit more within your mission but you're really gonna pay for a car wise yeah it's 11 grams for one wrap um in my opinion that's too high um if you're gonna eat one wrap in one meal and then whatever you put on it you could be eating 15 grams of carbs in one meal but where this might be good is if you're trying to transition kids or if you're trying to transition yourself away from eating a wrap every day and you want to have one wrap a week this might be something that's more palatable for you over the other two yeah i don't reckon you would notice the difference between the regular i mean i haven't tried these but they look exactly like the regular yeah so these are probably our favorite they're five grams per wrap so that's pretty like that's these are doubles yeah yeah so these we have tried these we made some um kind of like tacos with them and we served them to erica's niece and nephew i didn't even know there was not a mention and erica's nephew is a real pain anything he thinks is good for him or keto he just doesn't want to know about so i would choose the worst ones of the wraps yeah just because of the low carbs also compared to the simpsons pantry they're a little bit thicker so yeah they're a bit more sturdy these are quite uh thin but they're fine but i guess yeah just based on the carbs because the ingredients is pretty pretty similar across the board i would go for the water so i think it's exciting to see this is a new product so as dan said there's two flavors we had the wholemeal one last time which i guess if you're trying to fool kids the whole meal one would be better because this the seeds the kids are gonna touch grain and seeds you can see there's seeds in it so people aren't healthy um so our peaks are the woolworth's wraps the alpine bread and the uh the wool worse rolls yeah but you know we just wanted to show you all of the options so that people know because a lot of people when they're starting low carb and they're looking just to make swaps to these at their initial stage which is an awesome thing to do and shouldn't be like judged for that but if you're just looking to okay i normally have bread i want to swap to a better bread option these are your options hopefully you found this video useful guys please give us a thumbs up because that lets youtube know we're providing you with the stuff you want to see um subscribe to the channel and thank you so much for watching [Music] bye", "l-QjrlHjdUg": "today we're making tortellini totally from scratch and we're gonna serve it in broth with some English peas grab 300 grams ten and a half ounces or two cups of double zero flour dump it out on your counter and make it deep well in the center now all-purpose flour makes a decent pasta dough too so use it if that's all you have okay pour in a mixture of two whole eggs and five yolks now increasing the ratio of yolks give the dough a more delicate and rich flavour but you could just use three whole eggs instead now add a quarter teaspoon or about a gram of fine sea salt along with one teaspoon or about 3 grams of extra virgin olive oil grab a fork and begin to incorporate some of the flour into the egg mixture just make sure you don't break that wall of flour surrounding the liquids or you're gonna have a bit of a mess on your hands when you have something that resembles a paste ditch the fork and cut in the wet ingredients to the remaining flour with a dough scraper honestly you could just skip this step and use your hands if you prefer but a scraper is a great tool to have when making pasta after a few minutes of pressing and working the wet and dry ingredients together the dough is gonna be kind of shaggy you'll have some stuck to your work surface so use a scraper or something with a flat edge to loosen it then work those bits into the dough knead the dough with the palm of your hand press down and away then rotate and repeat do this for a few minutes then give the counter one last scrape and instead of incorporating this stuff just toss it it's way too dry and it'll ruin your dough now continue kneading for another three or four minutes or until the pasta dough takes on a silky smooth texture this means the gluten in the dough has started to develop form a dough into a ball like so then wrap it in some plastic film and let it rest in the fridge for about an hour so now we need to prepare a filling for our tortellini and you can go about this two ways the easy less complicated route is to just grab some sausage at the store this is chicken and garlic sausage and I plan to make chicken tortellini so it fits the theme but you could pretty much use any type just remove the casing and Bob's your uncle here's the more traditional and adventurous route grab and set up your food processor remove the lid into the bowl add the following ingredients five ounces 142 grams or about three-quarters of a cup of chilled and cubed chicken two ounces 57 grams are about 1/2 cup of children Adela the same measurement of chilled diced pancetta 1/4 ounce 7 grams or 2 tablespoons of grated parm 1 egg white leaves from one sprig of rosemary and a half ounce 14 grams or 1 tablespoon of heavy cream a healthy dose of freshly ground black pepper is always a must I'm adding about a quarter teaspoon here and last but not least a solid quarter teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg now pop the top back on your food processor I seem to be having a little bit of trouble here there we go good job Tim and blitz the filling for about 10 to 20 seconds until all the ingredients are broken down and you get something that resembles a loose finely ground sausage this is called a forcemeat by the way transfer the filling to a small bowl and make sure you get every last bit of it because you certainly don't want to waste any and we're done with the food processor so you can put that away then place the filling in the fridge and hold it there until we're ready to make tortellini speaking of which it's time to roll out the pasta so grab the dough and cut off 1/4 of it then wrap the rest back up in the plastic film this will keep it from drying out as you work with a smaller piece now have some loose flour on hand and give everything a dusting then grab a rolling pin and well start rolling I don't have one of those crazy long rolling pins that's meant to specifically roll out pasta and I'm fairly sure most of you don't either so do this roll the dough out a bit then rotate it every once in a while to stretch it out in both length and width just don't roll it out wider than the width of your rolling pin the end result will be an elongated oval and the dough should be thin enough so that you can kind of see your hand through it it'll be probably about a sixteenth of an inch thick another option in the one that I almost always go to is using a pasta roller this requires less elbow grease and speeds up the process quite a bit so dial your rollers to the widest setting and start feeding your piece of dough through the machine just remember to flatten it out with a rolling pin before the first pass now after you've run the dough through the first and second settings fold it into thirds give it a quick hit with the rolling pin and start it all over again do this a few times and then run the pasta sheet through the rest of the settings until you reach the second from last this is typically number seven on most machines when you're done the sheet should be the same width as the rollers the first thing I do here is trim off the dry edges and cut the ends to square off the pasta sheet next make two straight cuts from one end to the other leaving you with three strips of pasta that are even in width now make perpendicular cuts to form evenly shaped squares about two-and-a-half to three centimetres in width add small amounts of filling a little less than 1/2 teaspoons worth to the center of each pasta square for a visual reference that ends up being a little bit more than the size of a hazelnut lightly spray the pasta with some water now this will make the surface of the dough tackier so it seals better when forming the tortellini hold the pasta so it's shaped like a diamond then fold the bottom point up to the top to form a triangle press the left and right edges firmly to thin the dough and seal the filling now fold the top point in toward you then wrap the two bottom corners around your index finger so they overlap each other and finally pinch the dough together to firmly thin and form the Tortelli know again for good measure bring the bottom point up to meet the top point then firmly pinch the left and right edges to form a triangle fold the top point in toward you then wrap the bottom points around your finger and pinch again to form a totally no now that all the dough is used up it's time to cook these little guys so bring some chicken broth up to a boil and drop in your tortellini for this recipe one-quarter broth works pretty well add the English peas and simmer everything for about three to four minutes or until the tortellini are cooked through but the dough still has a little bit of a bite to it oh yeah and don't forget to check the seasoning of your broth before serving now ladle a tortellini broth and English peas into a bowl you can go family-style or individual servings here just remember to offer some freshly grated Parmesan cheese to those who can't go without it like myself thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll catch you next time", "x9cz2rTfb9E": "hi so today we have just been walking around our crawls or more words with a book so we've looked all trans measurable that was me looking for meals that you can kind of grab at the supermarket come home and prepare really super quick you know like move no cook or me just really just something that can be heated up or can be eaten as ease so look a full meal yeah for those times where you really can't be bothered and you're thinking oh do I go and get takeaway or do I grab something quick from the supermarket this is the quick from the supermarket chain yes now we do have some videos about snack options we've got a colles one a Woolworths one and an Aldi one and you could certainly put a few snacks together and make a meal like for example some deli made and some olives and pickles or what else like some of them had like boiled eggs that you could get and a bit of cheese or something so you can certainly make up a meal from snacks so that would be a good option so check those videos out this one is more we're trying to just look at things that you could grab and maybe just needed a quick zap in the microwave and they were good to go so we've just been looking at options that we think you know a good low carb meal if you have specific needs around ingredients maybe like grabbing things from the supermarket might not really be suitable you might have to make your own because they do tend to have extra ingredients than if you are just preparing something yourself right yeah and also if you're on a budget this probably isn't the the best budget-friendly option because it's already cooked there's a little bit more cost involved for some of these things we've convenience you tend to have to pay a bit correct yeah so there were four mates and we make a cold and whoa that's the two main supermarkets in Australia and we looked at four kind of main sections so there was the cold kind of ready meals that just needed to be like heated in the microwave or some of them I think you could chuck in the oven as well there was like the cold prepared salads that you just needed to chuck together and eat there was the roasted kind of hot roasted meats and what was the other thing frozen frozen ready meals again just chuck them in the microwave or the oven and that was the four main sections that we looked at the first one will kind of cover of the things we found is the kind of cold ready-made meal so this is found in the section where you can find like the precooked lasagnas and butter chicken and that kind of thing it was kind of in that ready males in the cold section not the frozen section is where we yeah in Walworth we found it was all together whereas in Coles it was a bit there were like three separate sections so it obviously it depends on your particular kind of branch is that what they called your shop yeah so your mileage may vary this is what way down there so in Coles they have a new low carb range yeah now we were tell you be very careful because one of the things that his brand of low carb has rice in it in the carb count was about 45 but just check them but there were three that would decent there was chicken cacciatore there was Thai green chicken curry and butter chicken so all of those were round between 10 and 15 grams of carbs so the best top option out of those three was the chicken cacciatore at six point four which is for me Brahmi I was pretty good and they were eight dollars fifty and that was a full meal with your mate and your veggies all done so pretty good option at Cole's the other thing that I McCall's which we hadn't even seen before was in this section it was called like dinner in 30 or something like that and it was me kind of perked meats in some sort of sauce and you just needed to heat them on the stovetop or in microwave I think it was a whole range of options but probably the couple of best ones that we saw that were only needed a short cooking time and were low in carbs so there was a slow-cooked beef ragu and then also a Sicilian inspired chicken the chicken was only 4.8 carbs per serve and they were nine dollars I don't know how it's soon maybe two people I think so I don't I don't look at how many serves it was it wasn't a one serving night and then you would just pair that with like a salad or like a a quick throw together salad or something if you wanted greens with it it was just meat there was no greenery or anything but I have never seen that no they were new or we've never looked in that section before so at luly's probably not as good options to be honest in the kind of cold prepared meal section they didn't have a chicken tikka masala that served for people and it was six grams of carbs per serve and it was $12 so you'd probably just grab some you know cauliflower rice pre-done sticking that in the microwave and that would be quick and easy they also had a beef rein game that was 8 grams of carbs and it serve - and it was $9 so again another good kind of option again like Erika said just grab some cauliflower rice from the fresh food section and you've got a meal ready to go and then probably a good family friendly option that I wouldn't have even looked at if we weren't doing this was they had a curried sausages kind of ready to go it served four people it was $10 and it was 7 grams of carbs per serve I would have just written that off I wouldn't have even picked it up because I just would have assumed but because we were specifically trying to find things that was like I probably would have thought there was potato in it but I think they don't like carrot was probably the highest card vegetable in there so so that is a good option okay so the next section is kind of like the fresh ready to go salad options I will say at Woolworth's most of them didn't look that great and they also look like you might need to add something to them they did have a BLT salad but it only had like a tiny bit of bacon so it seemed like you'd need to add a boiled egg go ahead so she can or something to it it was eight point three grams of carbs so I think for Sally it's an option if you don't spray alright guys and they didn't have a really nice-looking Greek salad so it had everything kind of sectioned off by itself so it kind of keeps it a bit fresh in that way I think it was only one point eight grams of carbs and so for people and was nine dollars so even I guess if you wanted to make that a bigger meal you would maybe only split it between two people add a bit of chicken or something yes that you could pair with like a barbecue chicken or something and then again dinner's ready to go by combining those two things yes but in the Woolies we went to today and our local bullies they do have a fresh sushi kind of making station so I know they probably don't have that in every wall worse but they do they're a pokey Bowl salad and there was tuna or salmon so the tuna one I looked at was 4.1 grams of carbs for one serve and it was $8 90 and it looked pretty nice it looked fresh yeah Dee I agree with Erica the Coles options seemed to look a lot nicer than the wall worst one they fresh your son looked a lot nicer now they had a chicken Caesar salad that looked way better than the Woolworths one it had chicken and egg in it where the war was fun didn't have those and it didn't look that great and I think it was quite a flying car because of the croutons yeah the Coles one was nine point five grams of carbs with the crouton so if I was picking up that salad I would just keep the crew in a separate line I would mixed in go in a little bag you know given to kids on but that is a really good option because it has the protein in it yeah that's what I thought it was really nice about it yeah and it was nine dollars so again like good for a quick lunch or if you were throwing together a quick dinner for yourself one person I would describe that interestingly they seem to have two different versions of Caesar salad this was like the fancier version then they had a cold one then was less substantial and only six dollars but I would go with this one it definitely had more it like and had egg in it the other one didn't have more chicken yeah and I just looked an answer another thing with the salads I hadn't seen that they had before was this barbecue chicken ball how do you say no before that looked really nice and it was all again kind of all sectioned off so that doesn't all kind of go so he doesn't mix it all up and it's ready to go that one was six point three grams of carbs and it was $6 so cheaper option it like Erica said that didn't have quite as much chicken as the fancier Caesar salad one so if you're looking for more protein you might go for that chicken Caesar okay so the hot roast meat section that kind of just used to be barbecued chicken it's really really branched out and it calls out and Woolies we found very similar options so there was multiple options with barbecued chicken so hot barbecue chickens they had like the free-range runs the standard ones we also saw Portuguese ones and then there was a chicken roll with spinach and ricotta or something so lots of roast chicken options they also had we saw roast beef and corned beef in that section mm-hmm ah hot ready to go yeah just the same as the chicken in those little bags but they've got a different color on them yeah i'm-a each kind of had a different color there was also pork like a roast pork and lamb yeah there was I was real and I mean you could obviously just have that by itself or I'd be happy with roast chicken another like a bit of mayo or something but alternatively you could then match it up with a salad so for example the Greek salad that we saw at Willie's with a chicken that would you know feed a family of four or we saw at Kohl's which something that we pointed out in our snack video will like the marinated cooked vegetables so there's like zucchini pumpkin capsicum and I think eggplant so you could grab one or more of those and a roast meat and that would be like your reason enough now we scoured the frozen section guys I was pretty disappointed very with what we found that section is full of plant-based options now not only that all the fish and chicken was crammed off yeah breaded like there was very very minimal and breaded things that were just like quick and easy to reheat the one we found in that kind of fish section where you find the Crum fished was the same fresh yeah it was not coated in anything and they had a couple of different flavors I think they might have had a plane but they also had a couple different flavors yeah so there was a Thai red curry and a parsley and citrus now I think it's like in a bag and you just heat it in the microwave it was like five minutes or something so a very quick and easy option that could be paired up with a salad awesome you know frozen food yeah those thing fresh frozen veggies have peeps of little packet options as well so you could do both of those in the microwave and dinner's done so they were roughly 3 grams of as per so depending on which country bar flavor they each oh so pretty low and for two serves it was nine dollars so in terms of frozen meals like you know Lean Cuisine the options were extremely there was so many different brands though like we're going through Weight Watchers link Wazir so not trying to like a massive plant-based section in that section but we found one company called core power foods and they had arranged that didn't suit because they had rice and stuff but they had a couple of chicken varieties that were reasonably low carb and definitely could be worked into your day now this was only at Kohl's we did not see these at Wally's and they were actually half price at the time so they're normally nine dollars over four dollars fifty I mean if you stopped up on a few of those in your freezer four dollars fifty pretty cheap meal if you get them on special I think it would definitely be worth it so they had two chicken options one was called The Naked chicken and the other one was called a seismic chicken and I think the seismic chicken just had some flavorings or something in it I wasn't too sure what the difference between the two words yeah and it had I mean green beans and broccoli like it had vegetables with it it was a full mature male so the naked chicken was 4.3 grams of carbs and the seismic one was 7 grams of carbs so again for a full meal completely low carb and workable into your macros if you're tracking my face yeah and perfect to have in the freezer kind of in case of like emergency when you just get home and can't be bothered just chucking that in the microwave would be super easy okay so that's out to go options at Coles and Woolies obviously check out our snack videos as well because they have loads of super handy things we've had heaps of feedback from people going they have you know found products that they never even knew existed at Coles and Woolies and so hopefully this video has given you some ideas around what you could do when you're in the situation at the supermarket and can't be bothered and just want something to throw together super quickly we'd really appreciate it if you would give the video a like and subscribe to our Channel thanks so much for watching bye [Music]", "40ZHT8OUMaQ": "hi everyone hi today we are going to make the cinnamon donuts if you watched our low carb emporium unboxing a couple of weeks ago these were in it i was super excited and we decided to make them for you so you can see what's involved yes so a few people actually requested that we make them and let let you know what they're like so these are from 180 cakes which we've made a couple of their kind of keto friendly sugar sugar-free kind of cake mix cake mix options on the channel before but these are the cinnamon donuts and what i think is good about these is it's not just cake shaped into a doughnut shape it's actually like a yeasted doughnut so what do we need to put in it so these are the things you need you need 150 mls of almond milk 40 mils of cream one sachet of dried yeast two large eggs 100 grams of unsalted butter or coconut oil um and you can do coconut cream if you're going for a dairy free option which is good that they give that and just the donut mold which we don't have um yeah so we don't have a donut mold so we're gonna do donut holes but i mean you're gonna get the gist of it right yes also what you need extra is whatever you're kind of coating them in so you could do like an icing or something but we're going with cinnamon and sugar or cinnamon and granulated sweeteners so i've already made some of that up as well so let's get cracking with making the doughnuts so you've got the oven on yes okay so there are a few steps to this where you kind of have to wait i guess because we're actually using yeast and proving something so 15 minutes ago i heated up the cream and the almond milk and popped the yeast in it and it's been sitting there for 15 minutes i was kind of thinking maybe it would bubble up it hasn't done that so i'm assuming that it is okay it doesn't say on there that it has to do that so so now that we've got that yeast done then we just put everything else into the bowl and feed it up with beaters for just one minute so this is the mixture so also the so sweetened with erythritol and it's 2.2 grams of carbs per donut how many donuts is it like we're not making regular doughnuts so it's going to be a little bit different but how many does it say it makes [Music] 16. we're going to get a lot of doughnuts so that is the dry mixture and then i'm going to pop in my i hope this is okay i'm very concerned about this but this is the the milk and the cream and the yeast and then you pop in two eggs and then 100 grams of melted butter or coconut oil and now i'm going to mix it up okay so that is our mixture now it says to set that aside for five minutes and just leave it to do its thing and then this is what we're going to bake them in because we don't have a doughnut hole a doughnut mold i don't really want to buy one just for this so it does say to grease them very well so that's just avocado oil spray you're using right yep from the supermarket i might do this and then use my finger to kind of spread it out so this is my cinnamon sugar so i did one part cinnamon and then four parts of this uh sucran monk fruit sweetener so just one say for example one teaspoon of cinnamon to four teaspoons of your sweetener and that's what we'll roll them in okay so we've let it rest for five minutes did thicken up a little bit so now it says to pop it into your doughnut mold and then leave it to sit again so i'm just gonna okay so they have been resting for 15 minutes they didn't really do anything um but now we're going to pop them in the oven for 20 minutes um i might just keep an eye on them because they're probably a bit smaller than okay so i've just pulled out an old donut holes out of the oven that was about 15 minutes don't they just look so cute um so i did a skewer it said on the packet till the skewer comes out clean so i've done that and now to let them sit in the um kind of tray for 10 minutes and to kind of cool down and then we'll get them out and pop them in our cinnamon and sugar okay so they have been sitting here for 10 minutes now i'm going to try and get them out hopefully they stay together and pop them in the cinnamon sugar mix so do they need to still be really reasonably warm for it to stick to the cinnamon sugar yeah i think just like so they're cool enough to handle right yep and stay together i guess so yeah i keep saying sugar but i mean like no real sugar in there granulated sweetener is what i mean but it seems to be sticking when do i get to eat one yeah after we've done this they look pretty good little donut holes kind of doughnut mini muffins so we got probably 36 little ones yeah or it was 16 regular sized donuts more just about to go in gonna give one a try yeah so they're still a little bit warm with the cinnamon sugar on the outside hmm i tried a little bit of the mixture without the cinnamon sugar you need the cinnamon sugar in my opinion they're not sweet at all without it but that's what makes a doughnut as well isn't it the cinnamon i think kids would love these it would really be like having a doughnut so i'm actually going to use those donut holes to make a trifle for christmas day i've never done that before but what else do i think it will work i think you know hopefully it'll be family friendly i was just going to put some custard some strawberry jellies or no jelly this time i'm going to put jelly anyway if you're interested to see what it turns out like follow along on instagram that's where i'll be posting about it but what did you think what would you do that i actually think it was more donut like than what i was maybe expecting like the flavor and the texture was more doughnut-like than what i've had before in terms of like a keto low-carb doughnut yeah where it's just really cake in the shape of a donut it was quite kind of light and airy and you can taste kind of the yeasty flavor like you would get in the doughnut so if you're a donut fan or you've got kids who are this could be a cool school holiday project if you want to get the donut mix you can get it on 180 cakes or low-carb emporium they're the best places to order it if you order from low-carb emporium have butter five is the discount for uh the code for a five percent discount yeah anyway last day tomorrow can you believe it we hope you've enjoyed the video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to our channel thank you so much for watching bye [Music] you", "e33lgOCYbBc": "hi everyone hi today we are doing a woolworths grocery kind of what we can find at woolworth's at a keto and low carb um some new stuff and also some of our old favorites that we've always loved yeah and some things are just new to us it might not yes um but we have just filmed a kohl's one a couple of weeks ago so if you're a coal shopper as well definitely check that one out and of course there's products that overlap between the two this was just what we found when we were there of course when you're at the supermarket we mostly buy meat and veg everyone knows where they are and what you can buy that is um low carb so what we're highlighting today is some of the more products that um you may not realize are low carb and available to you at woolworths yes and we would really appreciate it if you would give the video a like and subscribe to our channel that is a super easy way to support us if you like our content and it's free and we're inching our way to 10k that's my goal by the end of the year so please subscribe okay we're starting in the kind of raw meat section um and at our worst they have like a kind of prepared seasoned marinated raw meat that you could you then have to cook at home and they actually had some good options as far as like butterflied seasoned flavored chickens whole chickens now the beauty of it being butterflied is that it's much quicker to cook than like a whole roast chicken um they had a portuguese one and a lemon and herb one um and there was also there the woolworth's macro brand had like a greek sort of flavored one as well and they were all about two to three grams per serve which you know in your seasonings there's always going to be a little bit of carbs i mean the ingredients weren't perfect but they were pretty good i always say when you're looking at those kind of raw meats with marinades if you're looking and it says sweet or anything it's probably not going to be right but lemon herb chili those kind of things if it says those turn them over and check if they use soup so the price of those butterfly chickens was about eight dollars i love them because i just cook them on the bbq you can just pair them with some vegetables and you've got a meal done so we also saw two kind of marinated porks that you will then roast in the oven there was a pork loin roast with herbs and spices and it was less than one gram of carbs per serve and it was about 24 a kilo there was also as part of i think as part of the christmas range so it's probably just come in it will be in for the next couple of months but it was like a porchetta style pork roast it looked delicious and it was stuffed with like herbs and seasonings and it had like the skin on the outside so that was about one gram of carbs per serve and 22 dollars a kilo and erica said oh we should get that for christmas day because it looked great you really did and yeah so that's two really easy pork roast options that you don't have to really do anything to just put it in the oven and follow the directions on the packet another product we have loved for a little while now are the got singers sausages so i think they're only available at woolworths is that right yeah and depending where you are it depends on what the range is i know in kind of southeast queensland gold coast that's where they they're based you can get bigger right we found peeps when we were up there at ours when they have like the german bratwurst the little cheese krantz skis but the good thing with the godzingers is their ingredients are pretty clean like it's normally just pork and then herbs and spices and whatnot so some of them vary depending on the flavors so you probably want to have a quick look but it is a good as a general rule it's a good range we love them and they're yummy too so the carbs are going to vary depending on which ones you get but they were between one to two grams of carbs and they were about eight dollars a packet again depending on what you were getting okay into kind of the pantry aisles and one of the most popular products at woolworths is the macro low carb bread and they now have bread rolls as well so you can get a small loaf of bread or a little a little four pack of like bread rolls so they're five dollars for either the four pack of buns or the bread and the carbs are about 3.6 grams per serve so with the bread the serve is two slices and with the bun it's one bun so again that's got you know wheat and soy blah blah blah not something we would eat at all probably because we didn't actually like it's kind of a little bit i don't know it doesn't have a lot of flavor but it is very popular we also have a video where we did a comparison of the macro bread with the audi bread um so we will put a link for that if you're interested in why we preferred one over the other it doesn't have a lot of flavor but it has less seeds than the aldi one so i think that's probably why people like it left it more it's more like just a regular bread so now we move into the health food section of woolworths and one of my favorite parts is the chocolate section so you could spend hours trying to find something that works in there but the best low carb chocolate in that section is the well naturally we've featured them before they are ever expanding their range now they've moved into white chocolate now which is super exciting we haven't even tried it yet but it's really exciting they had a white chocolate and a white chocolate with raspberry in it they also reasonably recently came out with like a honeycomb one a salted caramel and a roasted hazelnut and they're in kind of like the golden looking packets the range was massive when we're trying to film it i'm like they have a lot of flavors it's five dollars a block and it ranges between one and two grams per serve which is i'm not sure what the serving size is no i'm not sure because i always eat more than a certain size what i will say is i have found that the range is better at woolworth's than a cold 100 coals only have like the milk chocolate in the bigger bars and then they have a few of the dark chocolate skinny bars but it's good to see um some competition for vita works which was really the only kind of white chocolate option we have i had the sneaking suspicion it would still taste nicer like i haven't tried the one that silly one but i think it would be hard to top the vital and i do like the vitamix milk chocolate better than the well naturally milk chocolate but it's more expensive and not at the supermarket that's the difference you can buy this at the supermarket which you can't buy um vital works at coles or woolworths also something that we haven't seen before in the health food section is the macro which is like the woolworth's kind of healthy brand they had xantham gum so that's something that has been a little bit difficult to find before so great to see that woolworths have their own now was five dollars for a bag that will last you like your lifetime because you only use the tiniest bit but yeah it's a popular thing in low carb cooking and baking as like a thickener or like for texture in baked goods so that's good to see and another product that we have been using a bit with our clean and simple reset is coconut aminos so that is also in the health food section and it's like a kind of wheat free soy free soy sauce alternative made from coconut it's delicious pickles is another one of my favorite favorite things i love to put it on burgers sometimes i will even have it as like um like with my lunch with some cold meat some cheese if i'm eating cheese and some cherry tomatoes that kind of thing i would add a couple of pickles now pickles can be very tricky to find some that have um don't have sugar added um and i have found my favorite one it's actually in the health food section which is extremely strange i think it's because it's organic um and so it's not with the other pickles which is where people get a little bit confused it's called serra's pickles they are absolutely delicious they are 6.50 for a pretty big jar and the um carbs is 0.7 per serve so really good yeah and they have like a plain just a regular pickle flavor and the chili ones as well so yes that is dan's favorite so we always have we always have them in there one in the pantry and one over the fridge i will say the jars are very hard to open um good to see nat via have come out with some you know they seem to have a lot more products now than what they used to they used to just have sweeteners but they have raspberry and strawberry jam that was about 1.7 grams of carbs per serve which is pretty good considering it's got fruit in it and they were sweetened with stevia and erythritol which is great and they're six dollars a jar just in with the regular jam so a good thing to keep an eye out for i have been really enjoying as the weather here in australia warms up making iced tea my favorite brand is the red seal it's cheaper than the twinings infusions they can be made hot or cold they have a rain i think they have four or five different flavors yeah i really love them what i normally do is just pop four in a one liter bottle fill it with room temperature water let it brew store it in the fridge overnight and it's ready to go for the next day and i absolutely love it as a alternative to water yeah it is really nice and i really like the peach and pineapple is that the flavor it's really yummy and i i like the flavor of them better than the twine yeah i think they have a really nice flavor they're 4.50 for a box yeah something that someone mentioned in our facebook group we haven't actually tried these but i was excited to see a kind of nice looking cordial that was sweetened with natural sweeteners so like monk fruit stevia and erythritol and it was the bigfoot sugar-free cordials so they had um three different flavors at our woolworths some were called sugar-free and some are called diet but seem to be the similar things so there was mixed berry there was a lemon lemon bitters and a lemon flavored they were less than one gram of carb per serve and i think three dollars sixty years for like a pretty big bottle like i think it would last you a while but i thought the lemon lemon bitters one was a nice coming into this time of year where you might like that with you know some vodka and soda water or something would make a really nice kind of special feeling drink and you would probably find that you don't use the same amount that you made when you made potties like you probably don't need as much either to kind of make it nice sweet and flavored so we just we talked about the alina's kind of big seed crackers in our kohl's video and in our worst those are actually in the health food section but in the regular section there are other elena's seed crackers which are kind of they're called simply seeds and they were like flavored seed crackers so there was like herb and garlic moroccan rosemary pepper as well i think and they were like a round small seed cracker that would be much nicer on a cheese board than those kind of big other ones but they were higher in carbs so they were two to three grams of carbs per serve um but i thought it was nice that they were flavored and i liked the shape of them better for kind of dipping or cheese boards and the serve was a quarter of the pack so it was probably maybe four crackers three or four crackers so not too bad also in the cracker section keep an eye out at coles for the always fresh parmesan crackers they're just 100 parmesan cheese kind of dried out they're super crunchy but it is like a smaller packet than what you think and can be tricky to find yeah it's really can be hard to find but it was quite close to where those elena crackers were so if you see those you should be able to find the parmesan crisps as well we have also really been loving the keeper cleaner products in the coles video we talked about their pasta sauces um but they also have salsas now to find the salsas they are with the corn chips where the el paso yeah where those salsas are yeah we have tried them and they are really really delicious they're super clean ingredients which we love so there's two flavors there's a mild and a chunky they were four dollars each less than one gram of carbs and yeah as dan said no vegetable oils no sugar no anything they taste good and yeah they're just along with the other salsas and the doritos and stuff now we move into the sauces now this is very difficult to find anything decent in there but i have found something that is worth getting and it's the heinz american mustard new york style i don't even know how i found it because i was we were making burgers and i wanted to find mustard that was clean and we usually use like a dijon or something like that and it's um fine but i wanted an american style easy one yeah exactly you know that's how you make a burger and i turned it over and i could not believe it didn't have sugar it didn't have the seed oils in it i was so excited so if you're looking for an american style mustard heinz american mustard yeah it was called mild new york style yeah and it's 2.75 and it's less than one gram of carb per serve so if you're a burger lover like me get it believe me someone mentioned on the cole's video that we should have a look at the kind of sugar-free options in the kind of i see poles along the lines of super dupers which is like a you know it's like a plastic tube full of colored sweet liquid that you freeze at home so at coles they had a couple of options actually they had their sugar freezies which had like kind of a very kid orientated so they had frozen as in the musical um and they had other kid ones but they were actually kind of natural colors and flavors which i thought was good so they were colored with carrots and that type of thing rather than you know the dyes um they were sweetened with erythritol stevia and they had some mouth atoll in them so i was a little bit unsure but i assume it's a small amount because it's pretty much just flavoured water like but choose your own adventure there also natvia had um what would they call it similar sort of thing but they didn't have maltitol in them so i would be choosing those ones but yeah two different kind of sugar-free options um for summer people seem to love them we have never been people that eat that kind of thing we'd be more ice cream kind of people than the icy um frozen ice cream you can see how for summertime it would be people enjoy them yeah so we've always had the kind of greens sugar-free maple syrup here that have um add our words out apple and cinnamon flavor and a regular flavor but we came there was two more sugar-free maple syrup brands that we had not seen before one was steve's um and it said it was like derived from canadian maple syrup sugar-free it was zero grams of carbs sweetened with sucralose and it was five dollars so i've never seen that before the shape of the bottle was actually like that maple syrup you know the glass shaped bottle so that was interesting it's important to note that they're not maple syrup they're maple flavored syrup because they have no maple syrup in them because maple syrup is small maple flavour yes um and then they had the lecanto maple syrup which is sweetened with monk fruit and erythritol it's 14 guys like that seems like a lot i mean i guess it's not something you're using in great quantities like how often he having maple syrup i still don't think it's worth it and it was also over five grams of carbs per serve so choose your own adventure again [Laughter] but three different brands of sugar-free maple syrups who even are we you might be thinking what am i doing with my maple syrup so maple flavored syrup that's right no shoe have recently come out with a pancake mix you know whatever and shake it um they had two that seemed to um be reasonably low carb they had a low carb one then they had a buttermilk one did you say that was more protein kind of based or something no there was three oh there was a protein one which was a bit higher in carbs i think it was about eight grams per serve then there was the low carb one and the buttermilk which were both around five grams of carbs per serve so three different kind of shake shaker pancake options that were no sugar and they're six dollars for your little shaker container yeah i think they use kind of chickpea flour and coconut flour so depending on your version of keto it may not suit you but i kind of thought it was a good option for like um kids or like perhaps if you're going camping or something like that speaking of la canto there's also two brand new la canto products that they had at our woolworth's which was an icing um icing sugar substitute i guess so it's more like a powdered than granulated so we haven't been able to get like a a sugar substitute that's been kind of that powdered um texture at the supermarket before so that's exciting and they also had a baking blend which was said it was a caster sugar replacement and it did have some other things in it it had a bit of tapioca and xanthan gum so i haven't tried using it in baking to see if it makes a difference but as their sweeteners they use erythritol and stevia and we've loved the other la canto products i think i use monk fruit oh yeah sorry monk fruit and arrested that's why it's called like monk fruits yeah i was like did i miss something so the price for the la canto is 9.95 and the bag looked bigger than did it and the other one i think i didn't look at the grams though so one of the products that we have found as a result of our mystery box challenge videos is a harissa paste which can get we found it at coles and woolies in the kind of herbs and spice section in a yellow box and we've actually been really enjoying using it it's super clean ingredients and i always kind of avoided it because i thought it was too spicy it's not spicy it's not spicy at all i mean it is a bit spicy but it just has a really nice kind of smoky chili flavor um and i think it would be it's really good just for rubbing on you know chicken drumsticks and then baking them in the oven or something but yeah something to keep an eye out for if you want to try something can you and i think it's a tube isn't it yeah it's a tube in like a yellow box and it's just pretty much chilies and spices and it's 2.60 for the tube now when we're cooking we mainly use olive oil or avocado oil we talked about the avocado oil at cold but what i have been really enjoying using on when i'm cooking on the bbq is they have an avocado oil spray at woolworths and it's not an aerosol so when you spray it it just oil is kind of coming out and it's really good on the barbecue because it actually you know when you used to use you know like the canola oil spray and the bbq would almost combust this actually doesn't do it it kind of seems to be much safer to use as well as its avocado oil so yeah and you can use it just in you know in your fry pan or whatever if you just want a little bit of oil or if you don't want to grease something or something yeah i think it's good it's 6.50 for the can and it actually lasts us quite a long time now the last section that we looked at um was just like the refrigerated section and there is a new yogurt option that looks like it kind of indicated it's a traditionally kind of strained greek yogurt which is like our favorite type because it's super creamy creamy and nice so the brand was easier and it was four point six grams of carbs per hundred grams which is pretty good for you for a yogurt option um yeah that was quite high protein as well and it was a decent sized tub and it was 5.50 for the tub another thing we found in the cold section was that they're becoming more and more popular in our supermarkets is the little kind of snack packs and quite often they have biscuits and dip and that kind of thing but we've found a couple of different ones lately this one was from premo and it was just a little packet like that and it had twiggy's and cheese yeah so it was kind of they're like little kind of salami meat sticks they're kind of mini ones yeah and just some little cubes of cheese so it would be a perfect kind of grab-and-go option if you needed a quick lunch or something like that that you just wanted to grab from the supermarket um and it was four dollars and about 2.6 grams of carbs and i've not seen that before and they had like a mild one and a hop yes two different flavors so that is some new products um new to us products some old faithful products that we have found at woolworths that are low carbon keto friendly so we hope you found this video useful this is by no means an exhaustive list it is just stuff that we have found people in our group have found and we want you all to know that they're out there let us know in the comments below your favorite keto friendly woolworth's products definitely give the video a thumbs up and subscribe to our channel and we'll see you next time thanks for watching bye [Music]", "fMuY1YI1eio": "heyyo today we are making vanilla custard which is just delicious it is so good we love to have it firm like a little dessert if you feel like a little sweet yelling after dinner you can just talk put it with some berries blueberries strawberries mix it up delicious yeah and it's basically egg yolks and cream so it's like a family friendly ingredients and delicious sorry let's get started so we're going to vanilla bean here and we just scraped out the seeds we can only do like and it doesn't give it like a super vanilla even done and we'll put the vanilla pod in there as well because we're going to strain it later anyway so we've got in here our two cups of cream and our vanilla bean that we've scraped the seeds out of them we put all the seeds and the pulp everything in there and then we're just going to add a pinch of salt and then we're going to prop this on the heat and we're just going to slowly heat it up we'd order to boil we just want it to get hot but hot but no boil okay so we've just got our cream on the heat it's just on like a medium heat and we're just got a spatula we're just gonna keep stirring that while it warms up I'm not sure how long it'll take probably about five minutes or so and then while that's happening we are gonna get out a mixture any so we've got six egg yolks here and we've got two tablespoons of sweetener I'm just going to pop that in and then enjoy it with great edit stuff yeah that's super ones so it's a wonderful I'm sure and it looks exactly like sugar yeah so you're just gonna give that a lease and break out all the egg what sorry break up hope egg yolks just have been bond it's just to get it all and you're not dissolving the sugar or anything you're not gonna take it I thought yeah yeah so we just leave that there and we'll just get out cream until it's heated up okay so good cream it just about ready you can see it's got steam coming off it now it's not boiling okay so we've got our hot cream and I'm just gonna pour and into the egg yolk mixture and whisking while I'm doing it slowly trickle it in got to avoid trying to scramble arrived yeah put it all in vanilla main pantanal and some of your vanilla beans my economy's sitting at the bottom so I'm seems great those in and then it's best to give the saucepan a wash so that when we put it back on the stove doesn't it tell you something okay we've got a clean sauce right now and we're just going to pour our custard mixture back into their barely changed color with the egg yolks - yeah then we're going to put it back on the stove and we just wanted to slowly heat it up and it'll thicken from the egg yolks do you keep stirring it yes I want to keep stirring it all the time now from now it's for being stirring it for a few minutes now you have to be have to have medications with this recipe you can see it's starting to thicken a little bit already just go to keep stirring it just be patient and it will be okay guys you can see it's getting nice and thick now and a good way of telling if it's ready is just if it coats the back of the spoon and you can run your finger down and it doesn't join together so we can see how big and delicious that looks come with the vanilla bean it smells so good doesn't it okay so let's take it off the heat now it looks so good yes and it's I love the smell of vanilla so it's always like magic to me okay cool so now we're at the point where we want to strainer to remove the vanilla bean pod and also just in case there's any lumps of egg that's called or anything like that so we're just going to strain it we've got a straining here over a bowl I'm just gonna pour it through make sure we get all of the vanilla beans out of the bottom of the saucepan because that's yeah we part so the consistency of this isn't like the thick custard you kind of buy at the supermarket it's more of a kind of horrible custard right and as you like as it cools down in the refrigerator it does pick it up a little bit and I prefer to eat it not cold out of the fridge and off a little bit the hair and a lot but we'd like some berries or like coconut granola that type of now I'm going over on top of these yummy as well but if you need a warm it's whatever you prefer it would be nice like just a drizzle over a mug cake or something like that yeah yeah but you tried it yes okay here we go hope not and it's deep hmm yeah that's our rich honestly you don't need a lot of it you don't need that super rich feeling that it's so nice and it's such a satisfying little sweet treat I think after after dinner if you're interested in making these check out the full recipe as well because I like to have like in front of me when I'm cooking it so even if you wanted to print it off that would be helpful yes so just remember to be patient winner and to try to keep your stove relatively low because if you take it too high and try to do it quickly it can split but as you can see it works perfectly so we would love you to give us a trailer know in the comments below and your favorite way to serve customs we also have a few recipes that use this custard so I'll link them in the description below as well if you want to check those out but please give the video like subscribe to our channel we would really appreciate your support we've got loads more videos coming out with new recipes and we've got lots of kino traveling coming up this year that you'll definitely want to follow along with so thank you so much for watching [Music]", "VbAZA4OXi2c": "hi guys we're in Japan how cool is that we have been here for over a week now and we've absolutely loved it now we follow Aikido lifestyle so when we're on holidays we try as much as we can to keep as local as possible it's probably more local yeah so we don't sweat the small stuff you know it's marinade stuff like that we just try and do the best that we can and we thought it might be helpful to show you some of the cool keto friendly foods that we found during our time in Japan now I will say it's probably been harder than we thought it was going to be because I mean we knew going in there was gonna be a lot of rice and noodles but we have found it more challenging so hopefully this video can show you some of the things you will be able to find low carb in Japan yeah definitely one thing I will say there's way more bread here than what I saw they're really big on bakeries and stuff and I guess we haven't really been with the language barrier and also from a cultural perspective we haven't wanted to ask for sauce or no rice or no noodles because we didn't want to seem rude and we also found it difficult to communicate that so what we tended to do was just choose the best option and then you know eat around the rice or the noodles which i think is probably a good way to go because they are very kind of proud and accommodating so we didn't want to upset people by saying asking for no right yes yeah and also that's such a you know normal thing here to eat that it would seem really strange so anyway here's some things that we have found that we're really yummy we have actually found that I can be your friend imagine of the finding awesome key two options we have found lots of leader friendly stuff at the convenience store one of our favorites has been boardings you can find them everywhere with people these peels these but feel them good to go other things we've found achieve lots of cheese I didn't really expect to see so much kind of European cheese's salami chicken breast that's cooked and ready to go nice Ericka fennel butter coffee in the Family Mart so there's a few different convenience stores we've been into Family Mart 7-eleven and a lot the Lawson's they're everywhere they're on literally every corner we've also been in to the department store down the bottom of the department stores they have like a food area can we be like the David Jones food area and it's much more kind of fresh meat and things like that so definitely use the convenience stores they are going to be your friend because there's lots of kiddo options there we've been using what we get at the convenience store for breakfast pretty much every day so we just had our first experience with sukiyaki here in Tokyo and it was an awesome Kirra friendly option so there was just kind of like a flavored broth and in that they cooked cabbage mushrooms a little bit of tofu some onion and then like Wagyu beef on the top there were some noodles in there we just avoided them but it was so yummy and such a good kena from the options yakitori is another great Peter option now that is chicken sticks last night we're more wandering around in Shinjuku we also saw that there was the yakitori alley unfortunately we had already eaten but if you're looking for a tutorial reckon that was the place to go there was heaps of yakitori stations there from the time we just got this from the supermarket like a department store but you can get them from restaurants convenience stores even have them so lots of options to get this in Tokyo if you're in Tokyo you should definitely come to Tsukiji Adam market there are loads of street food options and we found so many keto friendly things including oysters yeah journaled scallops grilled octopus and there with matcha yeah lots of options and even some things that we didn't try but we saw like grilled chicken like yakitori and then like Wagyu beef grilled I mean that honestly we are so full definitely come and check this out and great keto options in there guys definitely during our time in Tokyo in visited Tokyo Disneyland and in Tokyo DisneySea and I will say the low carb options pretty slim and I don't think is supposed to bring your own food so one recommendation I would have is you can easily get on the monorail and go over to the shopping center which is back at one of the main train station and there is heaps of food options there in coop including a supermarket that has loads of things but some things that we did find out one of them is spicy smoked chicken legs so that looks delicious at DisneySea and Tokyo disease and we found Turkey where it's very juicy and I taste it [Music] young lots of people walking around with these and a Tokyo Disney theme this is actually part of their kind of special Christmas food so it's probably only available like November December but it says something's called a sausage on a bone and it's like a cheese can ski all this I think [Music] one of the things I've really been enjoying is the unsweetened iced tea all of the kind of convenience stores supermarkets this ones that jasmine tea but we've tried to really boss tried like green one as well all on quite a few different ones and also they have some good sparkly this one's an orange one there's been lemon plain so we've been enjoying the drinks here even though we've been avoiding Pepsi Max and everything your options so some of the meals we didn't get a chance to try we didn't get a chance to try a steak now I would have liked to have tried a Kobe or Wagyu steak but it's really keep in mind that is really expensive here yes so both Korean barbecue and Japanese barbecue would be really good options I think particularly Japanese barbecue because it doesn't have quite as much marinades and stuff as Korean and they do include like vegetables and stuff but yeah the beef is super high quality at most of the places we've seen and you do pay for that and like it's expensive here anyway so just keep that in mind and make sure you check the price but yeah it would have been really nice to have like one fancy smancy steak another option that we didn't get around to trying was mas burger which is like a chain of burger restaurants that have a low carb lettuce wrapped bun on their menu so if you get a chance to check that out that could be a good option yeah that's probably a good option if you kind of been out all day and you just want something quick and easy that would be a good option yeah so I guess just to recap some of the things that we have found super easy to access boil eggs at the convenience store yakitori or some sort of grilled chicken on a stick you can get them supermarkets convenience store restaurants sashimi sashimi yeah so that's super easily accessible again it varies in price so just be aware of that what else the unsweetened iced tea yeah that has been my it's access to the unsweetened teas which we just don't have in Australia readily available this has been awesome all the convenience stores massive amount of choice and in the convenience store sparkling mineral water with flavors I've had like grapefruit lemon so it's not sweetened but just has the flavour in it so that's been really nice so it definitely has been options here but would probably have found that a little bit challenging at a time the highlight I think probably for both of us was the sukiyaki yeah it was like a full experience if you want an experience meal I would recommend trying sukiyaki yeah for sure and that was delicious it's not like we'd never had any sort of Wagyu beef before so yeah you don't really have to try that once I think if you're coming so we will pop a link in the description below of the blog post that we've done about what we've found in Japan there'll be lots of links and things in that blog post as well so we really hope this helps you with planning your trip to Japan and staying local we've really enjoyed visiting here it's definitely one of our favorite places and it's doable guys oh yeah totally doable if you've liked this video please make sure you give it a thumbs up and thanks so much for watching guys bye-bye [Music]", "LCYtWg8cucw": "today we going to show you guys how to make one of our favorite keto side dishes cauliflower cheese break yeah or like casserole depending on weight I'm from yes one has a different name for it but it is basically cheesy goodness on college level yeah exactly and this will convert even kids that don't like cauliflower Erica's nephew hates cauliflower bake we served it to him and he said this was the best thing he'd ever yeah that was actually Christmas day like yeah we did this because not only my family's potato make all the way for Christmas Day mine too we made this and my nephew even a that he hates cauliflower and he loved it he went that the seconds I think so it's really good and it's pretty easy I think to make the first thing that we do is just cut the cauliflower into florets I've used a bit more than 500 grams here it doesn't matter so much on how much you use no God yeah that was just one small whole cauliflower and what we're going to do is roast this in the oven first while we prepare all the toppings and what that does is kind of dry it out so at the end you not left with kind of a mushy or like watery so I think that's a good tip to roast your cauliflower first to dry it out so bringing that oven to about 180 degrees 350 350 or not and we're just gonna pop out cauliflower and for about 25 to 30 minutes just to roast off until it's tender when you're gonna Creek the stalk with a knife and while it's in the oven we're going to get our cheese sauce ready and all the goodness that's gonna go on the top to make it delicious with the cheese sauce we've made a video making the cheese sauce which I will link up in the corner so you know how to make the cheese sauce okay so while the cauliflower is in the oven we're going to make our cheese sauce and there you've got a separate video about that so we won't make it again for you but the other thing we're going to do is cook up some bacon that we've chopped up and elite so this is just the white part of one leek that we've sliced up so we're going to cook these up in a frypan until they're kind of golden brown and caramelized and then we're going to pop it all together at the end this is what makes it really really really good okay so we're just starting off by cooking the bacon first so we just want to cook it down a bit to kind of cook the fat out and for it to start to brown and then we'll pop the leek in after the bacons cooked down okay all about meat some pieces and now we're just going to assemble it together so you can see there's all the flowers come out of the oven and it's kind of browned and dried up a little bit which i think is good to try and stop that moisture and that's why we do this rather than kind of steaming it right yeah so now we're going to pop it all into a nice baking dish that we want to serve it in okay so we've got all of our kind of pre-roasted cauliflower in the baking dish and we have our bacon and our link that we've cooked down together and then we have our cheese sauce so what we're gonna do is pop the bacon and the leek mixture into the cheese sauce and then we're gonna mix that around and pull that so we're just gonna mix these two together okay a leader just like a cheap really creamy cheese sauce with bacon and I'm mmm I mean come so now we're gonna pour this over the top so you kind of want to get it as even as you can buff it all kind of move around a bit minutes cooking anyway so we're gonna just put all of our cheesy sauce mixture in there and then we're going to just pop a bit of grated cheese on the top we've just got cheddar cheese or like tasty cheese's what you would call it in Australia so cauliflower in dakedo world is like the new potato right the new black it is used for everything in replacement of potatoes so I've seen like potato salad using cauliflower this is kind of like a traitor make lots of replacements cauliflower mash cauliflower rice lots of replacement the cauliflower is a great animal yes even everything those means which is like you know okay that my baby needs out of cauliflower like you keep distant cremate yeah I'd say nice still cauliflower okay so there we go so we've got our cauliflower with the bacon and leek cheese sauce grated cheese so now we're gonna pop it in the oven about 20 to 30 minutes until it's all golden brown and bubbly and delicious it smells so good it smells so JD it's all like bubbling delicious so this would be perfect to have alongside a steak or some sausages for dinner grilled chicken you can even eat some of it on its own kind of like a mac and cheese yeah Oh YUM yeah and it keeps quite well in the fridge we even throws it up before you could probably get it ready to the stage just before you bake it and give it in the fridge and then you know like if you want to prepare it on the weekend and then just chuck it in there up and on the night that you want to have it too good kind of prep ahead option definitely a kid-friendly option as well so if you're trying to feed your whole family and you're trying to eat keto this is a really big winner with the whole family bacon cheese I mean you can't really go wrong okay we really hope you give this recipe a try definitely let us know in the comments below if you do and maybe what your family think of it I'm sure they're gonna like it make sure you give this video a like if you've enjoyed this recipe and thank you so much for watching guys thanks a lot bye [Music]", "EGAdPXS7g-o": "today we're going to show you guys how to make our kiddo granola yes so it's just made with nuts and seeds and it's delicious and crunchy and is one of the first father recipes with there's like the first I think yeah we kind of music granola and cereal so much so we had to come up with an alternative and this is such a tasty alternative yes so that's easy so let's get going first off coconut so we're going to put all of our nuts and seeds into this bowl and we've chopped some of them up and you can use any sort of variety of nuts and seeds that you have it doesn't have to be exactly what's in the recipe the coconut is the plain Bowl yet so there's 100 grams of coconut and then 50 grams of macadamia nuts we've chopped that I've already chopped up just roughly chopped we like it a bit coarse yeah pecans 50 grams again and another 50 grams we also have a video you should check out which shows like the best fun of nuts Paquito as far as carbs so definitely check that out and maybe you could incorporate some of those not some of the other nuts we've used as well worn out to reviews yeah or we try to avoid nuts like cashews and peanuts because they're bit lower in height and then the seeds 30 grams of pumpkin seeds or pepitas 23 grams of sesame seeds and 20 grams of chia seeds so again the chia seeds sometimes we use hemp seed after pencil sometimes many these probably seeds whatever we've got at home yeah we just mix this up but yeah we just give that a quick toss in a bowl and then we'll start getting our wet ingredients together that was just gonna pour over to kind of coat it and that was that's what makes it all you know crunchy and delicious when you bake them in the oven we do have our oven preheating because we are going to bake it so 180 degrees Celsius 350 Fahrenheit and we've got a baking tray here that we've lined with some paper so that's the dry ingredients done so now we'll get our liquid ready so we've got our 50 grams of butter here that we've already melted and we've let it cool a little bit from being in the microwave yeah but if you are dairy-free you could use coconut oil or you could use ghee or whatever you prefer we like the flavor of butter so we're putting in a quarter teaspoon of salt quarter teaspoon of this maple flavor which we get it from iHerb and it's kind of just it's kind of like I guess the vanilla essence but think maple maple and just do rather than using maple syrup delicious flavor yeah and it's the smell of it I think as well smells really delicious and then we're gonna add a tablespoon of cinnamon from our giant size job we can speak to anyone needs cinnamon here huh and then what makes it kind of caramely and delicious I think is this super in gold so we're going to add three tablespoons of this and you could use another sweetener if you don't have this one the link below to where you can buy Sukhram is available in Australia and it's definitely our preferred sweetener and it's a mix of stevia and erythritol and definitely our preferred sweetener as far as taste and everything that was made for our family and friends who are keto they've enjoyed it not so there's an aftertaste or anything so that's kind of effective check it out so I've just mixed up those weird ingredients to get like a little bit of a kind of wet paste that we're going to now add to the nuts so pop the nuts pour this in yeah so my niece loves making this yes anyone can make it it's not it's not I mean she's a really good cook but yeah definitely get kids involved great way to get them involved actually I actually do make this recipe yeah this is true because you it was your favorite yeah we know he often say even Dane can do it actually do it with the recipe to the team okay so we just want to make sure we get all the little bits of coconut and the seeds and everything all coated in that yummy secret and butter goes down and you can smell that smells amazing in here already yeah because of this demand so now we're just going to take a baking tray that we've got fun with no speak baking paper and we just go to pour the granola and you don't want to spread it out evenly across the tray so that it all gets a bit of heat and that makes it really crispy and crunchy and delicious okay so it's ready to go in the oven now and we're going to pop it in for about 10 minutes my tip is to keep an eye on it because it can kind of catch if you don't watch it and also about half way through give it a bit of a mix around so that it all kind of gets a bit toasty and crunchy because otherwise it might say bit wet on the bottom so yeah just give it a bit of a mix around occasionally so that it all gets toasty and it goes that was 10 minutes smells amazing I can't wait to have some of this a bit later with some Greek yogurt and berries that's my favorite way to have it so it was 10 minutes in the oven I stirred it a couple of times and it looks perfect it goes kind of golden that's exactly the way you want it to look and when it comes out it has to cool down and kind of harden up before it's missed yeah so don't still look a little bit wet you dryer yes it cools down so you want to let it cool completely and then the best way to store it is in an airtight job yeah so the other things I like to have with vanilla custard just a sprinkle on top and also on top of you cheap yeah a chain a little garnish because here you're putting we tend to use it more for garnish than like a cereal yeah exactly because yeah you have to eat all like it's it's not something you probably want to eat in bulk quantity that's right you don't think of it more as a garnish but yeah certainly gives you that crunchy granola yeah feeling when you have Italy yogurt so we've got the full recipe details in the description below so definitely check that out if you want to make it remember you can sub in your own nuts you don't need to use exactly the same ones we've used and we would love to hear what you do with your granola so do you do you eat it like a trail mix what do you how do you like to eat yogurt but thanks so much what you would really appreciate it if you would give this video a like and subscribe to our Channel if you like these types of videos because there's much more of these coming out also us Kito life and we've got a big trip coming up guys so also local pedo travel eating [Music]", "IamW8BiFp50": "who doesn't love meatballs I mean I love me and my family particularly loves these pesto meatballs Erica's mom makes them anytime they're invasive the nephew oh this is something we can eat and then something everyone else loves as well yeah definitely a wiener I went ready from my family and my mama has actually made them as well so there you go you're gonna try this recipe and it's pretty easy I think and there's a couple of steps to it but it's a good family dinner so let's get started so we've got 250 grams of ground pork or pork mince and ground beef that's about half a pound in the u.s. half a pound so 2:08 so 500 total and then we're just going to put all the ingredients in here and then we'll mix it up and make the meatball so I've got a quarter cup of grated Parmesan cheese a quarter of a cup of our mill so that's kind of replacing I guess the bread crumbs you might normally happen to meatball to keep it kind of a bit soft we've got one egg and we've got a quarter cup of basil pesto that we've just made too good a video on how to make that so yeah we know that I'll check that out because it's very easy to make and it's a awesome thing to have around not just for these meatballs but just to put on everything okay so we also just gonna put some salt and pepper but yes that's doing that if you want there now you are gonna have to get your hands dirty cuz you're gonna make so you just want to mix it really well make sure everything's all combined its rolling meatballs and grating cheese that's her area of expertise so yeah it's really good to give it a good mix together to make sure it's all thoroughly combined you want all the mince and everything or you know a uniform and then we're going to roll it into about 20 golf ball size meatballs so after we make the meatballs we are going to fry them off on the stove top first in some olive oil just to brown them and then we're going to make a sauce in here and then finish them off in the oven so we're using this it's like an enamel cast iron dish which is the oven safe and can go on the stovetop so that's if you've got an oven safe fraggin or something with some sides on it that's a good option if not you can just cook them off in a fry pan and then put them into a baking dish and put the sauce over and put it into the oven that way [Music] we have the oven preheating at 200 degrees Celsius which is 3 93 95 through got all of our meatballs here on side dish is heating up with a bit of olive oil in it and we're just going to pump in the meatballs and wrap them up on the both sides do do you normally throw them all at once well it depends on the size of your pan you might need to do two batches I'll see how I go I reckon up they are gonna be choking all right good but you don't want them too crazy and you want to make sure they've got a little bit of room between so we'll see how we go this is quite a big go to quite a big face on it does it basically we can get the ball in or a thing you're gonna do you're gonna you're not going to get a mean I'll say that was beneath uh-huh perfect just so now we just want to cook them fresh 7 or 8 minutes or until they're kind of browned on both sides it doesn't matter if they're not completely cooked through because we are going to be cooking them in the oven as well I mean folks have been cooking for yes but I mean in a minute yeah and we just got them golden brown on both sides and we're just gonna take them out now and make the sauce so you definitely want to leave all this goodness in the pan yeah so we have got two cups of fathanah don't crazy and we've got a teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of oregano we're just going to add in and some salt and pepper and then we're just gonna give that a stir and let it simmer away for just two to three minutes to kind of come together and then we will add meatballs back in so you kind of want to scrape the bits off the bottom as well because they're yummy so is that kind of this sort of the glaze is a little bit I guess yeah so just give it a stir and then we'll bring it to a simmer for a couple of minutes and then we'll pop our meatballs back in okay so that's been simmering away for a little while we're just gonna knock our meatballs back in those smooth and just I like to get them like a little bit coated in the sauce and then we're gonna pop our cheese on the top and then pop them in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes so you just want them to get the cheese all melted and golden brown and the meatballs to be pooped through okay yeah so that's looking delicious it's trying to spread them out of it delicious here we're using just a combination of mozzarella and cheddar cheese cuz that's what we had just sprinkle that all over the top and then pop it straight into the oven it goes in the oven for about 15-20 minutes like Erika said till it's kind of golden brown Oh 20 minutes in the oven it smells like a pizza really in the other night it smells amazing looks really delicious a year to try to have let it go gonna eat a meatball then ate a whole one we got 22 yeah by the way all the details of how to make this their recipes in this I'm marginally checking that out sorry it's probably at home but I love these meatballs they're so full of flavor they're not dry and the tomato the cheese yep we love to serve them at the table with a bit of extra pesto drizzled on the top just for a bit of extra freshness maybe positive yeah as we said you could serve them with doodles or even just sometimes have them we'd like steamed broccoli or so much cognac noodles what comedy rice or just by themselves you don't miss the pasta at all I don't I don't definitely give this recipe a try it is a family friendly winner I think yeah kids love it non-key know people love it we love it try it if you liked this video you guys make sure you give it a thumbs up we would really appreciate it if you would subscribe to our Channel we've got lots more recipe videos coming out as well as our keto travels so you definitely want to follow along thanks so much bye [Music]", "eFEFyDp5YGY": "everyone hi today we are going to do a halloumi video the battle of the halloumi's can we call it that we can call it that halloumi is really it's a cheese just as yes it's not a popular thing in the us but it is really readily available in australia you can get them at kohl's woolworths and audi which we will go into more in a little bit yes so we have got three different brands of halloumi here so we're going to compare them all cook them all up show you our favorite way to cook halloumi and then do a little taste test and decide so the brands that we have here three different brands we have lemnos so this one is kind of a very kind of block-like yes it's a much different shape to what i would think of as like traditional halloumi and it's just cow's milk yeah you said so um yeah the ones that erica has is much more traditional looking um the carbs on this per 100 is 1.5 yep and that one's six dollars and it's 180 grams where i think most other blocks are 250 grams so it's a little bit expensive i would think what we find people use this for is if they want to make halloumi chips because it is the neat block you can kind of cut them into good chip like um battens whereas that's a little bit harder to do with the more traditional ones so to me these are the more traditional looking like that is what i would expect a block of halloumi to look like and it's almost kind of folded over with like a hole that's slit in the middle um but we have got the aldi brand which i don't think we've tried before um it was 4.99 so the cheapest option that we have and it's a mixture of cows sheep and goat milk which i think is a traditional way of making it we also have the kohl's brand so this was 525 and again it's a mixture of cows sheep and goat milk and it's the more traditional looking that is mint dried mint which is traditionally used in like the preparation of it so there certainly are some other brands available but these were the three that we're going to try today everyone has told us the ld1 is very good what are the carbs in them about the same 1.5 per hundred those are the only ones less the audi one is 0.9 grams per hundred and this one is 1.6 per 100 grams so they're all pretty they're very similar so some of our favorite ways of eating halloumi we have a chicken and zucchini kind of burger patty which has grated um halloumi in it that is really yummy and one of our favorite ways to use it you can also pop them in a tray bake so if you're doing a chicken or a lamb tray bake it would probably work quite well in there we love to just pan fry it and add it to our breakfast so if we were doing bacon eggs halloumi that is very common in our household for like a sunday breakfast it's definitely what's going to be happening today um so we'd like to do that as well yeah and you can also maybe cut it into cubes and pan fry it and then use it in a salad like a crouton that would be good but i would say we don't normally eat it like like you would normal cheese like where you cut a slice and eat it or you grate it up and put it on something it is a different texture some people find it squeaky in their teeth but it's not going to melt when you grate it like a regular cheese it also doesn't melt in the pan like a regular cheese so it holds its shape in my opinion you've got to cook it yeah you're not like using it like cheddar yes so if you've bought it and sliced it up and eaten it and thought that would not be not for me try cooking it in a pan so what we're going to show you today is just how we pan fry it we just use like a dry frying pan over pretty high you want it pretty hot dan also does it on the barbecue which is delicious yeah so if you've got like a flat plate on your barbecue that's another really good way of cooking it but we get the fry pan on let's get it on okay so we've got our three halloumi's here so i'll just show you the difference so you can see how this one what dan was saying about the chips it would be good for that um i think popular in the airfryer um so that's the lemnos one this is the kohl's one and this is what i was saying about traditionally it's kind of folded over so that's why when you cut it the pieces will do that don't that that's just going to happen don't panic and these bits here are mint don't worry that it's mold or something so this is nicole's one and then this is the elderly one so these two are very similar and you can see again it has that kind of crack but this is about the width that i would do it if i was pan frying what does it like about the width of your finger no yeah it is between half a centimeter and a centimeter i guess um you don't want it too thick because you want it to kind of um get a little bit softer like it's not going to be melted like cheese but it softens in the middle so you don't want it too thick and then you don't want it too thin because it will kind of disintegrate over yeah yeah so we have our dry non-stick frying pan here that we've heated up over kind of medium high pretty high heat we want when we put this um halloumi in we kind of want it to sizzle so we're going to put in a few of our different pieces dan you're going to have to help me remember we'll put the cold one here this is cold when we stuff this up at the end let us know this is ours and then the lemnos one is easy to pee so you see how you want that sizzle so we're just gonna let it brown on that side and then we'll flip it over so you can see around the edge where kind of a bit of liquid is coming out of it so that's what we want because we kind of want to dry it out a little bit [Music] so in my opinion you could do it either of those two i quite like it like that and erica probably likes it a little bit more like that on the barbecue it goes like that yeah but you're not just browning it because you do want the inside to kind of soften a bit as well so i guess maybe if you have your pan on high at the start then once you put your hulu in turn it down to medium so it kind of cooks through without burning outside yeah yeah because i think this one needs a bit more color dan thinks that that's perfect that one right there which one's that again that's cold cold audi and you can see already like if you compare the texture of this this is hard like and this is see how it's like [Music] spongy and mix them up poles audi you can see as we're saying it's kind of softened it's nice and golden brown on both sides so we are ready okay so now the taste test which i guess most important right i'm least looking forward to the lenos we do that first yes okay we're a bit biased don't we that's actually fine i could see how people like that as a chip and you could probably do them in the airfryer and and make quite nice chips with those it's pretty salty but very salty it is a salty cheese guys for sure but that one it's all right particularly i mean it's better than i thought it was going to be i'll say that okay what do we got next coals coals damn it for the big pieces of course it gets softer texture in the middle for sure than the lamb it's less salty less um i prefer that over the lemons for sure much less salty that is really good yeah that's delicious the lemon one i felt like i just got salt do not salt your halloumi guys there is no need it's quite a salty flavor already we used to go to a cafe who salted it and we couldn't order it anymore because it was just too much but i like that that's winning so far so audi aldi's coming in last it looks exactly the same as the kohl's one so this is going to taste pretty similar yeah so this is the olive one i really don't know if it was the way that you cooked this piece versus the other but there's more caramelized flavor to it um i will say the coles and the audi one pretty similar like i don't know that i could tell them apart if you're looking for a cheaper version go for the audi because it it is quite similar to the coles it's really good yeah the coles and the audi ones both winners the audi one the cheapest one 4.99 for 250 grams so that is a winner the lemnos one as dan said good if you're doing like halloumi fries in the airfryer otherwise i'd probably give it a bit it was salty it was definitely a big hit of salt so um yeah but halloumi is the best guys believe me if you haven't tried it your challenge is to go and try it and let us know in the comments below what you think if you are a hauling me fan like us let us know what your favorite way to happen yes definitely because i'm always looking to increase my how can i include more halloumi in my diet again hopefully you've enjoyed this video guys try the halloumi we highly recommend it give us the thumbs up subscribe to the channel so that you get all of the december videos and you know when they come out every day you don't want to miss one you'll be out of the loop you might not know about halloumi thanks for watching everyone bye", "vISpsIbWT4s": "today we're going to be doing a different twist not talking about real estate or finance actually talking about it tastes awesome alright guys it's Angelo Christian and as you know I'm very big into health and you know you are what you eat and I'm doing many segments to come out and show you guys some of the healthy foods that I eat I just did a shoot earlier on the Mike Asian cod and now I'm doing one of my teriyaki salmon and like I said I'm very big in the bodybuilding and healthy eating I'm gonna show you this awesome recipe I've made it you know thousands of times and hundreds of people have asked me for the recipe so I want to come on camera and actually show you how I make this and it's a Atlantic salmon is better for this than sockeye I know sockeye is preferred but this this dish actually tastes better with fresh Atlantic salmon and we do a sugar-free teriyaki glaze on top of it I don't like sugar so I try to stay away from sugar so I'm going to actually show you how to make the teriyaki glaze and I'm actually show you how I actually prepare this dish from the beginning if you're in a bodybuilding healthy eating fish is probably what is the best thing for you and salmon is on the top of the charts Salmons phenomenal and if you're a bodybuilder out there trying to get different ideas or you're into this healthy eating trying to you know be toned you saw I interviewed you know dr. Willie earlier on the ketogenic diet I'm very big about health on taking care of your body I think that your your the foods that you eat affect your state and how well you perform and your and your thinking and so you know the Omega the omegas in fish are incredible and so I'm really big about you know making sure you're eating the right things I've gotten back into healthy eating for the past month I've been really weightlifting watching what I eat and you know I've lost like ten pounds so we're gonna kind of track me as they as the guinea pig to see what happens over the next year as I stay on this diet so I'm gonna kind of show you first the teriyaki the sugar-free teriyaki here's a bowl and I'm gonna put some just you know soy sauce okay and I'm gonna do about 1/4 cup of soy I've been cooking for you know 15 20 years I mean ever since I was a kid so I've owned restaurants the better chef so I kind of know what the the amounts are the quantities this is a pineapple crush sugar-free drink mix pineapple one of my favorites so pineapple and soy go very good together I'm gonna just pour that in there like that okay and you want to balance out the sweetness from the pineapple you want to take a little bit of crush red to have a little bit of heat just a little bit and then a little bit of lemon bring out some of the flavors so take this and put that in like that the lemon juice and then mix it up okay that's then you can take a little bit of water if you want to thin it out in fact we can actually do that because and you can I mean if you want you you can get real creative you can reduce it down to make it thicker like a syrup you can do that but that's that's what we're gonna do for the teriyaki sauce now this is a this is gonna be on the grill guys this is not something you're gonna cook in the oven or in a pan so my grill is preheating you want to get your grill very very hot for this so we have our our teriyaki sauce so I'm just gonna put this over here and now we're gonna I'm going to show you how to prepare the salmon so I'm gonna get rid of all this stuff real quick I'm gonna show you how we're gonna do this okay so again my grill is preheating and now we're gonna make our get our salmon ready so for this we're gonna just do a quick marinade with olive oil again olive oil is a very good fat and soy - we're gonna drop the salmon in there you know probably like a 1 to 1 ratio on olive oil and soy and stir that up okay alright then what we're gonna do is now salmon you know it has a have skin on it so you have to take the skin off alright so I'm gonna show you how to do that in case you've never seen that before so it's not hard to do once you get used to it I get your knife in a good sharp knife okay and again I recommend doing this with Atlantic salmon I don't recommend doing this with sockeye it doesn't taste the same do a fresh nice fresh Atlantic salmon okay this is a good piece very nice quality and we got to take see this has skin on it you can't you can't you don't want to eat the skin so we have to take the skin off so basically what you're gonna do is make a little slit right here if you want to come over here and watch you're gonna make a little slit right here on the bottom and you're gonna grab it with a paper towel okay and we got to take the skin off and you want to be very careful on how you do that because you want to mess up your fish right so you're gonna let the you're gonna hold the paper towel like this and you're just gonna put your knife down you want to get in there a little bit and then you want to run you want to have a good grip on your tape on the skin you want to take a little bit of skin hold it like that with your paper towel and then just leave the knife in place and then pull and the skin will come right off okay you might need to adjust your grip a little bit on with your paper towel you could also do this with a you know a regular towel I'm gonna go with this one that paper towel is getting messed up so but don't don't don't move the knife just move grab the skin and pull it with your so then have it come right off like that then what you're gonna do is take the salmon all the skin should be off you don't really you're not gonna do anything with that skin so but now you have your salmon piece and what you're gonna do is you can cut this up and we're gonna dump it in here and then we're gonna grill it so I think normally what I do is you know in thirds is good so you're gonna take that throw it in there and then do another one and put it in here there's no bones in this so I'm gonna get rid of that kind of merit you know marinate the coat and this is this is an incredible one to guys if you love salmon oh my god this one is beautiful it's kind of toss to coat it and again my grill is getting real hot you want to cook now when you cook the salmon you don't really want to cook salmon too well done that's not gonna taste good like a mediums good so we're gonna throw all this this out wash my hands were going to actually take this out to the grill and have you guys watch me grill this and like I said it's a beautiful dish we're gonna top it with our teriyaki these are good to go so we've got the grill nice and hot see that and then we're gonna spray it make sure that you don't want it to stick and for this we're gonna leave the grill open okay nice and hot yeah [Music] and we're gonna let that start grilling when they get a spatula this kit what keep the camera on there you want to watch our grills alright so check them out see how they're doing looks like they're doing good yeah a nice color tone because we use the grill spray and the gorilla's nice and hot you shouldn't have the problem with the fish getting stuck to the grill if you do then we probably did something wrong fish should be getting stuck to the grill again you don't really want to cook this well done medium is good medium well maybe medium I think it's better check it and see how it's looking looking good to me I love this one this is one of my favorites too I could eat this all day so then want to turn it over boom look how beautiful that looks you know this one then we got our glaze and we're gonna land it once that you know probably about three four minutes right there as you can see it's cooking through but that's this is a beautiful a beautiful salmon dish one of my favorites let me get something I'll be right back you don't want to try and turn their stuff too much but you want to make sure your you want to do like a quarter term so you have that diamond effect on the on your meet whether you're doing a steak chicken fish you know you always want to do like a quarter turn and that helps to give it a better appearance the hot spot of the grill you know if you have a grill and you know your grill you know you have hot spots I'm trying to not get it too close to the hot spot because it is a fish and it's gonna I don't want to burn the world's real hot though I recommend Weber Weber's that one of the best grills out there for a home grill obviously if you have a commercial grill that's even better but Weber is very good that's the grill is very very hot it's not like a invest invest money and a grill grill is very important and what we're gonna do with the teriyaki sauce is we're gonna we're gonna lay it down here okay and then we're also gonna top it with the teriyaki - the one I wanted to be smothered in this and the teriyaki we're gonna do on the bottom and the top I think we're getting pretty close you can you can watch and see how it's cooking and you can see that's starting to get on the inside it's starting to get the the pink flesh is kind of going away and it's kind of almost in close to being well-done not really well done but like pry it's probably like about a medium right now I'm gonna do it a little bit more because the thicker parts are gonna take longer to cook [Music] yeah that one should be and you can touch it yeah you can see you can feel it that one's ready to go so we're just gonna lay it right there then this one I wants to make sure it's still cooking good I'm gonna put that right there I think that's a better spot for that that one a little bit of teriyaki on top boom beautiful beautiful I just soaked up in that sauce so good yeah it's gonna be you know and obviously if you like different temperatures I I would think like a medium you know I don't think a well done is the right thing for salmon I mean some people like it well-done and go for it but to me you know you don't want to ruin the flavor either so this one is basically yeah it's pretty much yes is the texture you can feel it when you touch it and if it gives you kind of like you're like here and your wrist the different areas your wrist will tell you if it's you know medium medium rare well-done when it's firm that means it's getting close to well-done and this is a thinner piece see this is thicker so it takes longer to cook it right and you can see that looking good though all right so we're gonna put that one right here and you know again to swirl that sauce on there we're gonna dump some on there you don't have to feel guilty there's no sugar in there that one's still cookin that one if you wanna maybe because a little bit thicker you want to close it that's gonna get more heat but that's basically it guys I mean this is a phenomenal phenomenal dish you know sugar free I mean and it's all protein very very good clean fat eat this with veggies and you know and you're gonna feel you're gonna feel like a million bucks I mean it is really awesome so I'm gonna get that last one off and then you know that's how you guys that's how you do it and if you eat this you're gonna feel great your body is gonna be healthy you're gonna feel healthy and so it's not just about making a lot of money you know you also want to have you know a great healthy body too and eating right is a huge component if you're eating bad you're not gonna perform good you're not gonna feel good you won't be able to be at your best so you got to make sure you're eating right and and and doing the right things to be in the right state of mind so very very important that we're eating the right foods fish is number one so I love it and you know with vegetables you can't you can't go wrong so [Music] yeah see how if you come over here at the camera you can see how it's starting to be that's like a medium and that's really what you want you know because if it's if it's too cooked and it's not gonna have the right flavor it's called like steak you really don't want to have steak medium rare is ideal medium is okay you get to medium well well done it loses everything though this one looks good okay looks good to go we're gonna turn off the grill and we're all set so alright guys so there you have it I'm going to load top it with the teriyaki and that's it guys this is Angelo Christian I hope you enjoyed watching this and take this recipe make it at your house prepare for your friends your family your guests they're gonna love it if there are health conscious and they care

so much for checking us out bye bye [Music] you [Music]", "ssFbgFy7AdY": "hi everyone let's eat some ice cream sorry about that guys we are very excited today because we have the two brand new donata ice cream flavors here to try and we also have the leeks double choc people in our group have said they're like eating a paddle pop and when we did our coles video everyone oh my god you have to try them you have to try them so we have got them here now if you're not familiar with donata ice cream i would say it's the best kind of premium keto friendly ice cream option in australia it is an australian product which is super cool it comes from wa and they actually are sweetened with xylitol which seems to be the most popular sweetener to use in ice cream as far as the texture so they do already have three flavors that have been available at coles so they have a vanilla a double choc which is our favorite and a mint choc chip now they are usually 11.50 so it is you know a special premium you said a premium item but keep an eye out because it does regularly come on special for 8.50 so just buy it then pop it in the freezer and you'll be good to go they do have other flavors as well which are available at kind of health food stores igas tends to all you know be even more expensive but they have a peanut butter and they have kind of two options that are dairy free vegan friendly which is salted caramel and choc fudge espresso so they're the existing flavors and then we've got the two brand new flavors which are caramel choc flake and raspberry ribbon which one are you mostly when do we get to eat it i'm excited for caramel chocolate i mean that sounds good yeah probably the caramel one as well i love caramel flavor so just to um to it's five serves per um container which i guess you would probably eat a little bit more than i mean i think that would be not much ice cream so you might have two serves but be careful don't go crazy with it because it it can garlic the xylitol can upset your stomach so try and limit your portions if you can and these two are about 1.5 grams of carbs per serve so i guess even if you had two serves that's three grams of carbs i wouldn't do any more than two um yeah what should we give them another try let's try the raspberry one first we'll go fruity first yeah show us what it looks like oh special it looks like it looks white but there's a little thing we have had it out for a little bit to see if it would suffer okay there is a bit of a ripple in there good idea softening it up mmm mmm now the vanilla one is quite coconutty so i'm assuming it's going to be similar it's nice oh that's nice i love the raspberry it's quite a nice it doesn't taste artificially and it's got a good swirl there is a swirl in there yeah that's delicious but there is a bit of a swirl there i'm a fan of that i'm a big fan of it and also it doesn't taste coconutty at all to me the vanilla one has a coconut which i don't mind but that one that is delicious it's really kind of refreshing or something as well it doesn't feel like rich and heavy this one's gonna feel rich the double chop is my favorite flavor and so i'm assuming this is kind of a bit based on the double choc which is really rich and chocolatey oh okay it's not a chocolate ice cream i'm surprised so i expected it to be a chocolate ice cream but it's not it's vanilla caramel and chocolate um and also this is cute so inside it says in there paws off donald is great for humans but it's not to be consumed by pets please read our label or visit our website that's because it's made with xylitol so that is very cute i just made sure i got some flaky pop also the exciting thing with this new flavor is that in the choc chips there's no mountain toll so in the mint choc chip version there currently is melted hole in the choc chips no mouse at all in this so that's exciting dan seems to like it i think i like that one better really you love caramel this one's got like a more of a sweetener taste to it than that one did in my opinion i like the caramel flavor is nice though it's not like that artificially caramel flavor it's really nice but this the raspberry i think i prefer the rice raspberry is delicious i'm very surprised because i wouldn't normally you wouldn't choose i wouldn't choose a fruity flavored ice cream i'd always choose like a chocolate or caramel or something like that so but that they're both delicious and it has a decent amount of chopped chips so it's kind of like a vanilla ice cream with a caramel swirl and then like the tiny little flaky they're like flavor yeah which is nice because it's not like it breaks your teeth with the choc chips but i would highly recommend both of those i caught you know with the like we really love the double chocolate how would you rate that compared to these they're actually it's a very different texture to me the double chocolate is like a super super creamy juicy almost it's almost like mousse um these are probably more like said it would be nice double chocolate with raspberry ribbon that would be good but this get this guys this is just perfect for summer like that would be really nice for christmas day like oh delicious so as we said it is you know we know it's expensive but there isn't anything comparable as far as clean ingredients natural sweetness and that tastes as delicious as it does so it's not you know obviously we're not saying it's an everyday thing but it's comparable to if you would have you know the kind of premium ice cream like the maggie beer oh ben and jerry's or whatever i like it you know it's a special it's a special treat for sure look out for it on special like eric has said if you can get it for 8.50 that's a bargain now licks next up we're gonna try the leeks they call double choc they love a double choc and the other flavor they have vanilla latte we didn't get that one because dan doesn't eat coffee um so both the donata and the legs i think are only available at kohl's they're not available at woolworth so these are 8.50 per packet for four so um i guess also slightly more expensive than regular paddle pops i assume i'm not sure how much a regular flop is one of the tips we had was to definitely leave it out for a little while to let it kind of soften yeah so a few people said to us if you're trying these you need to let them soften if you eat them straight out of the freezer very high not enjoyable um but people have said they're like chocolate powder pops they're 1.9 grams of carbs per serve and i guess what for me is good for these over the donata is the poor you know built in portion control because you can just eat one you're not having to serve it up yourself but it looks you know it looks quite chocolatey how many carbs was it one point nine grams per paddle pop wow of course should be out a little bit longer that's still quite hard i mean it looks really chocolatey tastes like a chocolate powder pop it's a vegetable so creamy but it's way creamier than i thought it would be and i'm not getting any aftertaste or anything it's just really chocolatey and creamy it's chocolatey it's definitely a double chop you can see how like hard it is when you bite it so it would need to be left out even longer like it's quite cool today and it's probably been out for like maybe 10 minutes more you'd almost want it to be kind of melting i reckon for it to be even nicer but i reckon they're good i'm interested to try the coffee ones now i will also say it's not really ice cream weather here it has been warm or weak and today it's like 16 degrees but it's the end of [Laughter] so our freezer is now stocked full of ice cream which you know you can imagine we're very disappointed about but i was very excited to try the new donata flavors and support such an awesome australian company hi are you surprised by these you're surprised about that i'm surprised hopefully you've enjoyed this video give the donator a try please give us a thumbs up if you've liked this video subscribe to our channel for more videos like this and thanks so much for watching [Music] bye [Music]", "-4RsSQGvSuU": "fall is not actually fall unless you've got my favorite starbucks drink i'm telling you you got to order it this way when you go to starbucks soy latte two spanx of cinnamon two spanx of nutmeg and a dozen spanx of anabolic apple cider donuts speaking of wish going on party people welcome back to another video and another anabolic recipe today we're taking on the apple cider donut oh my goodness just making my mouth water by cheat day design now if you haven't seen his instagram profile i'll go ahead and link him in the description below so definitely check him out he's got a ton of great recipes to try it out especially chocolate chip cookies apple cider donuts and so much more and one of the things i absolutely love about his recipes is that he really tries to come from a very holistic picture and the overall taste and structure when it comes to total calories and a macro breakdown right it's a very fine balance between how much protein you can stuff into one dessert or one little treat versus what the actual taste and expectations are behind the flavors that you're gonna get from that meal but if you're not familiar with the apple cider donut you're gonna have to go and google that asap i mean these are the most hashtag basic form of fall orgasmic treats that you will ever have now most of my viewers know that i'm a california kid at heart born and raised out there but i spent a number of years out in boston i was very fortunate enough to be shown a very special place very dear to my heart called the atkins farms and they're based out of massachusetts so if you're ever out there go ahead and check them out great for apple picking and obviously anything and everything apple related but this is one of the very first places that i've ever laid eyes or had gotten the taste of apple cider donuts insert obnoxious picture so in honor of hashtag basic season and apple cider donuts i figure why not give these a shot because hey who doesn't love some warm crispy on the outside moist on the inside and just pure cinnamon sugary messiness it's absolutely an undeniable hashtag basic treat so without further ado let's get into the recipe oh wait hold on we gotta do this right oh yeah all right are you ready let's go so guys before we get into this recipe i'm gonna go ahead and post up the recipe and the ingredients list in case you guys want to reference this after the video but just as a heads up you guys might have a difficult time finding some of these ingredients at your local grocery store such as apple pie spice or maybe even apple butter they are a little bit of a specialty type of food or ingredient so apple butter was actually over at whole foods but they have very limited quantities i went to three different stores and for apple pie spice definitely a little more difficult to come by i went to five different stores and could not find it whatsoever so i ended up googling it and had my own diy recipe so we'll get into that in just a second but let's start off with the ingredients [Music] so in terms of ingredients first up you're going to need 120 grams of an all-purpose flour next up you're going to use 62 grams of a whey and casein protein mix in this case we're going to go ahead and use a snickerdoodle the recipe recommends using a vanilla but this is what we've got on hand so we'll definitely see how this actually comes out with a full flavor next up we're going to use 20 grams of a granulated sugar and just keep in mind that when you guys are looking for granulated sugar there's also going to be confectioners so just make sure to look at top or at the bottom then we've got four grams or one teaspoon of a baking powder and then we'll go ahead and use one teaspoon of an apple pie spice but in this case if you don't have apple pie spice you can go ahead and use the following ingredients in order to create your own apple pie spice and just remember the ingredients and the amounts are just subjective and can be used based off of your own taste preferences and then we're just going to use a teaspoon of salt so now that we know what the dry ingredients are we're going to go ahead and put all the dry ingredients into one bowl and give it a good mix and our goal with mixing it up is to prevent any type of clumping that could happen once we start putting in the wet ingredients [Music] so at this point we've mixed up all of the dry ingredients we're going to go ahead and grab another bowl and put all of our wet ingredients into this one so first up in terms of wet ingredients we're gonna go ahead and use two whole large eggs next up we're gonna use 57 grams of an apple butter and just as an fyi guys this is one of the ingredients that for me i feel like is a specialty type of product so you'll probably have to find it over at maybe a whole foods or a trader joe's next up you're going to use 80 grams of an unsweetened applesauce next we'll use 28 grams of a light butter then we've got half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and then we'll use one teaspoon of a sugar-free syrup so now that we've got all the wet ingredients we're gonna go ahead and give this a good mix and mix it in as much as possible we've got the butter in there you probably could have melted the butter and then put this into the mixture so that way everything just mixes up really nice and evenly [Music] oh guys this is smelling absolutely delicious it just it smells like an apple orchard in here so now that we got everything mixed up we're going to go ahead and take our dry mix and the white ingredients and then mix them all together [Music] this is where we're at right now we've got the wet ingredients and the dry ingredients together just giving it a good mix just make sure everything is nicely integrated and it's it's not too liquid of a mixture actually because in the recipe it actually states that the batter actually comes out into more of a liquid but this is the consistency that i'm working with right now so just as a heads up guys the instructions actually say to use a silicone spatula i was getting carried away with mixing up the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients by themselves so i was using a whisk but i've transitioned over into using a spatula and we're just going to go ahead and finish this off we're gonna go ahead and grab our donut tray and then hit it with some non-stick spray and if you guys don't have donut trays don't worry about it because this recipe actually allows you to throw them into muffin trays so feel free to do as you wish but we're gonna go ahead and throw them into the donut dish [Music] all right party people we've got the donuts in the donut tray so we're going to go ahead and throw this in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes so see you guys in just a second so while we're waiting for the donuts to actually cook in the oven we're going to go ahead and take our granulated sugar 50 grams of this along with a quarter teaspoon half teaspoon however much cinnamon you like go ahead and give it a good spank but we're gonna go ahead and take both of these give it a good mix and then use it for the outside crust and that's gonna give us our cinnamon sugar goodness okay so that's what our mixer is looking like and this is just going to really top off the donuts so let's go ahead and take a look at the donuts since they're out of the oven oh guys these are smelling so good it is very hard for me to keep my expectations low because being disappointed by apple cider doughnuts is going to be super sad but taking a look just real quick at these donuts they're looking pretty good i do have to say they kind of have a rubbery texture kind of similar to what you would see with just a lot of other general baking type goods when you're dealing with protein but this is what we're dealing it with right now they are quite warm but you can probably tell just the sheen on top hello kind of has that rubbery texture to it yeah i do have to say these are pretty dense looks like there's quite a bit of moisture in there so we'll definitely have to take a look at it when we go into the taste test all right time to get in some categories you guys know the deal so i hope that you guys are excited as much as i am to talk about these anabolic apple cider donuts because i am super stoked right now all right so you guys know the deal three categories anabolics taste and craving now if you guys have not had apple cider donuts i do not know how to really describe it it just absolutely orgasms in your mouth literally so with that being said let's go ahead and talk about total calories and the macro breakdown just something to keep in mind the recipe actually creates six solid doughnuts so now in terms of total calories for one of these apple cider protein doughnuts we're looking at a total of 170 total calories the macro breakdown is as follows we've got 4 grams of fat 12 grams of protein and 21 grams of carbs now for those of you who have never had an apple cider donut they're pretty popular amongst a lot of the dunkin donuts chains and what you'll see in terms of total calories on average is roughly about 350 to 360 total calories for one donut now compare that to these that's that's a pretty significant difference but just in case you guys are interested in picking one up a lot of the dunkin donuts do have apple cider donuts around this time atkins farms donuts are actually slightly less in calories so for atkins they're apple cider donuts which usually come in a six pack as well we're looking at a total of 201 calories with a total fat of 6 grams total protein of 3 grams and a total carb of 33 grams now when i think about the total calorie and macro breakdown of these apple cider donuts compared to atkins as well as dunkin donuts i'm pretty impressed with the overall breakdown i mean in terms of fat we're looking pretty good at compared to the atkins farms which is my personal favorite and just will always be the number one spot for apple cider donuts now when we take a look at protein each one of these apple cider donuts has 12 grams of protein when you take a look at atkins or dunkin donuts where they've got three or four grams of protein respectively it's not too bad right i imagine you know most of us would like to see a lot more protein in each one of these donuts but at the end of the day in terms of the protein to fat ratio i think we're holding on pretty strong but overall i'm gonna go ahead and rate this as a solid seven and a half and now the best part taste so just as a heads up guys if you made it this far into the video i've gone ahead and linked cheat day designs recipe and ingredient page in the description below so just make sure to check that out he does a great write-up on his overall idea and thoughts behind how he was actually building out this recipe because it is a little bit of a balance between actual total flavor and what the overall nutritional profile looks like and i don't know about you guys but i really appreciate understanding what the mindset is behind how some of these recipes are created because it gives you a good idea of how you can manipulate it to be your own or whether or not you can just do without it but otherwise i want to bring you guys in for a close up take a look at these so the sugar and the cinnamon topping look on point i will say the donuts still look a little rubbery and a little bit questionable but it should be interesting to see how the actual taste comes out however the donuts are very dense and they are very very moist but let's go ahead and try these out all right cheers boys oh oh my god oh my god [Music] we gotta give this a start you guys definitely have to try this this is fire holy smokes i'm going in for another bite we're gotta do our little happy dance we found ourselves a freaking awesome donut recipe oh oh so i don't know if you can see that but the density is quite there really gives you a good bite for your money and at the same time what i really love about the flavor of this thing is that a lot of the dessert recipes that we've been dealing with have a very artificial taste to them and that's that's to be expected right but i will say this one definitely has it to a minimum so that's what really really draws me and gives you a ton of flavor in this recipe i think i just found my favorite recipe so far so i'm still in shock on these donuts and this recipe as a whole right now i'm going to go ahead and rake this as a solid 10. that's i mean that's i'm putting it out there if you guys try this recipe out for yourselves let me know what you think this is absolutely by far one of my favorite recipes i'm probably going to whip up another batch after i filmed this so with that being said i'm going to try and talk through this as objectively as possible now there are a lot of donuts out there that are airy and very light and i feel like a lot of those donuts i can have those to a certain extent and for only certain types of donuts for me i really prefer i think what most people would say cakey type of donuts they're very dense there's a lot of bite to them and what i will say is that this donut is like a cakey type of donut now i think these because they're relatively small definitely give you the right portion of bite and just the amount for one donut right i think it's enough to really satisfy your craving i know we'll get to that in just a second but i'm letting you know right off the bat this rep this review is just straight up like i'm writing it off as a solid 10 in terms of taste and craving now outside of that what i will say as you bite into it the cinnamon sugar mix really really helps with the overall flavor now in terms of the donut itself you can definitely i think you can really do without the apple pie spice you can just make one at home if you've got the ingredients that along with the apple butter the apple sauce along with snickerdoodle pe science whey encasing protein i think really just wraps up the full flavor profile and gives you just i mean it's just the flavor is just really spot on and like this as soon as i took a bite just it took me back to atkins and the donuts that they had so in terms of craving i'm gonna go ahead and rate this as a solid 10. i know i said this earlier but if any of you guys definitely have an itch for donuts in general try this recipe out this absolutely really hit the spot for me and for my friends out in canada and on the east coast who are just starting to get into the cooler months pair this up with a solid spice cider or hey if you love whiskey a hot toddy that's one of my favorites i know it's not going to be anabolic but definitely put some hair on your chest so outside of that try this out let me know what you think and if you didn't like it let me know why you didn't but at the end of the day i'm going to go ahead and 100 recommend you guys try this out because this absolutely really hit the spot for me when it came to apple cider doughnut well guys we just wrapped up the three categories and the balls taste and craving for a total score of 9.1 but otherwise i'm gonna go ahead and wrap this video up i hope you guys enjoyed this video and got some really good insight into some hashtag basic apple cider doughnuts and if you're new to the channel consider smashing that subscribe button it's always a good time i'm having a good time i hope you are but at the end of the day if you guys did enjoy this video smash that thumbs up it really helps this channel to grow and really get other folks like yourself in the know on some really awesome recipes but otherwise stay safe stay swole and i'll see you guys next time peace good morning party people all right so just a quick little update i had the review on these apple cider donuts yesterday so it is the next morning so just wanted to give you a quick little wrap up now if you guys are expecting the cinnamon and sugar messiness to all stay intact and stay super dry it's not going to happen so this is what the donuts actually look like the next morning so they they definitely taste great still i i just had one of them i'm going to go ahead and pop them in the microwave for a few seconds and they should be as awesome as they were yesterday if you want to have the cinnamon sugary goodness just i'd probably recommend just making the mixture again but these are still definitely great i just had one of them like i said but uh yeah that's it um i hope you guys are checking out the new hat unicorns baby you guys are all unicorns just remember that so with that being said i hope you guys have an awesome magical day  unicorns peace", "Ij4QqtHSPaI": "[Music] hey munchies welcome to the channel if you're new or if you're not i'm alyssia and i'm so glad you're here either way you are gonna be glad you came too because today i am sharing the best dairy free ice cream i have ever made or eaten actually in my entire life honestly our filming crew couldn't even believe that it was dairy-free and they said that it was actually better than store-bought regular non-dairy-free ice cream i'm not even kidding you get ready for your mind to be blown because this ice cream contains no dairy no coconut no banana and it's only three main ingredients and it is going to be the creamiest dairy free ice cream you've ever had with no frozen chunks of ice i am showing you a few different variations the classics of course so we've got vanilla chocolate and strawberry as well as how to mix in your favorites like sandwich cookies for cookies and cream and a peppermint one as well since it is the holiday season so what is the trick well i've got a few up my sleeve today well the first is i am using joy's almond and cashew nut bases to make the dairy-free milk it's a shelf-stable nut base and it's so cool it was actually created in an effort to make clean and nutritious plant-based milks more sustainable and environmentally conscious store-bought nut milk is going to have preservatives and other unnecessary stuff joy literally stands for just one ingredient do i need to not do the sound either cashews or almonds and i mean the store-bought stuff is actually really watered down it's 98 water and 2 nuts you're not really getting that much nut goodness nutritionally not traditionally with joy you get up to six times more nut content to fully benefit from the healthy fats protein and fiber that healthy fat content is going to help keep our ice cream well ice cream instead of just ice so i have to thank joy for sponsoring this video because i would not have figured out this most delicious dairy free ice cream or discovered the amazingness of their nut milks without them if you want to try it out you can use the code mind over munch 10 or the link in my description to get 10 off the second trick i have up my sleeve for keeping this ice cream super duper creamy is by making a custard base using eggs which ups the fat content so it doesn't over ice that's usually the problem with homemade vegan ice cream is there's not enough fat and the water content is too high so when it freezes it gets really icy and hard so this one is lactose and dairy free i have shared a vegan no churn version linked in the description it's not icy at all it has a slight coconut flavor because it contains coconut milk to help keep it creamy but if you are looking for a vegan option this no-turn version is still truly delicious but this custard base that i'm gonna show you today is where it's at holy crap i don't think it can be beat the third trick is i am using an ice cream machine which is going to keep the mixture moving and churning as it freezes making it easier on you and a much more desirable texture so let's start with our basic vanilla i prefer vanilla bean before we do anything we need our nut milk it is ridiculous how easy this is i'm using the joy cashew nut base and simply adding water and joy to a blender and letting it go now when you make a regular joy nut milk for drinking you only need one or two tablespoons per cup of water you get to decide how nutty you want it and that's part of what's so awesome here is it's customizable so you only use what you need and you don't waste anything not to mention it lasts 12 to 18 months in the pantry i added more joy for this dairy-free ice cream because the fat content is only going to make it creamier and more delicious plus it is the holidays i mean joy to the world and in under a minute you end up with a high quality clean instant plant-based nut milk not to mention it lasts seven days in the fridge no irritating nut milk bags required and no pulp to toss and it's so freaking good it tastes like a nut milk should but we're not drinking nut milk today i added the joy nut milk to the stovetop and i'm adding vanilla bean paste and a little bit of extract you can do either or you can do whole vanilla beans scraped out of the pod i prefer the taste of the pod but the paste is easier i prefer the taste of the pod but the paste is easier sorry sorry i'm like reading it i'm like this sounds like a song i prefer the taste of the pod but the paste is easier i prefer the taste of the pods with the paste disease i prefer the taste of the pod but the paste is easier and actually cheaper if you want enough vanilla to really taste it which i do because vanilla pods are pricey that gets brought to a boil over medium-low let it take its time it's only going to be about five minutes and at the same time you're going to separate out three eggs the yolks from the whites save the whites for lunch and then add yolks to another saucepan along with sugar and salt whisk that up and get it integrated waiting until your milk comes to a light boil which you'll then turn off from the heat and start to incorporate it into the egg mixture now listen pay attention seriously this is important you must add the hot nut milk slowly because you got eggs in there and you don't want to scramble them so do this a ladle at a time and whisk concurrently to integrate as well as possible you can use a hand mixer if you're worried but either way just be careful because you don't want scrambled egg ice cream maybe you do i don't after you get a few spoonfuls in it's then tempered and you can add the rest of the milk and mix until it's completely combined that saucepan goes onto a heat over medium-low and just sit and stir it until it reduces to a custard it should be like a runny pudding almost i found that this non-dairy custard only takes five to ten minutes over the stove remove from the heat and now the worst part of the entire recipe you have to wait for it to chill you cannot churn it until it's chilled [Music] okay but after a few hours or overnight if you prefer whenever it's cold it's ready make sure you chill your ice cream bowl to turn beforehand it has to be frozen all you do is add the custard into the machine and let it go it's pretty fast this dairy-free custard ice cream only takes about 12 to 15 minutes to churn and you get a delicious creamy soft serve like ice cream holy moly you would never know it's dairy free literally i can't describe it any better than just saying it tastes like ice cream should taste not like oh it's good for a healthy ice cream it tastes like ice cream for real i was worried it would taste nutty you know since it is a nut milk base but honestly joy specifically manufactures this product to be neutral tasting so it works great in this context way better and way more subtle than a coconut milk based ice cream thank goodness finally a dairy-free ice cream if you want it firmer to scoop then you want to add it to a container to freeze i often just use a loaf pan and then you can scoop it out easily and it's ready for a cone okay so now that we have the base we can get crazy just realize this easy base only requires three main ingredients okay you've got your joined nut base eggs and sugar that's it also in the vanilla ice cream i used the joy cashew nut base but i also tested the base and it works just as well with the almond nut base i was worried because cashew was typically creamier from the natural fats but the joy almond base is high quality using the entire nut so you don't miss out on any of the healthy fatty goodness so it worked perfectly as this ice cream base just as well as the cashew i wanted to show you that it's no different than the cashew so we'll use it for the cookies and cream just blend water with your joy nut base for this one i am making it even easier by adding the vanilla extract right into the blender when making nut milk with joy to use regularly throughout the week or whatever you can really customize by adding your favorite flavorings and sweeteners right into the blender so let's speed this up a bit again we heat the milk make the custard and chill [Music] now this time before you churn crush up your sandwich cookies and once the ice cream is nearly turned you're gonna add them in to integrate holy toledo mind blown blow my mind again in a different way it is a smooth sweet base with crunchy chocolate cookies strewn throughout super rich and creamy but because you're making it yourself you can add as much of those cookie chunks as you want because we all know the more chunks the better and they never put enough in the carton am i right again freeze the ice cream longer for a firmer texture before serving this was probably my favorite of the day i love cookies and cream and again my team could not believe that this was dairy free okay the next classic is chocolate [Music] it's just as easy but the main difference is i'm blending water with the joy nut base i used organic almond here and i'm also adding vanilla extract and cocoa powder [Music] get your milk heated and custard made just the same and then you can taste it and with the chocolate you may want to add an extra spoon of sugar depending on how dark or sweet you like your chocolate and chocolate ice cream also i did want to let you know i tested this base with coconut sugar and no calorie sweeteners and it does work but beware the coconut sugar is brown so it's going to change the color of your ice cream so it won't look like you know that pretty vanilla bean and the chocolate though you wouldn't be able to see it the regular sugar of course is the best tasting in my opinion but others will work if they suit your dietary preferences better you do you so you chill the custard and you wait [Music] and turn it up oh yeah it is rich from the base but it's not heavy like a dark chocolate it's rather light but so creamy and satisfying even though i typically would not choose chocolate i'm more of a white chocolate person or really any other flavor than chocolate person i actually really liked this you have got to try it for yourself for strawberry which is personally one of my other favorite flavors when it's made with the real fruit i used the joy organic cashew nut base with water and vanilla extract to make my milk [Applause] [Music] got that on the stove made my custard just the same and then that has to chill at the same time i get some strawberries into a blender with a spoon of sugar and then let that puree and just sit until the custard is ready or you can do it when you make the custard and then just let it sit in the fridge until you're ready to churn the puree gets stirred into the cooled custard and then that gets poured into the chilled ice cream machine now this one is going to take about five minutes longer to turn because of the added puree say what you end up with a delicious natural bright and fresh homemade strawberry ice cream none of that artificial flavor stuff and trust me you won't miss it because using the real deal gives an intense strawberry flavor i personally like it creamy so i did a puree i didn't want chunks of like icy strawberries in my ice cream some people do like that so you could stir in a less pureed pulsing of strawberries if you prefer i was feeling festive since it is the holidays and decided to make a peppermint ice cream too [Music] i made the base the same use any joy nut base you prefer but i added peppermint extract to the milk along with vanilla extract i turned up the custard and then i added crushed candy canes or starlight mints whichever this one turns bright pink when it churns and i thought it would be perfect as an edible gift for the holiday season it's cool from the mint and amazingly creamy from the non-dairy goodness so that is my dairy-free custard ice cream using the ice cream machine it is so good i can't even believe it joy's nut based products made it possible joy is vegan free gluten free keto paleo and whole30 friendly so it can fit into almost anyone's lifestyle it really is so much more planet-friendly and saves money in the long run because each tub of joy will make seven quarts of nut milk if you want to try it out you can use the code mindovermunch10 at

think cannot be beat happy holidays from me to you i hope you have a safe and delicious holiday season i'll be back next week with a brand new episode and remember it's all a matter of mind over munch [Music]", "zdmVlHBHYjM": "[Music] welcome to another beautiful day in Japan honestly we have had the best weather since we have been you and very lucky and today we're in Tokyo and we're going to go to the Tsukiji outer market so this is kind of like a street food market that was on the outside of the old kind of fish market you know and they would do like the famous tuna options that fish market has actually moved somewhere else but the kind of street food market part is still yeah we are gonna check out and see what we can find so we just caught the train here from Shinjuku on the subway before the subway here from Shinjuku we just bought these little cards it's got his name on this map NZ we had some lovely ladies help us purchase this card we were very thankful cuz we don't know anyone but it's super easy now so we can just charge this up and just tap and go on and off the subways and trains everything so we're good to go now and yeah and this morning we deliberately waited until after about 9:30 to leave to try and avoid like the rush hour because I think we're saying she'll drink you which is - notoriously busy area now the Train the subway was busy but it was doable yeah we were able to fit in didn't feel like we were squashed in yet and I ended up with the seat I wanted it to be much no I think that good apparently [Music] [Music] I've got a noise the Egon at the Sauza sighs hey I see so this was 500 yen it is ginormous I'm not even talking to anyone by but I put a little bit of sauce on there though the description says milky it's so fresh that's got to be one of the professional sources on their behavior it tastes like the sea it just tastes really kind of salty and creamy really worth the 500 yen [Music] [Music] [Music] baby octopus so this was 450 yen to this skier and she just heated it up for it don't be do like a whole one yeah the first ones really being driver wow that was a big mouthful I know what I really like okay posted this is like super fishy I don't know if it's the way that it's cooked but my favorite thing you can try with in here some things a little bit smaller I wanna aren't really creaky because I agree with Ericka that was pretty fishy I would say it's probably got some form of fishy sauce on it because it's it's strong the texture was masked but it's a very strong flavor [Music] now we've got scallops on skewers these look good but see how we go our 200 yen so cheaper than the other side you like more than the text is not a thumbs up ha turn the fella it's really nice yep [Music] okay this was one of the most fabulous tools we have seen we waited maybe about 10 or 15 minutes for this lunch honesty so you could choose heart overall but with heart watching the guy cook it he has like such a cool method that is all what wouldn't is crazy what every actually oh yeah it is a little bit sweet so I don't know if it has maybe that's a bit of sugar enough oh well that's really yummy so I just got an iced matcha and they had an option with no milk and no sugar so it's just much of tea it's probably going to be three strong it's very green but I'm going to give most things ago so it's very grassy which I expect cuz that's matcha but I don't mind it yes I workers I think it's because it's nice and cold it's refreshing Japanese sake sake and cooking sake good good learn Soto and the black pepperoni simply space okay okay 500 thing my mother jinx thank you so much do not very hot be careful babies I okay thank yourself next we have some grilled China the man cooking Matt was adorable and he had like a world map and he asked us to put a little sticker where our town was so dad you said Newcastle so it put Newcastle on the map in Tokyo so this was just some tuna and he sprayed on some sake and then salt and pepper on it it looks really delicious and he kind of plain grilled it really hot oh wow I've had like grilled tuna steaks before and it's like dry as a bone that is like so juicy I'm so surprised by how good that we should know everything if Erica gets out of here without a fight I'll be sick dogs sorry it's the last being compulsively AIDS I'm sorry a piece of medium fatty tuna so didn't go eat there really funny ones we actually wanted a small amount so it was easier just to get one sushi and then peel it off it's so tender it just melts in your mouth have fun there's so much food but that was delicious and it was so much fun just walking around and looking at all the shops and all of this worked out so good yeah there's loads of people here as probably touristy but it was awesome I loved it and it was just fun and if you come to Tokyo you definitely have to come and do these for sure what was your favorite thing that we tried born me we're gonna yeah I've forgotten of 800 oysters for me yes also I was really surprised by the matcha because I expected it to be really kind of beat it but it was really not the true but definitely the two types of to know of my favorite thank grilled tuna I've never had a me like it was so yummy so definitely if you're in Tokyo come along too Tsukiji out-of-market and check out all the stores even if you don't want to eat anything just wandering around is really cool hope you've enjoyed this video if you have make sure you give it a thumbs up thanks so much for watching guys bye [Music]", "ptGIHakZD0w": "so today is our last day in Japan very sad we're heading home tonight but what we have been doing is collecting a few kind of unusual Quito friendly food items from the supermarket and the convenience stores to try on camera guys got some really really weird things to try one of the things we have are these black eggs so they've can't I think they've been boiled in life yes so actually the place where we went Hakone they have a volcano there if you watch that you should go and check out that video because that was such a cool day but they actually boil the eggs in like the volcanic water and they're black but because of the typhoon there wasn't any available at the moment because the area was a bit still closed off so these aren't the actual volcano wrong they were just some other black eggs that they were selling and I was like well I think we should do this one first yeah I think the actual her kinda ones the shell is black but the egg inside is just like a normal bow they get it's meant to be if you eat it you get seven extra genes on your life so I'm like let's just get a hundred of these things right and they didn't have any so we've got these ones right so these are already boiled yep every female domain said the actual egg itself is black so let's give it a little bit of fright in a straw this is what small that's quite bad yeah hard and I'm not gonna be feeling the texture I don't think but anyway I'll say neighbors like on the outside no the yolks kind of gray this is gonna be amazing then what does it smell like soy sauce maybe does know maybe that's what makes it black okay you ready Oh rude chewy hmm it's salty mmm  sweet sweet hmm and I love that stuff no it's just very hard let's grab my water because I'm people that this is gonna go downhill I was fishy it wasn't as bad but I thought it was gonna be but I wouldn't choose say you know we're eating some really delicious borders yeah honestly I like spot-on so we've also grabbed some things from the Lawson which is kind of like the 7-eleven right I just said to Erica let's just grab some weird things and we'll see how we go dan chose this one dried squid so let's say you're gonna be a whole one well it looks like that on the front oh it's not rubbery wow it's really strong just grab a little bit it's like liver yeah squid leather that's really strong fingers very like jerky I think this is actually edible I'm gonna find a little fibers form but it's like eating around a bale in soccer got a rubber bag you know now not even close deal the smell of it's worse than a service totally fine but okay 8:30 poeple either rock I feel like you don't chew it for six years yeah that wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it was gonna be I think I probably expecting it to be crispy though yeah I'm probably the same so now next up we've got some black steep kelp um I think it's just gonna eat one it's just gonna be like seaweed um sorry I was just trying to say if there was away from any cracking to this all right I don't know that anyone's choosing that nah you know it dried squid oh this looks fine I'll probably like this oh it smells so it just looks like dried seaweed excuse me it's like season doesn't chewy I hate that the flavor of it is really nice mm-hmm the flavor is delicious but god they must have really strong jaws that tastes really nice but the texture is really chewy you're gonna break it down now it'd be nicer in a soup or something I wonder you begin breaking Jim that's not bad probably saved the best for last I think this is the one I chose yeah she doesn't go to weed that's why honey this is smoked cheese and it looks like that's probably dyneisha good all right all right grant so obviously Japanese people eat it any snack they're in little foam bottles it's a little cheese lolly with Connor lollies we lock around here yeah oh my god I wasn't sure that would be dried but it's it's not it's like and it wasn't in the cold section it's like oh yeah that's nice smoked cheese I mean you thought that you know thank you jeez Louise so that's our favorite rock papa I don't even mind the same way flavor I like the seaweed flavor was nothing like detective but most of the textural thing is a real struggle for our season yeah the squid was the worst because it was inedible you couldn't even kind of chew it at all this was just a bit of a fun video guys to show you that you can kind of step outside Yukito box and try some things that are a little bit different and be adventurous every now and then we're not so I like to do it on video so you guys wouldn't yeah well we hope you found this video just a little bit of fun a bit of entertainment if you liked it make sure you hit the like button below thanks so much for watching guys bye [Music]", "T-GH3YKUu3Y": "hi everyone today salted caramel custard yeah I absolutely love salted caramel anything but we were so excited when the copper came out with a salted caramel monk fruit sweetener Erica was really excited to be able to come up with some recipes with it yes so this is like a one for one sugar replacement so you could use it in any of your you know like our baking or to sweeten like your copy or your chia pudding or whatever you normally use sweetener for and it will give it a nice kind of salted caramel it's like it really does give it a salted caramel flavor yeah for sure so today we're making a custard with it so it's pretty easy ingredients I need to get this sweet now so grab something from local Emporium we will put our discount code in there in the description below but we also need some cream some egg yolks and a little bit of extra salt so what we have got is a cup of cream just got it in a small saucepan and we're gonna add just like a little pinch of salt to that and we're going to heat this up over medium heat until it's just below boiling point so we're gonna heat that up and then in the meantime I have got three egg yolks only here and we're gonna add two tablespoons of this my salted caramel sweetness will come on oh yeah so it smells like this caramel fun yeah so two tablespoons of the sweetener in with the three egg yolks and then I'm just gonna whisk that together [Music] for a couple the sweetener and break up the egg yolks don't have to be like fluffy or anything but you just want it all to be confined because someone who's not good at multitasking like me is it good to kind of do that before you do if you get these really first and then you can heat up the cream okay so let's get our cream and a little pinch of salt and we're gonna heat these up okay so you can see the cream is steaming very hot but it didn't quite boil so now what we want to do you want to make sure it's quite hot you don't want it just to be lukewarm at this point you want it to be quite hot so I just sometimes stick my finger in make sure it's hot because it can be deceiving so what we're gonna do is pour the hot cream in on top of our eggs slowly while we're whisking this is that to avoid them scrambling yeah whisking it yeah so we're just slightly for again [Music] so it's also a good idea at this point to clean the saucepan otherwise where you've got kind of that residue it might stick at that point so I might just give this a quick clean and then come back and pour the mixture back into the saucepan and then we need to cook it okay nice and clean again and sometimes there's like a little bit of sweetener and then I'm going to switch to using like a spatula or something that's gonna the kind of scrape the bottom of the pan as we cook it and we just want to put it right over low heat at this point kind of need to be patient because if you do it too high it could scramble the eggs so we really just want to slowly heat it up and then it will slowly kind of thicken so we've just got it on a low heat and I'm just gonna continue stirring it the whole time through that it doesn't catch on the bottom and just slowly wait for it to thicken up so it's gonna take I mean it could take a while so you just have to be patient maybe do a little meditation or something but it's worth it trust me guys it's worth it okay we're nearly there guys you can see how it looks different like there's less bubbles on the top and you can see the mixture when you stir it it does look a little bit thicker now that's been about seven or eight minutes so we probably just want to go another minute or two and you'll see it'll thicken up okay I think it's looking pretty good you can see on the spoon if you can put your finger down and it kind of stays on either side that it is ready and it looks nice and thick so what's really important is that we take it off the heat and take out of the saucepan straight away because if you leave it in the saucepan it could it's still cooking so you can see it is beautiful and thick and as I said we want to get it out of the hot sauce pretty straight away so that it stops cooking and we want to just pop it through a fine sieve because whenever you make custard there can be little lumps of egg or anything like that work just caught on the bottom so it's a good idea just to run it through a sieve and that's completely normal hey make sure it's really smooth when you do that too doesn't it yeah exactly so we really like to eat this custard cold it goes much thicker and it's almost like a pudding or something so we are going to pop this right let it cool down for a while first and then we're going to pop it in the fridge and then we'll come back tomorrow and have a taste that's what do you think taste test day tomorrow okay we have had our custard cooling in the fridge because as we said we like to eat this one cold and you can see how it kind of really thickens up and creamy and delicious it is you try y'all too terrible custody that is so cool guys you've really got to give this one a go because if you like custard this just takes it to the next level with that salted caramel flavor yeah and we like to eat it just like this but you could certainly add a couple of berries to it or some like crushed nuts or like and not something like that but I think it's perfect just as it really is it's so good hopefully you found this video useful give this recipe a try if you have let us know in the comments what you think also give us a thumbs up thank you so much for watching [Music]", "3aUUStZOgzg": "welcome to huma's diary today we are making french palmers also known as elephant ears or simply call them puff pastry cookies something very easy yet flashy yet fancy with very little work on your part use handful of pantry ingredients and you can whip it up in few minutes let's take a look at the ingredients take a screenshot of it or see the written recipe in the description box in a small bowl add half a cup sugar 2 tablespoon sugar cane a pinch of salt and a quarter teaspoon ground cinnamon whisk up all the dry ingredients there should be no lumps in sugar set it aside and let's work on the dough here in us we only have access to granulated sugar but if you have coarse sugar available i recommend using it on the pastry sheet spread all the sugar mixture generously it's not about sprinkling it's about an even covering of sugar with a rolling pin lightly roll the dough for the sugar to stick into the pastry switch the sides if needed make sure you place the pastry vertically take one side and roll the pastry towards the middle keep folding inwards stopping in the middle of the dough do the same thing on the other side as well the two rolls should be meeting at the middle and touching each other you can also brush the pastry with melted butter or plain water to ensure the sugar stays on the pastry wrap the pastry in a plastic sheet and freeze for 15 to 20 minutes to firm up the pastry once the pastry is chilled unwrapped starting at the end cut pieces off the log in slices about 3 8 inch in thickness chilling the dough before cutting really helps you can also make them ahead and freeze them only bake when you're ready to eat [Music] grease the tray with cooking spray place the cookies 2 inches apart they will increase in size so leave plenty of room between each cookie and only bake it in batches set the temperature at 325 for 12 to 15 minutes i really like my cookies to be very light and flaky so setting it on a lower temperature is the key you can increase the temperature from 5 to 10 degrees depending on your air fryer at the seven minute mark flip the cookies and then bake for another three to four minutes if you are baking in a regular oven make sure you preheat the oven and cook until the sugar has caramelized i have included the detailed timing and instructions for the oven as well in the description box do check it out after 12 minutes our cookies are nice and golden brush the cookies with melted butter now let them cool down for 5 to 10 minutes on room temperature and then they are ready to serve one more thing i wanted to mention here is for best results use all butter puff pastry baking the cookies in air fryer is real fast by the time you preheat your oven you will already have a great batch of fresh cookies if you have not baked in your air fryer yet go ahead and do it as the heat spins around the cookies it gives a nice and crispy texture to the cookies enjoy these cookies with your favorite tea or coffee i hope you like the recipe do try it and leave us your feedback if you have any question regarding the recipe write it in the comment section i will reply as soon as possible thanks for watching see you in the next video", "3xKzm5qQiRQ": "hi everyone hi today is a slightly different recipe video because it's not really a recipe but it is us making burgers i love burgers and it is such an easy way to convert from what you would have had the carb heavy bun all the good stuff's in the middle very true very so really you can have most of the stuff that you would put in the middle yeah just don't put it on a bun yeah exactly so we would have this most weeks i love it so much yeah so um this is just a super easy one to show you all the different types of toppings condiments what you could maybe use as a bun first of all we're gonna make the patties um so we just have 500 grams of beef mince here um and normally i'm just going to add a bit like i don't have a fancy recipe or anything i just put some salt and pepper and mustard that goes into the beef patties and then we'll mix that all together and shape it into four patties who will mix it you or me i don't like touching that but so i'm just gonna pop some salt in there i mean you don't need to put mustard even you could just put salt and pepper it is nice to season it a bit i think rather than just having plain meat and we've never felt need to put bread crumbs or egg or anything in ours and they hold together fine yeah so i've just got some whole grain mustard here i'm just going to put a tablespoon in and then it's over to dan the only way to do it is to use your hands so once dan gets this all mixed together really well so you just really want to kind of knead it to make sure the seasoning and the mustard is through all the meat and then divide it into four shape into patties and we're going to cook it from the barbecue and we also have some onion here that we're going to cook on the barbecue as well so some other things that you might want to cook um to add on it could be some mushrooms that would be really yummy some bacon dan loves a soft fried egg so those are some other things you might want to cook on the barbecue or you can do it in a fry pan as well but we we like to do it on the barbecue so you can see you kind of just shape it into the best form of a party that you can i don't go very neat [Laughter] not super happy with this i don't care what doesn't matter to me if they're neat or not you probably just want them to be like a uniform thickness for cooking but it doesn't really matter at the supermarket if you didn't want to make your own patties which honestly like it's pretty easy but if you just wanted something quicker like a grab or if you're going over to somebody's place or something you just want to take something cleavers organic meats do have like a hamburger patty that has pretty good ingredients so that's probably the best option that's available at coals and woolies with the grilling on the bbq my barbecue is a lot of the grill no flat plate um so i tend to find it easier to kind of put a little bit of olive oil on the burgers before i put them on the grill um it really prevents them from sticking um and i don't like using the spray stuff so that works just as well to stop them sticking should we go to the barbecue [Music] do okay this is the fun part and this is the part where it's really cool like if you have kids or whatever just lay it all out on the table and let them build their own they will think all their christmases have come at once i like building my own um and erica is going to talk you through how she will build hers so we are using lettuce cups as our bun option and i like to do like two on the bottom so i guess some people might kind of do two like that but i'm gonna do two on the bottom with the white bit going the opposite way for extra sturdiness another couple of options for the kind of bun replacement is you can make oopsy bread we have a recipe for that so we'll link a descript in the description we'll put a link um the other options are buns that eat low carb buns that you can buy so buns like the ones from audi the ones the macro ones from woolworth's and also polena fresh erica also likes to kind of put hers in a bowl and make it more of a salad so that's another option too yeah so like just use rocket as the base then put your burger and then put all your toppings on top and eat it with a knife and fork because this is messy it's going to be messy there's no way around it okay so i've put my burger patty in there and some of the onions off the barbecue because that's the best part um the other dan is going to put i'm going to put an egg on here um but bacon is also another good thing you can cook on the barbecue or mushrooms and i've seen people use those big mushrooms and buns as well like you probably want to roast them or something but i'm gonna go with some tomato next and i've just sliced up some pickles here you can really go as creative as you like with the fillings most of them are going to be low carb you know what is low carb and what's not now cheese would obviously be a really good and delicious option we're not having cheese at the moment but avocado gives a nice kind of creaminess so i've just got some slices here of avocado pop those on so that's probably my fillings and then in my opinion the most important part the condiments so we've got a lot of condiments here then so mayo wise you guys know we like the sir kensington one you can buy it on iherb um you can make your own we have been making our own a lot lately if you want an australian uh version with good clean ingredients the good fat aioli the good fat mayo and they also have a chili mayo now they use olive oil and you can get them on low carb emporium also in the mayo range is the avocado oil ranch from sir kensington so they're the mayo's and then you're probably going to want barbecue or tomato sauce we like the good sauces we don't have any of the barbecue one at the moment but you can get these at low carb emporium they have a sweet chili erika likes the tomato sauce or ketchup you can also do mustard i've found an american mustard brand pine's brand is actually clean ingredients so have a look at the mustards if you like the american kind of mildew one that works quite well if you find the one behind one that's clean ingredients we also pickle our own onions there's not many left um yeah so if you don't cook any onions you could use pickled onions or just raw onions aioli um i might get you to open it because i've got avocado oh that was not my fault sorry just on me convenient isn't it smells good well it's really garlicky really thick as well i'm going to go with some aioli and tomato sauce i think double double sauces on mine are you going to make yours up then yep so honestly i'm going to do sorry i prefer the two over the top of each other um so top and the bottom i do i like a topping yeah so some of the onion put my egg on one slice of tomato i won't put avocado on mine a couple of pieces of pickle now the big big decision i might go male mustard you're on the aioli oh actually i might do the chili mayo all right we're gonna have all the mayo hopefully this one doesn't explode surprised i got that other one open had it been open before a little bit of chili mayo oh that looks nice as well we haven't had this one before have we we've tried their plain just original mayo not the flavoured ones just keep in mind the more wet stuff you put on there the way these get the juicier it's gonna be um i think that might be it actually yeah it doesn't need mustard am i gonna bite into it i think mine looks better than yours by the way look how big that mine looks yeah i'm not going for beauty i'm gonna stick my teeth into it how messy this is going to be but see the double double cup it's the best option eric is trying to prove that yeah i don't do it right hmm it's so good yeah okay delicious we're gonna go and eat our burgers now hopefully you found this video useful burgers are a winner i'm telling you they are the best i love them i could eat them every day pretty easy kind of friday night dinner as well you just have to make the patties pop everything out everyone can get their own to however they like it if you've got carb eaters get their buns you know exactly even honestly the bun is the only difference yeah in my opinion so hopefully you found this video useful give us a like subscribe to the channel thank you so much for watching everyone i'm gonna get that little bit of avocado [Music] bye", "xBd8DKYpvg4": "Christmas is right upon us guys and we getting ready to show you our Christmas recipes today our very custom top which we made last year for our Christmas dessert and as you saw last week we did our trifle our raspberry trifle which is absolutely delicious and one of our most popular Christmas recipes on the blog so definitely go back and check that out if you're working out what sort of Christmas dessert you're going to happen this year we've done the trifle a couple of years ago and then last year we did the custard so if you're in charge of Christmas dessert this customer okay so what we're gonna do first of all is make the base of our tart so we have our oven preheated 160 Celsius 320 Fahrenheit and then I was gonna leave you in charge of greasing there so we've just got like a 9-inch I think it is pie plate what does it say 9.5 inch 24 centimeter so you just want to grease it we've just got that coconut over spray and we just use the market probably the easiest way where you could rub some butter around it this is so there's a problem with it coming out so it's kind of like a biscuit base I guess it's pretty easy you just mix everything together and then we'll press it in so we've got some almond flour we've got some desiccated coconut and then we're gonna put some ginger in so it kind of it gives it that ginger biscuit kind of flavor I like the basis with the ginger another I might say taste hike with the ginger base and it's delicious it's not really strong but it just gives it a nice flavor and then we put in some xanthan gum which kind of helps it stay and then a pinch of salt and to sweeten that we're going to use Sukhram gold which is one of our preferred sweeteners we love this flavor of that one if you don't have that one you could use the the Kanto gold one that you can get it will ease yeah that would be fine but we just really like the sukham gold if you're in Australia you can there's a we'll put a link in the description below of where you can buy it okay so we've got the dry ingredients mixed together and then I've just got some melted butter here I'm just going to pour that in and then we should get kind of like a bread crumb well you know what was it called like a wet sand yeah texture wet sand kind of texture okay so that looks pretty good you can see it's kind of clumping together a bit now so now we're gonna pour this into our baking like pie dish I guess you could call it top dish and then we'll kind of press it out probably just gonna use my fingers initially and then maybe spoon it out like smooth it over with a spoon but you just want to make sure it's the basis all evenly covered and then we have it coming out the sides a bit if you get any parts for it to be thinner you can just put a little bit more it's pretty pretty forgiving or if you just like if it cracks at all you can just put your back together pretty good I'm sure you can do it neater than I can I'm not patience is not my virtue but just around the top just make sure that you kind of push it down because you don't want those kind of crummy bits off the top so just kind of hold it with one finger and push it down a bit so you get like a bit of an inch and just make sure it's kind of smooth and as even as it can be that looks pretty good to me so now we're going to pop this in the oven about 12 to 15 minutes just really keep an eye on it towards the end because the almond flour can kind of darken quite quickly so just keep an eye on it okay so we have a kind of top face out of the oven so we're just gonna leave that to cool down now and while that's cooling we it's a good idea to make the custard so before you make the custard you just want to take some gelatin and some cold water and we want the gelatin to kind of bloom so you just have to sprinkle the gelatin on top of the cold water and then leave it to sit for a while and it all kind of old gel together like jelly and then we can add that into the hot custard once it's done and that was that's what's gonna make it set we have made the custard on video before so I will pop it up in the cards and they'll be a description below on how to make the custard as well yeah and also in the description below there'll be a link to the full recipe with all the instructions all the specific ingredients so you can like print that out if you want to make oh wow that has like so you can see it's kind of sick that's amazing so you kind of just want the gelatin all to dissolve into the cold water and then we'll add it into the hot custard and then it will melt down so the key is the custom it's got to be hot for the air so this the jelly-like the cold water in the gelatin mixture and then it goes into the hot custard okay so I've just rather the custard through a sieve which I haven't done before but it's a good idea just in case there's any little egg bits or any little gelatin tiny little bit that makes it smoother yeah yeah just to make sure there's no lumps so our base has cooled down because it's still a bit warm but that's okay so we're going to pour it in here and then we are going to pop it in the fridge to set so it should sit firm so probably gonna take I'm not sure maybe four hours German probably three to four hours at least yeah you could do this the night before right but like before you top it with the blueberries yeah yeah definitely you could make this the day before and then just kind of decorate it on the day however you want to cheaper there we go so that part is all done so now we're just going to pop this in the fridge and we'll come back when it sets custard tart is out of the fridge all set looks perfect yeah how long was that we just had to pop out there was an emergency my mom may help her choose her caps then she's barking we've done that so it's probably not fine yeah and it's set nicely now so this is the custard tart ready so you don't have to do what we're doing if you wanted to at this point you could just serve it like this you could put some whipped cream on the top you could you could do like nutmeg like you know how custard types you used to buy at the school canteen how could this put a little bit of sprinkling of elam in error you could have even done that before it said I guess I thought you could put a chocolate ganache on the top or you could put like a caramel sauce fresh berries whipped cream and then berries on top or you can put I thought actually what would be nice if you did strawberries like arranged it nicely and then did like a bit of a glaze that's just some sugar free jam you can pick it up and then brush it over it would look nice and shiny anyway there's a lot of options that you could do depending on what flavors you prefer but we have got this blueberry sauce that we're going to pop on the top so you can see it's quite the chunky yet we've made this a video of us making this before as well so I'll pop that in the description and up here so that you guys can check out how we make that it's pretty easy to my yeah not that I've ever made it and we just use put frozen blueberries so that's a bit more of an affordable option as well yeah there we go ready to present to your family on Christmas Day absolutely delicious however you serve it I think it's a real winner definitely hopefully you guys decide to make this custard tart for Christmas but we have heaps of different Christmas recipes we have quite a few dessert ones that rum balls and bunch of trifle retrials a whole heap of different ones and then we have like a glazed ham we've got a roast turkey with cherry sauce that

enjoy your Christmas have a good time don't sweat the small stuff and thank you so much for watching this video guys [Music]", "vpIb-v44_0E": "hi everyone hi today we have a special treat gingerbread cookies we received this 180 cakes it's a special edition for christmas and it is going to be gingerbread cookies i am really excited about this yes it should be fun now we should we should have santa hats or something on dan like to be a bit more festive please don't make me do that anyway we thought we would make them now so that we could show you guys in case you wanted to order any in you know ready for christmas um so you can buy them directly from 180 cakes and you can also get them from low carb emporium i think and it's actually like a collaboration with 180 cakes and la caco so there's there's the gingerbread collagen in like the cookie mixture um so we're going to make the cookies we're going to make some icing and then we're going to try and decorate them please don't make those if i decorate them they're going to be horrible but i'm sure erica will get a good job oh no okay anyway we don't actually have a gingerbread cutter so we're doing gingerbread christmas trees not gingerbread men but it'll all taste the same so to make the cookies you need some sugar-free maple syrup we've just got this one from low-carb emporium or it says or mct oil okay either option um and an egg and you just mix it together in a bowl so let's start with that oh it's very sweet gingerberry bready which is a good sign so it's meant to make five large gingerbread men which means we'll definitely get more trees yeah so i'm gonna put one egg in so the sweetener that they use is erythritol and monk fruit juice powder and for one cookie it is okay when made with the sugar-free maple syrup it's 4.7 per 100 grams and 1.4 per cookie all right and that's for one big cookie so yeah made with um the maple syrup and if you made it with the mc2 oil the carbohydrates didn't change much it's more the um the fat that changes so i've got the egg the maple syrup and the packet mix in here it just says to mix it together it's quite a wet sort of dough i would think so i'm gonna have to roll it out apparently um but yeah that's that was very easy we also have the oven on 140 so quite a lot we have a fan forced oven so i think now we put it between two sheets of baking paper and roll it out to about a half centimeter thickness yep and use cookie cutters and gently lift with a spatula and place on your baking tray okay so we've got our dough here this is a little bit sticky but we'll see how we go with rolling it out so about half a centimeter thick so we really love the 180 cakes cake mixes they have sponge cakes they have brownie mixture they have cookies as well we have a kind of black forest truffle that uses their chocolate cake and we really like them because they're easy and they are totally delicious and we like the sweeteners that they use so they're using um erythritol and monk fruit from what i can tell yeah and the ingredients is all like almond flour coconut flour very clean ingredients no gluten or grains or anything like that and this one the frosting looks like it might use xylitol it doesn't have the um oh yeah it is sorry the frosting is xylitol vanilla bean and arrowroot okay so i reckon that's probably maybe even a little bit too thin but that's what i've ended up with i don't think with the dough that we're gonna be able to cut it into shapes so what we might do is pop it in the oven for a bit to firm up and then cut the shapes and then put it and then pop it back in okay because that dough is a little bit too sticky for me i will say it's maybe our fault because i just realized it said one small egg and our egg would have been extra large yeah so maybe it was a little bit too big so we'll pop it in the oven for a little bit to firm up and then we'll attempt to cut our trees so while they're in the oven we're going to make some icing to decorate them with now this is actually a vanilla frosting mix so normally you kind of whip it up with butter but we probably don't really want that consistency not like a cake for icing right you don't want like a cake yeah we want more of a thinner kind of one that we can um use in a piping bag to kind of finely decorate you need some help with that there you go okay so what i was going to do just put a small amount because we also don't need too much in this bowl and add a little bit of water just to get like an icing kind of texture but we don't need too much but yeah this is great like to ice cupcakes and you know decorate cakes for kind of celebrations and that type of thing and when you buy the sponge cake mixes the um like it comes with the icing mix probably put a bit too much water in this could get interesting oh you can really see the vanilla beans in it yeah you can it's not a super white white color is it because of the vanilla probably a good consistency that we want to decorate our christmas trees i think and we're just going to pop it into a snap log bag and kind of cut the corner off we'll see how we go the other thing i did want to say is it is probably time to start thinking about how you want your christmas to look in terms of food if you were going to stay low-carb or keto what kind of things are you going to have on christmas day to make it feel like you're not missing out yeah because you might want to order some things from like 180 cakes or low-carb emporium to make like a trifle or a dessert option we do have a really cool dessert coming out in a week or two which you will definitely want to order something from low-carb emporium for that but yeah start having a think about your christmas menu in case you want to order anything so there's plenty of time to pop your order in and get it delivered okay so we've just had it in the oven a little bit to kind of set so we can see if we can now cut out these and then hopefully once it's cooked we can just break them and see if i can try and i don't think you were doing that with the mixture no i don't think so i think this was a good option but yeah just be aware that you only want a small egg if you are doing it i didn't even think about the size of our eggs because we always have extra large eggs oh how many can you get oh nice you gotta be able to get two more surely we'll just have to eat all the oh yeah of course okay so now we'll pop it back into the oven um i think it cooked for about 10 10 to 15 minutes okay so we have our gingerbread out of the oven now so 15 to 20 minutes until it was kind of golden brown and firm to touch which it is now so we're just going to leave it to cool on the tray for a little bit and then on the wire rack to cool completely before we ice decorate it so our gingerbread has cooled down now and i'm hoping that it's just gonna come out oh i did and then it's probably nice to do decorate this shiny side right side because that side was a little bit rough from my rolling so we're each going to actually what we need to do first and just have a little taste of this little off cut so is chewy not crunchy but that has a nice because it definitely tastes like a really delicious ginger and it's got a nice sweetness as well yeah that's nice i'm really scared about this erika wants to prove that i'm protested [Music] i'm not proving anything okay so we've put our little icing into a ziploc bag each um i hopefully it's not too runny but we'll see how we go so we're just going to cut the corner off so you just want to do a small cut thanks she's already throwing me under the bustier small but you know whoa careful i've got it have i got it in the wrong hand this feels wrong you want it in your left hand right you okay yeah i think i wanted you so how am i gonna decorate this i haven't really thought about it around edge it is quite runny tinsel style i'm going baubles [Laughter] that's probably a smart call probably went a little bit runny with the icing to be honest a lot of bubbles [Laughter] i will say if you go to 180 cakes um cara's instagram page in her highlight she's got some information on making these and you could make a royal icing which that style of icing will be much better for piping because it's quite kind of stiff whereas this one's quite runny um but there we go i went with tinsel style and i went with baubles but i think they look really cute what do you think i think they look cute so these are our little gingerbread christmas trees i think they both look good also you could put some coloring in it to do like green or red or something like that as well i'm going to have my bauble one oh i like it with icing on it yeah definitely has a strong gingery taste probably the texture is a little bit different to what i would expect from gingerbread yeah i was going to say that it's um its own thing it's not going to completely replace the gingerbread cookie but i like it what you could do as well which would be cute if you have the different shaped uh the different sized christmas trees and then you you know how you're more like a star start with a big star and then smaller smaller smaller and you make a tree that would look kind of cool but this is what we have gone with so thank you so much to cara from 180 cakes for sending us those to try that was fun and if you're interested in getting them like erica said low-carb emporium or direct from the 180 cakes website yes and if you are ordering from low carb emporium for your christmas

episode 42 of this week's drop today i have ember valley zookees none other than ember valley emperor valley has like been on the up and up lately i had the honor to try them like last year at hall of flowers for my first time and i've been hooked ever since so let's just jump on in zuki's i love the packaging it's really cute i like i said i love a squatty jar since it fits in my purse and [ __ ] a lot easier so and it's straight to the point it's easy to read um i'm gonna give the packaging nine out of ten i like it the batch number we're looking at today is ev0163 it's testing at 25 so decent decent and i like how it's like sealed that's always nice so the smell that's good for being a hybrid it's technically a 50 50 hybrid but for being a 50 50 it definitely smells more like an indica i get those like piney like deep skunky notes oh i like that i'm gonna give the smell 8.9 out of 10. i like it smells good good stinky weed not too sweet for being like a hybrid which sweet usually means more like the sativa notes but i like it the look to you guys these are beautiful buds like holy moly these are really like dense little nuggets like i could like hurt someone that could break the lens if i like aimed perfectly with this little nug i love like strong structured nugs like this so i'm gonna give it 9.5 out of 10. these are really pretty like there's nothing there's not a big stem in the middle they're they're beautiful they're like super trichomed out i like it there's like some little orange hairs too let me break it down it's very nicely cured it's not like brittle it's not like turning into powder when i break it apart so that's good oops ground up like these nugs are pretty like dense and they look kind of like pretty dark green but when they're ground up they look very it looks very bright it looks like a sativa once it's ground though so i'm curious to see how it's going to taste wow that's interesting it like starts off like piney and like heavy like an indica but once i fully exhale it does taste a little smokier like a sativa it's not like i don't know how to explain that that was weird hold on let me finish this interesting it almost kind of tastes like a candy jack weirdly but um yeah that's that's interesting because it's crossed with uh gigi number four which is gorilla glue number four and animal cookies so that's like the genetics of the strain and it is a 50 50 hybrid but i do taste the sativa more in it so i'm going to give it the taste 7.9 out of 10. i like it it's just it wasn't like i'm like a sucker for like piney like stinky oh gee tasting weed so it wasn't bad it wasn't bad for a 50 50 like level headed hybrid i i don't know i want to knock it i like it also too like how i enjoyed this strain i've been trying to take up cooking i'm not gonna lie my boyfriend usually does all the cooking but i'm like trying to be his like little sous chef in the kitchen lately he's trying to like get me in there more trying to wifey make me a little more wifey status because i don't do [ __ ] in the kitchen i'm gonna lie i'm just i sit with my bong and wait for the food but i've been trying to get in the kitchen more and i've been like making like steak and [ __ ] this honestly i've been really really liking the strain right before i help like get in the kitchen because it relaxes me the kitchen is very intimidating to me it's such a foreign area so like i get kind of like anxious when i'm in there like especially because he knows what he's doing and i'm not trying to get in the way and [ __ ] anything up so i'm just like trying to like be zen and this makes me like very calm very focused at the same time like i know what i'm doing but i'm not like too stoned that i'm just going to be like oh [ __ ] i left the stove on or it's like very very good hybrid like in the sense that it makes me all my anxiety is gone but i'm very focused so it's spot on with like 50 50 hybrid i will give it that i really enjoyed this string you guys that means the string gets overall 8.7 out of 10. that's a b plus that's pretty good you guys 8.7 out of 10 that's high like i said amber valley you guys if you haven't tried them i would definitely hop on it another strain that i really like by them is a sunday driver do you see that one try it out you guys thank you so much for tuning in i'm not sure what i'm reviewing next week but that is the glory of it all oh wait i need to pack myself now trouble i'm getting too excited thank you guys so much i'll see you next week you", "nGnYAsG2peA": "hey YouTube

you're getting a lot of beautiful images from the space station and I know you have some other creature comforts like the new espresso machine you know the space station is actually a you know even though it's a remote place and it's a tough environment because you could never leave there's no running water you have a lot of work to do you're always at work there are little things that make life here more normal like the espresso machine which we just got running which by the way is a science experiment and we only have 15 espresso capsules so we're kind of rationing those but it worked great tasted great recently got a projector television to use for work-related things like video conferences and and some software we we can look at on it but we also use it to watch movie so yeah some of those little small things make a big difference up here yes [Music]", "36quf8JLLrE": "today we're bringing you something truly out of this world introducing ping pong in space with water I'm Ben Nye and this is insiders one cool thing NASA's Scott Kelly shows off the trick at the International Space Station the paddles he's using are hydrophobic which means that they repel water kind of literally the end result is pretty spectacular check it out", "r6t0ad6uFTs": "what's up guys og charlie here and today i'm gonna try to survive eating only protein bars for 24 hours let's get right into it [Music] all right so today we're gonna have my first 24 hour challenge and i'm quite excited for this one i truly enjoy protein bars and i'm gonna be eating them all day so first protein bar of the day is gonna be a white chocolate macadamia nut uh bar let's go ahead and try this one out already it's the first time i see white chocolate in a bar it looks quite tasty and there's a little drizzle on top let's go ahead and test this one out [Music] so the first protein bar was great uh the white chocolate was very tasty it's my first time having that cliff bar and i've had quite a few cliff bars in my day i can't really taste the nuts maybe it's just me in denial of having nuts in my mouth but i'd give that one a 7.5 out of 10. the next one is also a clif bar it's going to be the chocolate brownie one so complete different color so the chocolate brownie bar was really good uh i truly enjoyed the first one a little more so i'd go ahead and give this one a 7 out of 10. and to finish off my pre-workout snack we're gonna have a third cliff bar which is the cool mint chocolate one let's go ahead and dig into this one right now all right so it kind of looks like a combine of both the ones we had before basically it has the same color of the second one but has the drizzle of the first one let's go ahead and try it [Music] so the chocolate mint clif bar is definitely the one that i like the less it tastes like a regular chocolate protein bar and you squirt squirted toothpaste on top of it so i'm really not crazy about that one i guess it's like brushing my teeth before i hit the gym so it's not that bad but uh i'd give this one a 5 out of 10. all right now that we're done eating breakfast let's go to the gym and get those gains [Music] all right so i just finished at the gym we're gonna keep this quest going next up we're gonna have this oreo quest bar let's give it a shot and test it out [Music] so the quest cookies and cream is actually the best one i've had all day hmm tastes amazing i'm going to give that one a 8 out of 10. next up we're going to keep going on a quest and have this chocolate chip cookie quest bar so the chocolate chip cookie dough quest bar is uh nothing surprising i'd give that one a six out of ten and we're gonna finish my post workout snack with the chocolate chunk sea salt from cliff all right so that was probably my least favorite from all the clif bars i've had today i'm gonna have to give that one a four out of ten i'm gonna head back home now and take a shower and i'll catch you guys when i'm ready to eat some more protein bars all right so next up on the menu we're gonna have an energy bar from vector it's the chocolate chip cookie flavor all right so i'm pleasantly surprised with the taste of this one i'm going to give it a 7.5 out of 10. the chocolate taste is uh very pronounced which makes it awesome but the bar itself is quite dry all right so next up is gonna be a cliff bar again but this one's a little higher in protein it's the builder's chocolate bar i actually buy these ones in packs at the grocery store so this is nothing new to me but let's compare it to the other ones [Music] all right so this one's going to be quite hard to judge because i have them all the time but compared to the vector that i had just before it's a lot less dry the chocolate taste is not as pronounced though but i truly enjoyed these bars i'm gonna give it a eight out of ten all right so my stomach is quite upset with me right now probably has to do with the fact that i ate a thousand protein bars in the morning i'm currently walking i brought some water with me also to help me to digest and we're gonna have three more protein bars for the rest of the day all right so i just started feeling better and i thought i would celebrate this by eating another protein bar so over here we're gonna have a glazed doughnut from one let's go ahead and taste this one [Music] so this is the best one i've had all day pun intended the flavor is amazing and it only has one gram of sugar also very high in protein i'm going to go ahead and rate this one 8.5 out of 10. all right so i just got back from my wok and we're going to have another protein bar guys this one's going to be the blueberry cobbler one it's also from one so i enjoyed this one even more than the glazed doughnut one to be honest it's very high in protein once again and basically has no sugar in there the taste is amazing i'm going to give this one a 9.5 out of 10. and this is gonna be the last one for today it's also from one uh this is gonna be the birthday cake protein bar [Music] so this protein bar was really good too i'm gonna have to give it a tie with the glazed doughnut though uh it's gonna be a 8.5 out of 10. so the blueberry custard protein bar was the best that i've had all day to be honest it's currently 4 p.m in the afternoon i'm gonna fast until tomorrow since i'm feeling quite sick from eating all these protein bars i'm probably not gonna have one for at least a week and that's gonna be it for now thanks a lot for watching the entire video if you guys enjoyed it make sure to hit that like button and

started all righty welcome back to rounds what's up it's a can of jim molly jim molly shout out not really sponsored but you can sponsor us if you want no no this is what the uh their new rng rtd bcaa all in one have that coming soon yeah but this is going to be news from 11 15 through 11 21 all right let's jump right in uh so probably one of the biggest things going on right now um we talked about last week alpha lion um had teased or actually announced they were doing their uh super human uh pre in bad santa sauce yes right we already knew about that so after the fact throughout the week they had released more they have multiple limited edition products coming on black friday um it's going to include all the super humans so you're going to have supreme and the rudolph rush which is actually going to be a flavor of rainbow dragon fruit interesting the pre which is the bad santa sauce we talked about which is going to be watermelon apple they have their burn which we tried earlier in the year this is frosty fruit and it's going to be peach banana pineapple interesting yeah it sounds interesting but the way the flavors have been i have no doubt it's going to be good uh then they have their superhuman woman which is coming out in mrs claus aid which is like a watermelon lemon twist i believe that said they have uh protein they're bringing their protein back um and it's going to be released in anabolic pebbles it's kind of free pebbles an orange gain sickle um they also announced that their new superhuman muscle is gonna be coming out also um that's gonna that's a natural muscle builder and then they actually re-release the rebranded version of their intro which is now called super human intra in the same three flavors it was originally released in so they rebranded and you can tell they went to that whole superhuman and now each thing is under that brain which it makes sense yeah but they have killed it so far that's a lot yeah yeah uh i mean i don't think i don't think i've seen anybody else releasing that much on core core has probably released more than anybody this year and then you have then probably alpha i mean just one seasonal yeah probably they're probably leading the pack right now yeah because core has done it q through the q's but they've released i think like a total of 90 something a lot uh next chemix releasing a nootropic containing one gram of canna 700 750 milligrams of lion's mame uh to highlight a euphoric stacked label so yeah so when you look at the label um it is gonna be it's gonna be different for a nootropic and and i think it's gonna be i think in my opinion it looks like it's gonna be an aggressive formula um because you know nootropics give you that focus this is gonna be more of that mood like elevation type things like it should be interesting because a gramacana that can go a couple different ways for different people um it it can have positive effects or it can have negative effects on people yeah it should be interesting uh next five percent nutrition man we have talked about they have been bringing a lot to the table the last few months um they announced that they are they have a protein product that's called shake time um it's gonna be added to their lawn and they also have their 5150 pre-workout the og um which the rebranding and the formula is gonna be tweaked a little bit from what i heard yeah i'm pretty sure the shake time is gonna be like an animal protein i could be wrong but i think that's what i saw on it uh purist labs announces a new flavor of chocolate peanut butter to their myoway yeah um arms race we talked about them a few times um they actually are releasing another foundation flavor which is now snickerdoodle and they have announced that their harness is getting a new flavor on black friday kiwi strawberry sounds pretty good yes uh hostile sups announces they have new flavors of their celo 9 eaa hydration product coming yeah um no never say a dude's name anyway ghost lifestyle they were talked about every quarter it seems like with something which is great they announced that they have sugar cookie flavor for their way coming and then they also excuse me have a high protein hot chocolate mix coming soon um and then they also had teased their protein bars uh this week so that should be 20 21 i believe yeah if everything works out the way

again next week yeah we're gonna see you later deuces [Music] you", "93fgyIJk5jo": "- Hey guys, Cassey here. So I always hear a lot of\nmy friends and coworkers complaining about how tired they feel, especially towards the end of the day. So that inspired me to make this video and I will be sharing with you five different hacks that you can do to get your energy levels up without having to drink coffee\nor drink an energy drink and big thank you to Clif Bar for sponsoring this video. When it comes to coffee and energy drinks, I'm not a fan because of how dependent you become on the caffeine. Plus the way an energy drink\njust raises your heart rate, gives you higher blood pressure and also increases your stress levels, just sounds really dangerous,\nweird, and unnatural to me. So ready for your five\nenergy boosting hacks? Here we go. Number one, tap your thymus. What, I know that sounds really weird, but energy healers and practitioners of alternative\nmedicine, swear by it. Apparently by tapping your thymus, you can increase the\nproduction of T cells, relieve stress and also\nincrease your energy, of course, and increase your strength and vitality. So if you're feeling a\nlittle bit skeptical, let's just try it you guys. So your thymus is located right underneath your\ncollarbone on your chest. So take two fingers and\njust tap it like this for 20 seconds. Make sure you're breathing\nin through your nose and out through your mouth. This feels like a light version of like a gorilla going like this. I guess that's why it\nmakes your energy levels go a little bit higher. Number two, eat an energy bar, but not just any bar, because if you don't choose the right one, you guys can pretty much end up consuming something very similar to a candy bar at your local gas station\nin the checkout line. Like filled with tons of excess sugar and also barely any fiber or\nprotein to keep you guys full. One energy bar that I'm\nsuper digging right now is the Clif Fruit\nSmoothie Filled Energy Bar and I like this because it's got five grams of\nplant based protein. Plus the smoothie filling has things like fruity flavors, nuts, seeds\nand nut butters inside. So check this out. This is the strawberry banana. Mmm, mmm so good, I love the texture, you can taste like the\nnut buttery-ness of it. It's very good, like an\noatmeal cooking form. Ooh and it has like, you can see that, little bit of that smoothie\nfilling in there, mmm. And the other great thing about this bar is that it's low on the glycemic index, which means you most likely won't crash right after eating it like what\nhappens after you eat candy. Plus low GI carbs are digested and released slowly for sustained energy. Number three, massage your ears. I know, it sounds a little bit strange, but let's not judge\nuntil we give it a shot, okay you guys? So apparently, by taking your fingers and massaging the perimeter of your ears, just like so, anywhere\nbetween 10 to 30 seconds, you're able to calm your nervous system, You're able to increase\nyour body's energy levels, plus increase the amount\nof endorphins in your body, which means you'll get happier. Why? Apparently your body's meridians all pass through the outer ear. So by massaging them and\npinching them like so, they're really, like, activated. So did you guys try it? Let me know how it feels. Number four, get some light therapy. Look, whenever I'm feeling super tired and about to fall asleep at my computer, which usually only happens\nif I haven't slept enough, I will get up, walk outside\nand recharge myself in the sun. And it feels so good, just a good like three to\nfive minutes in the sun and I'm back to normal. So why does that work? Turns out that environmental\ncues play a big role in our body's energy\ncycles throughout the day. And studies show that people\nwho are regularly exposed to natural light are better at maintaining higher energy levels. And guess what? Exposure to natural light\nalso helps enhance your mood and I guess that's why I just love being in offices or houses with a lot of windows,\nbecause I love me some sun and some inspiration. Last but not least, number five, chew some gum. According to a study in\nnutritional neuroscience, just by chewing gum, you can increase your\nalertness levels by 10%. How? Well it's been shown\nthat when you chew gum, you increase the amount of\nblood flow to your brain, anywhere between 25 to 40%, that is a lot. And when there's more blood flow, there's more oxygen going to the brain, which means you have more\nbrain function efficiency, you feel more alert, your\nreaction times are better, and overall you have more energy. Also cognitive functions like memory and concentration really\nimprove when you chew gum. So go grab a stick. Well, there you have it guys. Those are five hacks you can try next time you feel like\nyou're falling asleep at work or in the back of your lecture hall. Let me know in the comments below which one of these you're\nmost curious to test out. Once again, big thank you to Clif Bar for sponsoring our energy hacks video. If I have made you really\nhungry at the end of this video, and you really want to try a Cliff Fruit Smoothie Filled Energy Bar, you should definitely go try it, you can head out to your\nlocal store and grab one. There are flavors like tart cherry berry, and wild blueberry acai, and the one I tried, which\nis strawberry banana, or if you feel like you\nwanted to just have it shipped to your house, then head over to clifbar.com. All right, guys, that is\nall, I love you so much and I will see you next time, bye."}
