welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a product uh that we've reviewed way in the past back in the good old um gray market days of edibles uh but we are now taking a look in their newly legal version and that is a syrup excuse me not a syrup a tincture a tincture company that i liked quite a lot years ago and that is cannabis that's right cannabis we've reviewed i think several of their syrups in the past excuse me tinctures uh and now we're back with their 600 milligram formulation uh and traditionally before i go into a little spiel we do about a hundred milligrams for all of our uh tincture reviews on wheats today we are actually going to do a little bit more just it's a bit of a celebration here at wheat's hq so we're going to break out of the traditional 100 milligram mold uh and we're going to go somewhere between the two and three uh hundred range and i will of course take that into account in our reviews and thankfully this cannabis syrup has a nice little chart here on the back um a little flow diagram that's gonna give us our exact dosage exact so this cannabis 600 milligram tincture uh cost 34.00 at my dispensary in long beach which is a pretty good deal for 600 milligrams of thc anyway you slice it tincture syrup or no you cannot beat that price uh so i am really excited to give this extra strength stuff a try uh so one thing i want to bring up real quick tincture syrup i know i did a review not too long ago a five star extracts uh that uh definitely labeled their product as tincture even gave you a little bit of an eye dropper as if to suggest it is tincture um i think one of their uh employees hit me up on youtube saying you guys need to take this you should actually take this with a drink which is weird because it does actually say on their instructions to do it sublingually cannabis uh spits right in that eye which i am actually quite okay with uh if you're going to um uh point out how stupid something is be bold about it and uh cannabis is quite bold about their uh tincture labeling they label it uh tincture in quotations uh just as i would you may see right there on that little label if i can get it to focus there it is yes it says tincture in quotation which i love it because this isn't tincture it's syrup it's candy flavored strawberry goop with weed in it um there's nothing medicinal about it i mean other than the thc uh but there's no uh yeah this they're not trying to hide the fact which i give them some points for oh boy uh this little cap is on here uh more stringently than i thought let me try to get that off oh no might have to be a time for a knife break let's see if i can manifest telepathically very quickly a knife in midair that nobody will see that will come to me like mjolnir like thor i'm going to do it right now yes it works 100 of the time um sorry to anybody who had to listen to that uh so let's get this cut open here and then we will dig into this scissor give it a good shake here is our 600 milligram 34 milligram 600 milligram 34 cannabis strawberry tincture let's give it a smell smells like scissor i've got some water here to help choke this down uh ultimately we're going to do about i said between two and three hundred milligrams which is you know anywhere between a third and a half so we'll do a little bit here uh and just to let you guys know like all our wheats reviews i'm gonna do this product um over the next not all between two thirds and half of this over the next uh on video but i will do it uh over the next probably hour so i'm actually getting ready to walk out the door i'm gonna have a little bit more later uh and then two hours after i have that last drop i will come right back to you guys and let you know our most important thoughts which is is this cannabis syrup as good as it used to be so without further ado let's get it down the hatch i don't know the best way to do this other than well i could mix it in something but i'm i'm a fool so straight down the hatch that's too much man whoa uh thankfully i'm trying to screw the long wrong lid onto my water there uh well you know what guys i actually um stand corrected i might not have to do a whole lot more i did way more than i thought i did about oh pretty close to 200 milligrams there uh in one gulp so now i'm just gonna wait and see a little bit how it affects me and decide how much more we want to do but i will need to take into account when i come back for a week's review am i that much higher than if it had been 100 milligrams not that it's a linear relationship i shouldn't expect to be three times as high as i would for 100 milligrams syrup but i shouldn't expect to be higher for sure um and i will know in just a bit and you guys will as well excuse me oh that syrup oh i feel it's sliding down anyways thank you so much for watching this far guys i will see you right back here or somewhere just like this in just a bit to give you those wrap-up thoughts we'll see you then [Music] welcome back tweets guys it has been many many hours since i had the cannabis uh about a hundred well actually right about 200 milligrams of cannabis syrup in total start over welcome back tweets guys it has been many many many hours since i had nearly 200 milligrams of this cannabis syrup um didn't do that much more than i originally had if any uh reason being it got me higher than i uh expected uh quite a bit higher even with just the about 200 milligrams i did uh and did the good old-fashioned classic pass out on the couch for a couple of hours that's why i look a little sleepy because i woke up still a little high for sure uh not outrageously but i fell asleep for a couple hours woke up still a little high uh and that's just 200 milligrams of cannabis strawberry syrup uh this stuff is pretty good um i will admit it did give me a bit of a stomach ache uh doing all of that at one go right at the beginning uh but that is on me don't do the way don't do this the way i did it um mix it with some stuff do it um in a less concentrated all at one shot otherwise it sits in your stomach a little rough for a bit but after about a half hour of um some mild discomfort from drinking that much syrup but once felt fine felt great felt really high still feel quite high many hours later and have no no no problems recommending cannabis as syrup yet again uh their 600 milligram excuse me 600 milligram strength tincture is another real winner for uh cannabis and cannabis line of tincture syrups so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats really happy to have tried this cannabis again um it's a strange world syrup tincture but uh i'm glad it's a product that exists and uh one that i think i will probably try again in the future this is really good stuff from cannabis syrup tincture and that guys then is gonna do it for this review here on wheats i appreciate you watching here to the very end thank you so much until we see you guys on our next review live stream whatever stay high but more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "1LywYGV2M04": "hey guys welcome to the hot box it's a little straight my boy will today we got a dope video we're going to be eating some medicated jolly rancher gummies oh yes 600 milligrams yes we're so excited it's been a minute since we had an edible video for real but before we get into that 85.8 percent of you guys are not subscribed make sure you subscribe it's going down it goes back up you know just keep subscribing guys we need y'all support for real we just lost our instagram not too long ago so keep subscribing we will be making another one soon asap it's just you know we're just trying to keep it safe like we were saying we got some jolly rancher gummies right here look at this package guys some really nice packaging sours by the way yeah as these little characters maybe these little characters i with the characters i hope it's like different flavors yes this kind of reminds me of the last review we did with what was it the sour patch kids yeah it's kind of like that packaging it's kind of like the same kind of vibe and stuff and the dopest thing is uh they're heat sealed so oh yes open it you know it's kind of there's no pre-opening you know it's you don't know what's inside legit you know what i'm saying pretty legit what i'm gonna try to do is open up this little seal right here you can see the little strip on top yeah straight into it a little bit did they were good decent yep thank you hello yeah oh wow i think i got watermelon ones did you get watermelon ones too let me see yeah a bunch of watermelons thank you these are the watermelon ones i don't know yeah look yeah bunch of watermelons inside yeah jolly rancher let me get all these out that's pretty cool we weren't we didn't know what to expect so all watermelons that's pretty cool let's see i mean did you get one two i got six i got six two boca six of them they're sticky probably a hundred a little bit it means a hundred milligrams each that's pretty strong bro hell yeah what i'm gonna do is get a quick close-up shot for you guys and then we're gonna get straight into eating them look at this guys frosted we got six each 600 milligrams that gas gas jolly rancher gummies that with them let me eat this nice one first yes that's great today what are y'all smoking what are y'all eating do you all have edibles where you all have weed let's all know what y'all got and like i don't know is there different ones like is there grape ones yes we have this is the first time we're trying these so yes i don't know if there's other kinds are there apple ones you know yeah are there different flavors out there let us know let us know if you guys have tried it that's packed with flavor yes very sugary not too strong on the um like a weed distillate taste you know it's not too strong it tastes pretty sweet yes i won't say that's bad i would just say it's actually kind of good because you know a nasty distillate aftertaste is not what you want whenever you're eating your edibles that's why i don't like these taste really good eating my second one and get that structure on that that's what i'm saying let me do a break up they're kind of hard to break up yeah it's some dense snugs right there you know what i'm saying scrape gas these are pretty fire though i like the taste probably some of the best tasting edibles i've had so far we really like the sour patch gummies because there was just like a variety of flavors and kind of looking exactly that's what i like go check that out link in the description we also have a couple other edible videos if you all want to go throughout our channel and check them and we got some more edibles coming soon hopefully some skittles yes that's gonna be dope i can't wait for that one we'll be back here in a

about 20 30 minutes yeah it's a little vibe you know yeah we've been chilling we just got some dope ass sweet in today and so yeah we hit that this morning so i mean that could be it but at the same time we do like edibles and  feeling a little something something but you know we didn't like the fact that uh it was only one one type of gummy you know what i mean yeah you all seen it was just a bunch of watermelon we were hoping it was going to be like multiple you know like some sour apple and all the different gummies you know water reviews all bunch of different varieties of this was just kind of one thing so yeah that was uh that was the only disappointing thing but we we didn't know what to expect you know what i'm saying i think it's hitting you know i'm saying i feel something so and people would say oh they're boofy and you know i'm just feeling pretty chilled out like my heads for sure like versus right now versus how it was before this video i feel way more chill you know yes and especially getting back into the video now i'm starting to feel myself a little more i like it though i really like the packaging like we said earlier it's really cool packaging yes it's very

this video is for a mature audience so if you're not a mature audience going on today's video we're going to talk about the THC drinks and we'll get drink them obviously I got a bunch of different things here there's a lot of stuff out there I got a few of the things that I like and we're gonna get started by doing it a nice cold start DAB here out of the Davidge you know I've filled it up with some Sun evil water mom and we're just gonna get started with a cold start before we get into anything [Music] [Music] I'm gonna drink it right just add a little more th in there isn't using it with the dab right now well damn now it's good only Clements real quick let's talk about these drinks that we got so oh that was the sons of sativa and it's a two hundred two hundred milligram watermelon sativa drink and it's sixteen point five ounces and they save 20 servings on here but we'll probably finishing the whole bottle so we got that I got another two hundred milligram Dixie elixir fruit punch here and I've had these before these are delicious it actually says two hundred and twenty milligrams like have that variance now this one says 193 it was one since 220 so if you if you get the chance look at the labels you might be able to anyway what percent bro this is made with pure cane sugar no artificial flavoring sweetening then a few different flavors I guess but I got the fruit punch flavor and this is 200 milligrams and the bottle is eight and a half ounces so about half as much liquid in this one for the same dosage so if you're not trying to drink a lot of liquid and then I got two of these a little bit little flasks here we're gonna have some fun with these they're made by I don't know how to pronounce the mark aha ma r QA h a but they're called flasks and they got a fruit punch infused beverage this is a hundred milligrams per bottle and this is just a few ounces that would think if it says on here this is like a mixin or a flavor utter flavor edition and this one is the blueberry chamomile aka very marriage berry this one is supposed to be there indica put you to sleep that one and these both have 100 milligrams but we're gonna have some fun with these and I just realized I want a glass of ice but before these over some ice and let's really enjoy the show all right let's have some fun I got a couple of couple of glasses of some nice here and ourselves a couple of drinks here maybe we'll mix some of the the flavors a shake that [ __ ] people who don't shake their drinks before drinking them oh my god let's pour some of this over some ice see how it looks this is the duck fruit punch I mean it's basically just a regular fruit punch with [Music] nice shot a big glass oh there we got some of that makes it look so pretty oh yeah oh that's nice stuff it says 30-minute activation time on here so we're about to get really good but that's the the one thing I guess I like about drinks if it's a [ __ ] quicker sometimes you'll eat an edible and then you have to wait an hour so some people find themselves just roast involves doing dabs and they're like I don't know if I got high from the animals I just put up like my smokes tomorrow but with these you just enjoy a nice drink and then a little bit later it feels pretty good let's we're gonna keep sippin that one I just want to pour this other one here and take a look and there's a there's even more drinks that I didn't have actually just thought about these sunglasses that I have are keep cola sunglasses and keep call it makes a lot of sodas obviously and I don't drink soda I haven't had a soda in several years it's just something I've decided to try one day hey hey let me see if I can go you know a week or so without drinking soda and then it's just like several years later I'm just like yeah I just I never want to soda let's take a sip of this and see if we like it well I guess I already took that out of it you know but this is this is the this is the stuff right here the watermelon is so good like picture your favorite watermelon candy for a second it tastes like that it's [ __ ] good [ __ ] jeez the sentence atiba like I said there's more liquid for the amount of tissue they both have 200 milligrams but there's twice as much liquid recycle sativa bottle but it's tasty who's feeling a Bhangra playing I'm asking like like you can tell me right now maybe drop a comment if you're feeling a bomber up right now leave a comment let me know let me know if you've ever had a PhD drink are you [ __ ] kidding me oh my gosh I didn't bring a lighter I brought every [ __ ] thing on the damn plane of that one Oh got one gosh alright let's just ripped it just rip this and then we're gonna have some fun with the mixers [Music] buddy let's do another [Music] Oh boom [Music] but massive blueberry into the water will make a blueberry water lightning fast absorption it chooses lightning fast absorption on here it's like not syrupy thick but it definitely it definitely made a Duggar Oh oh that's not bad it's still really sweet [Music] well there i weirdly want to mix the fruit punch into the fruit punch like I don't know why it definitely changed the Flair back that gets better I think the other flavor hit a little weird [Music] very very little - it's interesting for me to think that I have an option of getting high not drinking juice like think about you drink a gator right above your high or some [ __ ] like that you know what I mean I'm literally drinking juice with some THC in it and I'm pretty high it's way less harsh than smoking if you [ __ ] think about it think about ripping a bunch of bombs right now all that buckets of all that combustion ruining you I mean you're gonna get pretty blasted by like rather just sucking sips I'm some watermelon [Music] [Music] I feel like because of sipping it slowly me not super slow it's really tasty because I've been drinking it over the span of a little bit while making this video this is gonna happen nice for ramping effect on my high later like ah here you go ah here you got me before a inedible and then like I waited an hour and I didn't feel anything and then I got highlights and 15 minutes later and then I got really high like an hour later they tell you you could you know drink the bottle intense 20 doses or whatever but if I drink a tenth of that bottle and I don't think I'm gonna feel anything I don't know hi I'm a daily or nightly Dever device which stream at which TV / Cupid I might be live right now if you watch that next time look like so - just pop over right now and just say what's up half the to be the next person but I'm a daily never so I think there's so many they consume cannabis or THC and a concentrated form you might have a weird hollering swith edibles I've talked to a lot of people that say this and some people speak about having a different tolerance I don't know it kind of berries for everybody but for me and I know I need at least a few hundred milligrams to start the village so for me I'm probably gonna drink all these I think it's like 600 milligrams here total took two drinks for 200 in the two blasts or a hundred so that yeah at 600 I'll probably get a nice-lookin I'll probably get a nice hype at this and I'll probably just start screamin around so definitely go watch the put somebody in a super chill didn't wanna be outside when I was recording earlier but now he doesn't like dude we're gonna get your ball get the ball get the ball yeah [ __ ] Jason [Music] get it [Music] [Music] [Music] I can't behind me but not that

like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "W5n-HmByun4": "[Music] all right welcome super loves doobies yeah no now i was gonna say

up scary overwhelming place you call your dispensary today good old-fashioned classic ass episode of wheats which means it is an edible review my favorite kind of review if we're being honest love me some edibles and one today that i've got uh high expectations for no pun intended uh it comes at a premium price and it comes from a relatively um experienced well-known player in the field but one uh one of these players that is known for their cartridges not their edibles but they are branching out and so who is that that is heavy hitters that's right guys we are taking a look at the gummies uh now out from heavy hitters uh those are the fine folks that make really really nice um premium thc cartridges we've reviewed a couple of them here on wheats like them quite a bit uh and now they are making their own gummies that they say are ultra potent um there are some curiosities with this here first of all it says that they are five 20 milligram pieces which is a hundred milligrams what it's supposed to be uh it's just another sort of indication of how [ __ ] up the labeling is and how nothing really matters with labeling um because technically it's supposed to be everything is supposed to be uh at most or minimum 10 doses of 10 milligrams but this says five 20 milligram pieces well but then they get away with it by showing you actually on the back uh that even though it says they're five uh 20 milligram pieces oh sorry it's right on the front it does say two 10 milligram servings per piece so it's kind of very disingenuous to advertise it that way but whatever um we do have everything we want to see on our packaging here nutrition facts lab testing results showing our 100 milligrams of thc um and uh ingredients all that great stuff i'm not sure i've ever heard of a agar agar before it's one of the ingredients uh this is the strawberry flavored it's free of all the things you would hope it would be free of your glutens your dairies and your nuts um so you know if any of those things need to be free for you this claims that it is free uh and as i said this is at a premium this is an expensive edible uh at the dispensary i go to the gummies usually range in the about 15 16 range this comes in at a premium for 20 bucks uh so the heavy hitter's name uh given a little extra premium on the price let's hope it's going to be a little bit premium on the product so uh let's go ahead and open it here does have some opening instructions on the back i find those always to be those pictograms that show you how to open these child proof uh bags are very bad i think um usually they're not too bad it's usually about actually the trick is opening the bag beneath the zipper as opposed to above the zipper is the trick for most of these originally you know you rip the zipper anyways what does it matter um i just think the iconography of those things is terrible so here we go here are our uh 20 milligram pieces excuse me are two 10 milligram pieces i guess it is nominally scored as such does smell like strawberry and of course like all of our wheats reviews the way we do it i'm going to do the entire product i'm going to eat all 20 not 20. all 100 milligrams of heavy hitters strawberry gummies uh and then about two hours after i have that last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly how we're feeling let's go ahead and try our first of five right here for you hmm wow that is a tasty gummy that is a very tasty gummy i like the gummy a lot almost zero weed taste i mean i'm really looking for it there on the aftertaste not not much i mean that is a gummy i would be very happy to eat uh just uh out of boredom and anxiety like all gummy candies should be consumed but yeah that's that's that's great um a shockingly shockingly uh devoid of cannabis taste which you know hopefully is gonna be a huge positive if these get me as high as their ultra potent label suggests we shall see look that sugar off my fingertips well we're two-fifths of the way there i've got three more of these to go i'm not gonna gorge myself right now i'll have these over the next i usually like to do this over about the next half hour to hour or so and then two hours after that last one actually that is not 100 true um what i'm gonna be doing is doing these next three on a live stream with you guys as soon as i wrap up this first half of this review i'm gonna save these three i'm gonna be doing a live stream hanging out with you folks saying hi getting high with you and at the end of that live stream i'll come back and give you my wrap-up thoughts but that's just a little pitch to you guys let you know we do the live streams now and i hope you will join us for those in the future regardless if you do or not we will be back to tell you if these heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy are worth the heavy hitters premium price until then stay healthy and stay high my friends see you real soon bye-bye welcome back to weights everybody looks like a dog might be joining us welcome back tweets guys it's been about three hours a little over three hours since our journey started with the heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy and the dog is still coming in hello dog uh and i am very happy to say and especially if any of you had watched the live stream i did while enjoying this review these are quite good uh these are a premium product at a premium price but i gotta say they do land in that top tier uh echelon of gummy edibles i am very high i'm very pleased with my high uh quite impressive with these and that's not to even mention as a taste which um these are among the best tasting gummy edibles i've had especially for as potent as they are um really happy with it the only downside is that price uh these are more affordable or excuse me more expensive rather than most of the gummy edibles out there uh but you know i i uh some of it may be just uh some psychology of uh wanting it to be more expensive more potent because it's more expensive but if you hear me rambling it seems like it may actually work i don't know might be more than just psychological tricks i really enjoyed it really enjoyed it heavy hitters strawberry hundred milligram gummies can i get a big old thumbs up from me if you can find it and if it's not that much more give them a shot for sure so speaking of premium products uh i want to share with you guys a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that's not necessarily weed related that's like let's do something a little premium we're going premium edible let's go premium cherry on top what does that mean i don't know that's kind of a dumb thing but what i do mean is go premium on something and really what i mean by that is get rid of ads on something hulu spotify apple music whatever it is that you use that has an ad subsidized version pay to get rid of ads ads are terrible they're the worst i don't think you even realize how hey you're on youtube pay for youtube premium get rid of ads eat [ __ ] the music stuff who gives a [ __ ] who gives about anything else just get rid of ads live your life with as few ads as possible it's not until you start to consciously remove advertisements from your life that you realize how pernicious and awful they are so this cherry on top is a premium service of your choice and this review is a premium product heavy hitters strawberry that tree on top was really abstract but you know what i mean pay for something you'll be happy you did and that guy's is going to do for this chair on top that's going to do it for this review that's going to do for everything here on wheats i thank you so much for watching as always stay high stay healthy and we'll see you guys on the next video were", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from marijuana lay the topics in the description pink ominous video and we showed with an addiction to read if you like

gonna wanna know their review today we got a product here this is called the rainbow delights this is from tribal delights you got ahead of you today tell you what the ingredients is here this is says gelatin real fruit juice pure honey flavored gelatin tart and sour not sure why they put tart in this hour in this but 600 milligrams THC yeah I believe the is there 25 show you guys 600 milligrams of THC so it's colleague a nice little pot leaf going on there nice design you can see two colors so they layered it when they made it smell like it smells kind of fruity little dude fruity notes a

me heavily medicated yeah more than half really tastes like we stronger my mom like almost like I don't enjoy the flavor of it they should make this with distillate I don't know what they're thinking I wouldn't taste like it wouldn't taste like we strong we'd flavor but you know it tastes like weed cuz this this is 600 milligrams so if you're making it with a platic plant extraction a full plant extraction like this like what it tastes like yeah it's gonna taste like strong like wheat if you got a lot in there like soo ceremonies jacimo alright that would make these with distillate in my opinion then they wouldn't taste like weed at all you can throw a leg up you know like a thousand milligrams a distillate in there THC desolate you know I wouldn't taste like we did all your I want done this gummy man true you know you taste the fruit juice is lovely guy kinda like a fruit punchy kind of flavor on top looks like don't you taste like a little bit I'm not sure at the bottom flavor is or even in top 100 you know if they're top ones differently we're all could just be food tribal delights 600 milligram edible rainbow delights baby we almost got it the whole thing ingested all right I don't know if I can really taste the wheat taste too much now that it's like completely coated my mouth it doesn't take I can taste more than the fruit juice flavors and a little tartness last

make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our fourth look third look at a syrup lien that is I think the kids are calling it lien these days which i think is a take-off of when you used to do scissor with codeine in it this is not codeine this is just weed just good old-fashioned THC straight from the earth the good stuff none of that none of those opiates or opioids or anything to get you addicted so this is a pro methylene liquid syrup two fluid ounces watermelon flavored and it proclaims to be 600 milligrams of indica THC I guess they're saying it has 1200 milligrams of syrup total and half of it is indica of course we're gonna be doing the entire bottle 600 milligrams is a dot I'm not gonna do 600 milligrams right from the get-go although I'm pretty sure this might be another scam so I picked this up very cheaply I think it was 35 bucks for a 600 milligram syrup which is a very good deal if in fact is true but let's take a look at this bottle and just see what kind of red red flags just sort of pop off look how cheap it looks just a gross little cheap sticker poured out on there you can barely read what is you know what's on there because the printing is pretty awful shake well every use it's very muddy muddy is the adjective they use fair enough in THC We Trust so again this little bottle it proclaims that 600 milligrams hc' but I am skeptical because of the price because of the size because of the packaging all of that leads me to believe that this might actually be a another scam but I am certainly hoping to get quite high off of it and I realize I probably should have brought something to drink with me in case this thing tastes truly wretched which it might very well so let's go ahead and take a look at this Pro methylene liquid syrup let's shake it very well because it's muddy now it suggests that for a beginner to do half a teaspoon it says for an expert to do 2 to 3 teaspoons or 4 Club meanies whatever the hell that means 4 to 7 teaspoons which is what we're gonna be doing I have no idea what Club MIM is is maybe you guys can help me figure that out come on let's focus camera there it is 4 to 7 teaspoons tablespoons rather Club em I am eyes II don't know all right so our muddy stuff is shooken oh it smells really bad and it looks really gross look at the top there ah oh it is muddy as they said it is muddy well maybe I should go get something to mix it with [ __ ] it here we go 3 2 1 down the hatch see how much we can get down ooh ooh we got a lot of it down we got most of it there yak it's actually not super super gross it's not good tasting by any stretch but I'm gonna finish it off I'm gonna give my second self a second to let that percolate through my stomach and then I will be back

absolute trying to fleece you for your money there's nothing in there it tasted terrible at the bottom because there was a lot of like ground-up plant matter or whatever in there it was disgusting I don't know what it was probably wasn't actually weeds I certainly don't feel hi disgusting I at the very bottom tasting does didn't get me high at all an absolute it's like I took $35 and lit it on fire an absolute travesty of a product do not buy it if you see it at a dispensary tell them not to carry it because they're just doing their customers a disservice by carrying this [ __ ] that is Pro methylene I think I'm not going to look again because I don't want to if I have it wrong great they don't need the they don't need the endorsement they don't need the free advertising but I wanted to

I got the eucalyptus eucalyptus I got a blue one matches my little outfit I got jasmine mm and I got this premium Jane CBD topical oil and eucalyptus one thing that I really found interesting about

[Music]", "CKpWS5kiRc0": "[Music] everything starts with a plant we source from artisanal family farmers in Humboldt County where we are based our farms use sustainable organic farm practices and care about their community to create our relief bomb we use our proprietary infusion process utilizing heat water and pressure and no chemicals or solvents this transfers the cannabinoids from the plants into the oil maintaining the full spectrum of the plant we then mix that infused pure coconut oil with essential oils vitamin E and beeswax beeswax is a primary ingredient in the balm and we source from only top-tier organic farms we designed a heated filtration process on the fresh capping wax to remove impurities we blend all of these ingredients together with a combination of artisanal blending and automation to finish our product we use premium sustainable packaging and that's how we make our world-class bombs crafted with care for you and the ones you love", "AvSJ0rc8Uxg": "[Music] welcome to TV mall and today we are making sure that we take care of all those important challenges that you might be facing I know lots of us are battling with the anxiety depression pain is actually a challenge for most of us and today we've got a special product for you from Moringa Foods International and it goes by the name of CBD oil you might have heard about it but today I'm not alone in the studio about the CEO of Moringa Foods international to make sure that they can give you the lowdown and make sure you understand fully what CBD oil is about Jay welcome today thank you for having me in the studio and thank you for joining us and I know lots of people have heard about CBD oil but what many are sure of how to use it what exactly is it and this is why today we've got you to explain and give our viewers more information when it comes to CBD oil thank you so be a pleasure to share that information with you yes let's start with the one that we've got I like you if you write premium this is the premium CBD oil and this is from hemp that's right and I wanted to start by saying here we've got the six hundred milligram that we've got for you today and I like the fig that we always about good prices here TV more you're not going to pay 750 rounds and because we care about you and we want you to save and so that your money can go a long way you're going to pay six hundred and fifty rounds that's a saving of a hundred rounds so that's the premium hemp CBD or 600 milligrams tell us more about EJ you mentioned the fact that we use the word premium on our label the reason for that is because it denotes quality very high quality and high efficacy okay we expect the results to be positive on every single application or use we we see of what the benefits there which we're looking at pain relief we're talking about increasing appetite I hope we're not talking about overeating they're reducing stress promoting healthy cell growth and of course I like the part of the nausea and fatigue and also the brain health can you let's touch mostly on the pain aspect because I know most people are using lots of money on painkillers they are using lots of money on energy supplements they're using men of many on sleeping aids but and I know as we were talking Elia on you spoke about CBD or being able to assist in most of those conditions most definitely and without the side effects of a lot of what people are using currently so son if you look at the used to cost factor yes you'll find that it's cost-effective for the results that you're getting but I must point out something very important about as efficient as CBD is yeah it's a non psychoactive is very important because most people will always confuse and say ok the hemp one and the one that comes from marriage one what's the difference well it's actually taking on a high we're actually saying viewers when you talk about the premium hemp extract from you know from from the marina food I international there is no high that's associated with this is not psychoactive so this is actually a very good one if you look at the comparison there look at that we could it contains 0.3 percent or less of the THC the THC is actually the component that actually you know causes the high you think we always throw this the temps can you actually tell us what so what you'll find is that th is the psychoactive ingredient in both hemp and cannabis Jen drop the gentle plant species but what you find is Barlow be required to remove it from all our products okay so the maximum usage per day is twenty milligrams legally so be ensure that is absolutely no THC definitely below the legal limit I can see as you can see there we've got the comparison quite nicely there to make sure that you know we can understand that there is a difference and we look at that THC and actually how the plant look like but when we look at it we're saying this the one from hemp does not actually cause problems in the sense that it is not psycho active not have lots of THC so I think just to tell our viewers more about that the main difference because the too many greens being CBD and THC you find that in in marriage one I have got more of the THC and less of CBD and it's actually the reverse when it comes to the hemp one we've got more of the CBD and less in fact almost if I can variant very negligible and in fact what we do is we have a certificate of analysis that actually shows the breakdown of every ingredient in our products and you'll find that the MP is about ninety-nine point eight percent yes and then you get CBDs CBN's and CB G's that'll make out the difference I like the fact that okay you guys we have got the three hundred milligrams are on offer today our call center agents are waiting for your call zero eight six one a triple zero one seven three we are saving you a hundred runs normally you would pay 750 runs but today we are giving it to you for six hundred and fifty rounds of course they also do make a three hundred milligram which you can also purchase so but today what's on offer is the six hundred milligram and when you took dosages it's important because people want to know this is a 30 mil bottom in terms of how one would take for example if I'm taking it for pain how much would I take well each bottle contains about 600 drops okay and you only required on the 300 yarn you required to take about six drops three times a day if required okay because you determined that by your pain factor so we normally measure pain from zero to what to tare to ten so if you in about the three to four factor region yes then you'll use this like normal users following the the dosage instructions and they'll probably last for about two two to three months okay if it's for insomnia then you don't have to take it all day long just take it before bed time until outreach with your city so we've got lots of people I know what battling to go to sleep because we using lots of stimulants during the day and that affects how we'll then you know I produce those hormones that are supposed to help us to sleep we're telling you today that we've got a premium product premium hemp CBD oil which is going to help you so if it's way insomnia one we'll just take it before they go to bed actually so you just how many drops would you take so on the 300 you probably take about six drops okay you can actually determine yourself and we need to take you know how much is enough for yourself and is a dosage charge that's that comes together bottle people normally worry about overdosing jealous would you really say it would be a concern when it comes to your products the premium see video that we've got in terms of overdosing No so science in depending scientific studies show that with the removal of the THC there's absolutely no psychoactive activity which means you can't overdose quite quite honestly you could finish most of that bottle in one guy just like you sleep so we are giving you a product that is actually very safe for you to take the only side effect would be you'll be wasting your money if you took all of it so take it as directed so that it can last for about a month or two so that you can get all those benefits that we have shown you there we're looking at pain relief I've told you lots of money is going into pain killers lots of money is going into you know taking care of anxiety and stress lots of money is actually being put into sleeping tablets and if you look at it how better you know to just get one product that will give you all those benefits a 650 runs only 650 runs we're saving you a hundred grands because normally you would pay six hundred and seven hundred and fifty runs for the six hundred milligram strength J in terms of far when you're taking the product are there any people that are exempted are any people that should not take this product that CBD today studies have shown that you could actually use it anytime and anybody can use it so in age groups you check in kids can also take it again but control number of drops okay and in association with the discussion you have with your medical practitioner most definitely so we're actually telling you that at least the good thing is now your medical professional they actually know more about CBD oil that's why it is actually available since it's a product that is actually legal that you can purchase from your outlets there your retail outlets but we are saying to you today let's save you money instead of going out there to pay 750 runs pay 600 runs 650 runs for this 600 milligrams strength but we also told you that the 300 milligram strength is also available for so this is CBD oil to take care of your anxiety your stress manage your stress well make sure that you can sleep better I like the power of sleep because J I can tell you if we look at the statistics lots of people are not sleeping well and for me I value sleep a lot because if you look at it we're supposed to be sleeping eight hours a day that translates to about a third of our life so for someone was six years old you should have been sleeping for what 20 years so that's the value of sleep because that's when now you recharge the batteries that's when you actually get to be able to wake up energized most of us are battling they start their day on a cup of coffee why because they are lacking energy how about now using a product that's going to help you to make sure that now you don't have to depend on those stimulants you don't have to depend on those sugary drinks to get your energy we're talking about the premium hemp CBD oil and we've got Jay here telling us more about it Jay what else do our viewers you think it will be valuable for viewers to know about your product it's very important to know that the lifestyle will lead and the anything that we consume affects us serotonin dopamine levels okay so what you'll find that this regulates it positively so using a good level or mood but at the same time in the calming with a calming effect that it has yes makes you more efficient that anything else that you do that is actually very nice to you so those of you who might not know he just mentioned the serotonin and the dopamine serotonin and dopamine are hormones and dopamine is the one that normally that's associated with addiction so when you burn a good product like your premium hemp it actually helps you not to get too addicted to substances you're getting the feel-good effects quite nicely and the serotonin is also that hormone that makes sure that you can control how much you eat you do not go over Egypt but a healthy appetite that's why the CBD or is gonna help you with your appetite but also the same hormone is used at night to produce another hormone that's called melatonin which makes it easier for you to go to sleep so we're talking about a product that helps you right through the whole day we want you to be productive during the day we want you to do with that anxiety and stress and we want to make sure that when it's time to go to bed you can sleep well pain-free for that matter that's true the pen the pen therapy is unbelievable you found that a lot of sports people are using it apart from the normal time that we experience so well whether you approaching 60 or not and the pain associated with that it'll treat that but a lot of sports people I was actually gonna go to that in terms of actually their sports people in order so it's a product that you would recommend for people who are highly active that's right and we're talking about in terms of pain are we talking about a product here that also controls inflammation and then also then gets to take care of the pain that's right so a does handle it does help with the inflammation and pain but as I said it makes you more efficient we found it on the golf course I had the cap increases after taking the CBD because we so called 650

really happy to be making this video today i know it's a little bit different from what i normally do you know talking about makeup or clothes or vlogging but today's video i think is so important if you do watch my other videos you know that i have struggled with anxiety for a very long time you know this year i think it has been introduced into people's lives that have never had it before which is really unfortunate but looking at my wiener dog over here trying to climb up on the table what you doing girl you want to say hi to everybody say hi i'm in this video later i have something that's even for dogs for anxiety so i'm going to share that it just was weighing on my heart to make this video and i'm just really excited to share some things with you guys that i think really helped so i have five products today that i want to share with you and then i'm gonna make a follow-up video about things you can like physically do that i think help with anxiety so make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss that second video like a little mini series but yeah let's just get started five things you can go out and buy that are gonna help you with anxiety okay so the first product that i think totally helps with anxiety is cbd you can get cbd so many different ways and i feel like it's one of those products that people might be a little afraid of because they think am i gonna get high is this gonna like make me get in trouble at work but cbd oil is legal it will not get you in trouble like on a drug test it won't make you feel high it just helps calm your body down there's so many things that cbd does you can google it and you will learn all about it but what i personally use it for is anxiety and then i have back pain sometimes from my job so i use it because it's anti-inflammatory so i have used several different kinds of cbd i've done like the gummies i've done bath bombs um and then the main thing that i incorporate in my life that i know helps with anxiety is oil it's something you could just take every single day i'm gonna do it right now to share it with you guys so this brand you guys know i like to keep it real this brand did reach out to me and asked if i wanted to use their oil and try it out and i was like absolutely because that's something i've already used for years why not try a new brand so the way you use it is you put it under your tongue i like to take about half of a dropper just like that and then you wait 60 seconds [Music] and then you swallow it this brand in particular they're called premium jane who reached out to me and i just love their name first of all premium jane classic so when they reached out to me the first thing i did was i went to their website obviously you guys were putting this in our body and just because i had tried cbd oil i wasn't just like yeah send it over i wanted to make sure it was a good brand and i actually was really pleasantly surprised everything they make is from hemp grown here in the usa they have third party testing which i thought was really cool because again we're putting this in our body so to pay someone else to test their products and make sure they're good that's awesome you can check this all out on the website i'll link everything down below obviously and i liked on their website how they had all these different flavors and that's kind of what makes me like them the best i like i said i've tried other brands the flavor was just kind of if you've tried cbd oil it tastes kind of like weed it does and this is the first one i've tried that i'm like oh the flavor i got is mint and it's actually super refreshing danny even commented on it because he's been trying this too he's like that's actually really good so that's one thing i really like also about it but if oil isn't for you you can do they have gummies and they have bath bombs and they have topical lotions and the funnest thing is that they have dog treats too which is so exciting i will insert the footage from the first time i gave these to my dog so they could try it i like them because they're these little tiny mushy treats i was afraid they're going to be hard and my dogs don't really eat hard treats so these are chewy sit rose good girl good girl you like it gracie girl here you go yum belly bear she's the picky one she even took it are you gonna eat it are you gonna eat it she's taking it this one scarfed it down so did that one she's eating it that's amazing because she just ate that and she is my picky girl that like won't eat a lot of different things i'm gonna link everything down below and it's awesome because they gave me a discount code for you guys so if you use the code shaylee at checkout you can get 20 off i very first started trying cbd i was like wow this is kind of expensive but you have to think it's a self it's a form of self care you're really taking care of yourself it compounds in your body so like the longer you use it the more you feel the effects it might last me about a month maybe less because i'm going to be sharing it with danny because he also uses cbd oil so we might just order like two different flavors okay the second product that i know is going to totally help you with anxiety because i use it all the time is essential oils so the brand i like is called doterra if you've never heard of them you're probably living under a rock but anyways i will also link their website down below essential oils are so great for so many things but for anxiety i just feel like it's one of those instant gratification things so the most basic one i think for having anxious moments would be lavender because it's just so calming what i like to do is just put a couple drops in my hands rub them together and then just like breathe it in it's just like an instant calming effect i love it eucalyptus is another one i love i love putting this in my bath water if i'm just trying to have like a really calm zen bath i will i think i've shown you guys on a vlog i will just like make it the most calm environment in my bathroom i'll put spa music on i'll put these oils in the bathtub i just i'll put incense or candles on i love it and then another one i really wanted to mention was breathe you guys know this year we're dealing with a pandemic that attacks the respiratory system so i'm sure this has happened to you if you have anxiety you'll sit there and you'll think like oh my god can i breathe like do i have it i know it might sound crazy if you don't have anxiety and you're just randomly watching this video but if you have anxiety i know you know what i'm talking about i've literally laid in bed and been like oh my god can i breathe and i will freak myself out so i have used breathe and same thing you put in your hands i don't want to put a ton more oil in my hand but you just breathe it in and it's just like great to help you breathe anytime but especially when we're dealing with what we're dealing with this year so that is number two essential oils okay so you've already taken your cbd oil for the day you've already smelled in these essential oils to help calm you now we're gonna make a calming drink sometimes when i have anxiety just like doing something that's mindless you know like making a fun pretty drink can kind of just take you out for a minute too like take your brain to a positive space if it's like daytime i'll just do tea with some lemon in it i like lots of different teas but for night this is my absolute favorite i've talked about this a ton on instagram it's called this is basically an anti-stress drink is what it says on the front and it is a magnesium supplement so if you get like cramping and stuff it's great for that too this is the flavor raspberry lemon it also comes in an unflavored option but i like the raspberry lemon a lot i'll even add some lemon wedges into it to just make it a little bit stronger lemony pop my little electric kettle on get a coffee mug and i put like a teaspoon of this maybe a little bit more and pour my hot water in there and then like i said i add a lemon wedge it is so good everyone in my family is so into it like danny's into it emily and sean my sister and brother-in-law when they come stay with us it's like a nightly thing like we make four cups of calm and everyone drinks it it's delicious you can get this on amazon so the fourth thing is this little guy and i don't know what he's actually called but he is a projector and he puts stars up on the ceiling in your room so i like to plug him in at night time and you can pick different colors you can pick different there's different settings when you click the link to go see this on amazon it'll show you pictures i like the color blue and i will put it on the one that has the stars going in and out like in brightness because it's just like a visual thing that helps calm me down i like to watch the stars like come in and come out if you have anxiety another thing that people tell you to do is like what can you see what can you smell like when you're having a really anxious moment you need to focus on something so for me that's one visual thing i like to do when i'm anxious is just like watch the stars i don't know if that sounds weird but it just it's so reminiscent too of being a kid that i think that nostalgia calms me down because don't you guys remember when you were little the little mobiles or what are they called like they were little projectors i had one that would put butterflies um around in my room so this just kind of takes me back i think it's kind of weird maybe if you're an adult having this in your room but i don't care i love it and i also love it because it's a bluetooth speaker so i'll put like calming music on my phone like waves or um you know spa music and you can hook it up so it's not right there next to you at your bed table it's across the room where i plug this in so that's why i love this so much okay last but definitely not least is this guy and i'm so sorry if it has dog hair on it it's the life i live here with three dogs but this is a weighted blanket and i found mine at walmart this is actually danny's i bought it for danny like two years ago and we use it all the time it's pretty small it's not like a full blanket like a comforter it's just a blanket so you can sit on the couch with it or we just drape it across the two of us on the top section of us and it just makes you feel like you're being cuddled and ours is 12 pounds i really wouldn't suggest going any bigger than that because or heavier than that rather because then i feel like it would do the opposite like if i couldn't move i feel like that would give me anxiety so i feel like 12 pounds is perfect i don't know how that works if it's a bigger blanket if you'd have to go up and wait but maybe just start around there i am telling you guys if you take some cbd oil smell in some essential oils take a drink of kong put on that starry night projector and lay with that blanket you cannot tell me your anxiety won't at least be a little bit better so i really hope you enjoyed this video please before you

notifications whenever we post a new video thanks for watching", "hjA1Cn9o6oo": "[Music] hi we are talking today about skin care specifically as it relates to both psoriasis and something called keratosis polaris also known as kp now you all know i am a pilates teacher i'm a physical therapist i am not a dermatologist at all i'm giving you this information because i personally was diagnosed with psoriasis over 10 years ago i know what it's like to suffer through that and then our beautiful daughter was born with kp she is almost 8 now so i've spent the better part of a decade trying to research and find natural products things that i can buy over the counter talk to dermatologists on how we can manage both of those things in our household so that's where i'm coming from with this i'm going to tell you the products we have found that we really like that work i can tell you some of the things that i have tried that don't work and i can tell you when i have gone to a dermatologist to get medication because there's definitely times i've had to do that as well and then at the end i'll tell you how we use all of them in a daily routine that works for us i have found that for both of those conditions psoriasis and kp it's a very similar routine even though they have different mechanisms on how they work as a skin condition so it's really nice that we can actually use the same thing so i'll go through that i can't tell you if it helps rosacea eczema those kind of things feel free to leave it in the comments someone else might be able to help you with those but i can't comment on those because i have never dealt with them personally this is just my experience okay so we're going to start with the most mild and then we're going to move to probably the least mild of the products that we have used so for psoriasis just to keep in mind it is characterized by what they call scales or plaques it gets really itchy the skin can dry into these scales and then sometimes they'll fall off it's very different than dandruff go to a doctor if you aren't sure that's how i was diagnosed finally i did kind of figure it out on myself but i was diagnosed by a dermatologist for me i get it the most on the back of my scalp here so that'll be a little different because there's shampoo options so back of my scalp sometimes my earlobes and then i have had one really bad case on my face a few years ago and that is when i went to the doctor and got medicine right away it hurt it was itchy it was red it was bad and it was gone within a week with medication so there are going to be times that you are going to want to go that route i am talking today about the things that you can use at home that we use to help us manage things kp i can tell you is characterized they call it chicken skin our daughter was born with it both of these conditions are incurable there's not a cure for them it's again something that you want to manage many times with kids um the research shows that it can be gone by the age of 30. i know it isn't always but for many it is it's what the literature says so it's characterized by bumpy skin um sometimes it can get itchy in our daughter with her it's worse in the heat so in the summer when she's sweating a lot it gets worse but typically it's upper arms thighs and face and again it's just bumpy skin 99 of the time it doesn't bother her whatsoever and so i'm the one right as a mom telling her we're going to do these things to help manage it so let me tell you what we use all right so these are the products that we have found that we like that i keep here at the house one of the most important things that you can do to keep yourself and your skin healthy is to stay hydrated and i personally know how hard that can actually be i have great aspirations every morning to drink my water and by the end of the day i feel like i've never had enough built boost actually helps me hydrate myself it is a powder that you put in 16 ounces of water it's delicious and it's full of vitamins that i need vitamin b vitamin c so it helps boost my immune system it also has echinacea and it gives me natural energy so i don't crash i feel good and i know i'm staying hydrated my friends at built boost have offered you a coupon use code volant20 v-a-l-a-n-t 20 to get 20 off your order and the link is below so i'm going to tell you first kind of like i said the most mild and i'm going to show you both of these coconut oil and shea butter i'm going to start with coconut oil so when i first started researching this years and years ago coconut oil wasn't coming up very much but i knew it was something that worked well on skin from other research and things i had tried and things i had done so i used it first on myself on my scalp and found that it actually worked pretty well and then what i did is i ended up mixing it with some shea butter because with both kp and psoriasis one of the things is you want to keep it moisturized okay that's what it needs with the psoriasis specifically what happens is you keep it moisturized when you're in a flare and it can help the plaques come off that scaly stuff come off so what i find that i would do is use the coconut oil again on the back both on my earlobes when they were really itchy and dry and they hurt and then also on the back of my scalp i would put it on on the in the morning on the day that i'm gonna wash my hair that night because it is oily it's something to keep in mind i know so we have to work around these things so i put it on the back of my scalp in the morning it would help some of those plaques come off it would calm the itching down and then that night i would wash my hair i would wait a couple days and do it again and then what ended up working really well for me was i would mix one part coconut oil with one part shea butter because this is less oily this is a great natural moisturizer and so i would keep that just in a little tub that i made myself again half and half it's shelf stable so i would just keep it in with my skin care stuff and i would use it again sometimes at night on the back of my scalp and sleep that way on my face on my earlobes and that was my first foray my first step into trying to kind of deal with it naturally and that worked really well and i still use this and i think it's great on kids as well okay so this is something that if my daughter was six months old i would be happy to rub coconut oil on her skin to help because what you're trying to do is soften up those bumps okay so these are two things that i found are really really helpful for me now one other thing and i don't have it here to show you but something that i have found in the last year that i adore and use a lot is cbd sav okay so cbd and the sav is a rub basically it's not lotion it's actually called sav s-a-l-v-e and it is great for skin i have found it personally and again there's also some cases out there that show that it can be really good for skin conditions i have now used that a little bit more than the coconut oil so i will use them both and interchange them especially again on the back of my scalp but that cbd salve has been a life changer for me just on managing when it's itchy when it's bothering me it also is something i feel comfortable using on my seven-year-old again it's topical you guys cbd sav has no marijuana properties whatsoever in it so don't worry about that you can go do your research on it but um it's something that'll rub in and can help so i use that mostly on myself occasionally i have used it on her arms but mostly on myself and it's something that i really have had good results with okay so let's move now into something called kp away so i want to talk a little bit about age so those like i said are the most mild things that i have that i would be comfortable if my daughter was six months old putting those on her body she is now almost eight so we're at a point we're trying to you know find some things she can do for herself and manage it and that we can both kind of use so this is something i found recently we're halfway through this it's called kp away and it's kind of something i found that's called a cult favorite so we're going through the whole tub and so i can't tell you whether it's something that really has had great results or not because they say to use the whole tub about 90 days use it before you see results but a lot of parents say they're seeing great results with this i like it because it is free of all the stuff out there i don't want on her body so that is something that's been hard for me to find it's important to me to have products that do not have parabens in them that do not have sulfates in them you want things that don't have fragrance if you can help it you want the most mild sensitive things that you can find for both skin conditions and there's a lot of reasons i don't want parabens in our bodies so i find things that don't have parabens for our family but at the same time it's hard to find things that then have the added ingredients and properties that we need for these skin conditions so kpoa doesn't have any of that yucky stuff in it it has water it has coconut oil it has um emulsifying wax in it it has things that are meant to keep the skin moisturized and it's just a white lotion i don't know if you can see inside it's just a white lotion and it's nice because it's less oily than the coconut oil so one thing i will tell you is a lot of these things are going to feel like the coconut oil they're going to feel oily i don't like it either but i can deal with it and i'm an adult kids not so much at least my kid first off i'm not gonna load her up with oil in the morning on her body and have her rub it all over our furniture and two bless her heart our kids sometimes are sensitive with what goes on their bodies and their skin right so this is nice because it's a lit it's a thick lotion but it does rub in which is really important to me when it comes to her doing it on her own and us doing it every day so we do it in the morning and we do it at night right after bath or shower and again it's called kp away and it's kp it's specifically formulated for keratosis polaris and i have really liked it so far okay so that is one that i do like now i'm going to start one more mild one this is what we use on our daughter's face so it's actually neutrogena ultra gentle it is paraben free which is nice not all neutrogena products are so i found this one specific i have tried some other face washes i haven't liked as much this one i do really like again it's something she can use on her own or i can use for her when i'm helping her super gentle it's not specifically for kp necessarily but when you are looking at face wash or body wash you want the most gentle least stringent possible okay so that's what i use for her on her face now we're going to go into the things that are a little less gentle because if you've done some research you have probably read about salicylic acid for both of these conditions psoriasis and kp especially so salicylic acid or alpha hydroxy acid or urea sometimes they'll talk about those three things those are all meant to slough off dead skin cells which again with the plaques with psoriasis with kp that can help get to the skin below and then you can moisturize and help that which can help the bumps so salicylic acid again what i have found in my research is that they you don't want to give it to kids under the age of two i personally was not comfortable giving it to our daughter until she was about six okay and let me tell you why if you are a woman who's ever used a serum with alpha hydroxy acid in it and let's say you've put that serum on with possibly a sunburnt face you know how much that can burn because it's actually doing things to your cells it's sloughing off the dead skin cells so imagine doing that to a young child who has sensitive skin already if they don't have the words to tell you that it's hurting then they can't give you that feedback so i knowing what it feels like myself to put it on i was not comfortable giving it to her till she was six until i could get that verbal feedback from her on how it felt so i that was my personal choice again i have read things out there that say you can do it after the age of two i personally didn't want to do it until she was a little bit older than that but salicylic acid i have found really good results for me personally with the psoriasis i have seen good results with our daughter with the kp using products with salicylic acid in it so let me show you one of them that i really like it's a brand called touch this is kp exfoliating lotion it has 12 glycolic acid and 2 salicylic acid touch was actually a brand developed specifically for kp and they've expanded a little bit but it was specifically developed for that has no parabens it has parabens it has no sulfates it has none of that stuff in it and so it's a brand i can trust it's easy to access all of this is really affordable and so this is a brand that i do like we're using their lotion right now it does have the salicylic acid in it so let me tell you what i do this is my mama hint if you have a child with kp who either doesn't like the oil on them or doesn't like to put on lotion or if they're are sensitive and they just don't want anything that might burn a little bit which again salicylic acid will so try it on yourself first one hint try it on yourself first you should know how it feels second try it on them when they're awake let them give you some feedback and if you blow on it right away after you put it on it makes it feel a lot better and it's gone within 30 seconds okay but something to keep in mind but what i typically do is i'll use this for her just once or twice a week i don't use it every day once or twice a week and i go in an hour after she's asleep and i rub it into her face and her upper arms when she's asleep our daughter sleeps really deeply she doesn't wake up she doesn't have to worry about the lotiony feel or the oily feel at all and it can take all night to seep into her skin it doesn't bother her that is how i make some of this work but again try it on them when they're awake get feedback you want to make sure that you're treating your child in a way that they will feel empowered with this that's what i'm working with i know it's hard but i want her to feel empowered about it um okay so that's touch like i said i do really like that and then we're gonna get into two more that i use only for myself i don't use for her i mentioned shampoo because that is where my psoriasis bothers me the most in the back of my scalp here in the bottom so again neutrogena makes two shampoos that are really good one is t sal and that has salicylic acid in it this is actually coal tar believe it or not coal tar is one of the things that can help psoriasis on the scalp and i use it just once a week if i feel it coming on use it once a week you put it on in the shower the directions are here you leave it for five minutes i just put it right here and then i rinse it out and then i wash my whole head with my normal shampoo this stinks to high heaven i will tell you it smells so bad um but once you use your normal shampoo it's kind of okay and it works really well but i only use it once a week if i'm kind of in a flare okay last one you guys are doing great for sticking with me here this is amlactin i don't not know how i stumbled upon this but somehow i did back when i was having one of my worst flares with psoriasis and i swear by it and i keep one in the house at all times now i only use it once a week on my own face because it does have parabens and i don't like that at all parabens are preservatives they're not good but this has worked so well for me to manage again what's on my face that i am just going to use it once a week even once every two weeks it's called amlactin this is the ultra soothing and it does have the alpha hydroxy acid in it okay but i only use it on my face so let me review how we actually use these keeping in mind that kp can be there all the time it might go away as they age my daughter's has definitely decreased as she ages again i'm doing this mostly so that she as she learns about hygiene and how to manage things on her own that she can just feel empowered and make decisions for herself on whether she wants to use things or not i want to really find health what i feel like are healthy products that can help and have them there for her if she wants them and then psoriasis really comes in flares it can go into remission and come back personally i find it gets worse in times of stress it can get worse if i eat a lot of sugar for a long period of time those things kind of things really flare up my psoriasis so i'm in a very much a management stage for it right now so on a daily basis for our daughter we use the kp away every morning every night on her face on her body we use the neutrogena face wash morning and night that's what i use every day that's the basic for her and then i will use the touch on her face and her arms once or twice a week and again typically i just go in and put it on her face and her arms when she's asleep um sometimes she'll let me do it after the shower so that's just once or twice a week i do that okay so that's what i do for her and then for myself i'm using the amlactin as my night lotion once a week maybe or once every two weeks that's a management for my face i use the t-gel shampoo once a week or once every two weeks again just for management on the back of my head here and then i am using the cbd salve again if i start to feel a flare-up come on i use the cbd salve and some coconut oil mixed on the back of my scalp here or wherever it flares up ears back of my scalp and i'll put it on in the morning and kind of reapply throughout the day i tend to do it on a day i'm at home more i just try to keep it really moist as the plaques come off i'll peel them off and then that night i wash my hair like usual and i will do that for like a three week period maybe every other day or every two days on the days i wash my hair that's what i do to really help if i find a flare-up coming up and then finally see a dermatologist as needed don't suffer through it i am someone who just feels sometimes like i should just be able to handle things naturally and sometimes you just can't there's no reason to suffer through things when i do go i actually have a backup of a medicated shampoo that i keep if i get into a bad flare it's here if i need it she's just given it to me and said this has used helped you in the past keep it if you need it so i have it upstairs just in case i ever need it and if i ever do get a flare up like i've had on my face before i will be there in a heartbeat to get medication to help it calm down that was a lot of information i just gave you i hope it does help i hope it shows you that you have some options that you can try different things and if they don't work move on to something else i know what it's like to have to deal with these skin conditions i also know that there are tools out there that we can use to help manage them don't be afraid to see a doctor and find someone who will listen to you and your needs throughout all of this and thanks for being here and i'll see you next time", "ye-aKzqj5so": "what's going on everyone my name is chris here at CBD review lab and today i'm reviewing ananda hemp's 600 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil so ananda hemp is part of the australian genetic development company if ago fiber which has over 20 years of hemp growing and breeding experience with over 300 acres of hemp from over 25 countries the seeds from echo fibers hint plants are transferred to the states to Kentucky and distributed to contracted farmers to be grown without pesticides or harmful chemicals and from these plants we get some high-quality a CBD oil which is continuously tested every step of the process from seed to plant to oil so by the time the product reaches the consumer it's been tested at least three times for potency containment incident equality and just in terms of quality control I don't think I've ever seen a company this meticulous and they actually even go a step further by providing individual batch numbers to see the exact certificate of analysis of the product in your hands so their oil has a golden appearance to it with a little bit of a grain and it has a faint botanical smell and taste to it effect wise I was pleasantly surprised with this product considering it's only 600 milligrams I started out with one milliliter dropper which is 20 milligrams of CBD the effects were subtle but I definitely felt it and the effects obviously increased with the more you take I've taken a couple sixty milligram doses and the effects are exactly what I look for high-quality CBD product in my opinion this is a great option for someone who's never tried CBD before price-wise it runs $90 but if you use the coupon code CBD review lab it'll bring it down to eighty one dollars Ananda hemp also offers a 2,000 milligram CBD oil which I hope to get my hands on one of these days so overall Ananda hemp is a solid CBD company that offers a high quality product so if you were thinking about trying them out but we're on the fence on whether or not they were legit you can have some peace of mind knowing they are so I hope this video was helpful if you have any questions about Ananda hemp or CBD in general please don't hesitate to leave them down below I'm very responsive and I'm happy to answer any questions so thank you so much for watching hope everyone has a great day peace this is moose", "-dHxOA0moCk": "YOURSELF YOURSELF LESSON YOURSELF LESSON AT YOURSELF LESSON AT THE

is dedicated to healthcare information as well as pharmacy stuff so feel free to hit that subscribe button if this is something that you find interesting or useful today we'll be reviewing the medication gabapentin we will be taking a look at what it is its uses the dosing some side effects as well as some precautions to take into account if you are taking up a Penton or if you are considering it just a little disclaimer before we start this video is for informational purposes only and it's not intended to be a substitute for medical advice from your physician please continue to follow any specific instructions provided to you by your local healthcare provider or providers it so gabapentin is a prescription medication that is available either as a tablet a capsule or solution it is marketed under the brand name neurontin or horizontal or growl eyes org release as some people prefer to call it and it is available either as an immediate release tablet or capsule or an extended release formulation the two approved uses of gabapentin are firstly as an adjunct in the treatment of management of partial seizures and what an adjunct means is that they're by painting by itself may not be used to treat partial seizures but it may be used in conjunction with other medications the second use of gabapentin our fda approved use is in the treatment of post-apartheid inner algea this is a condition where there is a lot of pain due to damaged nerves which results as a complication of shingles so sometimes when somebody gets shingles the person may be healed there rushes disappear and everything but there's been some damage to the nerves and this causes pain gabapentin is used to manage that kind of pain interestingly one of the most common uses of gabapentin which is the management of that a peripheral neuropathy is actually not an fda-approved use it is basically an off-label use and what off-label uses of medications are that the medication was not necessarily studied for that condition but over the years they realized that it actually helps in that condition and based on the doctors experience he be prescribed it for that particular condition off-label uses of gabapentin or non-fda-approved uses include fibromyalgia hot sweats and sometimes even I said pre-emptive therapy in acute post-operative pain so they figure out that this person has had a procedure they're gonna be in pain preemptively they may give gabapentin to prevent the pain from occurring in the first place other off-label uses include in the management of hot flashes due to menopause it may also be used in the management of pruritus which basically is itching it can be used also in restless leg syndrome in single toes which is just a fancy name for hiccups as well as alcohol dependence with respect to dosing the extended-release formulations like relies may be given once a day while the immediate release preparations are usually divided throughout the day usually maybe two or three times a day the dose is usually capped around 3,600 milligrams because beyond that you start increasing the incidence of adverse reactions and as well as there is really no proof that beyond three thousand six hundred milligrams you get any additional benefit it is also not uncommon to see that those titrated gradually upwards so say somebody will start with a hundred milligrams at night and then gradually over a period of time as in us depending on how well the person tolerates the medication that doctor be titrated upwards until they desired therapeutic dose next we will tackle some side effects side effects include dizziness which occurs in about 28 percent of the adult population across 17 percent of and about 3% of pediatrics so we're talking about approximately one in three adults experience some kind of dissonance while they take gabapentin others include somnolence which is also predominantly in adults about 21% hypoglycemia has also been observed there are also a host of psychiatric side effects which are usually experienced in the pediatric population this include hostile behavior hyperactivity mood swings and sometimes disturbance in thoughts and like I said this usually occurs with the kids and the occurrence rate is around about 5% of the pediatric population which leads us to the next big one which is suicide ideations some people tend to have suicidal thoughts and I'll talk a little bit more than that when I deal with precautions other side effects include peripheral edema which is accumulation of fluid in the usually the lower extremities we also have the usual suspects nausea and/or vomiting and also some people may experience fatigue or lethargy another common side effects is ataxia ataxia is the condition that mimics being drunk in there is slurred speech that stumbling that's falling and for the most part there's a lot of in coordination some people may also experience breathing problems which I'm going to address more when I talk about the precautions now moving on to the precautions and the very first one that I want to mention is the ability of gabapentin to cause suicidal thoughts typically this happens in pediatrics or kids but it is definitely not completely absent in adults so it is definitely worth taking a load off especially if you are a parent of a child that is taking it to keep a close eye and you as an adult also it's definitely recommended that if you see any kind of mood changes you you have to seek help it is estimated at about one in every 500 people that take gabapentin may experience this obviously to varying degrees the second precaution retrospect together anything is to note that it has the potential to be habit-forming it actually has the potential for abuse as a result a lot of the states if you are watching this here in the United States though it is not a federally controlled substance a lot of the states are pushing to make it a control substance just for that reason and in one of the states where I'm licensed now in Virginia I know for sure that gabapentin is not a controlled substance so that is something definitely to be worried of whenever you start taking gabapentin thirdly it is recommended not to discontinue gabapentin abruptly anytime you want to go of gabapentin do you want to work with your doctor or your healthcare provider because they will most likely taper you off especially if you are taking it to prevent seizures may result in a condition called status epilepticus where you have continuous seizures so that is something to be very careful about not to discontinue gabapentin abruptly or as we say don't stop it Coulter also as recently as December of 2019 that's just a couple of months ago depending on when you are watching this video the FDA came out to put out a specific warning about gabapentin affecting the breathing of people who are already at risk of breathing problems such people include people that take other opioid medications concurrently or any kind of medication that affects the central nervous system as well as people who have COPD for such people definitely work with your doctor they may be some dose adjustment needed or they may be you know some way forward so that you don't find yourself in a situation where you have breathing difficulties due to taking gabapentin I'll put a link to that specific warning from the FDA in the description below so if you care to read about the whole thing it gives a whole lot of guidelines what to do what not to do so that's gonna be in the description below now if you become pregnant while taking gabapentin would be a good idea to talk to your health care provider about registering with the north American antiepileptic drug pregnancy registry this is a registry that is set up to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs you know you're in pregnancy so it's free to join you there's a lot of information there I'll put a link to the website in the description below as well if you are interested there's also a phone number I'll put a phone number there as well so you can check it out so that's a high-level overview of gabapentin feel free to leave your experiences in the comments below if you have any and as always thank you for staying through please subscribe to support this channel thank you so much

ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "5KflhpfYzvQ": "your testimonials on your website these things run the gamut you know you have it treating sports injuries chronic back pain cancer radiation burns acne you're talking about circulatory issues you know especially for the for the folks out there tell us the science how do these oils and lotions work you know especially for such a wide variety of issues so my understanding of it which is limited because there hasn't been enough studies yet and I can't wait to learn more about how these actually work but my understanding of it is that the cannabinoids respond to your peripheral nervous system your you have an endocannabinoid system which we as humans have this yeah every human has an endocannabinoid system and it's kind of a regulatory homeostasis system and there's two kinds of receptors there's cb1 receptors which are in your brain and those are the ones that mostly respond to THC and that will give you these psychedelic or a psychoactive you know experience and then you've got the cb2 receptors which are found in your peripheral nervous system and they deal with you injure yourself or you if you have pain they will interact with either your own natural endocannabinoids that your body produces or cannabinoids from cannabis so the topical seem to work with responding to the cb2 receptors in your peripheral nervous system the THC doesn't act actually go into the blood I'm pretty sure I've done like a bunch of drug tests on yeah at least for now is that you're not going to fail a drug test you're going to feel psychoactive effects yeah and so people typically don't feel any sort of psychoactive effect it doesn't seem to get into your blood system it just seems to interact with these cb2 receptors so dealing with the issue right where you put the SAP or the topical on the skin and these cb2 receptors will help the healing response and will help bring your body back to homeostasis once they connect you know with the cannabinoids", "go6Mbe_bMu0": "i was eating close to 600 milligrams a night and i ain't [ __ ] kidding you when i ain't [ __ ] kidding you you could get lee on the [ __ ] phone we were popping those things i know i was he would laugh at me i don't know how

like the cheese is gone the ham is gone chips are gone you know i don't drink soda thank god i don't eat cake or cookies nothing like that i just eat [ __ ] food dang [ __ ] god man but last night was a very weird night because i went to bed early you know like 10 30 quarter to 11 i had to be when i went to [ __ ] bed and i woke up like at 4 30. i didn't have to pee or anything i just woke up i laid there for about seven eight minutes and i was like man maybe i'll just get up go downstairs ride a little bit maybe take a two more droplets of the cbd maybe two more droplets of the uh the kikimo tincture and i'll go back to bed but i go [ __ ] i gotta do the podcast early i gotta get up i don't want to be [ __ ] sleepy for mike or [ __ ] up for mike you know i wanna be as good as i could be on these things so i said [ __ ] it i'll just uh try to fall back to sleep on my own and i got comfortable whatever i laid down and it wasn't happening and my mind started thinking about stuff you know like that's the natural i didn't want to get up and something hit me something hit me that hadn't hit me in a long time that feeling i had that little feeling i've been having the last maybe two weeks because i i tell you that this goes on in like two week increments you know like for the last eight weeks i felt different the last two weeks you know so when from august 19 to september 1st when i moved into my house i had a weird feeling and then from september 1st to maybe the 15th it took me that long to get rid of that full-time anxiety and then from the 15th of september to october 1st maybe the fear decimated a little bit i got to fear out you know i started accepting that you know the church wasn't happening i started missing lee i started accepting a lot of things by beginning of october and then you know thank god for mike he called me because i'm ready to go and we started doing this and i progressed fantastically this month but something else happened uh the last two weeks you know i mean listen my buddy died my sister-in-law died my wife is walking with a [ __ ] uh thing on her foot she broke during the [ __ ] pandemic my wife was playing whatever the [ __ ] not tennis but the other [ __ ] with mercy and she stepped wrong and she thought there was something wrong with her foot and she just came back yesterday with the doctor with a [ __ ] thing on her foot she's limping around she's gotta wear it for like a month so yeah listen it's life bad things are gonna happen and you're gonna react to them you know i miss my my buddy i miss my sister-in-law you know i see what my brother's going through i see what a lot of people are going through i mean i'm going to tell you something guys that i'm going to be strictly honest with you i'm gonna tell you how hard it is on people right now financially this is the first time in my life and i'm not talking about it being hard on me i'm talking about me trying you know helping people and whatever this is the first time in my life if you want i'll show mike just to prove it to you that i got 100 on my paypal this is the first time in since i've had paypal that i've had like 52 in there because people are going through a hard time i usually have you know 600 500 400 people buy cds you know whatever [ __ ] like that this is the first time i got under 100 bucks because people are [ __ ] hurting people need money people don't know what their name you know people are moving in i mean maybe you're not going through it whatever but you have to be you know drive up and down your streets you know businesses are going out people aren't working the full amounts you know and and the holidays are gonna be rough on some people this is rough you know we're not playing [ __ ] games here you know people needed help and whatnot but this morning when i was laying there in bed i didn't want to get up i didn't have to pee but i thought about what this latest feeling was that i had that was in me and the feeling was happiness the last two weeks i ever since mercy's been going to school for days listen i was happy when she was going to school two days a week because we were still covering the spread around the house there's still tons of stuff to do our neighbors are great people our neighbors around the corner are great people the florentines are a great family i still had a great support system but uh this morning i finally came to the conclusion like i remember even smiling in bed like i just smiling going i can't remember the last time i was this complete like this

how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope

those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips

enjoyed the video hit that like hit the like", "Knfl49kyAOQ": "hi it's Matt at Ruth's house studios and welcome to counter basics today we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused a body lotion for moisturizing your skin and also for pain relief also very happy to announce that we have a new scripted comedy series coming up called higher beings please stick around to the end of the video and learn how you can support that project on IndieGoGo now let's get started here's what you need to make cannabis infused body lotion you need a quarter cup of cannabis infused cocoa butter 1/4 cup of shea butter 1/4 cup of coconut oil 1/4 cup of light oils such as light olive oil and you also need 10 to 20 drops of essential oils for flavoring such as lemon oil mint tea tree oil eucalyptus you can also use some infused coconut oil and place of the cocoa butter in this recipe and then you could also use oil that's been infused with the herbal infuser and you can save $30 on the air blown fuse with a code ruffhouse at herbal infuser calm now let's talk a little about how you can infuse the actual cocoa butter now we've done this recipe a couple of times recently so but I'm gonna go over it real briefly again but basically you grind your cannabis and in this case you don't actually have to decarbonize effects it's time for the other cannabinoids that are in the cannabis and you do not have to actually activate this and you can do some research to find which level of activation you might need to relieve the certain type of pain that you have too but for this case you don't actually have to decarboxylate or activate your cannabis and then you're going to infuse the oil for about one to two hours and when you're done the cocoa butter is going to be a lot darker and if you let it harden it'll harden back up and it melts very easily on your skin temperatures enough to melt it and you can see there it's it's very slick oil and it's I got a lot of moisturizing value for your skin so that's where we're going to be using for a basis for our oil so whether that's melted or not if you just made it and it still melted you you don't really need to melt it anymore but we're gonna go ahead and put that in a heat safe dish that you can put into a double boiler you could use like a canning jar there and we're not gonna actually boil the water we're just barely keeping it just under the it's gonna board just with a little bubble start to go and like I said you could also use cannabis infused coconut oil if you would rather use that instead of infusing the cocoa butter so it's up to you which one of those you infuse or you could infuse both if you want a really really strong but it being so this is not something edible it probably is a waste to try to make it too strong because you're not really going for the THC and you might also use a strong CBD strain or another kind of strain for this depending on your needs for this kind of lotion ok we're also going to take the shea butter and we're taking the other light oil that we're using in this case we're using olive oil a light olive oil and we're combining all of the other ingredients except for the essential oils into our double boiler or into our heat proof dish inside of a hot water bath until it's all melted and once it's all melted and combined you can take that and switch it into a mixing bowl it's gonna be large enough to use a hand and executed and then at that point you can also as the oil is cooling and cooled off a little bit you can add in your essential oils and in this case it's up to you if you add any oils because you could just leave it as it is and it'll have a slightly chocolaty smell because of the cocoa butter but this part is definitely up to your preferences and also for what you use you're using it for if you're using it as an everyday moisturizer you probably don't want to make it very strong smelling or it's gonna overpower your perfume or cologne or whatever or just be overpowering in general but if you're making it for medicinal purposes you might use a lot of mint or eucalyptus or the things that would give it that minty or that medicinal feel and now you're going to put it in the refrigerator for just a few minutes until the bowl gets cold or whatever and you start to see that it's just beginning to thicken a little bit so just when the the viscosity starts to thicken some and that's when you're gonna do this step here and that is to take your hand mixer on high and just keep mixing and mixing as you're whipping in air it's gonna turn lighter and lighter and you do that for three or four minutes until it quits turning lighter and by that time it'll be finished and then you put it back in the refrigerator to harden and then at that point you could also pour it into a containers because it'd be a lot easier while it's still a liquid and then after it hardens and sets in refrigerator you bring it out of the refrigerator at at room temperature it becomes a very soft subtle lotion that you can rub into your skin very easily it really has no real expiration date as long as you keep it sealed keep it out of the light and it's great for pain relief as well it helped me with my psoriasis on the bottom of my foot with a moisture so check that out also check out higher beings this is a new project I'm really excited about and if you're really interested you could help us support that by checking out Andy gogo I'll put links in the description and on the screen here so please check that out it's a new scripted comedy series

o'clock see if i feel anything alright", "L0UpRHIowog": "[Music] hi welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back I really appreciate your support it does mean the world to me and it's growing and growing I'm so excited I like Wow but anyway so today I'm going to show you two how to do a topical for pain relief using an infused coconut oil and some hocus pocus and to know some essential oils and that put together and this stuff works amazing I use it all the time now I absolutely love it I have a rare genetic disorder called ehlers-danlos syndrome and it's a connective tissue disorder which my body doesn't produce collagen so as my tendons and ligaments stretch out they don't go back so all of my joints are very very loose and although my muscles are constantly sore because they're constantly fighting to hold my joints in place so yeah it's a whole thing but anyway so I've used this and it has been great for inflammation my shoulders and everything so I really wanted to show you how to do it and I hope you do get the sigh of relief from it as well so um I don't think I have anything else to go there I'm gonna get into the as I normally do I'm gonna get into the ingredients and then the directions on how to do it alright well thank you for joining me so these are bombs that I made up earlier so this one is like a bomb like a waxy bomb and this one when we whip it chill it and whip it and multiply it it ends up a lighter or a lighter feel and a lighter texture so it all depends on your preference on what you what you like on your skin I tend to use both so what you're going to need for this is two tablespoons of your infused coconut oil 2 ounces of cocoa butter and you want it to be unrep yer 100% pure unrefined cocoa butter so you don't want anything done to it you want to pure unrefined same thing with the shea butter it's going to be 1 ounce of shea butter and you're use all-natural raw unrefined two tablespoons of all natural beeswax pellets and then we're going to get into our essential oils so for tumeric which is great for the anti-inflammatory as well and so tumeric you can get in a tincture which I've got here you can use it in its spice form but if you use it in its spice form it will be kind of gritty you can also get it in an essential oil unfortunately don't have the essential oil and you can also get it in capsules and it is still powdered form but it's really really fine so I like using this because you really don't feel it at all so that's what I use versus the versus the spice itself then the essential oils that I like to use and I put a list of the description of exactly what each of them do and you can choose which one's work best for you you can eliminate on any other choice you can just pick a few or all but I like this combination I found it works awesome for for inflammation so I've got the tumeric tincture I like I use spearmint eucalyptus lemongrass tea tree frankincense vetiver and lavender and the other thing you want to use is what's called a carrier oil and you could use grapeseed oil sweet almond oil castor oil I think avocado oil I believe is another one and what carrier oils do is you're gonna add your essential oils into the carrier oil before we add it in into our mixture and the reason is is essential oils can be very harsh on the skin and the first time I made it I figured well all this stuff's oily why do I need to add that so I just did it without it and it did I found it made me very itchy but when I add it to the grapeseed oil which they call as a carrier oil for them you I found that there I didn't have any itching at all so that is now what I do so I'll go over all those steps just a moment and then just for your equipment you're just gonna need a double boiler and you just want to use the potty Bowl that you're gonna be keep your stuff in and a spatula or a wooden spoon and also tapioca starch in is an option for you if you would like it helps to make it not so greasy so if you don't like a greasy feeling on your bombs or creams then you can looking at in the tapioca which I really like so depending on how much you can bury again it's I use about a quarter of a cup but again you can test it out and see what feels better for your skin oops yes I'm crushing all right so I'm just gonna get all this cleaned up and we'll put all of our ingredients together alright so the first thing you just set up your double boiler add your water it's important to make sure that the water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you can put that in and you're gonna set your heat to medium to medium-low higher higher to the medium side and we're gonna add in our two tablespoons of our infused coconut oil our two ounces of pure unrefined cocoa butter one ounce of shea butter and our two tablespoons of wax pellets beeswax pellets I use pure organic and you're gonna just kind of mix that in and wait for that to start melting and yeah it's not a whole lot to it so we're just gonna I said let that melt and have everything come together now it's very important do not turn up your heat you want to do it slowly it is very easy to burn any one of these components so you definitely want to melt it slowly over that medium-low heat as it begins to melt you just want to continue to mix periodically mix things so that you're bringing the heated stuff from the bottom up to the to the top and distributing the warm over the coal getting everything melted a little bit quicker and then while our little mixture a little concoction here is melting we can get our essential oils ready okay so you're gonna start with two tablespoons of your carrier oil whichever you decided I use grapeseed the grapeseed oil it's a good neutral good for all skin types it absorbs easily into the skin and yeah but as I said you can find maybe one that works better for your skin if you've got skin issues or yeah the sensitivity or things like that you may find one of the other ones that work better for you so you're gonna add two tablespoons of that and so it said this is my concoction you guys can said kind of do what works better for you this is what I put together that I said that I found really works great for inflammation and a little as well as a lot of my friends have tried it and it has worked really great so I use about one milliliter of the tumeric tincture and then I use one of the capsules of the 3050 milligrams of tumeric the one nice thing about using the capsules is you know exactly how much you're using you just open that up put that in and then I use spearmint as I said if you look in the description you'll find a full explanation to each the essential oils as to why I use them and I use about 20 drops of spearmint and eucalyptus is really good for your inflammation as well and muscle pain and I use about 30 drops of this and if anyone's really actually counting and there's a comment about oh there was 32 I don't want to hear it and lemongrass is awesome plus it smells really nice and again I use about 30 drops of this and then I use tea tree and the reason for the tea tree is it acts as a nice ant is an antiseptic so it takes care of any issues on your skin as well so it is it it helps like I said if it's got any kind of open lose or blemishes or things like that it will help us with that as well and being an antiseptic and I used about 15 drops of this and then ten drops of frankincense whoops that comes out quick stop's expensive too and the vet vetiver now this stuff is really really sick so it doesn't come out of the dropper we got to be very careful well I have to be careful most other people don't and I'm gonna use about ten drops of this and another good one for our skin although I don't like it I don't add it because I hate the smell of lavender but lavender is a great option as well it's a very relaxing and soothing for the muscles but as I said I don't like it don't really find much for me personally I'd anyway again personal option I hate the smell of lavender and then we're just gonna mix all those together now that all your butters and oils are melted here you're just gonna turn your heat down to low and you're just gonna leave it on for a bow we're gonna leave it on for about 20 minutes this is just to make sure everything comes up to the exact same temperature and everything is fully blended and melted together okay I apologize sorry my Stoner gapping move here the tumeric capsule if you use the capsules do not put it into the essential oils so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna just strain that out you're gonna use the capsule put the capsule into the into your shea butter and cocoa butter mixture so I'm just gonna fix that up here by watch it go straighter stop putting a piece of cheesecloth I doubled it up and applauding it into a small strainer all this stuff is very expensive so I don't want to waste it so now this isn't going to hurt the anything I'm just removing the chunks in there that we don't really want in a cream and then I'm going to add the capsule into the end of the oil okay so I'm going to add the tumeric capsule into the shea butter and cocoa butter and our beeswax that's where it's supposed to go and you just want to get a whisk a little whisk if you've got one and just whisk that in alright so our mixture has been sitting on the warm on the hot water there for about 20 minutes you're just gonna take it off and you're gonna let it sit on the counter until it cools down a little bit we don't want to add the essential oils when it's really hot because that will it'll burn off on the essential parts of the essential oils so we want to let that cool down a little bit before we're gonna add in the oils for about 5-10 minutes just check the bottom of your bowl if it's just warm to the touch then we're good but if it still feels hot wait a little bit so that feels good so now we're going to take a Nadder and add in our essential oils and you're gonna get a whisk and we're gonna whisk that in alright so here you got some options if you just want a waxy balm you can go ahead and pour it into your containers like this if you would like to take away some of the grease enos of it you can add in the tapioca starch so I'm gonna add in a quarter cup and you're gonna whisk that in again the tapioca is optional I like it though it makes it feel a lot nicer you just use a spatula to get anything off the sides I just continue to whisk whisk that until it is all known all all smooth sorry you want it nice and smooth like that so as I said if you just want to have a bomb then you can go ahead and pour it into your containers I'm gonna do a little bit of both I'm gonna do poor part one so the poor one is a bomb and then show you how to emulsify and make it a lighter texture so I'm just gonna pour the liquid just doesn't do it I'm just doing a bomb and I pour that let that set up and now you're just gonna let these you're gonna let this sit on the counter until it partially solidifies so we're going to wait for it to solidify about halfway and then we're going to start the beating process now this will solidify fairly quickly because of all of what the Watts that we have in it but less wax you use the longer it's going to take to to solidify now you can put it into the refrigerator to assist with it but it'll go fairly quickly like I said right now because we've got the wax up quite a bit of wax in there but if you do want to speed up the process you can definitely put it in the fridge for about three to five minutes but don't forget about it all right so you want your bomb now to be like this so you see how it's partially solidified here on the sides it's kind of solid but in the middle we're still liquidy and you're gonna get your hand mixer or blender or whisk you can use whoops and we are going to continue to mix this until it is all one homogeneous uniform factory [Music] all right so I'm just gonna let this sit again and let it solidify around the edges again and we're gonna repeat the process and each time we do you're gonna see the the product keep getting lighter and lighter all right so it's sort of quite a bit more on the sides there during your mixing process you can always test your bond to see how it feels and make sure that you like it for your texture so it's gonna be a lot more solid once it solidifies and sets however you want to see what it's actually gonna feel like just take a little bit rub it on the back of your hand and see how that feels so first it'll be a greasy L feel greasy but that tapioca you'll notice it'll start to nod not feel it and then you just want to work it in so it may be a little bit yellow on the skin but as you work it in that yellow will go away okay so I would just put it back into the freezer for about two minutes and I'm going to continue the process all right so you can see now that our pain balm is all one uniform texture we whatever we pull off the size is the exact same we're not getting any separation wax or anything like that and that's how you know that is fully blended there and it's gonna make a nice light bomb for you so now we're ready to pour it into our containers I just want to smack them down so they're nice and fun get out any air bubbles and that's it you can let them sit out on this counter for a couple of hours to fully set or you can put them into the fridge or the freezer to quicken that up and I'm gonna put these into the fridge probably for about a half an hour and then we'll all come back and we'll test it out right so my pain bombs here have set up and this was the one that I did just as wax and I didn't whip it up there and you can see it's darker my lighting is a little bit tough here to see it's pretty bright and then this one's a lot lighter so I said you can it'll just give you a little bit different texture totally up to you it's just a preference thing you're not gonna get any different benefits either way so we're just gonna give it a try here you see so you see how it goes on a little bit yellow and then you just work it in and there you go then you can see that grease enos it was first there at tapioca that's what takes that away so it just feels really nice on your skin as well and that's it so now you can make your own pain bombs at home without caught us thinking absolutely well not gonna lie it's a little bit expensive if you go with all those essential oils I highly recommend doing research on buying them your local if you go to your local health food store it's gonna cost you an absolute fortune I do recommend Amazon has great prices on essential oils a couple of things with regards to essential oils make sure that they are 100% essential oils and that they are pure that the other is that they're actually essential oils because you will also see essential oil fragrances and that is just extracting the fragrances from your different your different herbs and roots and same things so you want to make sure it's essential oils 100% pure and that's about all I can say with regards to that if you have any questions at all as always don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll always get back to you if you have anything else any suggestions or anything I'd love to hear from you other than that I hope you enjoyed the video and you have a wonderful rest of your day thanks for watching [Music]", "FymCTaaSMDY": "my name is Willie Christie and we're in the kitchen at civilized HQ down here in Venice Beach California we're in the kitchen today because we're going to make some DIY topicals this is going to be an infused topical infused with cannabis obviously doing topicals yourself gives you the freedom to choose you know the quality of flour you want the ratio of THC the CBD you want or other cannabinoids if they're present the scent you like the medium you like you may be vegan you may not want beeswax in your products so this just gives you all the control for the topical we're making today you're gonna need coconut oil shea butter flour cheesecloth a container to put it in and a stove and an oven Toodee carb and to infuse the oil with step one is going to be decarboxylate in your flour what decarboxylated does is it activates all the cannabinoids in the flour if you've ever eaten just raw flour you'll know that you don't get high from it it doesn't have the same effect as inedible versus when you cook it in a brownie per se that's when the psychoactivity starts happening and essentially all that does is remove a co2 molecule from the THCA and it becomes THC so today I've got some Henry's original ritual flour it's CBD flour which I really appreciate around 2530 dollars for this eight it's got 500 milligrams of CBD in there so let's get started so in order to decarboxylate your flour you're going to grind it up and put it in the oven I've got 3.5 grams here I think that's a good start for today you can do more you can do less just do your thing so here we're grinding up the flour this just increases the surface area it helps all the heat reach all the areas of a bud we've got our pile of flour we're just going to spread out a little bit we're gonna try our best to preserve the terpenes by cooking it at a lower temperature we're at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes so now we're putting it in the oven we've got our timer set and we'll check back in in 20 minutes all right so we've got our decarboxylated flour and the next step is putting that into our coconut oil so we got a cup of coconut oil we're gonna start simmering this we're gonna melt the coconut oil and start simmering the flour into it so right now I'm just getting the coconut oil down melting it so it's a liquid the last thing you want to do is burn off any cannabinoids keeping temperatures low and a very low slow simmer is gonna make sure that your cannabinoids are retained and chillin inside of the coconut oil because not only will it be weaker if not completely inactive it'll smell bad it'll taste bad if you're gonna eat it much more to the consistency that I like that's smooth smooth liquid so now that our coconut oil is melted it's clear and it's liquid and its pretty and it smells good we're gonna put our decarboxylated flour into the coconut oil you ready and this this is where the magic happens this is maybe the most important step this is the easiest step to mess up if you let any of this get too hot it's gonna be you're gonna be starting over which nobody wants to do so what I'm doing is just carefully monitoring this a little bit of movement is good that means that he is moving things around but as soon as you see bubbles or smoke or anything like that then it's too hot so patience is key we're gonna start the timer again for 20 minutes and we're just gonna simmer this it's been 20 minutes on the stove I've turned the heat off and we've got ourselves a hot hot little hot little pot of pot alright so the next step we're going to put the cheesecloth over this bowl in order to pour our cannabis in there or cannabis oil and all this cheesecloth is going to do is catch the flower and so we'll just be left with infused coconut oil [Music] so putting on these gloves really lets you get the rest of this oil squeeze out it's gonna be warm it's definitely warm but the gloves help and you're just gonna squeeze that little bit of oil out all right so we've got our coconut oil in our Bowl and our next step is going to be adding the essential oils and adding the shea butter to thicken it up and make it more of a topical I'm not one to put pure coconut oil on my skin some of you might so you can really just stop at this step if you just want to smell like weed and coconut oil these next couple steps are just to kind of make it more for your mom or more for your own personal touch or say you don't want to walk around smelling like a toasted cannabis plant so I'm adding our shea butter in there now so I am now going to put some essential oil in here hopefully that's too much because I love this smell yeah that smells good so I'm just gonna separate these into different jars one of my favorite things about using cannabis flower especially prepackaged cannabis flower is you can use the jar again this is what I'm going to store the topically [Music] very DIY usually you would want to use a funnel or a baster or maybe a pot with a lip that you can pour but you know you work with what you got okay so we've got three different jars they're all the same right now and if you're happy with how it smells if you just want to do one scent for yourself then that's it you're just gonna put these in the fridge and let them chill and once they're cool it's just as just like any other topical but today I'm just adding some more little lips so I've got some Jasmine essential oil put a couple drops and let's see if it's beautiful I think some bergamot oil would be real nice and this one one two three four stir it these little babies up make sure that oil is evenly distributed well the only thing left to do is cool it down here we are four little jars yeah that's it folks we've got our DIY topicals if you're already getting flour at a dispensary if you already live at home if you already cook for yourself it's really not too extreme to be able to put those two together and make yourself a nice little topical or lotion you can add whatever else you want aloe vera gel vitamin E anything else it's the choice is yours as as we say here your body your choice", "3vrcTHZakaw": "yes yes brothers and sisters out there how are we doing how are we doing yes yes it's me it's me it's the it's justin how are we doing out there we've got a little bit of a review for you people today it's a special one um the ninja's been out and about and um she's managed to get me one of these um i did take one of these on one of my earlier reviews it wasn't like this it was somebody's homemade one that they did um it didn't look like this at all the one i had was flat so obviously let me just show you a bit closer so this is obviously uh the millions rope or rope s milligrams okay so it's quite a high dosage um it's certainly the highest dosage i've had in a sweet up till now there's warnings all over it which is really good so you know the packaging is fantastic it is just like a normal commercial suite you'd have to be careful with this obviously if you had children in the ace or anything like that you'd have to make sure this was really really away from them it does say 18 plus on it it is quite clear that there's cannabis in it let me just read it for you so you know so for um medicinal use only or medical use only keep out a reach of children and and animals so yeah if you've got a dog or a cat they might eat it so yeah it says tear and share uk net weight 52 grams um this is the strawberry flavor so very very nice ingredients organic cane sugar corn syrup gelatin citric acid calories extract full strength that's what i was looking for um color red yellow yellow white beeswax and vegetable oil so yeah there's nothing in there which really sort of alarms me to be fair see all seems pretty kosher um g magic sweet so there you go guys if you've seen them well you must have seen them because at the minute um we get sort of offered more sweets than anything um it's obviously overtaking the market quite a bit at the minute and i would say looking at these products now would tell you that you are getting really really really close to legalization now just look at it look at how it's packaged like say you would not know that or distinguish that from a normal suite right you just wouldn't right so that to me tells me that the cogs are moving they're in movement right first of all i think we're better on [ __ ] bombs right so cheers people one laugh um i'm gonna be obviously making this video which will be the eating video the taste test we'll call it so we'll do the taste test on this video and then obviously after about 60 minutes it says 60 minutes on there which i know that's about right um obviously we'll have a look at the effects and see what it does so um it says there's eight there's eight um servings there um obviously i've got quite a high tolerance so i'm going to take about six servings all in one day all right cheers which would literally be the most of my i've taken in a suite although i took the fifo the other day which is fight a thousand milligrams that's a different catch [Music] [Music] still on the cheese don't judge me for it it's the only flavor i can get in a minute we have had a bit of star dog as well so um but yeah it is it's going a little bit scarce in a minute let's say we're getting more sweets than anything so which is good i'm fine with that give the lungs a little break for a little while right then we'll pop that out for a minute but as you guys know cheers right i think it's about time to uh crack this sweet open that okay so 800 milligrams here we go let's have a look at it first what's it look like can you get it out just [Music] i assume the millions aren't medicated oh rocky now look so basically in a nutshell it's just squishy obviously what's medicated is the jelly in the middle by the look of it so yeah well then let's just stop [ __ ] about josh let's just get it down here it says it's strawberry but it's green [Music] but you can taste the cannabis huh [Music] oh my god we really taste the calorie [Music] stuff i didn't get that taste from the other it's strawberry because there's millions yeah if you see millions if a strawberry but the strawberry's masking oh i can taste it now [Music] you know when you get cannabis in your mouth like fecal or calories oil it burns your mind for a little bit you know i'm getting that almost at the back of my mouth [Music] i mean i wonder if there is an accurate dose [Music] cheers [ __ ] struggling this is breakfast [Music] [Music] [Music] a little bit [Music] i mean what i like about it more than anything is a lot of these sweets they actually mask the taste of the cannabis so it's like has it got anything in it hasn't it got anything i know damn well this has got something in it because i could taste it it's very very strong [Music] oh mate [Music] you're not having it's mine [Music] people [Applause] we'll see how strong this really is i mean i think the peach rings that i did a review on i think they were 400 milligrams and the other edible ones like the the um sour bright crawlers they were 300 milligrams in a packet so 600 milligrams i should really if i had a whole one i think i'd probably be on my back but maybe i'll do a whole one next time we'll see well 600 milligrams [Music] oh dear it's very very strong tasting i did not expect it to taste um as strong as it does in cannabis and it's um it's really really overpowering like i say the other one i had did not i can taste the fika or whatever it is cannabis oil in this it's right in the back of my mouth and it's overpowering but that's good because i know that it's [ __ ] loaded it knows it's loaded [Music] that much a little bit [Music] [Music] wow [Music] that's the only thing with these reviews [Music] looked completely different than the last one i had well the last one i was more flat out it was more like a belt it was more like a belt basically whereas that was like a rope um well it is like a rope you can see it quite clearly it's like a rope so but yeah six doses in one go [ __ ] hardcore you know me and i say if i get a good effect off here i'll get a whole one i'll do a hole in one go one night and see what that's like so oh really it's burning it's burning i know that's not a good advertisement for it but it just it has to if it's got cannabis in it it's gonna have some sort of effect when you eat it you've got to be able to taste it like that it's very very strong what's in that so i would say just i know you can't go by it but just by the taste alone i would say that that was probably a pretty accurate dose either that or they've got some serious cannabis [ __ ] flavoring put into it to make it taste like that which i doubt very very very much so i mean it says it takes um 60 minutes on there we know that edibles can take anywhere from like you know i mean 45 minutes to hour and after it's for the effect so the time is now five past 11 of the so we'll call it 11 o'clock as i started eating it probably five minutes ago because i was chewing it like [ __ ] as you saw um so yeah we'll go from there really we'll see what happens at five past twelve and see what i'm like i'll probably be hunting burgers down by that type well yeah let's get another pipe on the go people so yeah i hope you're all well hope everyone's in a good positive mood love the lovers [ __ ] the haters people yes yes one love here we go [ __ ] cheers fun time please join me smoke up choke up roll up you know where we go from here no mess of the bay we just smoke weed and we get [ __ ] higher yes yes let's do it cheers nice nice people nice nice chest [Music] [Music] hey cheers people peace one love to all of you and have a fantastic day you'll see me really soon anyway because i'll be making another video in an hour's time so um yeah i'll see you really really soon i hope you get a good [ __ ] giggle out of what's going to be coming next because i do tend to go off a little bit while i've added some edibles so peace of my love guys see you really really soon one love cheers for watching", "yRRRaF_BKy8": "today I am looking at some cannabis south and this is a CBD based self by Christy wood from by the bay farms [Music] this is a CBD only south there's no THC in this no psychoactive compound smells really really good she cannot stress enough that this is a healing process one or two applications is not ena constant application patience diligence mindfulness is really important with any product like this we're really any cannabis product I'm going to move my clothing I'm not gonna get all the way naked folks don't worry that's gonna be on my premium snapchat panic self massage it feels good that's really the main thing I can say and I also notice that if I smoke cannabis after using this stuff it seems to kind of go along with the entourage effect and I feel a increased potency of the SAP itself I think it's a great thing to implement products such as these into your life [Music] how's it going everybody its Freddie back here today and I'm bringing you a another product review and this time it is not from a dispensary and it is also not a flower or smokeable product so today I am looking at some cannabis south and this is a CBD base South by Christie wood from by the bay farms now Christy's located in Buzzards Bay and she was actually kind enough to reach out to me on Instagram and tell me about her products a little bit and she actually sent me some so this is a CBD only south there's no THC in this no psychoactive compounds but I'm super interested in stuff like this because I have very little experience actually no experience with topicals so super exciting really something new for me and hopefully seeing as I get a lot of questions about CBD and the different uses for it this can help me and you both learn a little bit more about this really cool cannabinoid that is getting a lot of attention but people don't seem to have as much hands-on experience with as they'd like including me so firstly thank you thank you very much to Christy I really appreciate the generosity and you reaching out to me anybody who reaches out to me you kind of hold a special place in my heart because I put a lot of work into these videos into these reviews and it's a lot of passion as well and I don't mind doing it but whenever anybody shows appreciation that means a lot to me so you Christie and let's get into it so the South a basic basically the ingredients in here are organic coconut oil beeswax cannabis extracts in essential oils so this is a CBD only product as I mentioned before and the directions are essentially to Chris you suggest that you test a small bit of this SAP on your skin before applying it to a larger area just to make sure there's no reactions or interactions with your skin so essentially it's just like a bomb or something that you rub on your skin she recommends Christie does using a spoon to avoid cross-contamination or bacterial growth within the salad self and the recommendation on this page says that you cannot put too much on so there's no overdoing it with this I've used it a little bit the one thing I would say is it can be a little bit oily if you take too much at once so you might have a little bit of that coconut oily residue on your hands if you grab a little too much for a certain area but honestly what I do with it is if I have a little extra on my hands I know this sounds a little weird but I just like run it through my hair I really can you see this stuff being used for almost any use is kind of a skin facial topical sort of healing ointment type menthol icy hot almost type applicator or application would be a good use for this and I I believe that the coconut oils and stuff like that are really good for hair as well this is just a personal thing for me um I have kind of long hair I put products in it and if I have a little extra of this Salib on my hands just run it right through there some people might think that's weird too gross or greasy but I don't know I think it's natural smells really really good I have to say maybe the aroma the aroma therapy qualities of this stuff might be one of its strongest uses for me or the aroma therapy aromatherapy qualities if that's even a word are some of my favorite parts of the self so when I have it in my hands or on the spoon I just kind of inhale it or just hold up my hands and kind of breathe deeply and that just seems to be a really nice kind of calming effect for me that could be in my head but whatever works for you works for you right so I'm not here to judge and hopefully you aren't either so yeah this stuff is awesome I've been using it pretty much daily Christie recommends using it about 6 to 10 times a day for the first few weeks constant application seems to be the method to the madness with this stuff so getting a baseline of just like any medication really you know getting a baseline of it in your system or on your skin will help you get used to it and will help you reap the benefits from it a little bit faster and more holy so 6 - time 6 to 10 times a day apply it to whichever areas you feel you need it the most and after that you can start to decrease the dosage that you put on according to Christie so she mentions specifically at the end of this little blurb she's written me that she cannot stress enough that this is a healing process one or two applications is not enough so if you want to purchase this stuff from Christie or you're thinking about checking it out be wary you're not going to you know put it on one time like some snake oil and immediately be cured of all your ailments it's not how any medicine really works so constant application patience diligence mindfulness is really is really important with any product like this notice how you feel before during and after an experience with something like this or really any cannabis product because that's how you really can you know see the effects because they're not always immediate they're not always super extravagant at first but when you implement cannabis and cannabis infused products into your life daily the little steps it makes over a long period of time make a huge difference so that's what I try to tell people is you know don't expect a one-time care because those don't exist in life but kind of weaving these natural and organic and well done products into your lifestyle will really just make your quality of life so much better in my opinion okay so now I'm gonna give you guys a little breakdown of how I apply this stuff and yeah we'll go from there so I'm going to actually turn and move my clothing I'm not gonna get all the way naked folks don't worry that's gonna be on my premium snapchat oh okay so as you can see summer has not yet hit in Massachusetts I am pale as a ghost but I like to put this stuff on my shoulders I get a lot of tension in my neck and in my upper shoulders so I find that an early morning application of this South especially after sleeping on my neck weird if by the way if you don't notice if you haven't noticed by now I have a [ __ ] long neck so this thing's always hurting me actually I had to put an extra little book on my tripod because my neck was too long for the Headroom anyway I digress so what I do per the instructions I open this up if that is really cool-looking I'll actually bring it over to you you can see it so you can see the way my fingertips are ready it's smells reminiscent of a mix vapor rub kind of which is one of my all-time favorite scents mixed with cannabis it's got a really strong cannabis smell but it's not overwhelming it's not skunky it's kind of a sweet natural organic smell of cannabis if that makes sense it's so so so medicinal just as an aroma therapy medicine for me I could literally sit here and sniff this stuff all day and it's just calmed me right down I think that's kind of the essential oils that are in here I'm sure that those have a lot to do with it alright so basically what I do is I get a little bit on the spoon and now I don't want it to be too much I don't know if you can see very well here but I don't have a lot have a little bit and then I just put that in my hands and so one thing that Christie talks about in here which i think is really wise and smart is the fact that a lot of times pain or inflammation or symptoms you're experiencing might be localized in one spot that not that may not be the cause of the of the ailment itself or the root cause so you might be feeling pain in one place as you see him rubbing this together you might be feeling pain in one place but the cause might be in another spot next to it so make sure you apply this in a large swath of skin or area because you don't just want to focus on the one localized acute pain point you kind of want to get all around it to loosen everything up so hands super oily right now it's all this stuff so what I like to do is just rub it on my neck and shoulders so right on my upper back kinda massaging it in this would make a really good massage oil too and that's not a necessarily written use for it on here but I'm sure it would be perfect for that so if you are a masseuse you like to give yourself self massage or if you've got a significant other you bless this out give them a little back and booty rub you're gonna have a healthy happy relationship oh man yeah so I just rub it all in and then with the excess I just gotta you know throw it in the hair I got a headband in now so probably to mess it up a little bit but I know that might might be gross to some people you might think it's greasy and weird but I don't care so immediately upon applying this stuff I'll tell you I also put my shirt back on immediately upon applying this stuff I feel a menthol like quality and the CBD seems to take effect and root in right after this menthol like feeling kind of wears off so it's immediately it's not an icy hot it's not intense like you know hot to relax it away or cold anything it's more so just a very not a numbing feeling but a slight kind of anesthetic numbing agent feeling it feels good that's really the main thing I can say and I also notice that if I smoke cannabis after using this stuff it seems to and this could be you know placebo effect but it seems to kind of go along with the entourage effect and I feel a increased potency of the south-- itself so take that for what it's worth that's a personal anecdote of mine I have a nose pick evidence to back that but yeah you put the stuff on you take a take a bowl or a nice bong rip it might have increased efficacy for you and that's something I believe in so definitely something to keep in mind if you do plan on getting some of this South which I do highly recommend like I said overall as a lifestyle choice I think it's a great thing to implement products such as these into your life because we use a lot of oils rubs creams and stuff but to be able to have access to something that's derived from cannabis and has those essential oils and common pounds in them is really cool and nice and I can't thank Christie enough once again I'll say it again Christie would by the bay farm her phone number five zero eight six eight five oh seven seven nine and you can also see her website on cannabis pain SOUTHCOM that is cannabis pain South one word.com south is sa l ve alright so that's about all I have for you today I feel great my muscles are definitely more relaxed after all of this and since I've implemented this as a daily kind of regimen I honestly do feel less or less tight in the morning and overall great experience so I can't recommend it enough Thank You Christy and thank you for watching I really appreciate it have a good one guys you", "wA5wg8JqoDw": "[Music] welcome back to torpy eyes in today's video i'm going to show you how i make skin cream that has thc and cbd in it this cream is amazing for sore muscles dry skin sunburns and any other type of skin irritation that you might have [Music] this mixture of products is pretty simple but does amazing job for the body all these items can be found at a store nearby you're going to need coconut oil aloe vera gel and skin cream i have a lot of muscle pain and dry skin so this mix of products is fast acting and doesn't leave my skin greasy the first step in this process is to infuse your coconut oil with the thc and cbd this can be done in a few different ways i found it to be easiest using a slow cooker you can do it on your stove top using a double boiler if you don't have access to a slow cooker i picked up this slow cooker at walmart for about 15 coconut oil is a great product to use because it's all natural and has little to no order it's one of the best binding agents for cannabis both cannabis and coconut oil are really good for treating inflammation to infuse the coconut oil with thc and cbd you measure out the amount of oil you want to make then measure out how strong you want your final product to be for my mix i want about a half milligram per one milliliter of final product i'll leave my mix amount in the description below simply put the coconut oil into the slow cooker then add one cup of water the water is added to create a volume for the slow cooker so you don't burn the product then add your thc or cbd you can use just thc or just cb or combine them both just like me it's all personal preference i grew the harley quinn vx4 strain a little while back it's a one-to-one ratio strain which gave me both thc and cbd [Music] i leave the coconut oil in the slow cooker on low for three to four hours then it's time to separate the oil from the canops and water i use multiple layers of chew cloth and a fine metal strainer be sure to use a heat resistant container because the oil is pretty hot i always go with a collab [Music] me once you have the oil in the glass bowl i put it into the fridge overnight this not only lets the coconut oil to get hard but it also separates the oil and water you can remove the hard coconut oil out of the bowl and then drain the water out since i use ice water hash instead of cannabis flour you see my coconut oil didn't get much color to it usually when you use bud you'll get a very green end result now that we have our coconut oil infused with the thc and cbd we can go ahead and mix everything else together for the cream i use a cream that i prefer any cream will do though this one also has vitamin e in it and doesn't leave my skin greasy so that's why i chose it [Music] as for the aloe vera gel this is great for reducing pain and soreness reducing the healing time of burns and it also contains vitamin a and c [Music] since our coconut oil is hard we're gonna have to warm it up a bit so it's easier to measure out i just put it into the microwave for a few seconds once i've measured it out to the proper amount i put it into the blender's container and place it back into the fridge for 15 minutes this is to thicken it up since our other two ingredients are a bit thicker than the oil for this mix i used 200 milliliters of the coconut oil and 300 milliliters of the aloe vera gel you can use all-natural rear from a plant but it may not last as long i've never used the plant form so i'm not 100 sure [Music] time to add the lotion this container of lotion is 220 milliliters so i use the entire thing [Music] i'm using a ninja blender i set it on low and let it mix for one minute i take it out of the blender shake it around by hand then put it on low again for another minute if you want you can add essential oils to the mix but i like mine as odorless as possible i like to reuse the lotion container that it came in and also any editor i put into a tupperware [Music] container [Music] if you enjoyed this video or found it at all

very nice I had lunch and chatted all about what we're talking about today which is topicals but anyway I hope you guys get a chance to outside and enjoy this lovely day and we are going to dive into our recipe that we made today but first we're gonna talk about obviously the skin which is like goes hand in hand with topicals the skin is so important because it is the largest organ of our body so clearly it's important yes and it's important to take care of your skin but it's interesting because our skin is a huge indicator of what is going on internally yes it is so Brooke tell me about what inspired you to make your own balm so as you guys know we do carry a mary's medicinal freeze which is a nice topical and we have our great synergy balm which is awesome I actually broke my foot and I use this around my foot it got great relief from it yeah it's really really nice so one thing that I noticed is that these are our Mary's medicinal CBD and our synergy really relief is a one to one THC CBD I was looking for something that was strictly THC so a high THC bomb so I took it into my own hands to take one of the grassroot RSO syringes and recreate my own bomb so that's what I did oh creative but we thought we would talk about this because we used products that we have here yes to make something that's a little bit more customized you used essential oils used coconut oil the only thing that we don't have which we were talking about you can just get at Whole Foods is beeswax yes and there's no difference between whether you get the pellet fees wax or the chunks of beeswax so either one so let's show the final product tell us how you so I'm give a smell it smells so good I did any tree oil tree yeah cuz so one reason that my bomb is strictly well not strictly but mainly made out of coconut oil and tea tree oil is for its antifungal properties so I suffer from Candida I get it on my back and I get it but it normally flare up in the spring but it's never really something that's to astronomical but I did just have a birthday and went on a sugar overload ship curry whenever a sugar overlays like me for a day weekend it was so fabulous yeah this is one I haven't used yet so you guys it's amazing this won't ruin your clothes no it doesn't ruin my sheets I put it on after the shower or before bed and it doesn't ruin my pajamas doesn't get on my sheets it absorbs really really nicely into the skin so it's because of sort of like how you made it you make sure that it emulsifies properly yeah let it cool yes okay so tell us like step by step so you combined half well this all kind of comes out to half a cup is what you were saying yeah so I feel like it came out to a total all my oils mixed together came out to a half a cup so I did about 1/3 a cup of coconut oil if you have a problem with coconut oil you can always do olive oil or avocado oil we do but we have in the dispensary which is fabulous so I did that I did an ounce of tea tree oil not only for the scent but I also an regime one oh yes I really wanted the antifungal from the tea tree oil so some of the tea tree or I'm sorry some of these scented oils that we have here in the shop are the blood orange the lavender and the peppermint these ones are great for mood boosting and to reduce anxiety so these are fabulous so it depends on what you need like yeah I have to make they don't have to make there's a tea tree nope if you prefer a certain scent if you want to use this before bedtime because we know lavender is a great one to help relax yeah then throw some lavender in there exactly so what's great about this is I had my oils I took everything I did a double boil put everything in there I had my total one ml syringe I did an ounce which is I think half a bottle of one of these guys of my essential oil right and then I did my coconut oil once that all emulsified and became one or I'm sorry that all became one pretty easily because it's all a waste I started to add my beeswax so slowly right yeah do all at one out all at once because you want it to slowly emulsify and become one so beeswax normally it's a one-to-one ratio so if you have a cup of all your oil concoction and then an ounce of beeswax what I had done was because I wanted mine to be more of a balm than like a petroleum jelly right I did double the amount of beeswax so I did two ounces of beeswax for my no no I did one else beeswax for my half a cup of mixture so you can see it's super nice it comes out really nice and it's like a true bomb and it just rubs on nice and there is no psychoactive reaction to this is strictly a topical it's a non edible you put your essential oil in it's it smells really nice and you feel it's not sticky it's just like I love it so it's super simple did it home nice little DIY but along with that yes we're still doing our accessory sales so we're just saying if you don't want to do this process you can really make a tincture in your levo with some clues flour and just make sure to add some essential oils because it's not going to be an ingestible tincture really right so you wouldn't miss for a topic Lori yep you would get your oil all out of this it would take make it a lot easier you're gonna have to DIY everything once your oil comes out you would add yours oh you would add your fees wax find the consistency that you like right let it cool I let this cool for two hours for this guy because it wasn't full all the way but this one I gave a solid sex just to cool all the way before I started using it and I just stored it in the bathroom it's cool Oh dark and yeah it's really good it's really great for Sienna so so this is good for and Brooke talked about how she suffers with Candida but bug bites well yeah but mosquito bites this time higher because you both are those yeah people we are those people here are those people the bugs love us so that's you know obviously uncomfortable you're inflamed when you want to keep eating this will help cool and soothe and reduce that inflammation but eczema athletes yes yes any of those topical you know like dermatitis conditions and I was gonna say that I've been using my balm for a week now and my breakouts on my back have significantly reduced in redness and size and I'm gonna give it a month and see how much balm I have left and see my spots so and keep us posted yeah and those are those Omega six is reacting to the inflammation in my body which is coming out through the skinny it's amazing yeah anything else you want to add today I think that's all we have we have some great products in we still have the accessory sales well xxx yes yes coming in until supplies last we're just trying to clear out bring in some new stuff if you guys have any

"qFPNyuv3pbM": "Welcome back to another video this week I wanted to show you guys how to make your own cannabis lotion So it is a two-part process. I will leave how to make cannabutter in the description box below so you can go look at that video after or before and Super simple to make it's really nice for inflammation, pain it's a lotion it's not a salve there's a lot of videos out there in that say lotion but it's a salve so a lotion is 75% water and 25% oil so it goes on nice and That goes on like a lotion it absorbs nicely and yeah, so we'll get into the video right now So here is the infused coconut oil. I will leave a Description of that in the box below and so what you'll need is 2 x 8 ounce containers. It does make 16 ounces And you'll need two heat safe measuring cups. Preferably larger ones at least one large one you want to be mixing in that one and you'll need two thermometers and a hand blender Rubbing alcohol is super important when you're making a lotion because of contamination. So you want to just Sanitize anything that comes in contact with your lotion including your thermometers forks of the blender The bowl itself, spoons just cover ground so you avoid any sort of bacterial growth And so here is the oil things. We will be using the cannabutter (cannabis butter) I'm setting it to ounces So you'll want to keep the temperature to 70 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes, and this just ensures that The oils have properly melted, it reduces contamination and it helps to emulsify. So keep track of the time and a temperature I'm just pouring the oil into the water, but you could pour the water into the oil I'll be using the blender here Just follow the instructions on that and it will be mixing here for a good two minutes on two minutes off two minutes on For a good like 10 minutes and here the consistency has turned into a lotion it is really nice and creamy and So at this point you could try using a funnel. I tried just I sort of mix it a bit too much in a way and not thick so Here, I'm just using my own piping bag. Well a makeshift one and I will be squeezing it into the containers And so the squeeze bottles are the way to go because it reduces contamination That is it on how to make your own cannabis lotion. It's really easy to make it is a two-step process So I will link the video in the description box below and I will link it here As well if you want to learn how to make that I'm pretty good for different types of things I mean, it's just a generally a nice moisturizer for your body, but you can use it on inflammation If you have like any sort of eczema or psoriasis, I personally have psoriasis Scalp psoriasis and it's going on my forearm, but I've noticed that it actually helps with the itchiness. It seems to tame down the inflammation It's good for pain neuropathy pain sore muscle so really broad spectrum use Yeah, it absorbs really nicely the lotion There we go it doesn't go on really greasy it absorbs really nicely The last lotion that I made was specifically for dry hands. So if you do have dry hands like me Check that out really nice video for that. So I hope you guys have a good day And I will see you guys in the next video. Okay.

"NCVBujyWvyE": "hi my name is coupons in this video is for mature audience so you better be mature if you're watching this today we are celebrating a thousand subscribers on YouTube that's right a thousand of you awesome people subscribe to my youtube channel thank you everybody who Tunes in and watches my videos and shares them and likes them in comments I really appreciate that holy [ __ ] so to celebrate a thousand subscribers I'm gonna stick to the theme of a thousand and what I've got here is a 1-1 gram snake of some shadow I've stretched out here so we're gonna do a 1 gram damp of some of this grape star shatter if I can get it to focus I picked this up earlier from the hem Center really cool dispensary and this is about who cares what percent 66% but we've got a 1 gram dam which is a thousand milligrams of concentrate and then I also have a thousand milligrams of edibles that we're gonna take today so a 1 gram Babb and a thousand milligrams of edibles do you think that you can handle this what I've got here is the let's get it to focus I have the Colorado cannabis oil capsules and there's four capsules in here and there are a total of 350 milligrams through the whole bottle and they actually make these words four capsules and it's a thousand milligrams but I couldn't find that so these are just I guess less filled and the capsules but let me give you a breakdown we're looking at okay so each capsule is about 93 milligrams of THC and it is full spectrum or RSO so there are other cannabinoids and there's really good stuff I've had this many times before and it's actually my favorite edible so this whole bottle is 372 milligrams of THC and it's not like it's full there's only four little capsules in here and we're actually gonna take we're gonna take three of these which should be just over a thousand milligrams it'll actually be about 1100 milligrams so I'm excited and then I'm gonna try to stream on Twitch after this so this is for a thousand subs on YouTube but you know I stream every night on Twitch if you don't sub to my twitch channel like twitch that TV slash coupons check that [ __ ] out I'm probably live right now if you're watching this and I'm probably not on my thousand milligrams and one gram that but maybe we hit some milestones again I'll do it check out my twitch check out my other social media we have links in the description below follow my Instagram my Twitter sup to the subreddit check out the Facebook I don't know check out all that stuff join the discord that's the good one let's take some of the capsules first maybe like a half now and half after cuz like what if the dev just wrecks me I can I can't continue let's give it a go so this is 350 milligrams for four of these and they're just little capsules and I guess this is the same size for all of them so if you get the higher dose which ones they just they fill more but they have more of the liquid in it early oil so let's go for it let's take a nap now [Music] just little GHC capsules I kappapa movement in this or above okay so that's four of them I think and honestly guys I mentioned it before this is my absolute favorite edible I hate if I want to take a thousand milligrams I usually hate a thousand to get high if I want to take it it's like several brownies or like a fuckload of gummies you know what I mean I'm not trying to eat like a [ __ ] eight ounce bag of gummies to get a thousand milligrams I'd rather just like pop a few capsules and this is actually these are the low dose not like a pop four and get a thousand milligrams some of them are even more potent so I need to look out for those they're hard to find and they're kind of pricey well that's half of it down it's about 550 milligrams of THC here was 1100 for the capsules overall so we have half of that down and let's fire up the let's fire up the nail here we're gonna do this on quartz banger I got the pearls in there hopefully hoping I can get the time right I don't do a lot of dabs on this lately so I'm hoping I get the time right but if not I'm down for four reheats and whatnot we were just gonna milk this a one-gram dab is like it can be a million different

Catherine from French Broad cannabis we're a formulator and manufacturer of CBD and herbal products in Brevard North Carolina today I want to talk to you about something that I am really passionate about and that is CBD selves I use selves every day I would say that they are my favorite CBD product I like them because they work where you put them so whether you just worked out or maybe you're just sore or just anytime you've got something that's targeted maybe like you know just one area that's something you can point to you and touch there's a lot of different kinds of selves on the market I really like some ones that have hello but oil in them the reason for that is that jojoba oil really mimics the skin and the oils in the skin so it passes the skin barrier very well which means that it's a great carrier oil for selves and for CBD which is oil soluble so there's a lot of different stuff on the market you can get stuff that's like hot coals like something you know that kind of cools your skin and then there's ones that are for sensitive skin those are the ones that I like the most there's ones that are just kind of regular selves that hit a larger market maybe if if you don't like hot cold or have sensitive skin you can just go with it selves that you just want to make sure that it doesn't contain any month all if you don't like that hot cold feeling but there's not a lot of research out there to prove or have any real understanding of efficacy of selves that being said the empirical data and the data from folks actually using it like subjective data is huge the selves are one of the best sellers here they're the best sellers and a lot of shops that I and the reason for that is that they work really quickly they're often also combined with other ingredients like arnica oil or camphor and these sorts of things that are also used in herbalism for the same type of stuff that you use a CBD or cannabis cell for so this only creates a more complex and efficacious product so just make sure that when you're using salves you find something that's been tested and you want to find something that's batch traced so something that's got some sort of batch number on the bottom a good company will have a website that you can go to that has full testing panels on their selves so you'll see that it's got heavy metals testing pesticide testing microbial testing that sort of thing microbial testing is very important in salves because a Staphylococcus or ecoli contamination equal I can happen in cannabis and then as far as Staphylococcus you can introduce that during the formulation stage let's say somebody has a cut on their hand or something like that that's the way that Staphylococcus would get into a finished product and it does stick around so if there is contamination with Staphylococcus it's going to stay in the product so you want to make sure that it's been tested for micro because if you put something that's contaminated on an open area or even an area that you know gets caught later or has a little bit of a you know rash enos to it you could infect your your body through a contaminated product you also want to make sure that it has no pesticides or metals that are above the limit set by the EPA and the Food and Safety Administration's that we have so you aren't putting harmful chemicals on your skin like I said something like I solve especially something that's got jojoba oil as a carrier is going to absorb through your skin so just think about your skin as a big organ and you'll be pulling whatever is in the south into your skin you also want to make sure that they're testing for potency and all of this should be batch traceable so you want to make sure that whatever you're getting is what it says it is and has the documentation to prove it because it's very important what selves I'm just going to give you a little peek of what selves look like this is one of the sobs that we make when you put it on you don't need a lot so it's a you know I'm gonna put on just this much here onto my arm when you apply yourself you're gonna want to kind of gently massage the area to rub it in and also to make sure that you're getting good coverage and that you're not um like leaving any chunks on the skin and then also it'll spread further so that amount just spread from here all the way to here so kind of everywhere that you can see this pink flower and blue on my arm um so you want to make sure that it's kind of a thin layer and then I just like to do like a little bit extra you know massaging the area just to make sure that I'm getting good absorption not everyone likes to do this but I like to kind of try to rest the area after I apply itself that way I can make sure that it's getting some good absorption time rather than you know going out and going for a run right afterwards so I like to apply myself in a time that I'm gonna you know have a little bit of rest maybe like a five-minute sit maybe a lunch break or something like that um salves are really convenient because you can just toss a little salt in your purse that's what I do I've also got a bigger jar you know we have bigger jars and often other companies will have bigger jars as well that you can keep by the bed or something like that at home and it's a lot cheaper to have a bigger jar and a smaller jar that you're pulling from the bigger jar into the smaller jar so I like to get one of each to start and then pull from the bigger jar that way I've got like a little container to put in my purse or maybe you have a little contain from you know a sample of some sort but the bigger jars are always gonna have better price points per milligram and per gram of material so using that to your advantage while still being able hot some thing that's cute and convenient to take with you throughout the day can be really good about storage of sobs you want to be careful how you store yourselves when it's too cold you're not gonna have too much of an issue but when it's too hot you're gonna have a big issue you'll start to get melting you might get onto solution where your cells are so separate from itself so you just want to be careful to store yourselves in a location that isn't gonna have big temperature variation and you want to make sure that the solve you're using stays solid at room temperature there's a lot of solves out on the market that aren't solid at room temperature they're almost kind of like creamy I don't like those selves because when I carry them in my purse if there is a natural temperature variation like throughout the day which there always is in my life because I'm in and out and and you know active so those can melt in my purse and create a big mess or mountain in my car or whatever whenever I am going from place to place and leave my purse in my car or something so you just want to be careful about the selves that you've got when you go into a CBD short shop which I believe is the best place to always buy your CBD you want to ask to try it out and they should have like an open sample of the selves that they're selling so that you can see how it applies and and get to know it make sure it doesn't burn your skin I've had plenty of self starts to irritate my skin so you just kind of want to try it out talk to them for a little while you know dilly-dally in the store and just see how it feels you know give it a couple minutes before you purchase that way you're getting to know your product if you're buying online you know that's the best way that you have available to you that's fine I would just start with a smaller amount to make sure that that solves going to work for you before buying a bigger bottle and then purchase the bigger bottle once you know all is good for you because there are a lot of stuff out there is a lot of products out on the market I would also say stay away from anything that's got chemicals in it if you can't pronounce or know the word that's on the ingredient list chances are it's unnatural and that there aren't there isn't a reason for it in your product so you can make a really good CVD solve with no chemicals at all with only natural ingredients so chemicals um companies that are using chemicals and ourselves are putting unnecessary ingredients and a lot of them are purchasing a base like a lotion base or south base from a company and then using that by adding just CBD in it I don't suggest going with those companies first of all that's not like an artisan brand there's not a lot of love in that and secondly there's just no reason for those chemicals so you're you know you're putting things on your skin that you really don't need to be and a natural product in my opinion is always gonna be better for me and just aligns with my morals better and and in with who I support and and what industries I support so if you've got any questions about selves you want to choose a solve you don't know what the best one is or maybe you don't know if a solve is right for you just go ahead and reach out to us we're happy to talk to you about that and you know maybe it's just worth a try like I said if you can point to an issue on your body and say you know that's the problem right here then a solve is probably good for that it's really worth a try people find that anything that's a targeted issue responds really well to a sell when you're using solves you're going to have to reapply it throughout the day it's not going to work as long as like a capsule or something like that um so you are gonna want to have it with you maybe apply like every two hours or something that's what I normally find but for me some days I don't need it at all in some days I need it five times a day on average I used to solve about three times a day one time you know maybe around 11:00 one time around 2:00 and then one time around 5:00 or at that time so to help me sleep and I really liked it for this area the the neck and shoulders just because that area tends to just give me trouble so I like to put it kind of on my back but you can get somebody to help you apply it or just put it wherever you think fit make sure that you're only using salves on external surfaces and don't put it on open areas like cuts or wounds all right give us a reach out to us give us a follow and let me know if you have any questions about selves we've got a great team on board that can answer your questions and is passionate about product and they're happy to answer any questions you have all right see you soon",

information in just one month and Becky Worley visited a CBD dispensary to take a closer look Melissa McCarthy reportedly uses it on her feet Gronk says it's changed his life for the first time in more than a decade I am pain free CBD lotions you rub on your skin to reduce pain the idea is that by rubbing it on it's absorbed through the skin and it could impact joint or muscle pain just ask athlete ally Stoddart I played rugby for 15 years I play soccer now I got a lot of pain Ally a cannabis health and wellness consultant says she prefers CBD the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant to over-the-counter painkillers I weighed a couple of minutes and literally it just kind of eases away but amidst the endorsements and hype what are you actually buying and where you can buy CBD creams online but to be honest it's confusing the dosages are all over the place so I head to the havahart dispensary in Oakland California where they can explain what's being offered plus whether it's intentional or just ironic this legal marijuana dispensary is directly across the street from the Oakland Police Department co-owner Josh chase shows me the products they sell we pretty much offer every single type of CBD that one could find in any form what's really interesting to me is how few claims these products make and that may be because the FDA forbids medical claims for products we're rigorous studies haven't been done was really up to the consumers to up to the patients to educate themselves and make sure that the products that they're purchasing are of safe quality or from a reputable source but keep in mind if you do shop in a dispensary do you take credit cards so we make sure that we do everything by the book by the city and state's law and everything is cash so this is something you want to try do your homework and bring cash for Good Morning America Becky Worley Oakland California good thing to remember I thought I Thank You Becky dr. Jenn Ashton is here for more will do viewer questions today and the first one comes from Adria from New Jersey let's take a look hi dr. Ashton I've heard a lot of people using CBD oil for things like stress anxiety muscle soreness but I'm wondering how does it actually work could they be making it up Thanks great question that is a great question and right now it's really about what we know and what we don't know the bulk of the pain literature in peer-reviewed data comes out of Israel and Canada but everyone is researching this and I think it's based on this understanding George of this endocannabinoid system and if you look at the wall we have at least two receptors that are called cannabinoid receptors one heavily concentrated in the brain that's related to the perception of pain cb2 receptors located all over the body and the confusion here with respect to pain is that THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis yes it fits into that cb1 receptor but khat CBD also fits in does not give you a psychoactive effect that is really important but it there is data that it can help you see a lot of the prices say no THC exactly okay we have another question coming in on Twitter this is from Susan she says I've seen 300 600 1200 and 2,000 milligrams how do I know what does to try and what do we know about the dosing here we see the different ones here yeah wild wild west George and here's the thing in in terms of official recommendations so far the only group that has guidelines out is the Arthritis Foundation their recommendation is to start with as few milligrams as possible under the tongue twice a day if you're not seeing an effect over days and weeks increase its slowly and if you're noticing any unwanted side effects obviously stop and talk to your provider the concept here is start low and go slow and it's a lot of trial and error it's not one side and this is not a beer question it's my question I guess is there any any concern about dependency there not as much dependency but you always have to take into account risks when you talk about pharmacology if you're getting a good effect you have to be on the lookout of any unwanted negative effects and right now those risks are low but as always talk to your provider if you are using any of these projects and

the second of our two-part series or four part series on CBD which is the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant and the healing benefits that you can gain from that I want to start today with a showing you some products these are topical creams and these creams come in regular strength and extra strength and then I also have a CBD cooling stick so I want to show you some options for healing if you have joint or muscle pain particularly arthritis or if you have sore muscles from your workouts or any other thing you twisted your ankles or a carpal tunnel syndrome for example anything where your joints or your muscles have been affected and you're looking for a non-prescription and non-medicated type of cream or non-pharmaceutical I should say this is plant medicine and I'm going to just simply show you how this is used this is extra strength and the extra strength comes in a little container like this and and really speaking you just apply it like any other cream if I have a little bit of soreness around my joints so I'm gonna take this extra strength and rub it in and generally speaking I feel the relief in about 15 minutes or so and I like to do this in the morning first thing in the morning and then I also do this at the end of the day just before I'm getting into bed you could apply to three times a day in order to feel the soothing effect over the course of the entire day it depends on your schedule depends on how often you want to use the cream but this one works really well you can see that it's not very greasy it's not - it's easy to absorb into the skin and if goes on really nice and there's no scent on this at all so this is an option if you've got joint or muscle pain this is an extra strength CBD cream healing balm so that you can heal topically the other option if you're experiencing inflammation so let's say you have an injury and it's a it's a it's a pain that feels inflamed so there's a bruise it's feeling warm to the touch the other option is to take cooling stick and so this cooling stick you apply it it's in the shape of a deodorant and you take the stick cover off roll it up a little bit and then apply this to your skin and you'll feel a cooling relief almost immediately and then this one also includes a little bit of the smell of peppermint so using regular essential oils this has a cooling effect and also a great way to work through any topical pain so the option is here rather than to go for something from the pharmacy or from the drugstore is to take mother nature's course first is to apply a little bit of plant medicine notice how it feels this I've seen also my clients use if they've experienced some tenderness or soreness after they've done a yoga class and they come out and they have applied some of this cream and in to great effect so I wanted to share that option with you if you're looking to purchase some of these you can click the link below and you'll have access to all of the different products that are available and remember this is CBD so there's no psychoactive effect you won't feel hi this is on your skin and a great way to leverage what we know about plant medicine is that it works very intuitively with your everyone has a different kind of healing benefit and it might just be the next best thing for you happy to help and if you have any questions please leave that here underneath

with you the value of incorporating topicals into your medicine cabinet we feel that cannabis topicals and saves are generally underutilized they can be really effective for pain inflammation and skin conditions and the great thing is they're not psychoactive now personally I've used topicals a lot for sunspots and small skin cancers and I've had excellent outcomes there is plenty of documentation of people who've used them effectively for arthritis for joint pain and others use them for skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis sometimes you're going to find that topicals are blended with other herbs oils or products that can really help amplify their effect for a specific purpose here are some things to know about topical use a game psychoactivity is not an issue as the cannabinoids don't enter the bloodstream now they're not magical creams that aren't always work wonders upon initial use consistency is the key so I recommend using them multiple times a day and see if they work for you now it's also best to apply topicals at times of the day when you're not moving around a lot or sweating before bed is a great time and throughout the day when perhaps you're at your desk or just not running around let's look at a few simple topical products now there's really no surprises here what you would expect from any cream or therapeutic topical it's really not a huge difference with cannabis okay now with topicals it's hard to tell exactly how much of specific ingredient is in the topical itself obviously a cannabis topical will contain some cannabis or a lot of cannabis the labels should tell you if there's any other herbs or additives within the topical itself a lot of the time they'll use an oil as a base obviously some producers do choose to combine cannabis with other herbs or plants within a topical er south now we know that a lot of plants are good for medical use and depending on the specific intent of a product they could choose to combine it with an array of different plants whether it's for nerve pain inflammation or an array of other specific uses so just pay attention to the labels and start to educate yourself about both what cannabis is good for for you as well as potentially other herbs is also now let's get acquainted with this topical here notice first of all that they put it in a dark container this helps protect it from the Sun and one thing that I like to do it being acquainted with any product really but especially a Savoie topical is to first just simply smell it our smell is a really powerful sense that we have and it can help inform us about what our body likes about what it about what it doesn't like for example and cannabis actually I can smell it it has a distinct smell okay so you can sometimes even tell how concentrated this topical is with cannabis or smell other products within it now when applying can start liberally but the great thing about topicals is that really there's no psychoactivity you can't overdose you can't really overdo it but I like to start still with topicals start low and kind of go slow up in terms of the application just to gauge how effective they are so I have a chronic injury in my wrist from some impact from a martial art so I'm just gonna rub it on I like to rub it on my joints particularly but you can use it for any array of uses sometimes it can be very effective verts in conditions like psoriasis and eczema and dry skin that's really great inflammation like in my case or pain pain in joints or other areas some people use it like my colleague Chris for cancer for skin cancer and it can actually help with that topical application as well so I'm just rubbing it in smoothly if it's really thick you can combine it with another oil that's fine as well any other lipid-based product you can just combine it with whether you like the smell of it or anything so feel free to experiment and combine it with some other products you may use therapeutically and topically okay do as much research as you can we recommend this with any product that you take but it's really harder to go wrong with topicals and they are very safe so enjoy it enjoy your senses and just see how it affective is for your symptoms and condition", "rIPTxn7FNak": "[Music] what's up thank you for tuning into the canon guide today we got a really cool review for you make sure you like this video and subscribe so we can get more content to more people we got a really cool review we're gonna do a CVD topical self review cell boards artisanal self now we've been carrying this salad for a long time I my collective here you can see that product right there it is a coconut oil base pure CBD derived from 100% cannabis flowers now this is a very high dose CBD product especially for topical in the entire tin I believe is about 400 milligrams of CBD that they list there on the top and they do come in different strains mainly ACDC and Charlotte's Web I wish I had the you know original full tin it usually comes in a kind of the large silver tin and that can run I think it usually runs around $40 in the dispensary depending on the area of coverage that you need to cover can be less or more you know of a value for you oh it's kind of nice system support a small business it's not one of a you know very large conglomerate yeah so when you smell this it is essentially is unscented there's no aromatherapy oils or anything else in here to you know make it very fragrant it is just raw like smells like coconut oil really just really smell like cannabis at all but when you you know it is filled with cannabis when you use it the past couple of days my knee has just been totally inflamed I hadn't been able to walk on it properly and it was seriously just thrown pain just sitting here you know most most people would just take an Advil or Tylenol but this stuff's really bad for your liver so I opted to try out the topical CBD you see how that you know really helped my my knee injury the coconut oil is a little bit thicker sometimes you can almost seem like a solid at first but when you touch it it actually just kind of melts into a liquid oil right there and your finger yeah look at it just melts right into an oil just with the heat of your your skin aren't there a little bit does go a long way with this but I found you know for males so you might actually need more than if you're a female just because have a bunch of hair the hair end up absorbing a bunch of it so I kind of had to use more than I you know I think someone less like hair we'd have to use so I just kind of got a solid glob on there now almost my my top part of my knee was hurting like right above the kneecap so I went ahead got it on both sides of that as well as on top and around the kneecap and just rubbed it in nice and gently now rub me I didn't was a little bit you know sore if you have a really sort area it's again I heard two rubbed in so just you know you can be gentle with it and I believe it is best to do this at night now I use it throughout the day you can use it throughout the day it doesn't actually get you high or medicated but at night when you're sleeping your skin temperature increases and that's when you're gonna be doing most your healing so it's gonna really be most beneficial and you know be a little bit more receptive I feel at nighttime or early morning or maybe even after a shower when you're you know nice and warm then I would take a little bit more I would actually just essentially just coat the entire area and sometimes if you can find like a source or you know find where the paint's traveling from I've actually hit that area with a little bit as well and what I found although I was very skeptical at first because you don't think you know topical is gonna work because it seems like just a lotion but it really really took the edge off now it didn't completely take the pain away when I was active and trying to move on it and you know not doing good things probably but you know when I was just sitting here you know trying to be comfortable and rest it very very very much helped the just ambient pain and just you know just the pain that's radiating and pulsating when you're just trying to relax you know conditions vary and it's really hard to say this will work for you this will work for your condition but I would definitely give it a try there's a lot of different brands out there make sure you find cvd that's derived from marijuana flower not CBD isolate from hemp it has anecdotally been found to be much less effective the have CBD isolate why that is you know a lot of people can just say it's entourage effect or it's the terpenes and the cannabis plant maybe it's the miniscule amounts of THC or the other cannabinoids we don't really know for sure I found that I much prefer those products I found them to be much more effective and if I'm to be just more reputable their testing results tend to come from reputable sources within the state and they tend to have testing sources man I can do a whole video and that you know what I will I'm gonna do a whole video on CBD just misinformation because it's seriously my pet peeve CBD isolates that are just found in a wellness store that's advertising CBD is not going to be a quality CBD product yeah people might might hate that but just be very aware when you're looking for CBD online be very skeptical until you have you know less reasons to be just be skeptical of CBT online especially from dispensaries still be skeptical just make sure you do your research look into it know what your product contains yeah supports been some great people lab test is 100% flower bud ACDC CBD topical great stuff alright so sub Ward's artisan South find them

I am so sorry about my voice I'm just now getting over being sick and I'm finally getting my voice back but it's still a little bit scratchy so please try to ignore it I'm so freaking excited for today's video because we are gonna be discussing and testing out the latest health trend CBD hemp is a type of cannabis plant that contains a chemical called CBD it doesn't make you high like marijuana but it is creating a national buzz CBD CBD CBD sprouting up everywhere and in everything to put a simply CBD is a component of the cannabis plant with enormous healing potential you can get the benefits of CBD in so many different forms like oils edibles coffee even skin care and so many more now I personally found out about CBD last year whenever I broke my wrist snowboarding I'm sure you guys already know the story with that but after my surgery the doctors prescribed me some really hard drugs to help me cope with the pain and even though the pain was so unbearable I could not stand the side effects of the drugs so I had to start doing some research into more natural ways of relieving my chronic pain and I came across CBD oils and I've been using them ever since it's really cool because it helps you with so many other things like relieving stress anxiety migraines and it even improves my sleep when I first thought I'm doing a video like this I was just gonna use CBD oil for a whole week and kind of see what it does but since I already have a really positive experience using CBD oils I wanted to dive in into a different way of using CBD without actually ingesting it so in this video I'm gonna be sharing with you guys my experience of using a CBD cream for a whole week now there are so many different CBD brands out there and it's kind of hard to find one that you can truly trust that is organically grown the most trusted brand I've tried so far is premium Jane they provide some of the most purest safest and most effective products in the industry they are sourced from a hundred percent or grown Oregon hemp which if you didn't know I live in Oregon and we're kind of known to grow some of the best hemp out there anyways I'll be using this CBD topical solve from premium Jane you can call it assault and pointman a cream whatever I think I was gonna go with the cream it's much easier for me to say but this contains 1500 milligrams of CBD and it has some other really incredible ingredients like eucalyptus essential oil Joba oil argan oil emu oil grapeseed oil Omega 3 and 6 oils soy protein hibiscus flower extract neem leaf extract lemongrass extract chamomile extract aloe vera extract and cocoa butter these are all-natural and very powerful ingredients and I'm kind of excited to see what it can do to my skin so I started applying this every single day on my face and on my wrist [Music] I have a metal plate and screws in there that's holding the bone together and since I live in Oregon this time of year it gets super cold and the aching pain in my wrist gets so bad this cream is pretty powerful as a high dose of CBD so as soon as I started rubbing this on my wrist I kid you not the aching pain went away almost immediately and I do use CBD oils for this kind of pain but that takes a little bit longer to kick in it was really insane to me that I got immediate relief whenever I applied this cream now I didn't really see much of a difference in my skin other than some of the redness and breakouts were definitely reduced and my skin did feel a lot more hydrated and supple but I did notice a huge improvement in my lips I have this terrible habit of biting my lips and I would get these little pieces of broken skin on the outer corners of my lips because you know I feel like this oh well all of that is completely healed from just using this for one week and then that whole eyelash extension thing happened I just got out of the shower and I'm so embarrassed to share this with you guys but I have to because I am convinced this is a miracle CBD cream last night I was washing my face my eyelash extensions were kind of in the way and I don't know where I just started like pulling them out and not just the lash extensions but my real lashes too because you know the extensions is stuck to the lashes whoo I literally pulled out so many of my lashes I barely have any on oh so my eyes swole up they were so red so inflamed they were burning so much pain so what do I do I take the CBD bomb and I started applying it all over my eyelids and almost immediately the inflammation started going down and it felt so soothing this especially it was so bad like you could still kind of see the redness and the puffiness but I was shocked at how quickly the CBD balm work the next morning I woke up my eyes were not swollen anymore they look good again except for this one damn I still feel really dumb for pulling out my eyelashes but it happened I'm so glad I had something like this on hand to help treat it oh another thing my daughter brought her fingers she was trying to help me cook and she accidentally touched the pan and had a little burn around her fingers what did I do I put this on in a couple seconds and the pain went away so good stuff overall I experienced many benefits using this cream I think this is something every household should have just in case of an emergency like I mentioned this helps treat my daughter's minor burn better than anything else I'm blown away with the benefits I've received just by using it for one week I love this little jar of magical healing cream and will continue to use it every single day I've already ordered a couple more jars to stock up just in case I run out if you're wanting to get your hands on this you know where to find it I will also

truth in latin as all of us remember from latin classes during boarding school or if you didn't go to public school in the united states like me maybe you know some latin well veritas we are gonna see the truth about your cbd farm i sent veritas farms to two independent labs to see if it's real how about the product paid for the lab test you're welcome i do use affiliate links on my website disclosure but if you look at my reviews i give some of the most critical honest cbd reviews on the internet and that's because i'm really bad at business and i would rather give you the truth veritas also known as the roman goddess of truth okay let's see the lab test the price breakdown taste test strength and the good the bad and the ugly on veritas farms subscribe because uh i have more coming and you don't want to miss out on this first problem is they claim 500 milligrams but they only say full spectrum hemp and we don't know if it's milligrams of cannabinoids or cbd who are you for a truth goddess we're off to a rough start what did the labs find both labs found that they are real b scores they give a little bit more cannabinoids than suggested links below to this page to see the official lab test dive into this now they are extremely accurate if you go by cbd 500 milligrams of cbd and they are right on the money within three percent accuracy very accurate and it's full spectrum with a good amount of other cannabinoids i used to berate cbd companies for not claiming cbd amounts specific amounts but now every market place is forcing these companies to be vague and not mention the actual words cbd or cannabinoids so i guess they're okay 10 cents per milligram it's good for a fancy little farm in colorado i should note that there is no discount as you go for the bigger bottles the price per milligram stays the same so there's not much point in that there are a lot of cbd companies charging over 15 cents per milligram so 10 cents is okay you can get cbd for as low as 2 cents per milligram but just pretend i didn't say that if you like this brand the taste was excellent one of the best i've tried and i tried the watermelon it kind of tastes like between a watermelon jolly rancher or maybe a watermelon bubble gum sweet but not too sweet and no harsh taste of hemp it's amazing how far cbd companies have come they also make a peppermint which would appeal to more people and non-flavored i think i'd go for the peppermint because i'm not the candy watermelon guy but it does taste great if you're into that sort of thing i don't judge the strength 17 milligrams is a good starting point 0.6 milligrams of thc won't have side effects for most people i would say but may provide some additional benefits to the cbd see the entourage effect for that i would go as far as to say that you can take this and still jump over a moving vehicle if that's your hobby without delayed reactions from thc but always check with your your doctor first before jumping over moving vehicles while using cbd with thc just remember i said that when you end up in the hospital specifically so you don't sue me i have a disclaimer this is a full spectrum and has good amounts of cbc and cbg it actually has more cbg than the majority of full spectrums that i test that's pretty good i know a lot of people want to know how i feel from cbd from this cbd personally but you should never pay attention too much attention to the experience of just one person and a cbd product the effect of cbd and other cannabinoids is very very individualized on your endocannabinoid system and it can be very misleading to listen to one person so i focus on the actual data the lab test so you can find one you like and actually know what's in it veritas farms is a real farm small farm in colorado they have 140 acres they focus on sustainable farming and avoid pesticides surprisingly this little farm made it into major retailers like kroger and cvs nationwide from what i've seen this adds a lot of credibility to a cbd company and it's much more likely that they'll test well and that's what my lab tests have confirmed i didn't find anything concerning about veritas a plus better business bureau score with no negative reports in my in-depth internet search overall i think this is great for new cbd users occasional users gifs this would be a fantastic gift and i promise you that this is going to taste better than 90 percent of cbd companies out there this looks like something you would get at a spa it has a professional luxury look that still says hey i'm a natural little farm here but i keep my barn clean clean packaging and logo small farms are great because they have full control over their products the consistency the same strain and cannabinoids they're not just buying cheap cbd from thousands of different farms growing with questionable methods and pesticides and whatnot if you met some cannabis farmers you know what i'm talking about they are not however going to compete with the giant companies they can offer super super cheap cbd if you didn't know hemp is becoming very cheap right now so a lot of small farms like this one are struggling so if you want to support a small business and get a luxury cbd product for you or a great gift i think this is great they also make gummies capsules topicals skin care and cbd for pets that is it check the links below for more info i will see you next time", "THO_HoNRm2E": "hi guys my name is Samantha you can check me on instagram at Samantha star cookies with my help from my

"d3pNjEWEak4": "hi guys okay so today I am doing a video on my top 5 CBD creams I've been loving the CBD oil but I am training for a 10k which I know is not a marathon but still I run outside and running on the pavement often hurts my knees so I'm was looking for a solution that I could apply on the you know pain area directly and so CBD cream seemed to fit the bill and actually it worked really well and I'm really glad I tried it so I want to share with you my top 5 today so if after this review you want to try CBD creams as well just click on the link in the video description for the best CBD deals alright so in fifth place I put met Tara's CBD rapid cooling cream these guys are for the cream in two strengths we've got the 250 milligram at $44.99 and the 750 milligrams at 70 799 their cream is a blend of CBD menthol and arnica and that's what provides that rapid cooling effect and really helps with joint and muscle discomfort I just rub it on my knees right after a run and it provides instant relief and usually it lasts for a couple hours and then after that the pain is gone for the day also with this one the menthol smell isn't too strong so you can just apply it after a shower in the morning and head off to work no problem and as with all other matera products these guys are 100% natural and organic they don't contain any THC they are made in the US and they provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in 4th place we have nano crafts cooling sports cream this one is $59.99 for 500 milligram which is great if you need an in-between dosage from Matara this one has a pump dispenser like the matera one so that makes it really easy to dose and apply the cream this one is also made in the US with non-gmo all organic ingredients meaning that it doesn't contain any pesticides herbicides or chemical fertilisers etc and they also provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in third place we have another product from nano crafts it's the muscle and joint bundle so this one is great if you're already convinced and want to take it one step further so this bundle includes the broad spectrum CBD soft gel capsules with curcumin these are packed with 25 milligrams of CBD which is perfect for daily and consistent consumption to make sure that you have a smooth start to your day they also have the broad-spectrum pure CBD drops which are also packed with 25 milligrams of CBD another way to consume CBD if you're out of capsules you can just take a few drops as is there ginger sytrus flavored or you can simply add to a protein shake or a post-workout snack and the third product is the broad spectrum muscle and joint stick that's loaded with 500 milligrams a full spectrum hemp oil that's great for on-the-go application if you're feeling some discomfort you know as you're working out outside and that's usually two hundred and fifty dollars but they're selling it for 195 but again if you want the best prices click the link in the video description it gets updated regularly with the best deals alright moving on to number two which is the ultra relief gel from just CBD just CBD is one of my favorite CBD brands they have a ton of product variety to choose from so the ultra relief gel comes at $59.99 for a thousand milligrams of CBD this one is great if you're looking for big CBD dosage at an affordable price the smell is not overpowering the pump makes it really easy to use and you can really feel the cooling sensation in this one I really recommend it for like intense pains so if anything is keeping you up at night then that's probably a good gel to buy and then in first place I chose the CBD infused pain cream so this one comes at 1199 for a hundred milligrams of CBD that's a really good option for like small pains but is also super affordable if you're just looking to get started or unsure about CBD in general then you might want to you know get started with this one and see how you feel and then just work your way up to a bigger dosage this is also a really good option if you're not comfortable with the oil format it's really easy to use and spread on your area of pain I started to feel the effects about 15 to 20 minutes after I applied the cream after my run and then I was good for the day so I really recommend this cream or any of the five that I listed in this video if you've got any aches and pains or just if you have if you often have pain after an intense workout or just starting to feel the effects of age then I really recommend you to try CBD creams and let me know how it goes in the comments all right if you want

CBD created equal with the passing of the 2018 farm bill it's allowed a lot of companies to create the opportunity to get into the space but that I think is creating over saturation in the market and some worried about what people are doing with requirements many of them call themselves just hemp extract made from stock stems and seeds the problem with that is stock stems and seeds contain virtually no cannabinoids that's what you're buying the product for I do trust imbue because of their quality their formulation is very simple there's no other fillers and that makes a huge difference in says of kicking imbue and being comfortable into the recommend to patients I want patients to fully experience the benefit of CBD in order if you do that they have to get the right car and imbued

CBD oil can be used to produce support for normal everyday stresses healthy recovery from exercise support for a sense of calm and focus and help you sleep and brighten your mood so what is CBD oil CBD stands for can add video and can video is a main component of cannabis and in an all-natural class of molecules called cannabinoids found in the plant genus cannabis sativa L CBD makes up around 40% of the plant and is just one of over a hundred compounds found in cannabis including hemp and marijuana out of all these compounds CBD and THC tetrahydrocannabinol are always the highest concentration they are therefore the most research of all the vital cannabinoids found in cannabis CBD is a non psychoactive component that can hold a wide variety of potential benefits and it doesn't induce the highs that THC does the human body actually has a system known as the endocannabinoid system and thus utilizes cannabinoids in a variety of ways in the body see beady oil is the purest form of cannabidiol extract from the hemp or marijuana plants found in tincture form there are several favorite CBD hemp oil flavors including citrus mint natural berry and vanilla the price depends on size 300 milligrams is $39 600 milligrams $59 1200 milligrams cost in $99 and 2400 milligrams costs a hundred and twenty nine dollars so as you can see the larger the size the cheaper the CBD will be we have three strengths of organically grown hemp CBD oil for sale each has a 12 month shelf life it's always made to order so it'll always be fresh CBD oil is best kept at room temperature away from excessive light heat and moisture some people store it in a pantry others prefer to keep it in the refrigerator it's up to you fab CBD oil products may sometimes vary slightly from batch to batch fab CBD products include whole plant hemp extracts the extracts contain a unique blend of cannabinoids plus terpenes cannabinoids are phytochemical compounds that are produced by the hemp plant they are non psychoactive with only trace amounts of THC that is below North 0.3% take care when using any CBD products as they may fail THC screenings and CBD can metabolize in a way that might give a false positive let's look at the ingredients organically grown hemp extract full-spectrum cannabinoid blend flavorings from natural sources terpenes and medium chain triglycerides which may contain trace amounts of hemp derived THC again less than naught point 3 percent when deciding to buy CBD oil and which potency is best for you it's best to start small and gradually increase your dosage until you get the result that you want you might not need a full CBD serving you also may not need a high potency CBD oil so you could save some money while still achieving the desired CBD oil effects you should of course talk this over with your doctor as you would with any daily health supplement the key features of these products are that they are organically grown provide proper servings they are non-gmo they contain cannabinoids and terpenoids d sides are used and they are farmed in Colorado so I recommend that you try CBD oil for yourself this is a safe product that will elevate your life to a higher level be healthy and be happy", "7mabo4jjUj8": "cannabis is not very well studied in clinical trials but we have tons of evidence that there's huge anti-inflammatory properties we know that it's been used from a wide variety of conditions for a chronic pain especially neuropathic pain for seizures especially in children and a lot of skin conditions as well we're you know there's a big study published on psoriasis and how it can reduce the plaque formation in psoriasis so it's not surprising at all it would be helpful in a condition like a theosis the endocannabinoid system is found throughout the body in the brain in the immune system in the nervous system as well as in the skin actually skin cells have cannabinoid receptors in them and so putting them on topically you're going to get that action directly where it's needed taking internally you're gonna have a lot of other effects because you're gonna it's going to impact the brain and the immune system and all of those things now there's a lot of immune system cells in the skin as well so you're you're interacting with that and then the cannabinoids CBD and THC also have effects outside of the cannabinoid system so they affect other receptors in the body and so we don't understand those that well yet but we know that there there are interactions there we see effects in in CBD that we know doesn't directly affect the cannabinoid receptors but it still shows a decrease in inflammation it still shows a decrease in proliferation of those skin cells which is the big problem in ichthyosis do we know exactly how they all work no there's still way way more research than needs to be done but we know that there are interactions that can be beneficial do we know exactly how it's going to work yet no but you know I think the one thing we do know about these things is they're very safe you know you're not going to get severe you know bone issues or kidney issues that you would with some of the pharmaceuticals yeah unfortunately environment we're in right now it makes it really difficult to do any clinical trials on on cannabis clinical trials you know in the pharmaceutical industry can be fast-tracked if you have the money to you know pay for a trial and the regulations are much less when you try to do a cannabis trial it's very hard to get through it can take you know tens of years just to get approval for to do a study and people don't have that long and the fact is that the pharmaceutical industry has incentive to make new drugs and you know cannabis there's just not that drive to to produce products or to produce studies that show benefit in fact you know there's disincentive for pharmaceutical companies to have studies that show that there's benefit to cannabis so I think it's it's difficult to you know just to factor in all of the things that that are going on here but a lot of it is you know the pharmaceutical industry a lot of it is just a slow process in the government it takes to get things going and there's restrictions on on cannabis right now that make it really tough but you know the good news is that there's you know states like Nevada who who have laws that allow people to to have access to cannabis products there's a lot of frustration from people about the medical system you know people are not getting to spend time with their doctors they're you know not building relationships they're they're giving a complaint and then getting a medicine and that's for common conditions I can't imagine the frustration that parents have for something where every doctor they go to just like I don't know what to do and that so that must be extraordinarily frustrating and seeing somebody you know going out and finding the you know different options and finding something that works it's absolutely amazing I'm really happy that people are doing that I think they people still need guidance and you know trying to find doctors who are willing to work with them in different ways and maybe that's you know seeking out things like cannabis or seeking other holistic methods but I think that's it's something that more and more people are turning to because they're just frustrated with the care that they're getting traditional medical system", "ucw8dRNNCv4": "MAINTAIN A STRONG BOND EVEN\nTHROUGH THE TURBULENT YEARS.

I didn't know when an appropriate time was to post this video because I clearly do not want to be insensitive to everything that's happening right now but like many of you I have been glued to my phone social media the news and also the last you know I guess how many days I've been I've been out and about at the protests in downtown LA and Hollywood as well and the other day I honestly needed a mental break after coming home from the protest it's been very emotional and powerful but I did need to just I ended up watching some Gordon Ramsay and then I watched him RuPaul so what I was saying is I I think it's okay to take a little bit of a mental break this is something that so many of us hopefully all of us watching this right now are just so passionate about and mad about and and ready to fight to make change for which is already happening but also we need to be able to recharge as well a little bit so I'm not saying that watching a video like this is necessarily an escape but a little bit of a mental break and a little bit of a ability to recharge and then get back out there and do what you can I also did reach out and speak to some of my subscribers out there and asked if this was an appropriate thing to do and they kind of voice the same feelings that I am feeling right now so clearly YouTube videos are a lot more plan they're not necessarily in the moment and right now with what's happening everything is so in the moment it's changing so rapidly so if you want to catch up with me and see what I'm doing in the present moment you can catch me on Instagram I'm posting on there quite a bit any Adsense made from this video I'm going to be donating to blacklivesmatter and I'm planning for at least the month of June any videos I make adsense there I will be donating to an organization affiliated with black lives matter and I also have a very important message at the end of this video that I personally would love more information about and I do need to learn more about and I feel like as a community we need to as well so please stick till the end of the video and yeah I hope you all are staying safe out there I love you all and enjoy what's up everyone AC girl Stephanie and today I am gonna share with y'all some of my favorite CBD products I've been a big fan of CBD for quite some time now is really impacted my life positively as well as other people all around me and Josie's too so before we get into it if you haven't yet please make sure to subscribe below come join the sisterhood no matter your true pronoun or gender identity come join the family alright let's get started okay so before we get into the products let's talk a little bit about what CBD is so CBD stands for cannabidiol which is a chemical compound derived from the cannabis sativa plant aka marijuana CBD is non psychoactive meaning it does not have a strong effect on the brains cognitive activity and doesn't cause the hive associated with marijuana and in fact has been found to have a lot of great health benefits currently there is so much research going on with CBD in terms of cancer research epilepsy but in terms of just 182 CBD in daily life I think I have four health benefits that you know anybody out there would use CBD for these ones I personally use them for so here we go I have pain relief so studies have shown that CBD may help reduce chronic pain by impacting endocannabinoid receptor activity reducing inflammation interacting with neurotransmitters we have anxiety and depression reduction so CBD acts on the brains receptors for serotonin which is a neurotransmitter that regulates mood and social behavior third we have sleep aid so one study showed that CBD improved the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder a disorder in which a person acts out in their dreams RBD is associated with poor sleep and nightmares and then in terms of on the outside personally we have acne treatment so CBD oil may help treat acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to reduce sebum production and also there's a lot of research on CBD in terms of other skin issues like really dry skin eczema and that kind of stuff so those are really the health benefits that I guess I'm gonna be talking about with these particular products and of course we have different ways of using we have ingestion and topical so we're really gonna go through a variety of different products here we're gonna start this off with ingested CBD and this is probably the form that I use the most and these are gummies so here are my favorite ones in particular this is by plus and as you can see I have different kinds here so if we're just starting off with two of these here these are 700 milligrams the CBD per 10 there's 14 gummies in here so that means our 50 milligrams of CBD per gummy that is a lot for a gummy product I actually have now tried and maybe over like 10 different brands of gummies and these are quite small but for me this brand tastes the best but also because there's so much CBD in there and you can taste it a little bit more it's a little bit more bitter obviously with so much packed in there you're not gonna avoid the flavor or like the terpenes of the plant itself so typically because this is 50 all like cut this in half or even into quarters sometimes or you know eat one whole I want to I started taking CBD because of anxiety I definitely deal with daily presence of anxiety I don't think that I have the high some anxiety ever at all but I feel like as a normal person we're all dealing with anxiety you know what issues within our own lives all the time the way that my anxiety Manifest is I just feel like I'm going a million miles an hour while I'm doing nothing and I'll like hold my breath really and I just get really tense and I don't even realize I'm doing it I have to consciously just like let it go CBD really really helps with that it just helps me just relax a little bit and just slow down has absolutely no effect on my brain function like I said or anything it just makes me just relax a little bit more so that's when I started eating these gummies I really like these but the ones I really like these are my favorite just CBD gummies are these ones they are 90 milligrams CBD and 10 milligrams THC now there's a lot of research out there currently that says that CBD is more effective when you have a little bit of THC with it and this is called the entourage effect and it kind of shows that in terms of like the chemical compounds of the plant they work better together than as their individual components so that's why when you look at a product that contains CBD it'll either be full-spectrum broad spectrum or isolate I'm really not going to go too far into that because this is a lot to talk about but I'll just say that full spectrum does have a little bit of THC in there legally for it to be just sold everywhere it has to have under 0.3% I believe so this one is not legal to be sold everywhere I had to get this from a dispensary because in terms of like one dummy actually there's point five milligrams of THC you don't feel it at all when you're eating this one but I do feel like this one in itself gives me the same relaxed feeling the feeling of calm as one of these so this one only has four point five milligrams of CBD per gummy this one has 50 milligrams so I really do believe in that entourage effect there is one more from this company that I think it's worth talking about this is their melatonin gummy this one is 25 milligrams of CBD per gummy one milligram of melatonin so it is a very low amount of melatonin per gummy I find that eating one of these has the same effect as eating like a melatonin pill and I want to say usually those are like five milligrams of melatonin so I really like to use this I don't eat melatonin super regularly but I do have racing thoughts sometimes like I said my anxiety can carry like into the night so sometimes taking something like this really does help and I will say that in terms of like whole flour marijuana or something like that I do use like a little indica pen to go to sleep as well that's pretty much my the scent of my marijuana usage but of course I live in California and it's all legal I use it to help me go to sleep but sometimes if I just have this I don't need that the pen at all I do know on their website you can purchase any of these separately and you can also buy these three as a pack which I did and like I said I had to get the one with th seed a little bit of THC and they're from a dispensary another brand of gummies that I do enjoy our CBD effects and this brand in itself has so many options for CBD they have got like gummies tinctures everything so and I believe on the site that might even have packs you know that you can have a variety pack of different things so if you're just looking into like diving into CBD and just trying whatever you want this is a great company to go to I like the concert or this one and itself too because it's pretty small pack I think they're like eight gummies or there were four gummies no eight gummies in here these ones for only five milligrams per gummy so you're not going crazy oh oh like going 50 milligrams and you don't have to obviously cut it up all by yourself so if you're really very new to CBD I think this is a a brand to look into I think that they have one like small pack like this left and it's there like spirulina you're not gonna get this specific flavor but you're gonna get the same like five milligrams CBD gummies another thing actually that I really do want to circle back to about doing your research is you really have to look at the ingredient list in the back and if you can't see it if they're not displaying it on the website do not buy from that website because there are some brands they label their CBD like gummies in particular like extra chil CBD and actually they've added melatonin to it without telling you explicitly on the packaging like you look at this one it's called sleep blackberry tea with melatonin there was one brand that my sister really liked no where on the packaging did it say CBD with melatonin but she was like Stephanie these ones are so good for sleep every time I just eat one of these gummies it knocks me out right away and I was like whoa that sounds like it's a little bit too relaxing but maybe my sister's just very sensitive to CBD so I bought it and I remember it was like 5:00 p.m. I was working on my computer and maybe like 45 minutes later I was like I'm so tired right now what's going on at first it felt like I was just like really relaxed so I was like this is crazy this did not have that much CBD in it and also like it's making me not just relax but really sleepy then I just went ahead and looked at the packaging and you know back here it said melatonin I was just shocked because I went on the website on the page of the gummi know we're on there to say anything about melatonin until you went to this teeny little ingredient list at the very bottom area that you had to like click a tab for and then under everything it said melatonin so just do your research and look over everything before buying a product and if a product doesn't explicitly say that has something like melatonin in it I'm not sure if I would trust that brand so next up after gummies the product that I use the most are tinctures so I have two here for you I have one by Lorde Jones this is their royal oil a thousand milligrams CBD and then I have this one by anda which is their full-spectrum CBD hemp extract now the Lord Jones royal oil is advertised as being topical and I do use it in that way as well but I didn't have the pleasure of meeting one of the cofounders of Lord Jones Cyndi Capobianco and she did tell me that this isn't just about as well because all that's in here is I believe grapeseed oil and the CBD oil one dropper pool is 40 milligrams of CBD so maybe I'll you know do half put it underneath my tongue and just hold it there for a minute if you're really not trying to mess with a lot of added ingredients you don't want you know any sugars or anything from the gummies this could be a great way to go and it is a very multifunctional product because I do have some neck shoulder pain issues and this is a product this is the first really effective CBD product that I found to really help with my my pain in my neck I think especially topically the thing that I really grasp about CBD is that it reduces inflammation and inflammation can be the cause of a lot of bodily issues in terms of pain management skin issues a lot of it has to do with inflammation and this product actually what they recommend is to use it in your skincare so you could put it in your moisturizer a little drop of that or even end it just on your face but like I said this one I use mostly for ingestion and if I were to put it topically like on my shoulder and then this one by and I just wanted to mention it because I haven't used it too much but I have seen a friend who does like this brand I need to look into it a little bit more I believe actually the all the packaging has changed very drastically since I received this one but if you are looking into another brand if you look into this one if you just don't want to taste anything at all you don't want to deal with any oils you don't want to deal with any gummies we have capsules here for you of course so I have two here where I'm from CBD effects again it's one these little envelopes there is 25 milligrams of CBD per capsule and then we have a little jar here of the Lord Jones hemp derived CBD gel capsules this one as well has 25 milligrams of CBD per capsule you know in terms of all these methods of ingestion it really comes down to I guess just your preference personally for me a lot of CBD is about the process I guess and it is I hey it's the word of like mindfulness of understanding that I am you know rubbing this thing on me or eating this thing to help calm me down or to help me in some way so I enjoy that aspect of CBD cuz it makes me kind of focus and be like okay just chill out this is what I'm trying to do to help myself so it's a little bit of a self-care moment if you don't need that moment for yourself like go ahead and just take a capsule or you know this could be that process for you as well I personally have not used these too much because I enjoy using the other ways but I have gifted these to friends you know a bunch of these in the bottle I have gifted to a friend and they were dealing with some real pain issues in their back and they said that this one really helped them along with other products I did give them though I'll talk about the other one in a sec it but yeah this is just a way that you'd want to ingest EBD go ahead and try it in terms of incorporating CBD into your daily life I have been enjoying some these products that make it even more of I guess like a ritual so I have a couple honey products here so this first one is from potli this is their cannabis infused raw honey this has 100 milligrams of CBD and 10 milligrams of THC so this is another one of those that you might have to purchase from a dispensary I believe this one is only sold in California and again because it has the little bit of THC in there you get that entourage effect to make it a little bit more effective this is something that I would put into you know anything that you want honey some tea you put it on some granola it just incorporates CBD in another way into your daily life without maybe making it feel so Medical like you're not taking a tincture or a capsule you just have it in your honey and this honey tastes great this brand potli is wonderful the founders are fell and Christine very are my Faria girls and I feel like they're killing it I have another product here from them that I want to talk about this is a product that I really really like and then if you're looking for one that has absolutely no teach C in there that you could just purchase online this one is from iki pers natural this is their beat chill raw honey and hemp there is 500 milligrams high potency hemp oil which is CBD in there I actually personally know the founder of bee keepers Naturals as well which is so cool so now I've talked about three female or four female founders but her name is Carly Stein she started bee keepers naturals because she actually has grown up has lived with her whole life with an autoimmune disorder and she found that natural bee products like propolis and royal jelly and I guess now added with CBD actually really helps with her extra so you're looking for just a really nice honey that has some CBD in there as well but no THC you can look into this one I have one more food product here again from potli and this is their hemp infuse extra virgin olive oils so this is cold-pressed estate Tuscan olive oil with 250 milligrams of hemp derived CBD again just one of those products where you can put it on to a salad you know just put it into your daily life and this olive oil is like really really delicious this is my highlight my special occasion not a special occasion but I wouldn't I would not cook with this olive oil I would use it for something raw I mean my favorite dressing for our salad would be some olive oil and some nice balsamic vinegar and we're good to go so you're fairly new to CBD and the idea of taking a pill or gummy or something is not practical for your life but you are a tea drinker or you're a salad eater you know this could be the form that would fit into your lifestyle earlier I mentioned my friend who I gave these capsules to who was having some really bad back problems I'm not sure it she it was like a pinched nerve feeling but she's not positive that's what it was but it made her very immobilize some of this one for her to put on topically and this is the bebo therapy's high potency CBD body balm there is 750 milligrams of CBD in this jar so topically what this balm claims to do is to reduce inflammation so if you're having just general body aches maybe just from working out this is a product that you could rub onto your muscles to help you out the other day Michael had a really weird back spasm it happened while he was bike riding and thankfully he wasn't that far away I think he was just like in Chinatown so I had to drive and go pick him up like he could not move his back was in so much pain it was actually really scary but when we go home he took a hot shower and then I rubbed this on its back for him oh no it was it was like his shoulder within his shoulder blade down his back you know some it was really weird but I rub this onto him for like half an hour and what they do recommend is to keep this on for at least half an hour and I think that it really helped obviously it's a combination of things like he took a hot shower clearly I'm giving him a massage which I think in itself helped there are other ingredients in here a lot of really nice oils that could help but in itself as a balm I feel like it does give some relief the CBD in there gives some real relief in terms of physical aches and pains this one plus the Royal oil are ones that I personally have used on my back and my neck for the pains that I have and you know when you're rubbing it on yourself you clearly can't really work it in and I personally have felt just that strain and my neck down to my shoulder just like loosen up after having this on for an hour it just says it just feels so much better even now like I still have the issues if I'm doing this all I'm hearing is just like I can't got crack all throughout my back you know just when I'm on my computer I'm hunched over and that's my tension as well that's my stress I I carry all in my shoulders and I hold my breath when I'm doing stressful things so all of it all CBD kind of helps me with those issues without having you know necessarily to take the next step into taking other things I will say this bomb is not the most friendly in terms of soaking into the skin it definitely is one that's great for massages because you can just keep working working working with it it does not soak in that well but that just means that a little bit goes a really long way because if you just use a teeny tiny bit of it it will obviously spread thin and soak in but it just is it's just I know it smells great it's a really nice bomb but yeah be careful if I don't know laying down on your white sheets or anything because it does a little bit of a tint on there and if you're slathering it on you know clearly you see that it has a color to it we're gonna jump into some other skin care products before we really hop into the face stuff there's another bomb here by Lord Jose and this is their high CBD formula body balm and this has 200 milligrams of CBD in there so you know this one over here has 750 this is 200 I would say if you are looking for something for aches and pains and those kind of things for inflammation of the muscles this is one that I would more recommend this one I don't even think that they don't claim anything about helping your muscles or helping aches and pains this one is just like a balm that you would put on for really dry skin the thing that lower John's really talks about in terms of CBD with this product is that it is very soothing and very a restorative ingredient and it is really good for dry cracked skin so especially now that we are all washing our hands so much using so much hand sanitizer this is the kind of product that like at the end of the day I'll like rub on my knuckles and my cuticles of course like I said with the previous product there are other ingredients within this like beeswax and oils that do help with that I think this product is a good example of how CBD can be really incorporated into your regular products in your everyday life it's not a miracle ingredient every single time they're claiming in this one that is just good for you know maybe some dry skin some cracked skin it's not going to solve your arthritis or anything so just do your research I guess on the product with CBD that you're purchasing so I have two more skincare products here another one from Lourdes Jones I just you know I think Lourdes Jones is maybe was the first CBD brand to go into Sephora they really did break out in the high-end skincare realm I really don't know a lot of other skincare brain ants that have CBD in them so that's why there's so much Lord Jones products if you have any recommendations for me please let me know in terms of CBD skincare clearly I have a lot of other brands that I like with CBD but I just haven't seen much CBD skincare that I really like because Lord Jones uses some really awesome ingredients outside of the CBD but yeah if you have any recommendations for me please let me know the thing in terms of skincare from Lord Jones I think I really like I really really like the most and this is probably the newest one for me is their whole plant formula acid mantle repair this is a CBD moisturizer this is quite a rich cream I am an oily person this is good for all skin types so typically this is my nighttime cream and it's this is gonna last me a long time because I've been using this for a minute and it looks like I haven't even really skimmed the surface you don't need that much at all along with the CBD there are some really great ingredients there's hyaluronic acid so it's highly moisturizing but because it does have the CBD in there it is really a restorative kind of ingredient it is great for acne and it's so funny because I do really love just scrolling through online reviews whether they be really bad or really good and it's it's awesome because on Sephora there are so many positive comments about this from people who look dry skin people who have acne prone skin it just seems like an all-around great very positively reviewed product so if you're looking for a really nice nighttime moisturizer if you are oily or disah all day everyday moisturizer if you got dry skin yeah this is just a really great straightforward moisturizer and the last product for the face that I have here is the Saint Jane luxury beauty serum again this is kind of one of those products that supposed to be for all skin types it has 500 milligrams a full spectrum CBD with 20 potent botanicals so it supposed to hydrate detoxify help with dullness uneven skintone wrinkles it's just kind of supposed to be yeah a miracle serum I haven't been using it for that long but I will say I feel like my skin is glowing afterwards I did have some breakouts that I had like I want to say they started like a week and a half ago I really consistently was using both of these at nighttime and my chin is just like really cleared up and I thought that there was gonna be more popping up but it did kind of back back then they went back in there so I'm gonna continue using this one I would say out of any of the skin products this is the one that I've used the least and it is also the most luxury product that I have here so I'm really being stingy with it but also again from all the reviews that I've read online a lot of different people with different skin types really have been enjoying this product hi Joe I just woke Josie up from snoring heavy sometimes when I'm recording now she just starts snoring so loud that I do have to I have to wake her up because she's just right here in front of the camera well speaking of Josie we do have a product for her this is the blossom full spectrum hemp oil this has 300 milligrams per bottle here this is the one I purchased for medium dogs you administer 0.25 milliliters per 25 pounds of pet weight CBD for pets is super effective I I feel like it might even be the most friendly gateway into CBD for a lot of people because they see immediate effects in their pets whether it be giving it to them during you know hard car rides where dogs have a lot of anxiety during that time or with fireworks so there was one night for some reason that there was a bunch of fireworks going on all outside Josie was a little bit nervous she's not usually nervous about loud noises but I think Michael wasn't around so it made her a bit nervous and I gave her some of the CBD and she calmed right down it was very I don't know it was pretty amazing and I have you know babysat other dogs where they're really anxious dogs and CBD just helps so much so I feel like just in that to see how CBD works for your loved animal and how it calms them down is just a really great testament to how effective CVD can be for you it's all not saying that everything you would give your dog is be good for you but I'm just saying we have a direct example there I do like this brand I feel like there are a lot of CBD for pet brands and a lot of the brands that I'm showing here let me see I know this one onda I saw on their website they have one specifically for dogs so I feel like a lot of brands that make CBD is just smart for them to also make it for pets as well so I would definitely recommend tinctures I'm not so sure about treats but I'm sure those are you know also effective I just have one last form of CBD not for pets but for humans and that is just the flower here so these are from Lowell smokes first off I have their premium hemp smokes so you can actually buy these from Lowell smokes it's just hemp and in this pack they also give you these little matches the packaging little smokes just kills it with the packaging is very very smart and I have gone through a good number of these little pre-rolls like I said I feel like for me personally part of CBD is the ritual and I am NOT a big just like weed smoker like I went sit down and smoke I was gonna say blunt I wouldn't go it's a ton of smoke a lot maybe you know back in my bay area days maybe but I went to sit down and smoke a joint on any given day but I do enjoy that process of sitting down lighting it and just relaxing with it so in a way I can I can have that without the high and we have it here with these CDP rolls if you don't want to have a whole approval because I understand I'll usually have to just like smoke a little bit of it put it out and then doesn't necessarily taste that great you know when you have to relight a joint they also just have the flower so this right here is 3.5 grams or 1/8 of the CBD hemp flour it's just crazy because in my mind like this just this is weak but yeah there's no THC in there it is just CBD is just hump and you can put this in your little pipe and smoke it so that's another option for you if you just really want to have that also I feel like if you're trying to not smoke so much weed but you enjoy that process this could be a great thing you know for you to do just smoke a little CBD so you're you're you having your ritual but you're not getting super stoned all right all those are all of my CBD products I have to show you it was a lot but I wanted to give you some options and I honestly I didn't realize that I really use a lot of sea wheedies so I hope you enjoyed this video before we close this up I did want to touch upon this in that you know currently marijuana is legal in California and in a lot of other states decriminalized in certain states I believe and it really is moving quite rapidly a lot of people a lot of companies are making a ton of money now in this industry and yet there are still thousands of people currently incarcerated for charges as small as carrying marijuana just possession and as a user of these products we need to be mindful and understand and become educated and become advocates for people who are currently in jail for crimes that are no longer criminal and I mean shouldn't not have been criminal in the first place I know myself I need to become more educated on the subject so I would love to hear from you any suggestions for anything that all of us should read about any kind of information or charities or organizations that we should look into because there's there's a lot of information out there but it's hard to really weep through it so I would love your help on that and I would love to be more educated and with that said I hope y'all are well and hope you are staying healthy and safe there's a lot of stuff going on right now and I hope this video maybe gave you a little bit of a break from that and I love you and I will see you in the next video bye", "ohMeUJPyRiQ": "I'm dr. Jason MacDougall I'm a professor of honestly 0 del University and I also too committee at the arthritis Society so cannabis is my family of hem the hem family and marijuana is pretty much the same thing it's just more of a slang term so we prefer to adhere to the scientific naming of cannabis cannabinoid is a hammock it's found within the plant the cannabis plant and it can also be a chemical that mimics the cannabis plant so it could be man-made or it could be naturally occurring in our bodies so they're actually three different types of cannabinoid there are the fatal cannabinoids which are the ones that are found within the cannabis plant the synthetic cannabinoids which are the man-made chemicals the pharmaceutical preparations and then they're the endocannabinoids which are the naturally occurring cannabis like compounds that a caramel produced in our bodies there were many active Cannabis the two most well known ones are THC and CBD THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol and that's the psychoactive component of cannabis CBD is cannabidiol and that has been shown to be effective at controlling pain and inflammation and but it doesn't have the psychoactive properties the same way that THC does so medical cannabis is the cannabis that's prescribed by your doctor and could be an either the herbal form either a synthetic form and there's some evidence to show that it can be effective in alleviating arthritis pain as well as inflammation and fatigue different ways of administering cannabis can be either smoked or ingested in oral form baked into cookies or produced in the oil of butters but they're also synthetic cannabinoids that can be taken as a tablet or as a spray underneath the tongue different strains of cannabis different types of cannabis and they vary and the amount of THC and CBD that they contain and it's important to know that because they may have different impacts in various populations of patients we'll just like any drug there are a number of different side effects associated with cannabis and so it may not be appropriate for all arthritis patients so we really really need more research try and understand the safety profile of the different strains of cannabis there's been a lot of experimental evidence to show that cannabis can be effective in treating the pains of arthritis as well as the inflammation and helping with fatigue but we really need more clinical studies to try and understand benefits and potential limitations of using cannabis so further research into medical cannabis is required so we can understand the different subpopulations of patients who may be responsive to medical cannabis we need to find out the effective dose of medical cannabis some of the interactions with other drugs as well as looking at different delivery systems you", "pf7uWK-slHQ": "[Music] hi it's Madame ruffle studios and welcome to cannabase ik's today we're making a cannabis infused pain relief topical this episode of canna basics is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop save 10% on vaporizers raw rowing papers and accessories and much more with the code canna basics a truffle studios.com let's get started here's what you're gonna need you need some 99% isopropyl alcohol we're putting is about 1215 milliliters you also need some fresh cannabis flowers we're using about 50 grams of fresh harvested flowers you need some fresh to ruffle hours commonly called hells bells about to medium flowers [Music] you also need some rue de also known as common room it's an aromatic herbal plant you need about 15 grams of that and you're also going to need some camphor tablets you need six quarter ounce squares or one and a half blocks camphor tablets are available at pharmacies and also online if you'd like to learn where to get these ingredients and to see the full written recipe please check out our blog site for free on the link in description or here on the screen it'll also be helpful if you have a mortar and pestle and also have large mason jar with a lid now the first step is going to be to manicure and to chop your fresh cannabis I like to destem the buds and use the fresh soft flower portion of the buds and the smaller leaves some pain relief strains that would be excellent for this is Charlotte's Web and Harlequin among many others [Music] using a chef's knife to chop the cannabis makes it very easy to chop the marijuana into very small bits you want to stop short of chopping the cannabis into a pace so it's still easy to collect it from the cutting board and once you have a choppa scoop it all up and put it into the large sealable jar I find that a 64-ounce wide mouth mason jar is perfect for the amount of cannabis that we're using in this recipe today next we would do the same thing that we did with the cannabis to the Rue de plana rue de otherwise known as common rule or herb of grace is an ornamental plant and herb which is recommended by the person who provided this classic home remedy recipe it's used as an arthritis pain reliever much like the cannabis remove the large stems if you want and then chop the root of fine once you have it chopped we're going to put it into the jar with the rest of the canvas next up we need to mash our doctoral or hels belles flour into a paste but first gently press out any of the water that may be collecting with a paper towel a datura is a poisonous plant so do not ingest this or get it into your eyes however the FDA has recognized the medicinal uses of the torah' recently because of the presence of certain chemical compounds now find it's helpful to use a mortar and pestle in doing this but you could also use the back of a spoon into a shallow pan or a plate however you achieve it you need to mash the to medium size flowers into a paste then add about 250 milliliters of alcohol to wash the mortar and pestle and to make sure that he rats all of the datura paste into the jar along with the rinsing alcohol [Music] now add the remaining amount of alcohol needed to fill the jar to about twelve hundred and fifty milliliters now we need to chop or crumble four cubes of camphor blocks until almost powdered then carefully scoop it up and add it into the alcohol mixture into the jar now add the two remaining kaffir tablets into the mixture hold without crumbling them up these two whole ones will help us make an aggregate when we shake and will also help release the cap for a little more slowly as it dissolves into the plant extracts now make sure that you put the lid on the jar and tighten it very securely because now we need to shake vigorously for several minutes now the better you shake the better and faster this process will complete in the long run so stay with it as long as you can the mixture will begin to take on a greenish tint but we still have a while to go because now we let it sit for several days in a cool dark place and shaking it again periodically after several days five to seven days at least the mixture will darken and the green color will saturate into a neon green color after several days the topical is ready to use but you can continue with these optional steps to make it more refined and easy to use product so now you can strain it very carefully through an unbleached coffee filter to remove any of the plant materials this will make it easier if you follow the next step now the product is ready to funnel into a spray or roll-on container so that when you need it you can easily roll or spray it onto the affected areas this top pool can be used as needed on the skin do not ingest it because it will make you very sick also keep it well away from your eyes and children but it is a great for arthritis pain general aches and pains and in muscles

marijuana cannabis products but look it doesn't hurt I'm totally kidding basically um there's this couple out of Maine that follow my channel I think they may be found me from this jarred jam music festival review I did or something anyway New England fam we sing together especially fish fam or just jam band fam you guys know what to do they started following me on like Facebook I think um and then I started following them on Instagram and I saw that they have this THC CBD confectionary situation going on I picture it like them living on this big piece of land in Maine and just like in their sugar shack like the making of the candies but I don't know and then I shouted him out in my end of your vid I forget exactly what I said there's this really cool couple at watch that live in Maine and they make like CBD [ __ ] candies if you ever want me to review any of those for you on the channel like I'm happy to and they hit me up shortly thereafter saying that they had some stuff

mixed a lot of people said but a lot of people said vag a lot of people said why not both actually that was like the most popular answer so I went with the but for now but then maybe in the future we can drive the vagina okay so anyway we are heading to a float I'm going back to NH folks and I inserted the suppository I don't know it was hard like it wasn't in an actual pill so I like you know I don't know but I washed my hands with soap after so hopefully that's you know I don't want to contaminate the tank okay so I'll let you know how it goes I know you're not supposed to get like super header high more of a body high but this should be perfect for the float so we'll see all right guys we're post float post depository I'm super relaxed no obviously that's partially because of the float but I will say that once I like got into the tank whatever I was really easily able to kind of just slip into a relaxation and fall asleep and it was maybe one of the best naps I've had in the tank since I started floating the suppository insertion like I think I need to get a little more clarity on that I'm assuming I don't put like the actual plastic inside I feel like that'd be a bad idea but I think I need to get a little more precise like with placement and squeeze through technique but I'm gonna do it of the V next time because I think it would be so good for cramps but I'm feeling a super great super relaxed and gonna go home and make another meal delivery kit which you'll be seeing all about that soon so okay guys thank you for watching this episode of and slating show see you next time goodbye a lot of you wanted me to put it in the B some of you wanted me to put it in the B and the rest you wanted me to put it in the BMV I probably will cut some of this out but", "V7er_qhbNCA": "hey guys what's up today we're going to show you how to make cbd infused honey we're going to be using a nug smasher touch and a decarb capsule [Music] next we're going to smash 14 grams of blueberry number seven in a nug smasher 14 gram 120 micron bag and we're gonna smash this using bottle text style meaning we're going to invert our corners to make sure they overlap [Music] next we're going to load our nug into the bag [Music] remember to be mindful of negative space in the bag rosin can get trapped in there taking away from your yield go ahead and lower the plate so that the opening is about the height of your bag [Music] so [Music] here we go [Music] you know where are we [Music] here we go grab your nug smasher everything tool and collection plate go ahead and remove all of your rosin off of the parchment paper [Music] tell me [Music] know [Music] next we are going to add one gram of our cbd rosin to our rosin pot [Music] heat your plates up to 240 degrees fahrenheit [Music] once the plates reach their desired temperature throw the decarb capsule in there and let it decarb for about 40 [Music] minutes [Music] here we go carefully release your plate pressure to see if your silicone rosin pot is still expanding inside of the decarb capsule [Music] if it's still expanding reapply pressure with the plates and wait a little bit longer as you can see we have done this about three times once all the pressure has been released you're going to want to grab a towel or an oven mitt to pull the decarb capsule from your machine [Music] during the decarb process rosin will liquefy making it much harder to collect throwing your rosin in the freezer for a couple of minutes will allow your rosin to return to a state in which it is much easier to collect we added 12 fluid ounces roughly 200 milliliters of honey to our beaker and we set our hot plate to 100 degrees fahrenheit one important thing to remember is that honey's quality and taste will start to degrade at 110 degrees fahrenheit be sure to stay at the 100 degrees fahrenheit mark go ahead and stir your honey while it warms up this will ensure that all our honey will heat up evenly [Music] while our honey is heating up we'll head back over to our freezer to collect our cbd rosin and get it ready to infuse with our honey once your honey has reached 100 degrees fahrenheit go ahead and stir in your cbd [Music] you may need a spoon to stir the honey and help the infusion process along when all of your cbd rosin infuses with the honey you're all done the process is very simple it just takes a little bit of time go ahead and add your cbd infused honey to your tea and enjoy let us know in the comments below what you plan on putting your cbd honey on thanks again for watching and

anxiety sometime a month to feel a little by now so it's something I'd like to see the back off there's a cannabis extract that's now so popular that you can buy it in just about everything from oils and vape liquids to shampoo and makeup to drinks and even chocolate its classed as a supplement and is being sold in shops and online it's called CBD and at high doses a regulator type is being used in medical studies and it's getting some positive results it's everywhere but there's just so much conflict in advice as well and this song which to choose from two months ago I haven't taken any yet I'm not sure of but I'm not sure how they'll interact okay now some are I mean I've since been diagnosed with other things I've tried a number of prescription drugs mainly antidepressants nothing or pulling me through so you get to a point where you'll just try anything especially when it's been advertised as something more natural I've looked at a couple of sellers website I'll try five milligrams but also a percentage strength I'm just not really sure what all different colors mean I guess the fundamental questions that I want to know over the next couple of days is will it work for me will it work for others how will it work what dosage should I return should all those be taken hi I'm Nathalie thanks for showing us around hi [Music] so we go never look a crop that I planted ten days ago yeah that's good yeah I'm just curious to find out what you grow here and how it works from your side well we grow hemp and flax for fiber we've got a whole processing plant so we can sell clean fiber 4 goes into mattresses and loft insulation by the beginning of August hopefully this will be 10 feet tall travelers people are interested what's the difference between this and marijuana well hemp and marijuana of both cannabis plants yeah but you've got different varieties that produce different cannabinoids how illegal is this and when does it get to the point where it becomes illegal we are perfectly legal because we're licensed by the Home Office to produce hemp strong we're not allowed to harvest the leaf and flower so we have to leave the leaf and flower in the field what do you do with the leaf flower do just leave it there for rest ok so the bit we're throwing away is the part of the plant that the CBD has been extracted from it frustrates me somewhat that the OL CBD producing companies in the UK are allowed to bring leaf and flower in from abroad but we can't produce it if the leaves and flowers go to West well of are they CBD UK are y'all coming from all the UK produced products it's a the core information Europe Oh America ok didn't realize that I'm much of loss people don't most people do when people hear cannabis they usually think getting high and although CBD is cannabis it doesn't get you high and it's legal and that's because cannabis is actually the name of a group of plants and both marijuana and hemp belong to that family cannabis plants have around 100 different chemicals in them called cannabinoids and they can have various effects on us marijuana plants have been bred to have higher levels of a psychoactive chemical known as THC whereas hemp plants have high levels of the chemicals CBD which is not psychoactive and can sometimes have pain relieving and calming effects from researching the CBD oil I just assumed I it was all made in the UK well what I've read nowhere states differently I've been learning today that the local homegrown farmers kind of amused a bit that make the CBD just a little bit of doubt and confusion once again so it's a really exciting area I think especially in psychosis because we don't really have treatments there are as effective as we'd hope and they often come along with lots of very unpleasant side effects it seems that CBD is relatively safe and well tolerated so the study that I worked on looked at people who were at risk of developing psychosis and we gave them a six hundred milligram dose of CBD or a placebo for three weeks and we found that CBD was able to normalize the dysfunction that you see in certain brain areas have got involved in psychosis I haven't tried it but I've opened it and it stinks like I bought this one offline and it's two point five milligrams of CBD per drop that that's probably not going to be very effective if you're looking at 300 milligrams or 600 milligrams I think the risk here is that we just don't have the evidence of whether it works or not the research that we know about is looking at sort of quite high doses 600 to 2,000 milligrams and we know that this could have a clinical benefit but there's the things that you can get on the high street often they have much lower levels and we just don't know basically whether they work or not I know lots of people report that this is helpful however it's difficult to know how much of that is sort of because of the drug or because of a placebo effect and often a placebo effect isn't a bad thing what would you recommend what was your advice before purchasing a product online I think it's important to speak to your doctor if you're considering it because the other thing that we don't know about CBD is the effects that it might have when you're taking another medication for example our bodies are full of receptors that react to cannabis these receptors are part of an internal system which helps control our bodily functions such as our appetite pain relief and coping with stress and anxiety it's called the endocannabinoid system or ECS and it got its name because it was people's use of cannabis that helped lead to its discovery we naturally produce these chemicals all the time and the chemicals THC and CBD from cannabis plants also affect our ECS and can have various effects on our bodies and that's why scientists are now researching potential treatments using them it looks fairly positive I might help man it might be a good impact something but I am still there looking to see what is inside a lot of thought and how much CBD is in it my vaults been open and passed around a little bit so I bought a new bottle do the testing on to make sure that it wasn't contaminated in any other way [Applause] [Music] and can this machine tell us what other chemicals and that being the CBD while CBD and THC are the main ones it also looks for other THC precursors within your product well CBD oil is legal that does depend on how much THC it varies depending on your product and no matter if you had a one meal bottle or a one liter bottle you could don't you would only be allowed one milligram of THC right now in the UK there isn't regulation or manufacturing standards specifically made for CBD supplement products but there is a law that means that the amount of THC that's a psychoactive chemical that gets you high must be less than one milligram per item and it doesn't matter how big the bottle or product is it can still only have one milligram of THC in the whole thing there's strict regulation around the type of CBD that's being used in medical studies that you can't buy online or in shops and there will probably be more official guidance and even laws around low-dose products like CBD oil very soon so of all CBD products in the UK tested and regulated in the same way that we're doing now so in theory yes for every product released in the UK they would need to comply to labeling standards they have the correct amount of CBD that they're advertising within their product if you've ever want to check a supplier should be able to provide you with a certificate that says we've had it tested for this match this is what's in it we ran a series of tests on the product and identified that the THC content within the product was just over four times the legal limit so the legal limit is one milligram per container and we identified just over four milligrams in this in this product four milligrams of THC isn't gonna do anything notable to a person you'd have to have a considerable amount of THC in there for there to be a psychoactive response we found that the CBD content was was pretty much spot-on to what they'd claimed on the product when you extract CBD from the hemp plant you end up with THC as a by-product so it could be the extraction process wasn't cetera as it should have been at separating the cannabinoids properly it could also be a pure misunderstanding of the law the problem is and if you know how to interpret it it's just a page with a load of numbers on it so I think the there needs to be a simpler way of explaining this to to the consumer that doesn't rely on complicated reports on this I would say to Natalie don't worry you know that the THC content in there is very very low don't fear CBD products as a result of this experience and as the industry grows and becomes more mature brands will be explaining better to consumers about their products and making sure that those products comply with all regulations [Music] [Music] [Music] all I have learnt so far I don't think I meditate CBD oil just until a few more studies and tests of being completed I've never seen no attacking it especially because it's becoming more prominent in the media and in the research labs but I definitely keep an open mind about taking it [Music]", "zYFmmX2MxZQ": "Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from\nSpineCare in St. Joseph, MI. In this video we\u2019re going to ask: can CBD\nOil really help with relieving sciatica? Is it effective, and strong enough to actually\ntackle the pain? Or is it all smoke and mirrors and too good\nto be true? Let\u2019s find out! Before we start, though, I want to say in\nfull disclosure that I\u2019m not benefiting from or promoting any product or brand of\nCBD oil. This video is just my personal thoughts on\nthe matter that I wanted to share. If you\u2019ve ever suffered from sciatica, you\nknow how much of a nightmare it can be. It pretty much makes almost every daily activity\nuncomfortable and inconvenient. For many suffers, they rely on over-the-counter\npainkillers to make it through the day. And in more severe cases, pain management\nthrough opioid pain medications, steroids, and injections may be prescribed. It\u2019s no secret that the opioid epidemic\nis real, and many people have reservations about taking something that has a high risk\nof side-effects, including addiction. That\u2019s why the appeal of CBD is growing,\nsince it offers the potential for effective pain relief on top of being natural, non-habit\nforming, and having little to no side-effects. No doubt, CBD use is also growing steadily,\nand is being used for treating conditions such as anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and\nmuch more. So let\u2019s take a look at how CBD may help\nrelieve sciatica pain, and start by going over what exactly CBD oil is and where it\ncomes from. CBD, or cannabidiol, is commonly known as\nhemp oil. It is a form of cannabis, which includes the\nwell known marijuana plant. Cannabis contains a number of different compounds,\neach with different effects on the body and mind. The two main active ingredients are Tetrahydrocannabinol,\nor THC, and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the part that produces the characteristic\n\u2018high\u2019 of marijuana, while CBD is associated with therapeutic qualities and is not psychoactive. Producers of CBD have developed cannabis strains\nthat have virtually no THC, primarily hemp plants. The oil produced from these hemp plants contain\nless than 0.3% THC, which means it is not intoxicating and DOES NOT have any mind-altering\nproperties. Due to that, CBD oil is federally legal in\nevery state and does not require a prescription. I want to note, though, it is also not regulated\nby the FDA and is considered a supplement. Next, let\u2019s move on to some key aspects\nof sciatica. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with sciatica, especially\nits causes and symptoms, and want to know more, I\u2019m going to provide a link in this\nvideo\u2019s description to another video I\u2019ve done that goes over it in more detail. So check it out after watching this video\nto learn more. Sciatica is pain that travels, or radiates,\nalong the path of the sciatic nerve. This large nerve begins in your lower back\nand forks into two (left and right) to travel from the buttocks, into the legs and feet. Sciatica has a couple main causes, with the\nmost common being a lumbar herniated disc that presses onto and pinches a nearby nerve. The other is due to spinal stenosis, which\nis when the spinal canal (where the nerves travel through) narrow and close off, again\npinching nearby nerves. The sciatic nerve is very sensitive, and when\nit becomes compressed or irritated by one of the reasons above, it may cause symptoms\nlike mild to debilitating pain, tingling, or numbness into the areas it travels. One of the things that makes sciatica pain\ndifficult to treat is that it is often a combination of two different kinds of pain, nociceptive\nand neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is caused when nerves are\nreacting to tissue damage, which sends signals to the central nervous system (your brain)\nthat something has gone wrong. Neuropathic pain is when the nerves themselves\nare damaged, usually through compression causing inflammation and irritation. So what is it about CBD that makes it potentially\neffective in taking on sciatica pain? It\u2019s this: CBD stimulates a part of the\nbrain called the endocannabinoid system, a system responsible for communicating \"good\nand bad signals\" throughout your body. When CBD stimulates this system, it can change\na bad signal to a good one, which may have the ability to alleviate both neuropathic\nand nociceptive pain, as well as helping to reduce inflammation. Currently, though, studies on cannabis, including\nboth CBD and THC, are still in the early stages. I could not find one definitive study directly\nlinking CBD use and pain management of sciatica. However, the process in which CBD works is very\npromising and could be an all-natural alternative to opioid drugs and other painkillers. I can say though, that CBD oil WILL NOT cure\nany underlying issue causing sciatica, such as spinal stenosis or a herniated disc. So please do not take it as a substitute for\ngetting the proper care you need from a licensed healthcare professional! For those sciatica sufferers that have tried\nCBD oil, please leave your experiences and results in the comments section below, all\nof us would like to hear from you! Also, if you have any other comments or questions,\nplease feel free to leave them and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for watching!", "4XIx3Ld47Ek": "I welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber scriber welcome back thank you so much for joining so today we're gonna be doing THC infused lip balm so this stuff is really really nice and what's really great is you put it on your lips and you're always doing this during the day so you are getting your THC and not in high doses and you can reapply it any time that you like and you can make it in any flavor that you like any sense that you like you can add essential oils for other benefits that you may like to add to it and it's fairly straightforward simple recipe so without a further ado I'll get started alright so the ingredients that you're going to need is all first of all your THC infused coconut oil so I did a small infusion here if you want to know how to learn how to do a small infusion I have a video on that you can check that out and so we're going to need two tablespoons of our infused coconut oil we're going to need two tablespoons of beeswax pellets and you can get these at any health food store or you can order them online and you want to make sure that you get 100% pure beeswax and food grade because it's gonna go on your lips so anything that you get you always want to make sure it's food grade we're gonna be using two tablespoons of shea butter and again you want to make sure you're using 100% pure shea butter now if you want to add a little bit of tinted coloring you can use some food coloring but literally like a half the drop or drop because that's gonna stain your lip and you lip balms generally are for color you can use a slight bit of tint so you can use like an oil-based color or you can use powders or you can use mica powders if you've got those on hand for you could add essential oils or benefits whatever benefits that you'd like you can add in some essential oils or for our fragrance and then for flavor if you like you can add in a little bit of your favorite flavoring and again you want to you guys this is candy flavoring which and you want to use a very small amount so that's our ingredients for that we're gonna need for our lip balm now what we're going to put it in is I got these from all this stuff from the dollar store so I picked up these little tiny jars these are probably a little bit too small but can't be too fussy these I got in a travel kit these are actually the perfect size and they came with a few other few other bottles that you've gotten your travel kit so if you make other lotions or leave some things you've got those in there as well if you'd like and it has the two sides is a smaller one and the slightly bigger one which is really handy or the other is if you want a lip balm - what I did is I just bought a package they came to in a package of some no-name lip balm and you're just gonna twist it up what I did was I put it in the freezer first these are nice because this one will come these come right out screw right out and then you just want to gently remove that and then you can use to use something sharp to pull out the rest of it the other thing is being difficult just take a little piece of paper towel with something sharp here and stuff it in then you can just go around and clean it and there you go then just screw it back in you take it all the way down and we can fill it up and then you've got a tube then what you can do is you just peel off the label there you go now you've got an empty lip balm too so that's everything that we need to get started oh sorry and what we're gonna be cooking is a French press and we're gonna be doing it in boiling water on a pot so you want to get a pot of boiling water going you just want to fill up enough water that's going to just cover the your oil you don't want to go too high otherwise your French press is gonna Bop around in the water and can fall over so just enough water that's gonna cover your oil all right so it's pretty straightforward we're gonna put everything into the French press pour in your can of your can of oil I'm so used to working with can of butter use your can of oil your shave and then our two tablespoons of beeswax pellets our beeswax pellets and have your essential oil you can add in two to three drops and if you want to add some flavor I'm gonna add a little Mangal I figure orange mango is gonna be used I you picked orange essential oil because it's brightening so I thought that would be nice for lips brightening your lips giving some plumpness to them and brightening them up and I thought orange mango would be a nice flavor and it also goes well with the coconut does you have a slight coconut flavor from your oil and we're gonna add in the 1/2 a teaspoon a lecithin and I said less instant it's really good for your skin it's good for you as well as it's gonna help to emulsify and bind everything together lecithin is optional you don't have to use it as well as essential oils or the flavoring you don't have to use it you could just go straight oh natural oh I don't know how well that would taste good it tastes very coconut and canta canta canta butter ish we've got everything in there and we're just gonna put the lid on you want to put it just above you don't want it to sit on top you want to keep it just above your mix your your lip balm mixture and then we're gonna place it in our water then you want to place your French press in the water you want to have just enough water to come above your lip balm mixture you don't want to go too high because otherwise the French pass well bobble around and it'll fall over see and you want to keep the plunger I said above it look just slip that into the water it's gonna simmer for half an hour and when we get up back we'll fill it will fill up the tubes and the containers and get it set up and try it out and about every five or ten minutes you just want to come along and cut it and just do the plunger up and down just to kind of keep move things around or you can just take it off and just put use a spoon or spatula to mix things up already so our lip balm has been simmering here for a half an hour I just took the lid off of it and what you want to do is turn your heat off but what still leave it in the pot here and what you want to do is you just want to whisk it binding everything together you want to do it in the hot water because it does solidify very quickly so you want to keep it warm let it sit and let the air bubbles come out of it and then we're gonna get ready to pour so if you're using a little lip balm tube the easiest way to do it is to get a funnel that's right in the top and just pour it in and just keep an eye you just want to come up to the do your top of your funnel overflows just throw a little bit back in we can clean up the rest later just when I just a touch more what just to come over the little screw up and that's why I do it in in a little bowl here so that we can collect anything that pours over those we don't waste anything so I'm gonna just let that set up and we'll clean up the sides in a minute so that's a lip balm then very easy obviously for a container just pour it in so we're just gonna let these set up it's always I say it solidifies very quickly you can already see on the sides it's already solidifying and on the bottom so you're gonna let those just sit for about probably about a half hour to an hour until they completely sit or you can put them in the refrigerator actually with the lip balm you can just use the if you've got the French press still you can just pour it in you don't really need to use the funnel but if you're having difficulty then you can it's actually easier without the funnel you just want to fill it up - right about there so our lip balm is all set up now and it's firmed up in the container he looks just like store-bought lip balm I've got that in them in the container and then the one in the tube so it works just like chop stick let's see now let's try it and see what it feels like so my first time making it so wow that's nice damn oh you gotta try this out of this is really really nice alright so I hope you give it a try and let me know if you liked it if you do give it a try if you've got any comments or any questions please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'd love to hear from you and I think that's all I've got for today I hope you look forward to more videos to come and thank you so much for joining me you have a great day [Music]", "0U_VnKq42XI": "hello everyone I'm Rick boxer I'm a urologist at UCLA and I am happy to be able to speak to you about cannabis and the urologic practice my colleague Neil Baum helped me with with this and I always give him all the credit he richly deserves and so in the this particular program we'll cover how does cannabis work the myths associated with cannabis safety of cannabis and the urologic applications the my journey to learn about cannabis started when I saw a patient a number of years ago who had been esthetic renal carcinoma he was in the intractable pain and anything that we gave to him was of no benefit and so therefore we he came to me and said I'd like to try cannabis and what do you think and quite frankly at that point I had no knowledge about it whatsoever nor did my colleagues I thought about it and and after he came back and had a very particularly terrible experience because the person who was supposed to help him could not help him and it was about seven or eight years ago in Los Angeles before that was when was only medical and so I decided I was going to learn more about this and as I learned about it I wrote about it and have been speaking about it but more importantly I wanted to share my knowledge with my colleagues because this is a patient driven and a patient driven medication and people want to know about it and it's only the best thing for your medical care to know about it I'm in no way advocating it I'm just simply saying knowledge is important so with that I want to proceed the responsibility of a urologist I believe is to just know a little bit about or even more about the use of the cannabis now it just the tip of the iceberg is some of the conditions that may be helped and we'll talk about those conditions in a moment but there is so much to learn about cannabis and one of the problems is that because it's Schedule one that is it's not allowed really to be researched within the universities the Schedule one has prevented and has become an obstacle to knowledge which i think is wrong so all of us end up having anecdotes and stories by patients and that is not the best way of guiding our care for the patient we really need to have evidence base on medicine and that evidence-based medicine will come but first the obstacle of being on schedule one like heroin or LSD has to be overcome 95 percent of us live in a state in that has either medical or fully legal matter of marijuana and only if you live in Nebraska South Dakota or Idaho is a completely prohibited otherwise your patients have the access to medical or for that matter recreational but we're doling and we talking about access to obtaining marijuana for medical purposes interestingly enough it's been illegal for so many years and it's been it's been considered to be dangerous all the way back into the 30s and far before that but in the 30s when there was reefer madness or than the 40s movies that that portrayed it as as a terrible drug well if you go back you find out that the Declaration in penance was written on hemp paper and so people have known about this for a long time the consumption of cannabis is based on speed rate of metabolism and choice there are various methods by which you can you can consume you can smoke or you can vape you can hear this person is using a bong which is water pipe you can consume in in candy or foods of some sort and what happens is that if the person takes cannabis by smoking or vaping you they get a much rep more rapid concerned by the cannabis you it's eaten it's a much slower effect because it has to be metabolized well under those circumstances some people will take one or two pieces of candy or or a brownie or a piece of candy in a candy bar and say oh nothing's happening and then they'll take a second or third piece and by the time the third piece or fourth piece is ever consumed the the effect will become multiplied that's why people need to be very cautious when they take medication through food which is metabolized now it's very interesting to me that the vascular system the lymphatic system and the nervous system have all been well described for hundreds of years and yet the endocannabinoid system was only discovered in 1992 and as you can see from the receptors the receptor of CB 1 which is THC which is more the the portion that people think about when they think about affect psychologically or neurologically or cv2 which is also known as CBD and people think well how can possibly have a medication or a drug that affects all parts of the body I mean literally soup to nuts and we are urologist we know the difference and so we have to wonder what is it about this drug this Mitali the CBD or TC that really affects everything well the fact is that there are different receptors for CB 1 against CB 2 and CB 2 are principally the ones that that will affect things that your urologist want to take care of particularly in reducing inflammation or reducing pain and so when you understand that the receptors throughout the body are different then you understand why CBD and THC and generally marijuana will affect different people in different ways the facts of about cannabis are that it's been used for thousands of years and it's but I showed you the number of states 33 states and history Columbia where it's medicinal should be um this Columbia is also recreational um it's off-limits for scientific investigation it's classified as Schedule one as I mentioned be same as heroin and LSD and in fact there's more research been done on heroin and LSD than on marijuana because of all the laws and truly became a and has become a political plant and there's limited evidence for abuse yes it can be abused but there is limited evidence and that's once again because the research does not allow people to really find out what is in that plant the plant has a hundred and forty-four chemicals within it and we only know of a few so cannabis and evidence-based medicine is critical in my mind because that's what we've been working on as to clinicians all of our professional lives patient values and preferences and best evidence and clinical expertise all Center in evidence-based medicine and since it is truly a patient driven medication people don't will not go to a doctor generally speaking a urologist and say what do you think I should take and the urologist starts off by saying take cannabis that's not going to happen what happens is the patient comes in and says I want to take cannabis how will that affect me because it's um it's been controversial and and promoted by lots of different organizations and groups and of people finally the National Academy of Sciences the medicine looked at it and put out in nineteen ninety nine twenty one years ago of a book that showed that the it is effective conclusively effective for chronic pain nausea and vomiting with chemotherapy that is chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting as well as muscle spasm and MS now those are the three things that that the National Academy is founded it is conclusively helpful for but there are complications and that's why the complications and pediatrics and pregnancy is that you the grade there is greater number of NICU NICU admissions in women who smoke marijuana or consume marijuana while pregnant there's also premature births and underweight well you think about it if those women were to take any other drug even alcohol for example or or other drugs such as cocaine which are much much more addictive of course they too would get greater number of ICU admissions and premature deaths that doesn't excuse it but it just shows you that that drugs are bad for pregnant women there's no conclusive evidence that it causes heart attacks strokes and diabetes it doesn't cause respiratory diseases such as chronic like chronics cigarette smoking there is some thought that if you smoke every day multiple marijuana cigarettes it would have some lung disease or issues but knowing very very very few people do that and actually including in California for decades people were smoking considerable amounts of marijuana and and studies show that they really were not affected like they would be had they been smoking cigarettes it does not improve immune competence and some people have even thought it would be good for treatment of testicular cancer there's no evidence of that whatsoever but for cardiovascular effects it does elevate systolic and diastolic soon aunt after consuming marijuana causes tachycardia increases sympathetic stimulation decreases a time to angina and there is a slight increase in Aminah and MI for one hour post marijuana use so now just like everything else in life you gotta take consideration any comorbidities and so therefore if someone were to have significant cardiovascular disease you would say that it's a bad idea to smoke marijuana for any purpose now another myth is that it's a gateway drug that has been disproven repeatedly and yet it is repeatedly spoken about and so it's all you can do is try and try again the National Academy of Medicine in the Institute of Medicine in 1999 the same book that I reference before has indicated that it is not a gateway drug but what we really need is research not anecdotes so that people will be able to know what - if it indeed is helpful another myth is that it causes cancer does not and when a person comes in to be seen and they ask about cannabis in the medical in a minute and see that only has medical marijuana and frankly just the knowledge of knowing what in a state that has recreational as well or adult use as well the you just have to say let us look at what is eat what is allowed in each state and that is for the medical purposes but and also it's good reference for you to be able to determine whether or not there's medical marijuana that would be helpful in any particular state and you can say well I guess that's at least anecdotally if not evidence-based that it might be helpful so for example in Illinois interstitial cystitis is a qualifying condition for the use of cannabis and so if a person were in California and they said well I've got painful spasms because of interstitial cystitis you could say to yourself well it is allowed in Illinois there may be proof that it is helpful and I I can't god I cannot prescribe it but I certainly can say that it is recommended or at least possibly used in Illinois cachexia due to cancer is another common condition that is that people use cannabis for to stimulate their appetite terminal illness hospice care chemotherapy induced nausea muscle spasms that's why I put in interstitial cystitis here because if it helps them MS muscle spasms maybe an interstitial cystitis as well or for that matter other muscle spasms it's it's been stating to me how well in Parkinson's spinal stenosis spinal cord disorders and we course see patients that have and have those conditions which resulting geologic illness PTSD rheumatoid arthritis sickle cell anemia at least the pain associated with it intractable pain and every state has the the ability or I should say has stated that if doctors find a condition that is diagnosed as debilitating then marijuana in a medical state can be recommended pain is the most common reason for for using the medical marijuana 100 million Americans have chronic pain and so this is the reason why chronic pain is the most common by far and away the most common reason why people use medical marijuana others is multiple sclerosis chemotherapy induced vomiting nausea and cancer as I listed before so you can see that over 50% of the people will want to use medical marijuana for chronic pain why again why 50% greater 50% use marijuana for pain well in 2016 214 million prescriptions of opioids were used more than 60 million Americans consumed acetaminophen on a weekly basis over 30 billion doses of NSAIDs were were given and 80 million aspirins are consumed a day not all of course are for pain but that's 117 aspirin tablets for every man woman and child in the United States the opioid crisis in the United States is is absolutely an epidemic and unfortunately know about epidemics now but is that an epidemic rate as many as one in five whose are opioid addicted received opioids as prescription for non-cancer pain 11 million abusing opioids and a million thousand people are go to the ER every day for opioid misuse the the most chilling thing is 72 thousand people who die every year and that is more deaths there are more deaths since a year 2004 opioid than all the deaths that occurred on the battlefields in every war since 1775 it is a spectacular amount of people who have have died and as it turns out marijuana is a could be a substitute II and some individuals and does not kill and this is the reason why it doesn't kill I think that this is the most important slide there is why do opioids kill and T C does not and the reason is the receptors the the cannabis receptors are in the in this portion of the brain and in the cerebellum the opioids are in the this portion but most importantly they are in the brain stem for breathing and so this is the reason why opioids kill and cannabis does not there has never been a death due to overdose of cannabis but seventy-two thousand people a year die of cannabis overdose in the United States as time has gone on it's become more and more legal in various states but more importantly and in this particular sideshows it that Americans believe it should that medical marijuana for sure should be legalized sixty-two percent versus thirty four percent and just in 1969 when when I went I was when I was in college in medical school 84 percent thought of what should be illegal and only twelve percent legal so attitudes have change and that's why your patients are coming in to talk to you about it so the summary is cannabis is safe it is not a gateway drug and it has several urological applications you can see that annual desk 435,000 from tobacco seventy five thousand from opioids none none from marijuana a hundred from peanuts so you can see that even even peanuts are more dangerous than marijuana the finally one joke by Bill Murray I find it quite ironic that most dangerous the most dangerous thing about about weed is getting caught with it so the dangers are few the the potential benefit is great and in it in this particular talk I hope I was not trying to convince you to use it but I'm trying to come to you about and educate you about why some people do so thank you very much if you wish to contact me there is my email address I wish you a great day thank you", "waCbh8qv8tw": "hey Jimmy here with holistic magnified doing a quick product comparison with our salvation 33 that's a thousand milligrams south this one is a full spectrum this one is only CBD so cannabidiol full spectrum there's over a hundred different cannabinoids in the hemp plant and the marijuana plant we obviously get our self from the hemp plant so we have all those cannabinoids in here that does include the legal trace amounts of THC below 0.3% is what's federally legal so a little story about how I applied these I went ahead and put some on this one on the full-spectrum on my right knee which I had reconstruction surgery on about 20 years ago I put the isolate based on my left knee which I also had a reconstruction surgery but that was only about three years ago so reconstruction on both played about two and a half hours of basketball this morning both of these are infused with the same organic essential oils um organic beeswax as well and they are both the same price sixty five bucks so we're just we're not looking at it from any other comparison except full-spectrum versus isolate after I put them on I would say about 15 minutes afterwards both knees felt really really good no swelling inside I had full range of motion it's now been about an hour my left knee still feels really good which I used the isolate based on but my patella tendon starting to get a little bit a little bit stiff um the the swelling inside my knee is not there but as I said patella tendon is getting a little bit tight my right knee feels phenomenal so that's basically my personal use today lots of variables everyone is different but pop on over to holistic magnified check out we make holistic topicals tinctures herbal inhalers very potent stuff so love to see you", "fejytAIWC_g": "hey I wanted to do a review on penat ryx and Charlotte's webs hemp infused Bahman which one worked for me so I've been dealing with a lot of chronic pain issues and I just wanted to do like kind of like my take so after using this product and it's almost all gone for a solid couple of months actually maybe like two months or w-mint three in terms of pain relief it smells really nice so it's not like like we agents have this or we call this like white flour or something like that and it's really abrasive to the eyes it's really drying on your skin but it feels amazing just because the menthol on this is is intense and so I will douse myself with this before but it was really drying like I said and really abrasive to other people too like they could smell it immediately in your leg oh you're an old Asian grandma and on a 32 year old young lady so I opted for this first so this is called penetrations and this is well reviewed on Amazon and I would have to say what I was using it for is like my shoulder I have a little like shoulder impingement cuz I sleep on my side and things get pinched that way I've tried so many different ways on how to sleep but I've found a different solution this is always like things like this things like this they're always just little band-aids that help you very short-term in terms of pain relief and it's not even pain relief it's kind of like just a distraction it's not really addressing the source of your pain it's a it's a nice distraction so when you're you know when you're trying to work or whatever and you've got an ache in your neck or whatever and you have this burning cool sensation it distracts you from I think the pain I don't that's just my take on it I know it's not solving the problem but anyway this seemed to I guess be something different other than those types of products because it's an inflammation formula so if you have chronic pain it's probably because the the area or the joint or the muscle is inflamed and so no amount of stretching or like working out is really going to help you because it's still inflamed it's in a state of emergency basically so in order for you to like for myself like my knee for example or my shoulder or this like chronic muscle that was underneath my shoulder blade and it's really hard to get to gets really tight and it would cause actually migraines a lot and I would use this and you see I've run through this this container and it was just okay and I really didn't see any difference I think it was a lot better in terms of yes calming down the tissue than this guy but again if I wasn't gonna follow through like this is kind of like taking it's a topical like I guess an ibuprofen an anti-inflammatory that doesn't have to go through your liver to calm down the inflammation of the area or the affected area but if you don't follow through after calming down the inflamed area it stays weak or it stays unconditioned so for me for this example I was putting this and yes it was helping the inflammation and for me to not feel any pain but I wasn't doing anything to make sure that I wasn't going to keep that chronic injury there so I needed to do something physical where I could train those muscles or the muscles around it to activate and that way that one muscle wasn't doing all the work you know and I'm saying so there's a process right so if you're in pain and the area's inflamed yes these things in my experience do work but I went through a whole container worth and didn't realize like there's a second process to that which is to do something physical which trains that muscle not to be weak anymore because that's that's usually why you're in pain is because something is out of balance something is weak and this particular muscle that's always tied are always aching it's compensating for the rest of your weakness you're weak so that's that so I'm basically all out and on my journey of pain relief I also stumbled across things like CBD oil now I'm just about done with this guy and I was doing this is my second bottle full bottle like this and this is a 30 milliliters so one fluid ounce very small and their recommended dosage is one drop in the morning one drop at night or two two drops to full droppers okay and shake well before using and it tastes really good it tastes like minty chocolate stuff so it's in my experience it was kind of mouth drying always kind of got a cotton mouth feel I don't take it anymore I'm just about done but I haven't even touched this in a couple of weeks and I was trying to take this for like anxiety or oh yeah like if I have this pain here if I just take it will it just handle all the things in my body I don't know I can't really say if this works or not because at the same time I was also practicing yoga which to me in my example the whole shoulder blade thing the knee thing the hip thing the only thing that's really been I feel helping is yes these like step one little baby step one and then step two which is a big step which is to start training start conditioning those muscles so that you stop staying in this crappy injured in flame state that brings me to this okay so this is fairly new maybe about two to three weeks the use of this this is the 1.5 ounce soothing scent hemp infused balm from Charlotte's Web I love this smell it smells really good at submit it's like a minty my settlement enos doesn't burn your eyes when you apply it close to your face unless you put it like right here so I usually use this because I'm still getting that shoulder impingement not as bad as I used to used to wake up with headaches but yeah definitely using this in tandem with my yoga has been I'm seeing I'm seeing a lot more progress and a lot more strengthen and how I'm gauging that is just by doing regular everyday tasks so going up and down the stairs seeing if I could jog for like a little jaunt from the kitchen to the to the living room if I got excited about something or to run to the restroom like I'm that's how I'm gauging my progress and before I couldn't do that especially when I had done when I had injured my knee and so I've been applying this pretty regularly to my knee and before when I was doing yoga whenever I knelt down on to my knee onto the kneecap it was very painful and so I would just kind of find ways around it in terms of the yoga like still doing downward dog still doing forward fold still doing everything that I could you know it was really just the ones where I had my kneecap on the floor so I've been applying this directly to it and I've only started doing that for probably the last two weeks because for some reason you just I don't know when you're in an injured state you don't really think of all the ways you think of I don't know that's just been my experience and and that's been a transformation in my mind when you are chronically injured and maybe you have many things wrong with you it's kind of hard to keep track it's kind of hard to keep up with all of your issues but I encourage you to think of your body as a full system and so if your knee hurts it's not just about your knee it's about your hip it's about your quads about your hamstrings about your calves I always forget about my calves is about your ankles so that your your body's a whole system and so this has enabled me to I feel been very effective anti-inflammatory I'm not taking advil or ibuprofen for anything really the only thing that I really take ibuprofen for is if I have a feel of massive headache coming on and maybe I can prevent a migraine and then I'll maybe I'll take some or if I'm you know I have cramps or something that's the only reason why I would take that so I'm trying to minimize as much drugs as possible that I'm taking into my body and just doing these topical things that you just rub and they smell so good too and it is very I in my experience effective that I feel in my body as an anti-inflammatory agent which is pretty cool so and they and I think they make that distinction you know this has 450 milligrams of hemp extract and I've seen it go as far as to like a thousand milligrams and I'm like whew maybe that will like make it make my healing even faster because um right now with the yoga and I've been doing yoga for a good 45 days I think that's a good estimate maybe 50 days pretty regularly pretty like maybe I've missed two days and then I just did it the next day or something like that and that's given me the strength to go and do deadlifting I'm now lifting again when I was completely invalid for like a good three months or something when I when I injured my knee so that's been my experience with this this and this um so yeah not taking recap not taking this anymore I feel the yoga has replaced what I have seeked out in not gonna buy this anymore this is about 20 bucks I think and I think it and I think it does work when I was using it it's just that you need to follow through you can't just put it on to be like why am I not better yet you have to follow through physically emotionally mentally all the things I like this a lot better just because it's a little bit cheaper and and I feel like it lasts longer too cuz this is more like a this is more like a cream and this is more like a wax and like I can both they had a very similar scent this one like very kind of minty yeah mm-hmm they both smell really good I like both of them this one's just a little bit cheaper but it takes forever to get to you so maybe this is a better option I don't know it'll just kind of depend on my mood when when I go to refill this one but this I feel like it's lasting Mia quite a bit so I'll just put three of my fingers in here rub it on I'll do it before and after a workout or like when I remember to or if I'm particularly feeling little stabs of pain in my knee or in my neck and stuff and I just feel better and I've been using this for maybe good three months or so so that's been my experience any specific questions I'd love to you know answer your questions in the comments and maybe you know it'll work for you too and like I said these things are just temporary fixes and they and make you feel a little bit better for the time being but you have to follow through with all the things and try to think of your body as a as a whole system you know not even just your body like your mental state like are you do you really want to get better are you using your chronic illness as an excuse for not living I know that so yeah thanks for watching see you next time", "wFcIZFQC6Kk": "[Music] don't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel to see more videos hello everybody welcome back to the channel in today's video I'm gonna be making a very much anticipated and requested video from our subscribers today I'm going to be making CBD hand cream or body butter whatever you'd like to call it an oil based cream but first if you wouldn't mind if you are new here to channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you very much for your support and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to continue that support so folks I have received so many emails friends requests and just direct messages about can we make a CBD cream how to make a CBD cream and will you make a video for youtube and the answer to all those questions is yes today I will be showing you how to make a CBD hand cream or body butter now this is not a lotion lotions are water-based for those of you that do not know the difference lotions are a completely water-based and are a totally different recipe and we'll be making that later on so look for that video on our channel but today we are doing an oil based cream or body butter and I'm going to go over the ingredients to be able be able to make it so first and foremost you are going to need sweet almond oil now for those of you that are allergic to nuts you can use avocado oil and I have for this recipe now you're not going to get the same results as we will with the sweet almond oil but for those of you that nut allergy this is a great substitute second you're gonna need cocoa butter this is not the same as shea butter it's a harder texture smells like chocolate so you're gonna need this then next you are gonna need shea butter this is different not the same as coconut butter some people will get them confused and I want to make it clear that these are two separate butters and here we go here is the shea butter it's more malleable definitely have that softer butter texture and then last but not least as far as the cents greediest go for this recipe you will need infuse coconut oil now for those of you that do not have the infused coconut oil you could add CBD pollen or Keef to this recipe however if you want to make the CBD coconut oil that's infused go ahead and check out our video right here on our channel then come on back and after you've made your coconut oil and you start making this recipe so folks that is the essential ingredients to making this hand cream over body butter whatever you'd like to call it the next two ingredients are not essential to this but I will be adding one of the two of them today first is vitamin E oil now it's not necessary but this is a great way to rejuvenate skin it just helps the skin a lot whether it's recovering from damage or just being nice and smooth now you don't need to add it because shea butter has vitamin E in it but this really adds a lot more vitamin E to it to really give you that rejuvenating skin feel the other thing that we are not adding today is an essential oil now if you don't like the smell of chocolate which is what this will come out to smell like because the cocoa butter is very strong you can dampen it and the two I recommend are lavender and mint but today we're not going to be doing that we're cool with the the chocolate smell so let's get right into how I make this CBD hand cream or body butter alright folks before we get started you're going to need a couple things from your kitchen first and foremost a probably a really small spatula to be able to get the oils out of your 1/3 cup measuring cup you'll also need a double boiler or in this case I set it up as a double boiler glass bowl and you have water in the pot we're going ahead and turn that on right now while we're doing all this all right folks now that you've gathered all your kitchen equipment you're just going to need 1/3 cup of every oil and butter so 1/3 cup of cocoa butter 1/3 cup of sweet almond oil and for those of you that using avocado oil it's the same thing 1/3 cup of infused coconut oil and 1/3 cup of shea butter so I'm gonna measure all those out get them into our double boiler and start making our CBD hand cream or body butter so let's get right into it we have measured everything out and we have put it on the stove and as you can see everything's starting to become liquid already now this is the time where you would start thinking about adding your essential oils for us we're just going to do a few drops of the vitamin E so we'll do that you don't need anything crazy maybe five six drops max nothing nothing nuts really just depends on what you like I wouldn't go overboard with the vitamin E though you know ten drops really maximum and so we're just gonna start stirring this around for a little while so we're gonna cut to that so once this all melts down I'll see you in a few minutes okay folks you can see that everything is melted so now we're going to take it off the heat now it's very important this step is that you do not throw it right into the refrigerator you take it off the double boiler and you set it down on the counter get rid of this steam here real quick okay folks so now what you're gonna do is you're going to stir this gently for a little while for about ten minutes you really want it to come down in temperature because first glass can crack and we just put it right into the refrigerator you also want to give the oil some time to rest before you go ahead and cool them down so that's what I'm gonna do for the next ten mathema throw it in the fridge for about an hour and then we'll take it out and we'll whip it so I'll see you in about an hour folks the oil was in the fridge for approximately an hour and a half so a little bit more than an hour and it is now solidified and you really want to get it when it's not totally solid it just transferred over to a solid so it's got that you know loose texture to it and that's important because now what we're going to do is we're gonna whip the oil and this is important because in order to make it a body cream do our hand cream you call a weapon we do this for quite a while and I'll see you okay so we're about halfway done with the whipping here and so what I'm doing is I'm just getting it off the edges and I'm putting it in the middle of the glass bowl here so that we can start whipping it again and I'm going to do this process for a probably about another one to two minutes so I'm going to jump to that next to that alright so now I've lifted for about three minutes and you can tell that it's starting to get that like nice whipped kind of texture to it so what I'm gonna do now is this is the final leg scraped with a bowl because I want to make sure I get everything I can so you can have as much of this body cream as possible but you can tell see it's getting that very whipped type of texture that's what you're gonna look for and you want it to be very fluffy very fluffy and you know kind of Airy just like whipped cream you really want this to have that whipped cream type texture so we're gonna give it one more run through with the blender here and then we'll have the final product alright folks so now we're just gonna store it up and all you need is a mason jar go ahead and just put it right into the mason jar now the great thing about this stuff is it is all ready to be stored it's all oiled so it should be okay on the Shelf you may have to read it if if it deflates for whatever reason but it shouldn't and this should last you quite a while this is a lot of butter or lotion you can use it on your hands use it whatever now it does have a bit of a greasy feel to it and that's typical for body creams and lotions but yeah that's it for today folks I really hope you enjoyed this video I hope you can make this at home and if you guys have any questions comments concerns leave them in the comments below I'll answer them to the best I can if you guys are interested in any kind of flower all my information is down in the description below go ahead and reach out to me and I can give

warehouse this is where we do all of our packaging and trimming like gateway to medicine I love it next to the grow house since Jason Cranford pharmaceutical grade lab where he and his staff turned those plants into cannabis oil it's all really all about keeping the medicine clean so this is actual raw plant material this is how it looks when we first started out it's probably 20 pounds somewhere on there and how many of these do you have height 50 the medicine that you're that you've sort of devised for autism is it based only on this plant it'll be really easy for us to mix like a whole bunch of THC strains together that makes them CBD oil and do this to do that but the problem with that is consistency within batches if I give Eric a bottle today and then I give her a bottle a year from now it has pulled from the straight same plant then the lab report is you're gonna be the same so her product will be consistent and so what's in this what are we looking at here this is a strain that is very very low in CBD and high in THC what's a call I haven't named it yet THC has been shown to help with autism related symptoms easing chronic pain reducing insomnia and promoting appetite for wasting syndrome but it's also the psychoactive compound meaning this medicine will get kids high so what happens next like it's a plant how does it become a medicine all right I can't get my hands out of here [Laughter] [Music]", "mfawz0ujn_8": "[Music] hi guys I'm going to talk to you about five of common CBD vaping mistakes number one concentration levels of CBD so here we've got a 10 mil ball with 250 milligrams of CBD that's 2.5 percent of the liquid is CBD here we've got 100 mil bottle if that had the same amount of CBD in the hundred mil bottle it'd be point two five percent so that means don't spend more money just because it's a bigger bottle spend if it's got more CBD yeah number two hemp oil CBD low they are not the same thing do not confuse the two with the same hemp oil is way cheaper hemp oil has much much much lower levels of CBD so if you see a bulb with a really high amount of hemp oil and it's still cheap it's because it should be it's got this much CBD in it don't confuse it to number three three number three don't vape CBD oil a liquids are not called oils oil is oil a liquid is a liquid you get CBD oils to find your tongue CBE liquids to vape you do not want to be vaping CBD oil so that's number three don't vape see videos also a liquids are way more bioavailable what was by available me professor bioavailable means your body absorbs they're not better so if you put a drop on your tongue goes into your stomach gets absorbed for your at SIDS and all your hamburgers and your vegetarian sausage rolls and your pigs in blankets and your muesli and then it goes in your blood system whereas you vape it goes into your lungs those strains your capillaries into your blood system that's what being bioavailable means so if you faint CBD liquids more bioavailable just don't pay just don't feet you see video oils number for putting nicotine in your CBD liquid nicotine degrade CBD so if you get a CBD shot of nicotine included give it back to the shopkeeper you want your CBD as CBD came without nicotine number five is the right kit and the right tank for CBD CBD a liquid is pretty runny so if you use a big tank with a big coil the chances are it's going to come straight out the air holes all over your pocket your hands and your device that's expensive so use a simple little device like a pod system or a starter kit the best thing about it is they're also cheaper so if you get sold a big fancy flash kit for CBD vaping give it back to the shopkeeper and asking for a pod kit hi guys I hope you found this CBD video useful if

we're looking at an edible this time sour infused gushers uh 500 milligrams now this is obviously a black market edible i guess you could say uh and there's probably a thousand different uh edible gushers but these specific ones let's let's just take a peek inside very melty and gooey as you can see but delicious may i say and very potent but obviously anybody could really anybody could buy these packaging and fill them up with uh edible infused gushers oh by the way these are the world's dankest gushers oh not even worlds worlds wow just well medicated fruit snacks if we take a look at the back a sour burst of flavor in every bite uh gluten free yeah i'm sure uh there's a government warning which probably just doesn't matter that much on these now if you if you uh if you pick these up make sure you trust the person you are going to and make sure you're not paying any expensive amount of money at all these these are like the mids of edibles like you i would not pay more than 15 for this single package right here just because there's so many better options and more reliable options and more legit options without typos and extreme claims but hey if you if this is your only option uh i've had much worse and i'm sure i'm sure you can like i'm sure all that stuff is thc infused also all the [ __ ] around the bag so i mean if you trust if if you see some random dude with these i would definitely stay away don't even take the chance don't even bother but if it's from a reliable source maybe slightly there you can expect slightly more but not by much you can get these packaging like you can just get you can just buy the packaging for like 90 cents a pop and just fill them with you know actual fruit gushers if you really if it if you really felt so inclined to do that so i would definitely be careful around these um i don't i don't want to recommend them just just because how easily they can be just absolutely fake um i'd say i got lucky but yeah there's there's a thousand different uh edible gushers just don't don't get this one just just wait around just wait just go to it go to a dispensary if you're uh if you really want them there's also uh infused cashews that comes in cans kind of like the warheads cubes that i reviewed a few months ago and i would trust those ten times more than i would trust these so stay away be careful make sure

amount isn't enough to have an intense high or psychoactive sensation and a lot of our farm fam who have intense anxiety or ptsd really really prefer that also we're a veteran family-owned company so shout out to our veterans", "E7MvGH0yMNU": "disclaimer in no way shape or form does the information of this video replace medical advice this video's purpose is to shed light on cbd and how it could be used to treat anxiety amongst many other remedies and medications out there is school stressing you out your job giving you anxiety or can you just not fall asleep at night well this just may be the video for you the use of cbd could be an effective and safe way to alleviate anxiety stress and improve your sleep but what exactly is cbd cbd is short for cannabidiol which is one of two compounds found in cannabis the other one being tetrahydrocannabine or thc for short what you may notice is that the chemical formulas of cbd and thc are almost chemically identical but they both elicit different reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what works best for you if you are interested in learning more about the use of cbd research currently being done or the science behind it please refer to the links in the description of this video [Music] you", "jqoMzR4mw0I": "i'm ashley brennan founder of sabine holistic health sabine holistic health is a non-profit that helps medical cannabis patients with medicine costs all patients who need medical cannabis should have affordable access to it today i'm discussing how to make a cannabis infused salve a salve is a thick topical applied to the skin and can aid in relieving pain spasms or inflammation where it is applied all cannabis infused topicals even those made with high thc strains are not intoxicating as they are applied to the skin and do not enter the bloodstream this easy recipe can be personalized with different essential oil blends of your choice and is a good way to get started with topicals so let's learn how to make a cannabis infused salve i will go through all of the directions for making this easy salve today and they are also available on sabine holistic health's website using the link in the description if you have canna oil prepared this cannabis infused salve can be made in about 20 minutes to make this salve you will need one cup of canna oil prepared cannabis infused oil 1 cup of hemp or sunflower oil 4 tablespoons of grated beeswax and a tablespoon of vitamin e oil and also any other essential oils you would like to add up to 20 drops can be added for fragrance or to relieve health symptoms this is where this is an easy recipe to personalize if you already have the can oil prepared this recipe will be even easier and faster making cannabis infused oil or canna oil is easy and can be used to cook with or make many other recipes canna oil also lasts for up to a year so it is a good idea to make it in larger amounts so you have it on hand to use in recipes or to make cannabis infused products like this lotion you can find the complete steps to make canna oil in my other video and on our website both linked in the description all making canned oil requires is coconut oil and cannabis the recipe linked below calls for 3 cups of coconut oil and 20 grams of cannabis these amounts can be scaled up or down depending on your needs a basic overview of how to make this oil is to begin by decarboxylating the cannabis by breaking it up or grinding it and distributing it equally on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil to prevent sticking bake the cannabis at 240 degrees for between 35 to 45 minutes remove it from the oven and let it cool decarboxylating cannabis activates both the thc and cbd in the cannabis it is an important step to convert thca to thc and cbda to cbd you will need to do this even if you are making cbd products or using high cbd strains after decarboxylating the cannabis combine the coconut oil and decarboxylated cannabis in the slow cooker cook for 3 hours on low stirring every 30 minutes make sure the temperature of the slow cooker remains lower than 200 degrees to preserve the cannabinoids then strain the mixture by lining a fine mesh strainer with a cheesecloth and placing it over a bowl preferably a glass bowl pour the mixture over the cheesecloth so the liquid strains into the bowl this liquid is the cannabis infused oil that can be stored in an airtight container and is good for up to a year this is the oil that you will need for this salve recipe you can find a more detailed description including different methods for cooking the cannabis to make this oil and straining it using the link in the description after you have the can of oil prepared you can begin making the cannabis salve in a mason jar combine the 1 cup of can oil 1 cup of hemp seed or sunflower oil and 4 tablespoons of grated beeswax fill a large saucepan halfway with water put the open mason jar inside the saucepan and make sure no water gets into the mason jar heat on low until all of the beeswax has melted stirring occasionally remove the jar from the heat and add the tablespoon of vitamin e oil and up to 20 drops of essential oils or a blend of oils stir to mix in the vitamin e and essential oils until they are blended thoroughly next pour the mixture into one jar or split between two jars where you plan to store the salve this recipe makes about 16 ounces of south so it may need to be split into two 8-ounce jars let it cool completely before closing the jars with air-tight lids this cannabis infused salve will be good for around one year and can be stored at room temperature to test out the cannabis salve apply a small amount to a small part of the skin wait a few hours to feel its effects and strength although there is no risk of over-medication when using topicals it is always a good idea to test your products in small quantities first after testing the cannabis salve you can use it in larger quantities on bigger areas this recipe is pretty simple and can be personalized easily with your own essential oils topicals are non-intoxicating ways to use your favorite strains and fun to make topicals do not enter the bloodstream so even topicals made with high thc strains will not produce a high it is a great non-intoxicating way to use medical cannabis use the links in the

today for our next webinar um we're gonna do introductions we're just waiting people are still quickly joining so give us one second and we're going to get started we know this is a pretty topic to our community so we will be recording this and sharing uh after the fact uh and we will also make sure that if you need contact information we'll happily provide that as well okay i think i'm going to get started just because we have so much to get through today so um first of all we'd like to thank you for joining us uh today we have a rash tag thee did i say right yeah uh who is um from apollo cannabis clinics and uh this company um reached out to us to offer their information and expertise around cannabis and use for people living with als so we have decided to go ahead and do this presentation because it is very much a topic of interest in our community uh by no means are we encouraging people to do uh to take cannabis it is really a listen and learn information session uh we know there will be a lot of questions and we have presented a lot of um als specific information to you today to speak about but also if you have questions please put them in the chat box at the end of the presentation we will make sure that we address those if they are very specific questions to your specific question uh condition we're going to ask you to reach out to the company directly where we can make sure that you're connected with the right people more of today is general information so i'm going to go ahead and let you kind of do a little bit of introduction and make sure that uh everyone knows who you are sure thank yeah so as mentioned my name is arash and i am one of the international medical graduates that works at the apollo cannabis clinics i grew up in calgary alberta so proud canadian kid and i went to most of my middle school was a medical school was completed in the states so i spent a significant amount of time in atlanta georgia and i also did a couple of rotations my elective rotations in cook county hospital in chicago illinois so that is where i was before i moved to toronto so that's a little bit about me um when you graduate medical school you got to put in your time into the community and you have to build up your resume and then you apply for residency and that's kind of where i am at now so i work closely with all the healthcare professionals at apollo and i also work very closely with the research department um we have several ongoing research projects at apollo and that's something i'm going to discuss as i go so without further ado i'll start the presentation and as kim had mentioned um if you have questions put them into the question box i encourage questions the more the better i think and obviously i'll take them off right a webinar on thursday which pals okay so i'm gonna get started guys um first and foremost who is apollo apollo was a research institution that started in 2013 from a group of pain management physicians that were running out of treatment options for the patients that they were treating they would have to say mr mr smith i'm sorry i no longer have any other protocol to treat the condition that you are suffering from and the patient's turned back to the healthcare professionals and ask them well what about medical mechanics this is something that i am interested in and let's give it a shot and the doctors got together and they recognized that they knew very little about medical cannabis and they thought well let's research a small group of chronic pain patients to see what benefits we can find and they monitor them very closely and they started with you know the very entry level products for medical cannabis and they saw very very good results very early on and the group started to kind of communicate that to the people around them and they went from a small group of 30 to 60 then to 120 and then it became exponentially larger so the research institution was converted into a cannabis clinic inadvertently they didn't really plan it that way but they had no other choice with the number of patients that were coming in they had to dedicate a nurse to dedicate a couple of doctors just to that patient base so we now have um this number is a bit dated we have well over 50 000 patients rostered in our emr we do see patients coast to coast all over canada we have a team of physiatrists anesthesiologists we have pain specialists we have a psychiatrist mental health is a very big issue at apollo and that's something we address all the time and of course we have family doctors and we have academics and researchers that follow all of the information so as i'm sure a lot of people in this audience will know medical cannabis is kind of new and it has a lot of interest towards it a lot of people are gravitating towards it to see if it can benefit them but what we have to do as medical professionals is pay attention to the information because we all know that collecting retrospectively or proactively for research is just as important as the treatment options that we give patients on a daily basis so as mentioned we've been involved in a lot of research projects the current pandemic has slowed down a few of course since we have had to have some distance put between us and our patients but we have been doing research since 2013 as mentioned we've been published for ptsd with the use of medical cannabis and we have a couple other papers that i can't speak too much on because they are still in peer-to-peer review but again that is where we started that is our foundation and it's it's something that's very important to the fabric of apollo because without knowledge and information about what you were doing it's it's sometimes shooting in the dark and we fully understand that when it comes to this medication sometimes the dosing is us trying to learn but what we promise our patients is we will follow we will learn and we will understand what can help them so that brings us to our patients medical cannabis comes with a level of stigma to it we all know that um and we we have to counsel other physicians or other institutions about it all the time people think when you go to a medical cannabis clinic well you're going to be stepping into a place that has you know some slow playing music a lot of snacks in the background people are laughing a lot and guys i'm gonna make it very clear that is not the case we are a doctor's office like any other we have a waiting room we have consultation rooms we have education rooms so it's it's very regimented and you would be surprised the amount of people that walk in there wondering if there's something going to be out of the ordinary but again it is just the doctor's office oh and also worth mentioning on this slide um when it comes to our patient base the epidemiology the reports the numbers have come back since the legalization of recreational cannabis in 2017 which is what kind of started the trend for medical cannabis as well interestingly enough medical cannabis has been legal since 2001. recreational cannabis became legal in 2017. so medical cannabis has almost got 20 years behind it but everybody thinks well 2017 is when the leaf was turned that's not the case it's just when it became more popular so our patient demographics now with the new numbers that have come back to us since 2017 shows that the age category of 18 to 35 for the use of cannabis has not changed it's the 65 and over audience crowd demographic whatever you want to call them that has gone up exponentially and again it is a treatment option for many people who suffer from chronic conditions and that's why i think that that age group is looking more towards an alternative with medical cannabis as opposed to the traditional treatments so our medical process i wanted to make sure that i went over this quickly just so people understood there's again a lot of mystery when it comes to medical cannabis and medical cancer clinics why is there a clinic that is dedicated to just one medication well that's because a lot goes into it first and foremost we'll start at the top step one when anybody comes to apollo whether it's virtually over the phone or in person when we were open before the pandemic they must go through what is called a triage that is designed for us to attain all your past medical history the current reason you're looking to use medical cannabis and the current list of medications and any other information that the physician would like to have before consulting for medical cannabis step two is your doctor's appointment right this is where you will have a consultation with a healthcare professional they will go over all things that you need to know and ensure a safety profile is in place for that individual step three is the medical document this is your prescription the prescription must go to what is called a licensed producer there are about 350 of them in canada now licensed producers are just basically your pharmacies we do not choose one or the other we will send the prescription or the medical document wherever the patient wishes now most people come to clinic and have no idea what a licensed producer is so we explain it these are companies that have approval from health canada to grow medical cannabis and we can send a doctor's prescription to them to give you access for medical campus and again that's all nlp is once a licensed producer is chosen we go to step five and this is where apollo's bread and butter is this is what we're really proud of we spend a lot of time with our patients we fully educate them on what to expect when using cbd what to expect if using thc and everything in between that can happen between side effects or or help with the condition all of this stuff is discussed and again that's what an education entitles after the education it's important to know that the medication will be sent directly to the patient's door we are inadvertently contactless right the medication comes from the license producer directly to the patient's home that is a registered address and as i present to you now that is the only legal way to attain medical cannabis if ever you come across a clinic that is giving you cannabis in the clinic that is illegal so again just so you understand the medication must be sent in the mail licensed producers i've added this slide just so people have a better understanding again these are health canada approved state-of-the-art facilities these guys have positive airway pressure in large warehouses and greenhouses they're amazing to experience if you ever have the opportunity you step into a facility and you're hit with a a warm air it's almost tropical and then you close the store and there's a whole bunch of people in white jumpsuits again it's to keep everything sterile and to keep out contaminants they have licenses to grow the plant which they can turn into oils capsules sprays nowadays they also do vape cartridges and edibles and again i'll discuss all the different methods of consumption when we get there i was a little off about my number i apologize guys i said about 350 um i guess the marketing teams updated that for me it's about 380. needless to say there are many options when it comes to medical cannabis so we try to clarify that we have a list of top 10 or top 15 licensed producers that we really like and that number and those ratings have come from our patients to us if someone says to me hey you know what i tried this license producer they were really quick with their shipping and they were excellent in understanding what i needed well then guess what they're going to get bumped up in our list because i know that a patient has had a positive experience there these licensed producers are armed to grow two plants and there's a third that i will also discuss the first plant just a bit of background guys i'm going to discuss the two different plants and then we'll get into the medical compounds i have yet to say anything about cbd or thc sativa plants were initially discovered in south america they are big they are tall um if you ever see a fully grown sativa plant and you look at the base of the plant it's almost you know as thick as the end of a baseball bat you won't be able to pull it out of the ground with your hands they're strong strong plants they actually kind of grew feral in a lot of places in south america and that's how they were initially discovered farmers were trying to keep them off their land and a few farmers reported that they plucked some of these strange smelling buds from these plants and they would chew on them while they were working and they all reported a better mood and less back pain and they weren't as tired so again that's generally where the plant sativa started they are known to be uplifting and energizing the memory trick for a sativa plant is sativa as for sun again it can be uplifting the next plant that they grow is called the indica plant now indica we remember this way indica in the couch they're supposed to be calming and relaxing okay so again and i'm not talking about cbd or thc yet but the indica plant was discovered um in asia remembering that the sativa plants are big and strong and tall the indica plants are short and stubby and they're actually kind of sensitive plants um their properties again are the opposite of the sativas they're calming and relaxing where the sativas are uplifting and energizing but the two plants are genetically identical okay so that's important to note genetically identical but phenotypically different and what i mean by that is that they have different characteristics phenotypes are what distinguish the differences between all species including humans so phenotypes will choose the color of our eyes the color of our hair our bone density there's a lot of different factors within any species that are different and differentiated by phenotypes and again sativas and indicas are identical genetically but phenotypically different and that's the difference between them i mentioned the third plant sometimes a license for two producers will want the strengths of a sativa plant and they'll want the properties of an indica plant so they will cross pollinate them and they'll call that a hybrid i'm not a botanist i don't know too much about how it occurs but i know that most medical cannabis providers will have a hybrid version of their plants just to ensure that a patient will have access to that as well medical compounds drum roll this is what we've all been waiting for right this is where the important stuff can come come forward now when i first started giving these presentations there wasn't many people who knew what cbd was right i have to take a long pause on this slide to describe you know cbd this is cannabidiol this is the non-psychoactive component of medical cannabis fast forward two and a half years feels like it's been a lot longer but now everybody knows what cbd is now there is a person that doesn't understand what cbd is when i have these presentations so i've just put a list of some of the things we've seen in clinic and what we've recorded as the benefits of cbd for for us to discuss here um if i had to choose a couple off this list that were probably the the more important ones i would say the analgesic effect it's a fancy way of saying painkiller and the anti-inflammatory properties these are very very important as well one of the main conditions we see in clinic is the simple run-of-the-mill osteoarthritis right the painful knee or the bad back or the bad neck i've even seen a lot of hip discomfort as well in clinic and again this is a person who through time has worn down the joint and you have site inflammation when things get too close there's pain there and there's inflammation and that site inflammation if left untreated can graduate into systemic inflammation and now you have pain that started in the hip but you also have a headache and your shoulder hurts again you can't understand why and again that's all from systemic inflammation and again the anti-inflammatory properties of cbd play strong role for those patients another one here that's also important is an anti-enzyme right mental health we do see a lot of the pediatric population coming to our clinic now because of the epilepsy that can be controlled with cbd as well again it isn't anti-epileptic it can help that way as well remembering guys um cbd does not have a psychoactive effect and to translate that into more simple terms it will not get anybody quote-unquote high as the kids call it these days that's not going to be a risk factor for cbd the side effects of high use cbd are an upset stomach or diarrhea or a headache and again these are all things that we've seen in clinic and documented and recorded at a very low percentage the next chemical compound that comes off of the plant is called thc so this is the infamous one this is the one that people watch out for this is the one that sometimes people are scared of when they come into clinic guys i want to make this very very clear thc plays a very important role no i have no volume sorry guys i'm getting a little bit of background noise um so thc is not the component that most people are started with when it comes to medical cannabis but again it can be a very very helpful tool in the physician's belt when we discuss medical cannabis for certain cases remembering it also is a powerful anti-inflammatory okay it also helps a lot with insomnia a sleep disturbance is probably the number one complaint when it comes to any chronic condition it is the primary psychoactive component of medical cannabis but that is dose dependent it's very important for people to understand i always say the dose is the drug not the chemical component because recreational cannabis has its starting point and medical cannabis stays beneath it and we ensure that our patients do not feel the ill effects of thc in fact if people do feel them well then that's a miss that's a that's uh we have failed that patient we need to go back and discuss the treatment plan and their doses and how we can lower and still help our goal is to attain the lowest therapeutic dose when it comes to medical cannabis again i i tell you now from experience thc is a very helpful component on this list is also appetite stimulating anti-medic you know in a world in which everybody is trying to lose weight why would we ever want to stimulate the appetite with thc and the answer to that is it has its place medical oncology is one of those places people who go through chemotherapy or radiation will have a complete loss of appetite in fact they'll suffer from a lot of nausea and again a little bit of thc can reignite that appetite for them a little bit and also help with some of the nausea they're experiencing also there's anorexia and bulimia people who struggle to have an appetite can find some assistance when it comes to thc drag homes i thought this was an interesting slide maybe not all will agree but um these tiny little projections oh let me rewind this is a microscopic photograph of the plant so cannabis has a little over 100 different chemical compounds that come off of it 100 different types of cannabinoids and they're all housed in these tiny little oily projections called trichomes this is important to know because this means that a plant that is 97 carbohydrate based has a small percentage of fat that grows on it and that that soluble medication or fat soluble chemical compound that comes off of the plant has receptors in our body and it can affect the human body that way because again it is fat soluble so at the end of the day these big fancy licensed producers and all of these numerous medical cannabis clinics are all trying to harness this tiny little microscopic fat that comes from the plant a licensed producer will take five to ten grams of a bud from a particular plant and they will crush it and they will heat it at a very high rate and they are basically melting off these trichomes and when they melt them off they attain a small concentrated amount of it and then health canada tells them they must dilute that with healthy oil they now choose medium chain triglycerides or mct oil which is a coconut derivative which is one of the healthier oils that we can ingest and they mix with with the oils that come off of the cannabis plant that allows the medication to be unmixable so now you have an even amount of medication throughout that oil and again remembering that it's fat based and you're mixing a fat with the fat you can't unmix it so again it's the safest method in which we can that we can consume medical cannabis so we've talked about thc and cbd we've talked about sativas and indicas and now we're going to discuss what is called the endocannabinoid system this is a system in our body that is already in place there are several different ways we can plug cannabinoids into this system and starting from the top we have cannabis or cannabinoids these are the ones that are being put into the body from either a plant base or a synthetic base endocannabinoids the word endo in latin just means endogenous which means us endocannabinoids are the ones that our body naturally produces and then there are synthetic cannabinoids as well and these are the nabalone and side effects that's what they're known for for any given reason we have observed in clinic that both nabalone and satovx not to be confused with sativa plants sativex is the synthetic version of thc they don't respond well for long and what do i mean by that sometimes you have a patient who will come in and they started on 20 milligrams of sativex they come in a week later and say it worked for three days and it hasn't worked for the past two well the physician will say okay well though maybe we need a higher dose we'll go from 20 to 40 and the same will occur they get about a one to 48 hours 72 hours of benefit and then that falls off again it is quick to be tolerated for some reason that we do not understand when it comes to the cannabis plants and what they produce they're called phytocannabinoids so the ones that come from plants are called phytocannabinoids and they tend to work far better in the system we've observed small percentage of tolerance and again we can easily combat that and we teach our patients how to do that on a daily basis for reference it's important to know that cb1 is the thc receptor and cb2 is the cbd receptor so if we look at this they are everywhere and when something is widely found throughout the body we use a fancy medical term we call it ubiquitous again just a fancy way of saying they're everywhere and this is probably the reason why medical cannabis can be used in so many different conditions which is why we have such a massive variety of patients in our clinic this is another slide just further breaking down the systems that are involved and the receptors that can be found so obviously first and foremost the very top of the list is the brain right upper motor neuron is your brain and spinal cord lower motor neurons will be your peripheral nervous system so everything after the brain and spinal cord will be considered the lower motor neurons or the peripheral nervous system but if we look closely in the brain there's both cb1 and cb2 receptors so everybody always thinks that thc affects the brain and cbd affects the body it's not necessarily true cbd alone can affect people's mental health in a positive way thc can help with sleep in the central nervous system and a physician may choose to go that route depending on what the sleep disturbance is caused by so if you think about it i'm going to talk about chronic pain as an example for the brain chronic pain is consistent signaling that goes to the brain it doesn't allow us to really think of anything else so a patient who is suffering from let's just say fibromyalgia is lying in bed struggling with pain and they're just constantly getting messages not allowing them to rest so cbd can play a role in helping control that anxiety that comes with chronic pain thc will help initiate sleep so again they play important roles and both these things can be discussed at a doctor's appointment other important organs to recognize here would be probably the large intestine if i had it my way that would probably take up half of this slide um the gi is one of the areas of largest free radical damage in our body every time we eat we're causing a lot of cell turnover so the large intestines need some antioxidant help cbd is a very very good antioxidant for the digestive system and also the central nervous system there are set conditions that we see for the large intestines or the digestive tract in general as well there is ulcerative colitis there's crohn's disease celiac is another big one that we see and sometimes the patients will say well i still react the same way to those foods but instead of being sick for 10 days or 15 days after a poor reaction when i use cbd i'm only really feeling poor about 48 hours after so it's really helping with my recovery again these are things we hear the immune system is also another big one here guys way at the bottom almost off the slide but the immune system is where we find a lot of benefits when it comes to rheumatology or autoimmune conditions as well i'm assuming there will be many questions about this slide so i'll come back to it at the end we can stop on it this photo is every medical student's nightmare this is where we spend a lot of time understanding the exact physiology of of the human body in this particular case we're looking at the pre and the post-synaptic cleft i assume in this group this picture will not be so foreign to us sometimes when i do these presentations a hand will go up and people will say well i don't even know what i'm looking at is that an elbow is that me guys this is the pre and post-synaptic clef this is how the neurological system communicates okay so there are receptors in place and what i want to make very clear before i i leave this slide because to me it's boring is that there's 2ag and anandamide those are the two chemical components that our body naturally produces in the endo cannabinoid system and there is cb1 receptors that also affect the central nervous system that act in a very similar way again in this particular photo it's showing thc but cbd also has receptors in both the pre and postsynaptic left so it can affect how we perceive pain it can also help with the inflammatory process that follows pain and we can also kind of address some of the other symptomatologies that follow chronic conditions so when it comes to the endocannabinoid system these are again some of the things that we have seen that are benefiting our patients comes down to inflammation pain digestion sleep bone density is an interesting one mood stress regulation and even reproduction these are the conditions that we have documented well in clinic chronic pain being at the top of the list neuropathic pain second to that when it comes to als most people do not discuss pain but they do report pain in about sixty percent from my readings even as high as seventy times as well so pain is a neuropathic origin when it happens with als from my understanding and again cannabis does play a role with that fibromyalgia is after that ms an autoimmune condition in which the central nervous system is being attacked i've already discussed epilepsy and ptsd with you guys we have anxiety and stress insomnia is huge i think that um anytime you walk into any room i it's fair to assume that more than half the people in that room aren't sleeping properly and that's again something we hear in clinic and some people say i started taking cbd for my migraines but i've never slept better so even when i don't have a migraine i'd like to continue and the doctor turns to them and says that's okay with me as long as you check in every three months and we're on the understanding that this is an as needed medication when you need it you can stop if you wish you can use regularly if you wish as well so this is an additional slide that i put in here um regarding als um again when when i did a lot of my homework with this stuff i went back into my medical books and then i read up on what was new um and we're we're still struggling guys obviously i mean i don't need to spend too much time stating that to this audience but i just put some of the facts that i've come across the second most common neural disease second to alzheimer's very high incidence in caucasians and slightly higher in males is also what i found there's a sporadic and hereditary route i'm looking forward to the questioning portion of this because i'm hoping that you guys can even fill this in for me a little bit further but again i've found again from my recent readings that it's 90 sporadic and about 10 hereditary average age of onset between 40 and 55 but seen as young as 25. and now we're kind of circling back to how medical cannabis can play a role with als symptom control with the sleep disturbances and obviously with the pain management i've also added here from what we have observed in clinic reduced fasciculations and again reduced neuropathic pain is something that we have seen from the als patients in our clinic now what does that mean when you see and observe something in a condition like als all that we can do is document all that we can do is share that information with the next patient that comes in but we must be very clear just because it works for one person doesn't mean it will work the same way for everyone and that is the case for any medication guys not just medical cannabis when when medication is released into the market and it has gone through all of the battery of tests that come from the cdc and health canada they still say these are the side effects that we observed these are the positive benefits we observed and within two standard deviations of the norm ninety percent of people started at this dose the only difference between medical cannabis and most other medications is that we never got a chance to do the bell curve of the dosing so to combat that what we do in our clinic is to start at the lowest possible dose that you can and i always tell patients this is interesting we're going to start a dose that you probably feel nothing and then we're going to move up slowly and once we've attained therapeutic benefit we might push a little bit further if it's the same we'll come back to reduce cost that's the method that we use to ensure proper dosing in our clinic methods of consumption this is a big one now initially and when i say initially i mean two and a half three years ago um there were only oils that can be used okay so like i explained the trichomes were being melted off and put into an mct based coconut oil and patients would only have to dry out what was a small oral syringe and they would measure the dose and that would go into their mouth there was a huge conception of do i put it under my tongue is it absorbed under my tongue no it is not remembering that it is a fat based medication the liver is required for digestion we call that first past metabolism and that is what causes the delay or the kick-in for medical cannabis products at times if they're ingested if they're edible so you consume that oil it goes down into your stomach over into your intestines your liver picks that up stamps it sends it everywhere that prospect takes about an hour and a half to two hours depending on that person's metabolism once the medication is in your system it should last anywhere from four to eight hours again i put the longest window of variability most people tell us it's about four to six sometimes people say it goes past eight again it'll depend on that person's metabolism nowadays we have capsules which have just been concentrated oils into a capsule and it's much much easier to use in that way um patients are very very happy about the capsules and so were we we had a lot of trouble with you know drawing out a dose in public or people who have arthritis and have trouble getting the bottles open now we just move on to capsules it's much much easier i put here it is important to start low and go slow which is just again referencing our titration methodology the second form of um in uh medical cannabis and the method that can be used is inhalation guys i always take a hard pause when i do this presentation to make it very clear we do not promote that anybody smoke anything in apollo but there are health canada approved vaporizers that have the ability to take a dry flower and you put the dry flower into a unit this photo is one of them and that unit will heat the plant to the point of dehydration that plant will let off a steam or a mist and you're inhaling a very small amount of steam that is very different than the recreational vaporizers that are out there the jewels or whatever brands that are out there that people are using that are within seconds giving them huge clouds of smoke those products are are burning plastics and they have vitamin e acetate and there's a lot of inhaled oil and plastic that goes into the lungs and that's causing a whole array of problems for people i can get into that during the questions if someone wishes the condition has been called popcorn lung and i can explain why but what's important to remember is the only difference between vaporizing the correct way and ingesting is that vaporizing will act much much faster there are certain patients that benefit from this and there are certain patients that absolutely need it um and those patients would be our veterans right ptsd is a condition in which a person's mindset is in a war zone they don't have an hour and a half to two hours to wait they grab their vaporizer and they turn it on and there's also a misconception that people think as soon as you are vaporizing cannabis you're using thc that is not the case you can attain pure cbd flower and inhale that and again they unanimously report symptom control they say that you know i'm calm again i avoided panic attacks this month i was able to stay away from the unpleasant trees of my inner self when i'm going through a struggle with ptsd and again these are things that we've documented recorded and they come back to us and their families come back to us and they're all very very thankful they say thank you for giving my husband back or my wife back to me um he wasn't himself or he wasn't herself when she come back so this is helping again i put here it's within five minutes as quick as it comes it also leaves a little bit faster it's about one to four hours before the efficacy is passed i've added a couple slides for terpenes guys this is um something that a lot of patients are telling us um in clinic it's very interesting remembering back to the trichomes that grow off of medical cannabis those tiny little fat projections because they are fat they can have particles settle on them dust settles on them pollen will settle on them so if a medical cannabis plant or any cannabis plant is growing next to a lavender field chances are that it will adapt to some of its environment it can pull in some lavender pollen and that becomes a part of the plant's genetics it's very interesting so plants that have a bit of the lavender terpene profile to them have a calmer relaxing feel a terpene i should explain is any scent or aroma or flavor that comes from all plant matter so if anyone has a basil plant at home and they pluck a leaf off of that and they smell it you are smelling the terpene profile of that plant cannabis has recorded all of these different terpenes within the plant so linolol was the one that i was referring to lavender that is again it can be used to have calming effects um it's a bit sedating it helps with insomnia naturally chirophiline is another one that one's a little bit hard to say but that is the one that comes off of black cloves um spicy woody scent to it again these are all things that we document in clinic pinene is a very popular one as well this one's an interesting one we have patients who use cbd with a high level of pinene and they come back and say hey guess what i don't need my asthma inhaler nearly as much anymore i feel that it really dilates my lungs and i can breathe a little better when i use my cbd well we have to listen we have to document and that is what we have done here there will never be a time when someone you know goes into a clinic or or a bit of an acute setting in an emergency setting and says you know i need to shut a little or i'm not going to make it it doesn't have direct medical value but it's helping and we're paying attention guys side effects this is another hot topic when it comes to these presentations a lot of people love to ask me well i heard so and so tried it and they went crazy and they were never the same person again that is not what happens when it comes to medical cannabis this is a very very controlled and monitored situation that people get into when it comes to medical cannabis all of these side effects that are seen here are from the use of high thc i pause for dramatic effect remembering that cbd side effects are an upset stomach or a headache these are all from high thc and again of course dry mouth is on the top of the list here drowsiness well i thought about adding this one and i took it off and i put it back on i thought is it really a side effect if we're using thc for sleep assistance and a patient is feeling drowsy isn't that what the goal was but again i put it there in case someone didn't want to feel drowsy thc would have to be avoided and that's common practice some of the more uncommon side effects are a panic attack paranoia or psychosis guys these are so uncommon that we hardly ever see them and if it is something that is a danger to the patient we protect the patient the only time a patient would suffer from a panic attack paranoia or psychosis is if they were predisposed to it if they were diagnosed with schizophrenia if they're diagnosed with bipolar if there's a family history of schizophrenia all these questions are asked and documented and recorded by the doctor before a prescription is even put into place so again the old tale of someone using cannabis and never being the same is not true mental disease is just not well known enough and a lot of people who are struggling with mental disease will go into alternatives to try and attain some form of benefit and it's not always a healthy practice but these things can occur any stimulant can cause psychosis in a person who is schizophrenic this is uh also something that i wanted to add and discuss with you guys a very in a sneaky way added the opioid overdose and i wanted to compare and contrast to cannabis because the opioid crisis is no secret guys i don't want to throw shadow at modern medicine but at a time opioids were helping so many different conditions that physicians started to write it more and more and unfortunately they're incredibly addictive and when the doctor would say no to a person well they were left with alternative methods to attain it it wasn't ever safe to begin with the reason why opioids can be so dangerous is because they do have receptors in our respiratory center our breathing center it is considered a neurological suppressant there was a time in which a lot of movie stars and famous people were passing away from opioids and that's because the physician would give them the prescription and tell them please do not use this with any with any other neurological suppressants and they'd say yeah sure doc don't worry about it they would take their medication and then they would sit and have a couple glasses of wine and the next thing you know you have not just one neurological suppressant you have two and they would go to sleep and they would simply stop breathing due to opioids having receptors in the breathing center it was very sad that is called an accidental overdose the comparison and contrast is that thc does not have receptors in the breathing centers of our brain and there is no way that it can slow down our breathing again very important to this group very important for everybody to understand that there has never been a reported case of death due to the use of cannabis addiction i think some of the questions that came our way before this presentation were asking me about addiction so i i brought forth this slide i absolutely hate this slide but i have to give you guys something um if we look at the bottom here it's very dated it came out of washington dc in 2001 but this was a study that was done and it was respectful enough for us to post it here cannabis is reported to have about a nine percent dependency rate now dependency in medicine is described as somebody who requires a substance or they are at risk from a physical standpoint if you take alcohol away from an alcoholic there's a chance that they can suffer from a heart attack seizures renal renal dysfunction they want to call it so regardless there's lots of different things that can happen if you remove the substance with cannabis there are none of those things nine percent of people said they were living better with it and they wanted it again so and again this list is talking about people who smoked cannabis it has nothing to do with medical cannabis i hate that we're even in the same arena as some of the substances in this slide you know heroin and cocaine and tranquilizers those are very heavy street drugs but at the top of the list is tobacco which is readily available at a very young age in this country and then of course alcohol which we celebrate with and that's quite a a a very very toxic substance when you think about it alcohol kills people there are several hundred deaths in toronto every month based on alcohol dependency again under the radon right we're okay with it because it's been around for a while but cannabis has all this stigma so it's important to know the facts this is another one that i've added here um because i thought it was very interesting to share with you guys one of our physicians came to us from a substance abuse recovery program and he said his patients were all unanimously asking more about medical cannabis so he decided to join the apollo team the apollo family and he wanted to learn more and he started paying attention to the medications that were dropping off the list when patients were using medical cannabis and these are some of the results that we found so again alcohol substitution more than 40 percent that's an enormous number illicit drug use this is what he saw in his private clinic not us but about 26 of those patients were able to substitute cannabis the big one the most important one that we like to talk about is obviously prescription medications more than 65 were able to reduce prescription medications with the use of medical cannabis and of course you have these buds in the background that we now understand the reason why they're fuzzy and sticky is because of those tiny little trichomes that brings me to the end guys um i'll stop here because i anticipate questions and maybe some discussion so let me get back to everybody can you see me kim i can see you i can't see you i can still see your screen okay what about you know perfect we're good thank you so much uh aaresh okay so we have a few questions that have been coming in if people have any more questions please type them in now uh before we end the presentation we will follow up with you though and and your clinic uh if there so one of the questions um was how can cannabis help muscular atrophy and not neurological so muscular yeah a lot of clients suffer from muscular issues and it's not yeah of course of course i mean let's look at a big picture okay als is a loss of communication with central nervous system let's leave it at that any muscle who that is not used over a period of time will atrophy okay i have to be 100 honest with you guys medical cannabis does not play a role when it comes to the physiological physiological atrophy of muscle we don't i i can't even sit here and connect it in any way shape or form we do not play a role that way the best combat for atrophy is physiotherapy guys you got to use that muscle to build that muscle and of course i understand that's not always available but that is that is the combat atrophy good question can you tell us some of the benefits for someone who has bulb or onset symptoms yeah remembering that almost 80 percent of all als will graduate into bulbar symptoms this is something that we must discuss with als patients right if a patient is having trouble swallowing or trouble breathing and medical cannabis can help relax that nerve or thc at a micro dose can help as a muscle relaxant then we can say that we're some way benefiting it would have to be a trial and air basis we would start again at the lowest dose possibly move up slowly to see if there is a benefit sometimes they come back to us and say it's still the same we will have a very serious conversation you see well we understand that we have tried and this is not a treatment option for you but it would be with the relaxation of muscles and that's the only role we can play um does cannabis help with anxiety around you know people who have an als diagnosis but also people who are suffering from severe copd copd yeah if a patient comes in with anxiety and copd you better believe the physician is check marking no inhaled forms of cannabis okay we're going to be ingestible only cbd plays a role as an anti-inflammatory copd is inflamed airways that have been clogged up and now we're going the other opposite direction you can't get oxygen out so to not bore us with all the details spoken patients do come to our clinic and we do give them cbd and then ingestible forms of a combination of both cbd and thc can help with the anxiety right remembering that both anxiety and depression are two conditions from the same area of the brain one is an overcompensation one is an under but they're definitely linked right so you can help kind of regulate people we put people back into what we call homeostasis which is balance that's not always easy to find it's ghost dependent but i promise you we'll find it okay um is there medical cannabis that's available in edibles yeah you know it's funny edibles is an interesting term people are thinking now well edibles are out so where's the cookies and the chocolates and the brownies and all that fun stuff you guys remember cannabis is a fat soluble medication so when you consume a brownie that has cannabis versus a capsule that is medical cannabis or an oil they all get digested the same way right they're still first past metabolism a lot of the licensed producers now have chocolates a lot of them have cookies the only kind of restriction that help canada has put on these license producers when it comes to the fun quote-unquote edibles is that they must be broken down by dose in the past you would get someone telling you hey here's a cookie you know eat half of it don't eat the whole thing it's too much well how do you know the medication isn't all sitting on one side of that cookie you have to feel one way you meet the other half of you you feel completely different so canada has said that is not allowed you have to give individually sized dose dependent edibles so i guess the energy questions yes they do exist i think there will be some people on the call that will be quite happy to know that it comes to chocolate form yes um so one of the questions we're having is who pays for medical cannabis and then the second question was did ohip cover that cost good questions uh there's a couple there so first and foremost your entire process will apollo is completely free all right it is overhead covered and it doesn't matter what province you live in right now we are able to see patients from coast to coast like mentioned so the six steps that i showed are all covered the medication is still considered private so that is on the patient unfortunately we are at the top of our lungs with health canada we want this stuff covered just as much as patients do we do have a lot of different avenues that we can travel if a patient is looking for some form of financial relief a lot of these companies offer compassionate pricing there are certain companies that are higher priced or lower priced we can find out exactly what would best keep the individual but as it stands now it is uh is private it'll range in price anywhere from 25 to 100 a month depending on what the patient needs um is there a typical timeframe one of the things you you may reference to a few times was low and slow and is there a typical time frame for a patient to start feeling like they've really reached that perfect dose yes it usually takes us anywhere from four to six weeks to learn and what we do with our patients is they have their first appointment and we drop a treatment plan that's gonna slowly increase their dose with a phone number to our call center that's open seven days a week if they need it and we don't want anyone feeling abandoned and we always tell patients after their first visit look you've been here a while this is a long process the one thing you must remember when you leave is if you feel any side effects stop immediately and call us okay there is no weaning schedule with medical cannabis but because it is fat soluble it can take time to build up in the system and we see those benefits anywhere from four to six weeks out a lot of people are like wondering i took that one dose how come i'm not okay guys you cannot obtain a benefit from any medication with a single dose we have to try over time so we have a question from a client who's been taking um cannabis over for overnight for sleeping um just wondering is there a benefit of increasing that to take it during the day so what's the benefit the difference between maybe regular dosing versus time-specific dosing the the benefits would be based on the half-life of the medication okay so let's say someone is taking and actually i'm gonna give you a real case we had a patient who came in um who had really really bad osteoarthritis in both knees okay former soccer player he says my knees are killing me i take cbd first thing in the morning and it really helps me until about one o'clock so after one o'clock i'm kind of just left with my pain and in the evening i take my sleeping dose and that really helps as well what he has inadvertently discovered is that it takes him about four to six hours for it to come out of his system so his eight am dose is done by about one o'clock so i asked him well why don't we take another dose at 12 30 because i didn't know i could do that i said well if you're feeling the pain again that means that the medication has come out of your system the advantage to using it more regularly is symptom control and more hours of anti-inflammation or anti-inflammatory properties of cannabis so good question you can extend daytime products in the day and then obviously your evening product will be your even product um one of the words that you use and i'm going to try to say efficacy um explain that to people yeah efficacy is where we attain a clinical benefit okay if something is ineffective it's not high efficacy that means that it's not affecting anything it's not helpful but we try to retain the lowest therapeutic dose and the highest efficacy which means we want to use as little as possible with the maximum effect and the only way you can do that is to get to a dose where you're feeling something push a little past that and see if there's any more benefit if not you come back to the lower dose sometimes and very rarely patients will call us and say well i tried one evening capsule and didn't work so i went to two it was okay i went to three and that was not pleasant for me i didn't like how i felt well i will say well mrs smith mr smith we now know what we don't want to feel okay we will go back to a lower dose that is more effective there's a higher efficacy for you i hope i answered that one other questions we had was is a little bit more complicated but um a person who received um a prescription for medical cannabis and and picked that up from their pharmacy um but feels like they don't have they've never been given any actual instructions where do people turn for that support you have to go back to the clinic that is that is our our number one problem with medical cannabis unfortunately i i'm in the industry myself and i see it all the time we have patients that come to our clinic and say well i went to so-and-so and they told me to use this but that's all i heard and talked to me since well like a doctor's office if they give you a prescription and you call and say this isn't working yet the doctor will say well we've got to give it four more weeks so we got to give it two more weeks so if it didn't work stop and i'll come back in for a follow-up we treat cannabis the exact same the problem is that there are a lot of clinics that are opening that are not correctly situated to support the patient base so it's it's it's unequivocally important for patients to understand that your support system is just as important as access to the medication right so if i was a patient that had nowhere to call for medication odds are i'll stop using it and then the whole process is undermined by a lack of education so i promise you actually let me rewind that person should go back to the clinic that prescribed to them to have their questions answered and if not they can always give us a call all right can people if they've had not a great experience it's not an issue to switch to another another clinic if they like they're not getting the support they need at one clinic they could go to another clinic and for example being your clinic being one of them i encourage that anytime someone doesn't get what they need from a family doctor they're quick to change right and sometimes people think well this physician didn't treat me right or this nurse practitioner didn't treat me right i want to go somewhere else and they go somewhere else and they attain an entirely different experience i'm not trying to say we're you know we're walking this golden line here but in actuality if a medical facility is not fulfilling the need for a patient the next question we had was around cannabis salves so creams and lotions uh and and the benefit around that yeah topicals topicals so a big hot topic um it's interesting to say but i'll do my best to explain it when we think about our bodies we always tend to look past the skin right one of our biggest and most important organs it is a fat soluble protective layer cannabis is fat soluble yes it will absorb yes it will affect the joint that is put on that being said we have seen benefit from smaller more peripheral joints right so a bad elbow wrist ankles maybe a knee but if we're talking about back pain shoulder pain or hip pain anything that's deeper you got to go systemic and like i explained when it comes to you know osteoarthritis chronic pain which is more than 70 of what we see in clinic any site inflammation will graduate into systemic inflammation and it's important to address systemic inflammation with the systemic anti-inflammatory i love topicals and i love how people are gravitating towards them well they're saying well i don't want to use cannabis i just want to use it on my joint and kind of get away with it that's great give it a shot but i promise you you will probably attain a better benefit if using it systemically this has been so helpful in terms of the education for all of us listening um so we know that there will be follow-up questions we are going to to pass them on to you for sure we appreciate everyone listening today but we also really appreciate the information it was very unbiased and really general so if you have a question and you want to talk to a medical professional at your clinic please call you can call any clinic but these guys are offering to to answer questions and and and help give some direction it seems like there's some people that have been posting some comments about that they just feel very lost and so it sounds like from from listening to you speak is that it's really important that people feel well supported in this in terms of the decision making around what works for them and we've heard a lot of times i think the one comment that was made is that um the two things one is low and slow is very important but also um it takes time and it it's not just uh let's do the first dose and be done with things um it doesn't work for people wow right away but for long-term use that's not going to be something that's going to be exactly that's exactly right and again like i mean i always draw on on clinical examples so we have certain patients that tell us my condition is really bad in the winter right so from end of october to march i am able to stay afloat with medical cannabis i don't need it in the summer and that's brilliant like i love to hear that that means that patient is in complete control of their health and their understanding of the signals that are coming to them from their body other people will tell me well i tried it twice and it didn't work and again it's not an antibiotic you have to use it for a long period of time you have to understand what you do for after 90 days and the support systems that are lacking for people discourage that so i i don't want to you know sound like a bit of a broken record but the support system is just as important as access one more thing i wanted to quickly add as you mentioned the pandemic has kind of slowed down some of the more uh research initiatives that we've wanted to do als is is unequivocally important and if we do have those patients what we do is we kind of mark them in our emr we attain their permission to follow them from a category standpoint like i will give you a number not in you won't be written down names but i want to know what we are helping with and what your symptoms were and and how long we treat from the date that you came to us compared to the date of diagnosis moving forward again that information will be way more important to us down the line than any kind of commercial you know posting here so i'm happy to hear you said it was objective and kind of detached from the commercial side of things because our goal is to turn the dial of human understanding we want to know if this thing will be something that we can continue to grow on so as we were wrapping up we're getting rapid questions coming in because people realize so one of the questions is uh what's the best method of ingestion for someone who can't tolerate solid foods and might uh need a feeding tube is there a and i i don't know if you want to address that in this group setting or you'd like to just do that on an individual one no that's fine no that's fine i'm just thinking about it in my head a little bit i would have to know more about the individual but my understanding is if there is a gi-2 then we would want to avoid oils and go to a very small capsule again i don't know if they were able to take that capsule via the gi tube we'd have to do some more investigation but my thinking is less is better for that individual and at a concentrated dose so i would want to have 20 milligrams of cbd at night to start and only at night and then we can graduate into daytime use but we have to understand what it will do first so yes is the short answer okay um can you juice cannabis yeah you can um the process of juicing is interesting some people will juice it cold and then you have unactivated cannabis which just means you have to consume a lot more of it some people juice it and follow some of the cooking recipes a lot of helpful people on youtube um your the process is called decarboxylation which is what licensed producers are doing before they send the medication out the only difference between people doing it at home and people getting it from a licensed producer is that the license producer is health canada certified they have an exact set precise dose whereas if you're doing it at home you're kind of guessing now i've seen a tremendous number of people benefit from home cooking recipes and saying you know it's controlling my sleep and my fibro again so thank you i just don't know how much i'm using i'm making the same recipe week in and week out and sometimes it works better than others i left in the oven for an extra five minutes and that's less effective now again those are problems that some people want most people will think a licensed producer can prepare it for me and that's just the easier way um does does the person need a referral from their gp to work with you or any other clinic i don't know about other clinics for us we do not require a referral anymore this is so interesting some patients were telling us well i don't want my family doctor to know can i come in anyways and we'd say no we need a referral and then we decided one day it's not fair for us to say no to people if they're reaching out for an alternative for their health we need to say yes so we opened our doors to walk-ins and it just flooded in and then we got a whole bunch of enthusiasts saying well now i want my family doctor he told me not to search this out but i've been able to get rid of my sleeping man and some of my pain meds and he should know so we're happy to send a consult note with the full treatment plan highlighted to any physician that refers to us we prefer it but we don't have to have it i always say the more minds involved are better the bigger the circle of care the more care is involved and the last question is where is your clinic so we have um five brick and mortar locations in the toronto the greater area of toronto so i don't know if people are all from ontario but we start in aurora we go down to north york then we have a couple of locations downtown and then out west as well but with the current pandemic in place all of our appointments are over the phone or virtual so you would call you would be given an appointment within 48 hours and then you would have it from the comfort of your own home so that can be anywhere in ontario someone could be referred to your clinic anywhere in canada okay yeah anywhere in canada we have patients all over the country awesome thank you so much uh i think we're done because i think people continue to send stuff in but i really appreciate irish like this was awesome and so helpful for people uh thank you everyone for attending and i hope wish everyone a wonderful rest of the day if you do have any questions please feel free to reach out to us and we'll happily answer those awesome thank you so much for having me you guys want to end with a big token of gratitude it's always great to connect when we're also disconnected awesome thank you so much goodbye", "ngWuODwllSs": "[Music] each CBD product that we carry comes with a standardized dosage the dosage of CBD for the oil that we carry is twenty milligrams per ml for a hundred and fifty pound person the daily dose of CBD is basically twenty milligrams or one full dropper inside this bottle is a glass dropper with a line indicating the ml or CC mark so it says milliliter that milliliter mark indicates that's the 20 milligram dosage and for anybody who weighs more than 150 pounds you can adjust the dosage upward [Music] you", "i8ITLj9AHdQ": "hello again everybody and welcome back to your career economists in today's episode we will be making CBD coconut oil but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button for those of you that are new to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much so I'm gonna leave a link to my CBD MCT oil and that's gonna kind of go over the entire deke art process so I'm just gonna run through a really quick today I've already packaged up my biotics flower and I have that right beside me here this is 24 grams of Vioxx flour which came in at 21.1% CBD and this is our bag of flour so I'm just gonna put this in the oven for 30 minutes D carb at 250 degrees okay so while we're waiting for the flour to D carp I'm gonna go over some of the materials you'll need to make the CBD coconut oil first you're going to need coconut oil now I have organic coconut oil just run to the middle nothing crazy I got this larger container at BJ's you can pick it up yourself you always get it on Amazon I like to use organic stuff same thing with my MCT oil it's just if you're going to be putting this kind of stuff into your body you're gonna want it to be organic and we've put all that effort into making our head flour organics so why not just buy some more more organic products the other thing you'll need is you'll need to measure out 2 cups of coconut oil and I'll get into that too but you definitely don't want a measuring cup and of course in today's video we'll we will be featuring the magic butter machine now this recipe can be used without a magic butter machine but for today's purposes we are going to be using a magic butter machine some people use crock pots some people use a bunch of other stuff I just like the magic butter machine because it's just a no mess situation its cleanup is super easy but you can't use another household kitchen gadgets so now we'll wait for the flour and we'll start making the oil okay so our canvas has just D carved in the oven so before we take it out we are going to add the coconut oil to the magic butter machine again if you're using a crock-pot or whatever the recipe is still the same but your device is going to be different so here I've measured out two cups of coconut oil and you're just gonna put it right in try to get as much of it as possible I know coconut oil can be a pain because of its solid texture and you know it melts at like I don't know 75 degrees or something like that so what I like to do too is take the glove and I'll just kind of use that to get the coconut oil off I can always wash the glove all right so that's all the coconut oil now we're going to grab our D carb M flower smells awesome and gonna add it right in make sure you get everything get this out of the way make sure everything's out I'm gonna put this right on lockdown I'm gonna go ahead and plug it in all right and so the magic butter machine recipe typically calls for two hours at 160 degrees but I like to do 160 degrees for four hours I like the longer cook so that's it now we just wait for the machine all right so the magic butter machine is now done it's been four hours and we're going to take the top off here now looks to be pretty nice not a whole lot of mess this time around which is great shake it off a little bit and now we're gonna slide this scoop off the edge let me show you inside here very typical for this machine you just want to scoop off the edge get as much as you can that plant material holds all that CBD all the good stuff that down I put the glove on my right hand and I am going to pour [Applause] he's gonna get all that juice out of there looks really good so now we'll put this off to the side just back up now there's some plant material down there in the bottom so I'm just gonna scoop the rest of this out all right give this one more good squeeze you can see right there just squeezing it get the most you can out of it that looks to be it so we'll put this in our sink and that is it so what I'll do is I'll take the coconut oil I'll put it in these mason jars and I will let it rest it will risa Lydda fie and you can do what you want with it now the great thing about coconut oil is you can add it to your lotion you can cook with it you can use it as a lotion you can pretty much do anything you really want with coconut oil it's kind of a really good way to use CBD but that's today's recipe that's all I have for if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button if you're new here to the channel and you can find us on Instagram and Facebook now those links will be in the description below I'll

have joining me now to discuss concerns around the use of medical marijuana to manage chronic pain as dr. Dean Drazen is associate medical director for care and treatment centers dr. drowsiness thank you so much for being here today thanks for having me so Ken marijuana be used to treat or to manage chronic pain chronic pain is one of the number of diagnoses that are acceptable for a physician to prescribe or to authorize use of medical marijuana we hear a lot now about CBD as an alternative so is that a viable option CBD in the scientific study seemed to have some good pain relieving properties and that was very exciting initially because CBD in and of itself is not associated with addiction however in real life as we see there's a lot of CBD products on the market I'm not hearing patients getting great pain relief from CBD it also has some all CBD preparations also have at least a trace amount of THC which may be a concern for some patients so what are your other concerns with marijuana being used as a chronic pain treatment well in the context with with in which I treat chronic pain which is patients who have a substance use disorder as well as a chronic pain condition part of our aim is to calm down the part of the brain that's involved in the substance use disorder marijuana use is not going to allow that part of the brain to calm down like we want it to in order for them to get good recovery excellent I see so what solutions might you offer to alleviate the current opioid epidemic in terms of marijuana and using it to manage chronic pain well I think that for people who have an opioid use disorder that using alternative methods of treating their chronic pain acupuncture massage hydro therapy physical therapy yoga meditation all of these are harmless all of these will allow the part of the brain that processes chronic pain to calm down and allow the part of the brain that is involved with addiction to calm down and get to its baseline state medical marijuana really does not have a place in the treatment of chronic pain particularly in a patient with a substance use disorder and that touches on my next question is there any concern about swapping out one addictive substance for another in this treatment yes there's no question that marijuana has its own addiction liability associated with it and certainly for somebody who has a substance use disorder again we want to allow that part of the brain to heal without stimulating it with a different substance and what alternative chronic pain treatments exist that don't involve opioid medications or marijuana well as I mentioned there's many alternative treatments acupuncture massage physical therapy hydrotherapy as I mentioned previously but in combination layering these treatments and individualizing them for one patient that's the way to go and if there's one takeaway you want people watching this to walk away with what is that I think that the most important thing to understand is that most effective relief from chronic pain involves a minimum of drugs and a maximum of alternative therapies excellent doctor drowsiness thank you so much for being here thanks for having me and if you're interested in learning more you can visit Karen org", "kklrpXakawk": ">> MY NAME IS JEFF ROSSEN.

Hillary and Johnny I mean these were debilitating migraines this was taking days out of every single month for you we just couldn't leave the house yeah it's interesting because it's only very much later on in life for me sort of mid forties when I when I discovered that I was actually suffering from the first of I just thought was a really bad headache or a virus and I remember I was actually filming it was freezing cold I was about 46 bit stressed and it was that time of the month and I just had this awful searing headache I felt sick and actually for the first time ever thought can't work and I had to ask if I could just sit down for a while and start working and since then sort of on a sort of regular basis normally I think for doing my hormones and when my periods start I've just had this awful migraine where sometimes three to four days I just can't can't function can't you know can't make tea for everyone can't do the school around can't go to work and it's something that I didn't really I never thought about it you know with people say I've got a migrant that always she's just got a headache you know but why did you have to lie down you know what why is it so dramatic because you look fine but actually and it changes your character I've been really sort of disgruntled and snappy and you know I just I want to talk to anyone I'm actually not held to live with and it was held to go through as well and had you been to the GP there and and gone down there yes tried various kind of mini yeah I'm not great at popping pills I'm all for being preventative and saying but why am I getting them you know what can I do to prevent them rather than right well every month I've got to have this this stack of pills to stop me suffering so much so you know for me that there was sort of like as a safety box it was you know where I'd have these pills there is sumatriptan yeah which kind of worked but I'm not happy with that really I'd rather find out why I'm getting it yeah and what I can do about it or May a more natural way of getting over it and this is then how the the cannabis oil can abide it with your partner actually suggested it yes yes my other half Martin he sort of researches a lot into system well first of all from nutrition but authored to health and sort of holistic ways of looking after yourself and it was a friend of his who actually was epileptic and she's done a lot of due diligence with it and discovered that it helped her I'm just saying this he's all for everybody's different you know I'm not an expert but you know I started to read up on things and discovered that you know for headaches it could help so I tried and it's been like three four months and I haven't had a migraine which for me is life-changing really yes and it could very well be the placebo effect who knows Hillary but where where do you stand on this because if you're saying you've got three or four months there with like this terrible migraine what Jenny describes really well is menstrual migraine and this is very common so many women in the days leading up to their period and during their period they can get migraines on a frequent basis and part of the reason for that is is a falling off of Eastern and levels just before a period and a rise in chemicals called prostaglandins which can cause inflammation and pain and and normally we treat those we can treat those with Eastridge n' just before the period we treat them with with medicines that can stop the inflammation and that would be the traditional way forward now there's huge hype at the moment about CBD products as sold as health supplements legally in this country things everyone's jumping on the bandwagon and you really don't know what you're buying so some will contain a lot more CBD than other products which may have hardly any and there is research done it being done on how therapeutic CBD can be in things like neurological conditions headaches migraines anxiety depression a lot of works being done but we don't yet know how effective CBD is and what concentration you need yes you can buy it provided it satisfies all the safety and sort of regulatory necessities but you don't know what you're buying and some of it can be really expensive now it's worth trying and you've tried it and it seems to work for you and that's fine what it doesn't have in its THC which is the psychoactive chemical that you're not getting a high but you are getting some pain release with an awful lot of people don't quite know what is that you hear they're trying a health supply which is legal cannabis is a Class B drug and it's still illegal to to use and possess and supply so you know you've got to be there is a big distinction this CBD doesn't contain the THC which which has this that gives you the high is the psychoactive and activity but it may be that for some people when they use a decent concentration of CBD does give them relief against pain and some people even think it could be good for conditions like Parkinson's epilepsy anxiety and depression yeah just drops I just take her you know you sort of work up to what sort of works for you but for me just a couple of drops underneath the tongue for about 60 90 seconds and I do it twice a day but like I say you know it works for me I think and I've been very careful I've done the due diligence on what I've got a sort of certified organic non sort of toxic drops that I use from hemp so you know you have to you have to go out there and do the research yeah but it is tricky because it's you know it's very expensive as well and if you get the wrong one you know and there are plenty you can buy online which will have more concentration and others you can buy and health food shops might have very very little if any you know so just be careful and do you diligently it's a waste of money otherwise you", "fqNfGj8jwFY": "arthritis is a very potentially debilitating condition it affects millions of Canadians and there's actually a lot of different forms of arthritis the most common form that most of us think of when we hear the word arthritis is osteoarthritis and so that is typically the wear and tear that most people eventually especially if they live long enough will experience on their joints and that can be arthritis of the shoulders the knees the hands and that's just your general wear and tear and what people who experience this type of arthritis what they usually complain of is that sometimes they have a mild amount of stiffness but as the day gets on and they start to use those joints the inflammation starts to get worse and the pain starts to get worse another form of arthritis though that a lot of people don't typically talk about is inflammatory arthritis and so you can consider this as a slightly more severe form of arthritis where in addition to the inflammation it's actually your immune system is kind of attacking your joints regardless if you have osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis one of the main goals is managing pain and so when it comes to pain management you're stuck with anti-inflammatories which are your advils or your naproxen of the world tylenol or opioid painkillers and sometimes steroid injections work but if you have multiple joints it's hard to inject steroids all over the body nonetheless cannabinoids have become extremely popular and the arthritis society here in Canada they mentioned that almost one in two of their members reports using cannabis for arthritis it's typically osteoarthritis that patients are using cannabis for but what we're seeing in the clinic is that this is a huge burden to society and a huge number of referrals coming in come for arthritis a lot of the patients will use high CBDs typically and what they become back and report is that their joints feel a little bit more fluid they're having a reduction in the nation and they feel like their functioning has improved some patients will use a little bit more THC but it's usually in the evening where the pain will affect their ability to sleep so they'll use a little bit more THC and that will help them sleep and sleep is really important to managing your mental health and if you're in a chronic stress state then your pain is also going to be worse the next day we were actually the first health charity to have focused call on medical cannabis to understand what impact it has on arthritis patients but coupled with that if something is being used as a medicine we think that it should be treated as such so things like it needs to be taken in the context of a health care provider making sure that it's monitored properly but also people should have access to medical cannabis the same way they have access to their other medications so right now people actually can only obtain medical cannabis through mail order as one example which could be challenging unlike other medications you would pay tax on medical cannabis which is not something that we expect or is true for any other medication so their number of things that we think that if something is being used properly as a medicine it should be treated as such and we also know that many people who are authorized to use medical cannabis are actually taking it for arthritis so in that context we've heard a lot from arthritis patients about what medical cannabis the impact that it has on their disease most importantly we want to make sure that at the arthritis society we're trying to speak on behalf of patients and patient experiences and for something that's been authorized for almost twenty years now we hope that people can have access to medical cannabis in the way that they should but you know really emphasizing that there is so much to learn and we don't want to jump to conclusions but we want to make sure that we're paying close attention to medical cannabis and giving it the attention and resources that we think it

Ross hammock and we're going to continue our conversation about CBD THC marijuana and how it is used in lung cancer treatments can we start with talking about how it can be used what it's good for and maybe what's still not proven as for symptoms or a possibly a curative approach so it I mean we said there's THC and CBD so the CBD tends to work best for the symptoms that we associate with cancer and some of the treatments for cancer so it works for lack of appetite can work for insomnia it can work for anxiety it can work for pain I've had some patients that be able to come off their opiate painkillers that can work for nausea the thing is it's just a drug though I mean it works for some people and just like any other painkiller or anything else it doesn't work for everybody so it's it's just another tool in the armamentarium that we can use okay the THC has pretty limited medical role I'd say I mean there there are people who've pushed the very high THC form so there's something called Rick Simpson oil sure has that treatment for cancer and I think there's a tiny bit of truth in that but if you think about all of the developments in lung cancer it's all about personalized therapy so why should there be one treatment for every kind of cancer it doesn't make any sense and I think that's just wishful thinking okay so if someone was interested in starting to use CBD or THC as another tool in their lung cancer treatment yeah how would you want them to approach you and then let's also talk about how they can go about getting it where they should get it from and then also how they should go about using it you know methods of edibles smoking and vaping or what's the best options out there so in states where it's legal for both recreational and medical as in Colorado I mean technically you don't even have to go see your doctor you could just go in and get the stuff recrea recreationally the different recreational medical is the price it's essentially the same stuff or the same range of things that you can select it you go the the medical ramp you go to your doctor and I don't prescribe it I don't get out my prescription pad and say you need this and this dose and this often all I do is fill out the details so you can get an ID card so you can get the reduced price sure I mean my biggest worry though is then you go into a dispensary and somebody who may have no medical knowledge may really just be up to speed on their recreational aspects is then the person saying oh yeah you need this one yeah sure what are some things we still don't know about CBD and THC and its uses well I mean I mean it's a really long list so the the fact that they're I mean this is a natural product there's an analogy that's a bit like saying you know your doctor says you know you should have some alcohol and you go into a liquor store and they say the doctor said I should have some alcohol what should I get and the guy behind the things that you want beer do you want wine do you want liquor or whatever so we're kind of at that state you know which strain of marijuana do you take how do you take it generally speaking I would suggest you take something orally you know I think smoking it bathing it is a bad idea these are very sensitive tissues in your lungs it can be a solid gummy or a candy it can be an oil which allows you to be very sensitive you can't get it as creams but that's the only gonna be an issue of guilt like an achy joining the the other things we don't know is you know what dose do you take how often do you take it sometimes these things can get into your system very quickly ones that the oils tend to get in quicker some people even rub it on their gums which get into their system very quickly but if you do that if you don't or if you don't know that aspect you can overdose really quickly you know a one square of the chocolate bar I think nothing's happened 20 minutes later I eat the rest of the chocolate bar and then two hours later I'm completely stoned so all of this is unknown and desperately in need of study definitely what about drug interactions if someone wants to find out if the treatment they're on the target therapy they're on how it works with with marijuana where should they go for that information or who can they ask well what we're mostly worried about is when two drugs and marijuana is a drug are tab alized are broken down in the body in the same way and they're going to interfere with each other so they're either going to increase the levels of one of the drugs or decrease them and so the best place to do is to go to your your your pharmacist in a Cancer Center and say look I'm thinking about starting this I'm already on these treatments is that okay and I think that's the best place to start but it goes back to the idea of you know don't do the experiment in this weekend and then tell your doctor that you did it say hey this weekend I'm thinking about going to see a dispensary the first time what should I look out for okay perfect do you have anything else that you want touch base on this well so here's my question so have you taken marijuana I have many many years ago obviously not as a treatment option okay but I think what what I really like is that you answer that question directly and this has been a sort of taboo subject for a while and if the patient asked me have I taken marijuana I smoked it once it had no effect I was on a canal boat with some friends who's stoned out of their head and I was the one left driving true story there then you know you have to be able to address it upfront without being awkward about it sure and that's what maintains trust perfect okay well thanks for your time and thank you for joining us on hope with answers",

maybe a little more of the coconut oil and a half ounce of the decarboxylated cannabis we're going to throw it in the crock-pot below and we're gonna let it sit in there for about four to five hours go ahead and strain it through the cheesecloth basic simple straightforward take that half ounce of flour throw it in the oven 240 degrees for 40 minutes grab a smoke if you'd like forty minutes later that should be looking a nice golden-brown perfect just about ready let's go ahead and turn our crock-pot on to low using organic unrefined coconut oil eight ounces add the half ounce of the decarboxylated cannabis stir and cover leave on low for 3 to 5 hours I did four hours stir occasionally double layer the cheesecloth for a finer strain squeeze or press it to make sure you get all that oil out infusion complete overall in terms of the process I'm liking this method the best it's nice you don't have to worry about keeping an eye on the flame if you have a gas stove top like me even an electric range you still got to keep an eye because it might get too hot and you don't want to burn anything that ease of the crock-pot I am feeling and I'm excited to use this coconut oil and some nice gummies you know I love doing it in a smoothie I'll do a video about that even though it's really simple just to show you how I do it let your imagination run wild throw this coconut oil whatever your heart desires thanks for chilling on truebloods TV check out one of these videos click the link and i'll catch you on the next [Music]", "ATDB4zmZKlE": "CBD cannabis oil has attracted a lot of THC the CBD what is CBD CBD has well and truly brought the cannabis plant into the mainstream it's touted as having loads of health benefits and can be found in all sorts boils creams wine teabags sweets you name it and it's been all over the headlines but for something so talked about there's a lot of uncertainty about how it actually sits within the law CBD is a major compound found in the cannabis plant it's thought to affect the receptors in our nervous system and have broad medicinal benefits potentially treating conditions like anxiety insomnia and chronic pain but it won't give you a euphoric high and it's legal pure CBD is legal unlike its counterpart THC which is the other major compound found in cannabis THC produces the psychoactive effects that get you high and it's not legal in the UK but it's difficult to separate CBD from THC fully as they can come from the same plant now it's important to make the distinction here between hemp and marijuana hemp is legal to grow in the UK with a very low percentage of THC marijuana on the other hand refers to cannabis which contains more than this legal limit the home office says it's legal to grow industrial hemp containing up to 0.2% THC with a license however this is commonly misunderstood as applying to CBD products technically the legal limit of THC in finished products is 0% and research into the industry has found that a lot of commercially available CBD products include traces of THC this strict limit isn't currently being enforced and is unclear how it would be in the future right now the booming CBD market is frankly a of a mess the existing regulations are complex and vague and there isn't a standardized way of testing CBD products or labeling them instead every CBD product out there is subject to different regulations depending on what type of product it is so let's take CBD oil as an example is probably the most popular CBD product and it's classified as a food supplement not a medicine even though that's what most people use it for this means the CBD oil you find on a shop shelf won't have gone through tests and clinical trials like a medicine would have and it can't make any health claims on the bottle plus dosage guidelines and prices vary massively and you have to rely on the manufacturer's assurances that the product contains what it claims to and then other CBD products say cosmetics or veyts are subject to different regulations so at the moment got a situation where we've got a product that is super popular everyone wants to buy it everyone wants to sell it but the problem is no one really knows much about it particularly legal status of it and whether or not it can be used as a food product whether or not can be used as a cosmetic product and if it can whether or not it can be allowed to have a certain quantity of the narcotic element in it in this country technically you shouldn't have any THC at all in the product itself if you want to travel with it then you're going to have to check with the country that you're going to whether or not they will allow CBD oil to be in your possession or for you to use it or even travel with it some places won't even let you take it on a plane and to check that I would say look on the website of the government of the country that you're traveling to and if it isn't clear which in a lot of situations it isn't clear just don't travel with it so currently whether your CBD oil shampoo or tea bag complies to UK regulations or contains what it claims to is far from straightforward but thankfully there is momentum behind initiatives for independent product testing and clearer regulations because the CBD boom looks pretty set to continue and until the benefits are proven in clinical trials and regulations have caught up treat CBD with caution it's an exciting area of research but there are still many unknowns about dosage drug interactions and the effectiveness of over-the-counter CBD [Music]", "ODVX4f3eEDo": "[Music] hi there and welcome to the cannabis kitchen today I thought we would make some CBD infused muscle rub so muscle rub is a tough thing because a lot of people have their favorites but a lot of times they don't really know what's in it and so it's nice to have something a little bit more natural and it's also nice to be able to add the benefits of CBD so today we're actually going to be using two different types of CBD it is absolutely not necessary you can use either CB oil or you can use CV flour today we're going to use a little mixture of both just to add a little bit more liquid to the mix so what we're going to start with is our dry ingredients so what I've done is I've got a little bit of cheesecloth here and we're gonna put all our dry ingredients into it and form almost like a little tea bag so that we can drop it into the mixture and it will be a little bit less cleanup later on so what I've done to start actually is I've made a double boiler so I have that turned on and running right now the heat is just on low I just want the water should be hot I don't want it to boil underneath there and boil away on us so now that that is ready to go once we add all our ingredients that will start to melt together and we'll leave it sit for a little while so I have in this container this little glass I have 10 grams of CBD flour and a little bit of shake as well in there so we're just gonna add that onto our little pile here there we go the next thing we're gonna add is some cloves so cloves actually have a slight numbing feeling so that will definitely be a good add to our mixture here so I have I want to say 15 yes 15 clove pieces in here you can use clove essential oil as well I just didn't happen to have any in my kitchen so we're just gonna pop that on the pile the next thing we're gonna add is some cinnamon so cinnamon as you may or may not know has lots of anti-inflammatory properties I'm just using sugar from my kitchen or sorry cinnamon out of the kitchen but you can use cinnamon sticks or you can use cinnamon essential oil this is a little bit powdery but because it's going to be mixed in with everything else I don't think it's going to go through the cheesecloth so I've used about a quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon powder and the last dry ingredient we're gonna add is some red crushed red peppers so crushed red peppers are gonna add a little bit of heat to this mixture so it's going to be kind of a cold hot kind of a feeling once you put it on your skin we're not adding a lot I happen to have an allergy to peppers so I can get away with using a little bit but not very much plus with all these ingredients that we're going to be adding a lot of them anyway they do have some irritants if you happen to rub your eyes or touch other parts of your body things like you like to put it in your mouth or on your lip so a little bit goes a long way so again I'm using about quarter of teaspoon just under a quarter of a teaspoon of crushed red peppers perfect so now all we're gonna do is gather this up as best we can and we're gonna make a little tea bag I guess you'd call it squish this up just like that give it a good squeeze we want it nice and tight there so now what I've done is I've just cut a little piece of kitchen string this is what you'd normally used to like tie a turkey at Christmas or Thanksgiving so we're just going to wrap this around this is just organic cotton so it won't add anything that we don't want into our mixture and leave a little bit at the end so we can tie it just like that perfect there you go so this is all of our dry ingredients ready to go and now we can start to add our wet ingredients the first thing we're going to add is I haven't here a quarter of a cup of melted shea butter I only melted it to get my measurement right but inside you can put it in as a big clump if you want to not a big deal either way so we're going to add that right into the bowl on top here there we go perfect ya know there are also obviously some benefits to shea butter shea butter is full of fatty acids which is really really good for your skin it has a very kind of high concentration so it's actually excellent for your skin but also it has some alien flare anti-inflammatory properties so of course it's the perfect addition for what we're making today the next thing we have is a quarter of a cup of sweet almond oil so sweet almond oil also very good for your skin it contains lots of vitamin E so it's gonna keep your skin nice and soft so we can't leave that out so pour that in just like that see if this will fit in here there's so much air as we can go good so now I'm just gonna add this little tea bag in as well just because we've got some liquid here so we're gonna put that in and we're just gonna kind of get it nice and saturated if we can and then we can get that started perfect all right so the next additions are small ones we've got lots of little containers here now I will put links on the website for all of these things so what we're using is some camphor and some peppermint essential oil we have our CBD oil as well I'm using the aurora and so the other thing we're adding is some eucalyptus oil I didn't happen to have any of my usual essential oil left in the eucalyptus so I just picked this up at the drugstore it's gonna suit the purposes the eucalyptus oil is and 80 and flama thick so like you can smell it in there it's gonna do just fine sometimes you have to just go with whatever you can so we're going to put all these in here there's only little bits of these as well this isn't a super big recipe so we're adding 45 drops of camphor we're adding 20 drops of eucalyptus and 30 drops of peppermint essential oil there now we're gonna add our CBD oil the CBD oil I'm adding is a hundred milliliters so about four full droppers out of your bottle if you have a 30ml bottle go perfect now the last thing we're gonna add is some beeswax pellets beeswax pellets are going to help sort of hold the whole mixture together but we're not using enough to make it back into a solid as these actual beeswax pellets we're using a lot of liquid in this recipe so when we're finished it should actually have quite a nice easy rubbing consistency so we're just gonna drop those in as well and we'll get up that all melting along so this is going to be done the same way as any other infusion with decarboxylated the flour that we're using which we always do and now this is just gonna sit and melt all together for about four hours and then we'll come back and get it put into some little containers and it'll be ready to go all right so we will check back in with you in four hours okay we are back it has been four hours and we've got our mixture all ready to go so we're just gonna pop this out of the water it's still a little bit hot so we need to be very careful so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna take this tea bag we're going to squeeze it out and get as much out as we can so I picked up this cool little contraption at winners one day and I think it's gonna be perfect for the job because I don't have very strong hands so this will help me maximize it so we're just going to pop that in there I'm gonna give it a squeeze there's so much stuck in there get as much as we can there we go I think that's pretty good there we go so here's our mixture let's put that down we've got our mixture here there's not a lot here like I said but we're going to put this into some containers and then it's gonna be ready to go so what I've done previously is I sprayed these containers out with some rubbing alcohol just to make sure that they're nice and clean inside and so now all we need to do is just pour this mixture let me just get a little scraper there we go now it does set fairly quickly so it shouldn't be too bad I'm not sure we're gonna need to but put all the extras in there and it's already starting to harden in the bowl so you got to work a little bit quick and if it does cool down and start to solidify again you can just pop it into your hot water and that should soften it back up okay so we are back and our muscle rub is all hardened it actually has not too too strong to smell it's quite nice actually and when you go to use it it comes off fairly easily so it's nice and easy to rub on your skin just like that wherever you hurt and it rubs in quite nicely and easily so there you go you got some homemade CBD infused muscle rub which is awesome if you keep it in the fridge it'll probably last you about a year if you don't use it up first and also if you buy some nice little containers they make nice little gifts for people as well so let's fit on nice there you go you can get some little stickers to write a little label on them and I can already feel it starting to work so that is really nice and I think you'll enjoy it too so thank you very much for joining me in this episode of the cannabis kitchen I hope that you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed making it it's a nice easy recipe I will put the links in on the website if you go into the cannabis infused recipe section at www.canadianoutback.com look into doing that for you as well we actually had this one in the works to make and somebody did request it so that worked out good so whoever was looking for it I hope you enjoyed this particular recipe you can make changes as you wish you can add more camphor which is really good to reduce inflammation you can add more CBD or less just make sure that you're not messing around too much just because you don't want to mix up and get a really runny batch or a really really hard batch that you can't rub on so play around with it enjoy it if you have anything that you would want to add to your balm then by all means let me know in the comments I would love to know how you guys make yours and again please join us on our website Canadian wheat farm calm we've got lots of really great people there it's a really great community everyone's very helpful and if you have any questions you can ask them there we don't limit ourselves to

dr donald fabio cbd from hemp oil is what we're going to be talking about today and how it's used as a topical pain relieving liniment it's very common it's available everywhere just about all 50 states right now i believe over the counter and again it's a hemp oil extract which means there's very little thc in there there's no psychoactive effect so let's be clear about that we're not talking about the medicinal marijuana we're talking about hemp oil extracts cbd so how can you tell if it's going to be a beneficial for you well you got to read the ingredients and once you read the ingredients you can determine if it's going to be a good product you look at the concentration you look at what's in there and you look at what your goals are so right now our goals are pain relief that's what we're talking about so i just have a couple of creams randomly chosen cbd plus oil gold formula full spectrum hemp extract which is what we talked about so that's good it has the ingredients 100 milligrams of cbd we don't know how much per serving but the jar is 100 milligrams and it's got sweet almond oil beeswax and glycerol stearate and a bunch of other ingredients on the bottom here but no artificial dyes or scents so that's good no artificial dyes or scents it's got a lot of emollience a lot of things that are going to soften your skin with cbd which means it's going to set on your skin probably really good for someone who has a skin lesion like psoriasis or eczema something like that i don't think it'll be really good for pain control because it's not going to penetrate through the skin beeswax sweet almond oil those are oils hemp oil it's an oil it's going to sit on the skin so might be good for skin types of things where you want moisturizing and healing but i don't think it's good for pain control cbd clinic pain relief ointment oh now we're going right after pain they're claiming this relieves pain let's look at their ingredients cbd hemp oil good so we know it's it's there it's safe 400 milligrams so um this is 1.55 ounces this is 1.3 ounces so there's a lot more cbd in here um there's peppermint oil tea tree oil eucalyptus oil clove oil so lots of good oils in here um we look at the label however under active ingredients and it lists camphor 11 and menthol 16 wow that's really high so you're going to get a lot of icy hot you're going to get a lot of counter irritants menthol will give you a cooling effect camphor kind of gives you that cooling heating effect so it's an icy hot 17 percent icy hot is very very strong so this will give you a counter irritant effect i don't know if it's going to decrease the inflammation but it doesn't really address the pain directly it dresses it into correctly because it irritates the skin with the menthol in the camphor and then therefore the brain doesn't sense the pain in the area so it doesn't go after the cause but very strong stuff the next one we have is phytozol transdermal phytocannabinoid complex serum uh what are their active ingredients well it's a 100 milligrams of micro encapsulated time released photocannabinoid complex cbd so the cbd here is encapsulated well and what it's encapsulated in dgme which is a transfer agent so here um there is no menthol there is no camphor there is no methyl solicitolate it's just cbd which is an oil which is encapsulated surrounded in dgme which allows it to get through the skin into the deeper tissues um i do know this does not get into the blood by the way i did research that it doesn't say it on the label it just stays in the in the superficial tissues so this will actually penetrate through the skin it won't sit on the skin so if you're in the cbd gets into the skin through the skin and once it penetrates then it can become an active ingredient at the deeper levels and it binds with the endocannabinoid receptors in your body going after the cause of your problem and suppressing the pain and inflammation that way so a transdermal agent that goes through the skin and doesn't sit on the skin so the active ingredient goes through the skin only company i know that has that whether it's cbd or not cbd that just sits on the skin with emollients cbd with counter irritants so you feel the icy hot so you know something's working but you don't know if the cbd is working so the bottom line is what are you looking for do you want to go after the pain and inflammation or do you just want to do a counter irritant if you just want to do a counter irritant i would say skip the cbd and just go to a really high concentration methyl salicylate menthol camphor formula that you can buy anywhere as well if you want to use the cbd it makes sense to do the phytozol because then you're going to be able to get an ingredient that penetrates through the skin scientifically proven to go six times deeper than other companies penetrate there's the information now you know i'm dr donald fabio thanks for tuning in", "g7bApQhA1H8": "on today's video I'm going to teach you how to make cannabis infused butter or oil in the instant pot so we're gonna talk about why to use an instant pot how to do it I'm gonna give you a quick demonstration as well and then just so you know the instructions for this recipe are printed below so you don't have to write anything down hi my name is Andrea hard I'm a cannabis coach and educator and I post new videos here every Saturday morning I also offer private consultations over the phone in-person workshops around the London Ontario area and online classes from the comfort of your own home okay let's talk about why we use an instant pot well this is the number one advantage the instant pot internal temperature gets to 242 degrees Fahrenheit which is literally perfect for D carving and infusing and it's a nice constant steady temperature so you don't have to worry about fluctuations it also makes it so that it's really not all that smelly at all infusing in your instant pot in a mason jar is way less alerting to your neighbors then doing it say on the stovetop or in a crock pot and it is crazy quick this is why people love the instant pot or any kind of pressure cooker in general is because it makes things really fast the first step in the process is to deke our beer cannabis and that turns your THCA and cbda into THC and CBD which is what you want you don't have to grind it first you're just gonna put it into a mason jar close it up finger tight and put that into a bath in the instant pot where the bath water is about halfway up the jar so if your jars halfway full make sure that the water is halfway up the jar as well and you're gonna set it to 40 minutes on manual then let it release for 10 minutes natural pressure release and then release the rest of it pressure yourself and you have d carb cannabis in a flash you don't have to infuse this cannabis you could just use this d carb cannabis as a sprinkle on top of spaghetti or you could put it into capsules the point is you could use it right now as a ste carb you don't have to infuse but if you want to the instant pot is great for that as well so now you're gonna lightly grind the bud you're not trying to make it into powder you're just trying increase the surface area slightly add in your oil or butter make sure that it's melted first and make sure that there's at least of enough liquid to cover the cannabis that you have in there the more liquid you add the less potent your infusion will be then put that mason jar back in the instant pot and it's a little bath for 40 minutes on manual again ten minutes natural pressure release then open it up and strain it or not and you have cannabis infused oil or butter which is amazing super fast much much faster than any other way as for storage you can keep your your all of your abusers always in a dark and cool place butter should be kept in the fridge or freezer and coconut oil could be kept on the counter or also in the fridge the great thing about infusing cannabis into oil or butter is that it allows the cannabis to last for so much longer it doesn't degrade once it's infused into an infusion as for dosing there's no real precise way to find out exactly what's in your infusion unless you have it lab tested but for the home cook I have a little solution for you so this infusion calculator allows you to put in the information that you know about your cannabis and it will spit out how many milligrams of THC or CBD are in your infusion so I'm going to show that to you now this is at the wake-and-bake website and if you haven't been here before you should definitely check it out it's amazing so if you know the THC percentage of your plant material you can type it in because you have lab tested cannabis if you don't you can go to a site like Leafly and type in the strain name and get a general idea so you type in how many grams that you're gonna be using for my infusion that we're gonna do today I'm doing 14 grams into one cup of oil so I know that with my cannabis I'm gonna have 20 100 grams of THC and not very much of CBD and that in each teaspoon I have about 43 milligrams of THC so that's really helpful for me to have an idea of how potent my infusion is again this is not perfect there's lots and lots of variables to go on there but it's a great starting point and even if you have used the dosing calculator it is still really important that you start low and go slow and be your own guinea pig each infusion that you make might be slightly different and you don't want to have a really bad experience because you're going off of what you think will happen so I encourage you to keep a consumption journal and write down how does it make you feel how did you feel before you took it how long does it last keep all that in mind and that will help you really homey and Nona how potent your infusion is all right so let's get started I have here coconut oil you couldn't view this infuse this into butter or any kind of oil that you wanted but I'm going to use coconut oil this is sunflower lecithin we'll talk about this after this is bendy car and here I have my 14 grams of cannabis I'm gonna put this into its little water back in here again you want to make sure that the water in the pot is at least enough to cover what you have in the dark put the lid on and set the timer for 40 minutes and then walk away I'll see you in a bit as you can see my D carving is done it's already done about 10 minutes of natural pressure release and I'm gonna just let the rest of the pressure out open it up alright so I have some perfectly he D card to cannabis in here super hot careful when you're opening this so um D carbon cannabis will be a little bit browner than when you put it in your don't smell a little bit different once your cannabis is cooled off you're going to grind it up I have a coffee grinder here I have a separate coffee grinder for coffee or that would make for some very interesting morning the great thing about this method is that you can do it all in one meter so you're just gonna put this back in your mason jar then I have a cup of coconut oil that I've warmed up in the microwave first I'm also putting in a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this helps to emulsify the mixture so that the cannabinoids don't separate from the oil it also helps the cannabinoids to enter your blood-brain barrier a little bit more quickly so it doesn't actually make it more potent but it does help to make it feel like it's working a little bit better however so I'm flower lecithin tastes like crap and you know I really hate it so I only had a teaspoon most people recommend a tablespoon to two tablespoons per cup but I recommend that you start low with that inserts and go slow and see how it goes for you then you just put it back in your jar and shake it up back in the instant pot before another bath of 40 minutes on manual and then we'll be done I've got my infused cannabis oil here you can now strain this using a cheesecloth make sure that you really squeeze the cheesecloth to get all the beautiful camera soil out you can then take that cheesecloth and dunk it in a tea and a pot of chai and then you can have some high chives there's still some medicinal benefit left in even the satchel of spent cannabis material but with this one I'm not even gonna strain it I started to add my unstrained cannabis oils and butters right into my baked goods and nobody seems to notice I'm gonna make this into cannabis infused protein bites and that would be next week's video all right if you have any questions I am super happy to answer them just leave them in the comment section down below and are you following me on Facebook and Instagram I really hope you do the links are below I post daily cannabis education there every day and if you head to my website reveal cannabis column you will be send some free stuff like an awesome recipe book and a video that teaches you how to get started with cannabis so why not head over there now until then I will see you next week", "AIhELWPJcO8": "[Music] Aya's Madden roughhouse Studios and welcome to cannabase --ax today we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused cocoa butter [Music] cocoa butter is a pale yellow edible vegetable fat it's extracted from the cocoa bean and is used to make chocolate as well as many ointments toiletries and pharmaceuticals cocoa butter has a natural chocolatey flavor and aroma and also has a high saturated fat content making it a good vehicle for infusing cannabis in order to do this we're going to need about a 1/2 ounce of dried cannabis - a 1 pound or 16 ounces of food grade cocoa butter and optionally you need 1 teaspoon of soy lecithin powder and to do this year we're going to be using an oven - decarboxylate err cannabis and a double boiler setup to do the infusion you could also use an infusion machine like the mighty fast herbal and fuser and you can save $30 on the mighty fast herbal infuser with a co roughhouse at the herbal infuser calm but to thank them for sponsoring this episode the first step is going to be to grind and decarboxylate our cannabis so what I'm doing now is I've weighed out 1/2 pounds of cannabis and I'm grinding it go make sure I pull out any big stems and any seeds that I may have once I have it all ground up I also want to put this into a dish where I can spread it out evenly so I'm using this large glass there's just so we can see it in the video but whatever big dish you have you can spread it out nice and even so it'll cook even we're gonna put that in the oven preheated at 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna let that D card for 25 minutes [Music] now when you're making cannabis infused cocoa butter you want to make sure that you're using food grade cocoa butter there's other cocoa butters that you could get that aren't necessarily designed for you to eat it might be used to make our hair products or something like that or candles so make sure that you're getting food grade and I'll put links to where you can get that on Amazon okay and we're going to be putting our 1 pound of cocoa butter into a double boiler that's got boiling water underneath it and we're gonna let that melt let's go take a few minutes to melt but I should take about the same amount of time as it took to decarboxylate our cannabis so by the time that 25 minutes is gone by you're also going to have your cocoa butter nice and melted nice and hot so it's that point cannabis is out and we're going to be able to add that into our cocoa butter and this is much like infusing butter or infusing any other kind of oil such as olive oil or coconut oil which we've done before and so it's going to be a very similar process we're going to be letting this infuse for one to two hours [Music] notice I'm letting that infuse without a lid on it and I'm doing that because I don't want the condensation to build up and let any water drip through so you want to avoid letting any water comment on contact with this especially if you're making chocolate but once we have our infusion down we're going to filter that out now filter the plant material out and you can do that with cheesecloth or a cotton muslin bag or a filtration bag if you're using the mighty fast turbulent fuser you'll have that HEPA filtration bag that's included with that we're using a fine mesh filter which works perfect you see we were done there our cocoa butter is now a much darker colored and has been infused with that cannabis has a lot of different flavor now and I've put that in the refrigerator for a little while so it'll harden up and you can see what it looks like but it hardens up very brittle like chocolate it'll have that snap to it and you can use this for a lot of different things you may notice at the bottom it looks like there's a puddle of brown stuff but that's a very very thin just a little color layer there of some very fine sediment that's filtered through and that's nothing to worry about and you could use like a vegetable peeler and just break that off if it bothered you very much but it really just is a very thin layer so I'm just chopping it up now so I could store it and you can store this for as long as you want in the refrigerator you can even freeze it until you're ready to use it and there's several different methods that you can use this for different cooking methods and you can also use it just as it is to moisturize some people may put it in their hair one popular thing to do with it is to make lotions or SAVs out of it and we're gonna be doing a recipe very soon you can see we've made a lotion out of it there so make sure that you subscribe to our Fi Studios because you'll see these recipes that we're making Whitney's coming up we're also making a white chocolate as you can see it's a very very good ingredient to make white chocolate is the main component of white chocolate in fact so make sure that you stay tuned for these recipes coming soon again I'd like to thank our sponsor for this episode which was the mighty fast herbal infuser please check out

feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

peter leo i'm isabelle tebow senior manager of community research and i manage nia survey research which generally aims to gather information from many individuals about the eczema patient experience so we can better understand how to improve the health and quality of life of those living with eczema we'd like to thank our 2020 webinar wednesday sponsor sanofi genzyme and regeneron whose unrestricted educational grant has made today's presentation possible our presenter today is peter leo md fellow of the american academy of dermatology dr leo is a clinical assistant professor of dermatology and pediatrics at northwestern university's feinberg school of medicine and the founding director of the chicago integrative eczema center his clinical practice is at medical dermatology associates associates of chicago dr leo is a member of nia's board of directors and nia scientific and medical advisory council and with that i am pleased to introduce our presenter dr peter leo hi i'm dr peter leo and today we're going to be talking about cannabis and eczema what are the facts i'm just going to share my screen these are my disclosures let's jump right in this cover back in september of 2019 really caught my attention high on the hype the cover of newsweek pop culture says marijuana cures everything but what do scientists say and this really i think captures the zeitgeist of the moment cannabinoids and cannabis have really been talked about in this incredibly positive light as having all sorts of potential and i want to explore that with you guys for about the next half hour lots and lots of research has been happening and we can see the research in cannabinoids in general that's the general category that includes cannabis but all of its derivatives and we're going to get into in a moment we can see the studies in the 1990s look at 2000 and look it happened in 2010 things went crazy we're going practically vertical here blasting up with all these studies and look none of these are actually skin cancer neurological disorders schizophrenia anxiety multiple sclerosis epilepsy so lots and lots of different areas are being studied in addition to the skin the skin industry has seen a massive impact from this and this was a really nice uh comment under a section called comet controversy and they called it the growing trend of cannabidiol cbd which is one of those cannabinoids in skin care products and this is again just calling attention to how common this is getting and we're hearing more and more about it this was a really nice editorial from peter cogan and i like this a lot the title of this piece was on health care by popular appeal critical assessment of benefit and risk and cannabidiol-based dietary supplements and i think we're seeing again a big interest a lot of public outcry let's let's have these let's use them how how do we get them to us and i think that's exciting we want to we want to learn but i also want to make sure we're doing it cautiously and intelligently and carefully because you know if we look at the history of medicine we haven't been burned before we've embraced things very quickly and very openly only to find out later oh we rushed in maybe we made the wrong decision and the quote here that i really like is quote ongoing lack of meaningful regulation of cannabinoid supplements continues to put consumers at undue risk without clear evidence of therapeutic value unquote so we just want to be careful as we go into this now in dermatology we're a little bit buffered because we're going to be talking about some of the more genital approaches to this but i still think it's important we know cannabis marijuana has a very long and celebrated history there actually is mention of it in the ebers papyrus one of the most ancient forms of egyptian medicine that remains ancient documents it also here is pictured above the goddess seshat the goddess of wisdom knowledge and writing and then uh here on the syrian clay tablets so it's been around for a long time people have known to to greater or lesser degrees that it has been part of us in our culture and it has long been used for health and healing the preparations from the flowers and resin have been used in china for about 5 000 years it's been used for fever malaria constipation menstrual disorders gout rheumatism and pain and before aspirin i didn't know this but i learned this in reading reading a lot of the background history uh cannabis was a common pain remedy in western medicine in the 1800s i didn't realize that kind of interesting that you would just have some cannabis instead of popping an aspirin now so we've said that word cannabis which is sort of equivalent to marijuana and then we think about the chemicals from that plant right the cannabis plant what are the chemicals that group of the ones we're talking about here one of the groups the ones that we're interested are called cannabinoids so that's the group of molecules that have anti-inflammatory anti-itch and pain relieving properties among others they do show promise in treating eczema and other skin conditions with multiple possible routes of administration and importantly because sometimes people get confused they can be made and i think should be made in our case to have no psychoactive stuff so you think of somebody getting high on marijuana that's not what we're going for that's not that's not the look we're going for here that is um a very different part and it turns out that that part getting high is one particular cannabinoid in fact it's the tetrahydrocannabinol we'll look at that in a moment but that is different we're not so interested in that for our skin there are different classes of cannabinoids that come up and the first group is called the endocannabinoids those the ones that inside the body uh a-e-a-p-e-a-o-e-a-a then there are the phytocannabinoids the ones from plants phytos plants and that's the delta 9 tetrahydrocannabidiol cannabinol that's the thc that that is the one that's psychogenic and other ones cvg and cbdv and then there are some synthetic ones as well now pea we're going to talk about an oea they're not technically real cannabinoids they are just sort of binder enhancers they just kind of help but they function in a very similar way this is the crazy biochemistry pathway they start with these activated fatty acids and they go through a number of different synthesis pathways to get some of the big guys here's the dial to 9 thc here's cbd and some other ones too they have lots of different characteristics so the tetrahydrocannabida cannabinol thc is the psychoactive one but it turns out pretty much none of the other ones really are psychoactive which is kind of fascinating that really is the outlier in a way and that's most abundant in the drug type plants because we know hemp is really the same as cannabis marijuana it's the same plant but they've been bred slightly differently so the hemp ones have very little thc and they're more fiber and oil and then the marijuana plants have a lot more of the delta 9 thc cbd is one that we're really interested in dermatology it's non-psychoactive it's the most abundant in the fiber type plants or the hemp type plans and it really it can have an effect on these different types of receptors so we mentioned that it's been studied for many disorders so look at this pain multiple sclerosis anorexia nausea vomiting colitis you name it so lots and lots of things have had studies for different types of cannabinoids and more appropriately for our work is the anti-inflammatory stuff because when we think about a lot of the problems we're facing in dermatology and particularly for our for eczema it's the anti-inflammatory and anti-itch and again there's been lots and lots of studies here we can see pretty exciting one of the big things that are holding this back a hurdle is that there are still regulatory issues this is still listed by federal sources as a schedule one controlled substance so that's very different than you know in a lot of states has been legalized even for recreational use but from a federal standpoint it's still tricky and it's sort of slipping in at least the cbd products because the 1994 passage of the dietary supplement health education act created this big group of products called dietary supplements which we know you know you can see infomercials there at every store um and they get to kind of skirt around a lot of the regulatory stuff it was a very powerful act that was pushed very hard by these makers of different supplements said listen this is an important industry we want consumers to be able to have these options we don't want the fda in everything and that's sort of how some of these can get through there and many states say treat them more like dietary supplements which can be a good thing it can mean that again less regulation can mean much better availability cheaper prices of course it does have a negative side and that means it's the wild west sometimes we don't know if what they say you're getting is what you're really getting and we've actually written a couple of papers about this recently that many of my patients say well how do i know like even though it's legal in for example in illinois my job says it's not legal my job will fire me if i fail the drug test so if i'm using a cbd product on my skin can you assure me that i won't fail the drug test for marijuana exposure and it's a really important question and it's nuanced because it has a few steps the first is if they really do put what they're saying in there if it's just cbd at the percent they're saying and the patient's using it the way we expect then we can answer that question it turns out the answer to that question is almost for sure you'd be fine but because it's not regulated we don't know if they're really putting in just what they're saying they're putting in and the right percentage so that really throws things off so there are a couple layers that that make it a little confusing so we know the the fda then really does not limit these or regulate these which is good but the problem here is that we don't have a ton of data on these so despite all the people talking about them despite being on the fact of newsweek you're going to see i think kind of a frightening lack of information you know when we really really look at what's out there and some people talk on it with such uh confidence and expertise like they were like they know and i'm thinking gosh how do you know even if you've been recommending it to a lot of patients it's still we know that there's a lot of inherent dangers to just your anecdotal experience right and so it's fascinating to think that we haven't we want these so much and we have so much information about them but yet we have so little when it comes to actually using them in patients not a single product sold as a cannabinoid supplement has been assessed through a large randomized controlled phase three clinical trial so for better or worse now it probably doesn't matter if you're taking a zinc supplement right at this point um that hasn't been passed through anything either but you know it just it just may vary and i think it just opens up the question so cbd at the center of all these possible things neuroprotective pain relieving anxiety relieving antidepressant antioxidant and more how is it doing all this well this is a look at the endocannabinoid system in the skin and it turns out that the cannabinoid receptors are all over the place they play a role in fat synthesis hair growth they play a role in the inflammation and they also probably have a direct role in pain and itch which is really neat so all these things come together and make us very interested in harnessing this for our patient needs what are some of the adverse effects that have been seen well in general this is a little bit broader and this it really is including things like smoking marijuana so it's it's broader than it needs to be but i figure it's better to be a bit broader than than too narrow of course it can cause sedative effects psychological issues perception and motor changes strokes cerebral blood flow differences you know dispensing decrease with chronic use and again i would expect these are really all marijuana systemic marijuana this is not going to be a cbd product on the skin conjunctival injection the red eyes of people who are smoking marijuana heart issues as well respiratory issues again if you're smoking i think that's what they're talking about here coughing wheezing bronchitis decreased lung function it even has effects on the gastro gastrointestinal system reproductive effects and then the immune it's unclear for marijuana but there are some potential adverse effects i will say that for the topical products that i'm that i'm going to mention and kind of go into uh these tend to be cbd type products they're usually not having the any of these other issues i would say that the risks there are more um it is possible that you could become allergic to it it's possible that it could actually irritate you those are the big things we don't think there's a whole bunch of systemic issues that would happen from a topical well it turns out that eczema is not the only thing could be used for and i just wanted to talk for a moment on a couple of the other things it's been looked at as a potential treatment for acne and it turns out if you look at the oil cells the cells that make our oil called sibo sites and they kind of grow them in culture they actually found that adding cbd can block some of their ability to make the fat make the oil and that's really important because we know one of the issues when people break out with acne is they tend to be doing too much sebum production too much oil production so if you could bring that down a little bit and do it safely that would be pretty neat pretty handy we actually don't really have a medicine that does that very directly the closest we have is the isotretinoin medicine that kind of shrinks the sebaceous glands but that's a little different this is more of a signaling thing as we said it also has an anti-inflammatory effect too and they did this really neat little breakdown showing all the different parts so lipostatic means making less fat or oil anti-proliferative slowing down some of the cells from growing and again we know one of the issues in acne is the clogging of the pore so if you can kind of slow that down you might slow the clog and then the anti-inflammatory piece kind of interesting and they did a study where they to control group and then they added a little bit of this chemical that stimulates oil production and they showed all the oil that's the red stuff and then they did the chemical that stimulates oil production along with some cbd and the cbd decreased the oil production so really kind of neat at least you know in a glass right so this is not really in people this isn't in a culture and it's hard to know if this would actually play out on our skin but that's how it begins it starts with noticing something and saying huh could this work in people now for the skin there's very little but there was a study looking at three percent cannabis seed extract and a base cream as a control putting it on twice a day to half the face for 12 weeks and they actually found that the oil and the redness uh were significantly decreased at various time points and there was no safety issues that they noticed and most patients tolerated it well so this is a really good example it's very small i wouldn't base major national policy on this but uh we have what we saw under the microscope in the culture and then we see in a small trial a kind of a pilot study and a half half-face study that actually really fits it well so i think this to me suggests there is real promise here now there's still a long way to go you got to get the right dosage you got to get the right purification you got to make sure it's the right vehicle and you do want to do more testing but i would say very promising that that it could have an effect on oil production and if you have oily skin this could be a way to approach that problem which is kind of neat let's get to the good stuff what about itch so those receptors those cannabinoid receptors in are actually on nerves and they may decrease excitation so if you stimulate them they could sort of cool down the sensation of itch again that'd be a win-win for us and they did a small study in 12 volunteers where they actually put histamine in their skin right the itchiest thing in the world and half of them got this cannabinoid agonist so kind of a cannabinoid that would stimulate the the receptors the other half got a placebo and they actually found that the people that had the patch with the medicine did significantly better than the placebo patch so there's again something potentially to it lots of questions but the the principles are here and that's again where all this begins pea is one of those ones we talked about early on it's it's one of the sort of pseudoendocannabinoids it's actually they call it a cognate so it improves the binding of our own endocannabinoids to the cannabinoid receptors and it's nice because it also has some moisturizing properties and seems to help with itch as well so they did 100 subjects with itchy dry skin and they either got the vehicle sort of the base cream or the the cream containing the pea and they actually unfortunately didn't find much difference so i report a negative study which is never fun but it's important again just to kind of keep balance because we often will report the exciting stuff but we kind of gloss over the ones that didn't help so in this group it didn't seem to do much and this is kind of what it looked like at varying time points so there was a trend towards improvement but but not enough to be statistically significant now in atopic dermatitis there was a large multinational study now this was not placebo-controlled though and that's important to know but almost 2500 patients with atopic dermatitis that's a little different than the last one they were just dry and itchy maybe it doesn't do as much for that what about if you have atopic dermatitis you have economy of actually inflammation so they applied the pea containing cream twice a day to the problem areas and they actually did find that it helped p was the p-value was less than .001 so significantly improved in all the following patient reported symptoms the decreased use of topical steroids yes that's a win we want to decrease the need for those improve sleep a huge win and improve dryness scratching itch and redness so amazing so this is the kind of stuff we want to see now it's not placebo controlled though so we don't know if maybe just putting on any cream would have done the same thing so again we needed to do more and better studies but again possibly interesting and this is kind of what it looked like at the study start versus the study end the dryness got better the scratching exploration got better like cannification scaling i mean everything much better but can you tell me for sure that that wasn't just due to putting on a moisturizer i can't because we know that all of these potentially could get better from a moisturizer too it would have been so nice if they had the vehicle then we would really know another study looked at oral hemp seed oil and found that it also may improve atopic dermatitis this was a randomized crossover study of 20 adults with atopic dermatitis and they compared that to an olive oil control they found that consuming two tablespoons of hemp seed oil decreased the skin dryness itchiness and use of topical medicines compared to the olive oil group and it was thought that actually in this case it probably wasn't really related to cannabinoids at all because there's very few in in the purified hemp seed oil it probably has more to do with the high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids in there so it may just be that those fats have an effect again this is a great example of why it can be confusing to try to figure out what the active piece is what's actually doing the work that being said this is something i use for a lot of patients it's very inexpensive it's very accessible there's no risk of of getting high or anything like that the hemp seed oil is is quite safe and even for kids i feel comfortable having them try some of this the only thing is it tastes terrible it kind of tastes rancid and you definitely don't want to cook with it i read something that said don't cook with it i thought oh let me try and as soon as the frying pan started getting hot oh my goodness it turned terribly ranced that it was the worst so highly recommended you just take it mix it in with something it's best in like a smoothie where you don't have to taste it at all this is what they found in the trial the hemp seed oil skin dryness at week zero versus week eight so it went down a lot skin itchiness dropping down use of medications dropping down all of those were significant other trials just summarizing everything here this is all that's been done so it's a little bit a little bit uh disheartening that after all we've talked about this is all they've done that acne one we mentioned the aesthetic eczema one which really didn't show it showed some difference but not much difference in the barrier and the atopic dermatitis one that did show an improvement and then the chronic itch one that also we talked about showed no significant differences so not too many studies have been done yet but i'm really hopeful and excited that we may see lots more coming especially in the next coming year or two we have a lot of people interested in this now finally the last thing i'll leave you with is a checklist how do we pick a good one what do we do so there's no great answer but a couple of things to think about is do we know that it meets quality standards and a couple things that can help us is if it has a current good manufacturing practices certification a cgmp from the us fta or it could have uh from the eu the australian or canadian organic certification that is associated with a higher quality because they have to jump over some hoops or the national science foundation international certification so any of these certifications can suggest that it is higher quality it's not a guarantee and there are some differences but i think it's definitely better than ones that have nothing does the program have an independent adverse event reporting program that's nice to know again it shows that they're committed it shows that they're long term they're not a fly-by-night operation and hopefully they're getting feedback and continuing to do quality control is the product certified organic or eco-farmed again while not a perfect connection with being a good one i think that's a higher correlation and finally have the products been laboratory tested by batch to confirm their stated ingredients and ideally the percentages and make sure there's no pesticides or heavy metals these are just generally good guides when we're picking supplements and the answer for some things is you can't tell or you can't get that information but it really can be quite helpful in conclusion cannabinoids have tremendous potential with very strong scientific underpinnings there's real reasons why this may help and may be useful there is some evidence for itch and atopic dermatitis and even acne there's speculation from some scientific folks from many conditions in dermatology even including some skin cancers but we have a lot of unanswered questions which one to use how to administer it should it be oral should it be a patch should it be a cream how do we do this what is the dosage what is the frequency and what are the risks for now caution is strongly advised until we know more but there is great hope on the horizon thank you so much for your attention i really appreciate thank you again dr leo for helping us get the facts about cannabis and eczema thank you to sanofi genzyme and regeneron whose unrestricted educational grant has made today's presentation possible and many thanks to all of you for joining us today you can find many additional eczema resources on our

burger canvas and this week's video I'm gonna teach you how we make CBD oil here on the farm but first if you're new here to the channel please hit that subscribe button if you've already subscribed thank you very much so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil here on the farm so obviously first thing you're gonna need is CBD hemp flour now we grew this all year and this is about 3 and 1/2 ounces now they recommend magic butter machine which is what we're going to use they recommend 7 to 14 grams per cup of oil your choice of oil but the oil that I like to use here is MCT oil now this is fractured coconut oil to pretty much just have no coconut flavor and mono saturated fats what's cling on to CBD so those are pretty much the two ingredients in our CBD oil the next thing you're gonna want to do is after you weigh out your flour and you figured out how many cups of oil you want to use now typically I do two cup run and I will use about 12 grams of flour per cup I just like that ratio seems to work really well so you weigh it out on your scale and then you decarboxylate it now magic butter machine has its own decarboxylated flow and I put it in the oven at 250 degrees to 230 degrees really depends on where you want it how fast you want it low and slow I like to go with my D carb and you're gonna want to do it for twenty to thirty minutes so that's what we're gonna start off with so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil okay guys so now we're going to turn on the oven so first thing we're gonna do for our oven here is we're gonna hit the bake button we're gonna bring it down to 230 degrees Fahrenheit then we're just gonna hit start and now while it's preheating I'm gonna weigh out my flour and put it on this aluminum Flo so I'll be right back okay now that we've made our little container for our flour and today we'll be using our by ox flour that we grew this summer the next thing I'm going to do now that this is all good I'm gonna cover it up and more aluminum foil so you want to make sure that it's nice and covered because you want to keep all of those proteins in there and you really don't want to lose a lot of that flavor so to speak from the bud and then once we do that I'll take a knife it's almost like making a pie you know you're gonna want to cut a couple holes in it and that will let out any kind of moisture so now we're going to stick it in the oven for about 25 minutes okay so now we have decarboxylated our CBD hemp flour which is right here so this is pretty much what it looks like it just gets a little bit darker nothing crazy but it activates that CBD a and then what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get all that in here so that was approximately 24 grams of CBD hemp flour now what we're gonna do is we're going to add two cups of her MC tu Oh now the reason why I prefer MCT will is because it's just the best carrier for this CBD you can use coconut oil and you can use olive oil and a bunch of other oils but MCT really holds it the best and it has the most mono saturated fats per serving so there is our two cups of MCT oil we're just going to add it right into the machine get that all in there okay and that's it guys with the magic cutter machine it's a set it and forget it so now we're going to go ahead we're going to walk this thing on we're going to plug it in okay now if you can see the buttons here and I'll try to pull it up a little closer to the camera you're going to be able to see these flashing buttons first you're gonna want to go to a hundred and sixty degrees Fahrenheit and I like to do it for four hours because this is an oil tincture and that's it now it's good to go and you'll see the light starting this is starting the process of making the CBD oil and the great thing is guys there's no food processor there's no mess you can do this a whole bunch of other ways but I really love my magic butter machine because this is a no mess set it and forget it thing so we'll see you in four hours and you'll be able to see the final product alright everybody so the CBD oil is complete now I didn't catch it in time but the whole thing illuminates like blue and red and pink and once it's done it'll start flashing so this thing is ready to take out so now we're going to go through the process of extracting our oil from the material in the magic butter machine so as you can see it is all over the place in here and so what you should have is a spatula of some sort I just have a silicone one which is what a lot of people use I guess for this machine I don't think it's necessary but what you're going to do is you're just going to try to get all this material off the butter machine as best you can you know you can drive yourself crazy trying to get it all off but you want to get the majority of it a lot gets up underneath it so that's pretty good for me then what you're gonna do is you're going to kind of like scoop the sides you're gonna want to get it all in there okay so we are probably going to get less than two cups so I'm gonna get my bigger because you're gonna have to take this now magic butter gives you they call the love glove and the micron bag this is to extract all the plant material so you want to carefully get all that will in there now you use spatula again get as much of it in there as you can you can see down in there there's still quite a bit so that's what I'm trying to get out right now it smells awesome you guys alright that'll be good enough for now so next thing you're gonna do is gonna want to get your your silicone glove on your dominant hand so for me I'm a right-handed person you need to pick it up and you're gonna squeeze that bag this is the best you can you don't want to extract all that oil out of there if you can see it still coming out of there okay and that's it there's your CBD oil and I'll show you the finished product here so that is MC t CBD oil now what I'll do after this is I will put it in a bottle like this food-grade you can buy these at Walmart or Dollar Tree for for less than a dollar and then I will use it to fill these cvd vials so that's it for today's video if you like the video please don't

I'M NICK TOMA((CANDICE)) AND I'M CANDICE KELLY. 3 ((NICK)) A FAMILY FROM CARBON COUNTY IS NOW USING MEDICAL MARIJUANA TO TREAT BOTH OF THEIR CHILDREN WHO", "Ex4V2im8a5o": "your search for best CBD oil for pain can end here perhaps you're searching for the best CBD oil for acute pain the best CBD oil for chronic pain or maybe even the best CBD oil for pain for my dog there's so many options what do you do right hi my name is dr. Gerry Hosken I'm a retired chiropractor and I've taken a deep dive into finding out just how that all works I became a curious researcher when my wife had surgery and was unable to tolerate her prescribed pain medicine her surgeon prescribed just four little red jelly-like pills that were described as experimental at the time when he classified them as natural and evidence-based I was relieved but when he mentioned that they were derived from cannabis my curiosity peaked with just a bit of alarm as a doctor of chiropractic my class in pharmacology and toxicology was years in the past and it was far more aware of the popular side of cannabis than the medical aspects as a husband I was more concerned and even frantic to get my wife out of pain my wife's surgeon took time over lunch to explain the important changes in the medical application of cannabis products well this was the start of my look into additional natural methods of relieving those isolated pain problems that for one reason or another or no reason at all would not respond to conventional chiropractic or medical methods so just like I was I'm guessing you're looking for the best CBD oil for pain also right perhaps the best CBD oil for neck pain the best CBD oil for back pain so with all the things that come up when I'm in the search and with so many options what do you do well here's what I did so I didn't have a whole lot of pain problems but other people around me did my patients did so I just started using CBD oil for pain just to check it out now I wouldn't use it for acute pain and not like a migraine headache or a sprained ankle or something where you're in acute pain but more for chronic pain you know as an example I had some pain in my left shoulder that seemed to linger most often this chronic pain becomes aggravated from extended time at the computer followed by a night of restless sleep one of my chiropractic friends usually corrects the problem two or three months later my excitement for some online project would enticed me to spend too much time at my desk I know it's my fault that's on me I experimented with all the same topical products that were used in my practice and of course those products gave me very short-term relief and took the edge off the pain ironically I first search for the best CBD oil to alleviate some anxiety issues but then that's the story for another day however that search led to the information that indicated CBD oil could alleviate pain could cannabis products give more pain relief and last longer than the products from my chiropractic practice how well do they perform on more serious paint problems more serious than my minor pain challenges that I can take care of him in my own office from the facts that I found and the personal testimonials that I heard I would say yes yes they do perform better than the products that I've been using but how will they perform for you and for others I don't know you'll just have to find that out for yourself it's a personal decision that again you must decide that for yourself do your due diligence and make the decision personally I've been blessed with good health good health training and the ability to ignore pain many years of playing recreational level sports as an adult especially soccer and basketball helped raise my tolerance to pain boy did that change when I turned 80 years old now I'm using the pure hemp works relief to help relax and soothe muscles renew anti aging cream with apple stem cells to help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines and then I'm using hemp works 500 and sometimes 750 milligrams of active full-spectrum oils to help with a wide scope of benefits help maintain healthy blood sugar regulation support optimal cardiovascular health

into some factory six factoids going into the forge about the difference between full spectrum broad spectrum and isolate products now the first thing we need to under really understand is where does that come from what is hemp extract well that comes from this delicious little flower here which is produced by the hemp plant now this little guy is where we're really going to pull most of our product from some of the leaves but mostly this is where the concentrated product exists now it's about a three to four month growing period for this to come to full fruition then a couple months for you know harvesting and drying and then at that point we're going to put it through an extraction process most commonly that extraction process is going to be a co2 or an ethanol depending upon you know purity and speed and whatever you're looking for but there's also new processes that are coming out we're working with a company right now that is actually working on a high pressure water extraction right now that is really exciting because it's solventless it's all natural we'll see how that comes out and more as it comes down the line however right now we're going to talk about the full spectrum crude oil that is the first thing that comes off the plant through that extraction process so this dark tar-like substance is exactly what has what we call a full spectrum of the cannabinoids or when we say that we mean all of the cannabinoids that that specific strain or that variety of hemp produced so it doesn't contain all 113 known cannabinoids but it will produce a variety of specific ones depending on the strain that you're growing and from there when you put it through the extraction process those are what's going to be present here along with some plant fats some chlorophyll some other things like that this is a pretty raw material so taste wise it's not super delicious it's kind of rough to the palate however there's things that we can do with this even as it is right now one of those things being we can use it in for example topicals like a cbd balm or a cream that way we're also utilizing as much of the plant as possible because it's as close as to it as we can get it's the first extraction that's something that you can really just use and just rub onto the skin and it's really nice you're gonna get most of the benefit that you can get from the plant in and of itself from this product alone all right friends so the next step in that process that we're going to be talking about today is going to be distillation with distillation we're going to get a distillate from crude oil that distillate is going to look very much like a honey as you can see here it is a very beautiful product in the sense that it's got the fats the chlorophyll everything else is taken out of it it can come in two different forms it can either come in a full spectrum or a broad spectrum the full spectrum is going to have again like i said all of those cannabinoids that plant produced and 0.3 or less thc as per federal regulation whereas a broad spectrum you're taking all of that thc out down to four decimal points so it's a non-detectable amount in that extract for you so the main thing that we're going to use something like this for is we're going to put this into something that's more of like an adjustable product like a tincture but this is really one of the main or most popular products that we use with a distillate among the many various products that we can put distillate into all right friends and as we move along this process we're going to be taking our distillate down to an isolate so in isolate as we go down that refinement process is going to be a powder that is literally a crystallized oil which is actually quite fascinating but one of the benefits of that that gives us is the fact that we can do really targeted things now an isolate is a 99.9 or 99.5 pure concentrate extract so we're talking about really really pure no plant anything but just that singular compound in and of itself so you know this is kind of like a sniper rifle in the sense you can get really targeted you can get really specific on what you're trying to do with it and that's really really nice it's workability it's it blends well it does a lot of things that these other products is a little bit more difficult takes a little bit more time to do so for example like a great product that an isolate would be used for is like a quick tab it's a nice little sublingual tablet that dissolves directly into the mouth but again it's very easy to work with and that's why we like to use an isolate with it all right guys so the last thing we're going to be talking about today in our process is going to be a powdered water soluble extract now this is unique in the sense that we're taking a oil product we're encapsulating it down on a nano size to actually make it dissolvable in water which is really really unique considering the oil and water don't generally mix so from this we can make really really cool products there's a lot of applications you can do especially since this can be a broad spectrum product still retaining all that cannabinoid profile all that entourage beautiful effect that we've talked about earlier but while at the same time getting a very very targeted application it's really unique and really really cool to work with guys thanks for watching this is all we have for you today for more information check out factory6cbd.com watch more of our videos this is trent the wizard with factory six factoids again we'll see you next time you", "BxgS-rYe3CY": "hello how are you doing today perfect and how may I help you I think I have the very thing you're looking for what kind of CBD product we have a lot here this is a CBD only dispensary oh you had a car accident and how's your back well I am sorry to hear that um thankfully I think we have the thing that will help you out I would recommend to you a tropical South yes I think that it would work best for you you just apply it to the skin you rub it on smooth it over and it should alleviate some muscle pain that you're experiencing it's an anti-inflammatory CBD is and there is different types that you can get and by the way these are frog song farm items and I have been buying from them for a very long time it is a small family farm located in Oregon um near Woodburn and it is just really great they produce and extract their own hemp and CBD and I recommend you giving these products a try what do you think perfect so and they are free of pesticides which is wonderful so the first product I have here is a tropical South that contains 500 milligrams of CBD this might be a bit strong for you considering that you're not someone who uses CBD very often there is mild side effects if you just take a lot of CBD um it could include drowsiness or a dry mouth a little blood pressure but nothing it's quite uncommon and it's also very mild so just so you know in advance okay so I would recommend this cell for you but instead of the 500 milligram we have a 250 milligram and there's Xie butter inside of this coconut oil Aragon oil sweet almond oil beeswax activation time is 5 minutes oh yes yes um CBD is fine to be used on that so you just have to be aware of the proper dosage and be aware of the weight of your pet so do you have to definitely take that into consideration before applying for the intake yes that is a very common question to non-intoxicating the anti-inflammatory antioxidant rich and supportive plant base so those are important things to keep noted before try I mean it may help with sleep conditions anxiety arthritis neurological health definitely worth a try again I would recommend the 250 for you what do you want to do is take a little bit you don't have to take too much because this is very rich in essential oils comments you just really need a little bit it's actually I might have put a little too much there put some back when you rub on like this we're ever needed yes CVT is legal um it was federally legalized in 2018 but it was partially legal in 2014 so another factory that's why it's such a big thing recently as you can see going to store such as new seasons old foods yeah it's a very common it is the next big thing would you like to try some okay yeah here you go give it a go and let me know what you think okay activation time is five minutes so you will feel it in no time there you go excellent okay so another item that I would love to recommend to you is a tincture it is designed to be held under the tongue before swallowing it's just more effective that way however if the consistency or taste is unbearable you can just put some in your food or drink or whatever you wish to do and yeah that's perfectly fine as well and this is the 750 milligrams CBD so this one's a very potent for your situation and socially being someone who's new to CBD I might recommend the lower dose so there's another tincture that has the last CBD unit and I think that one would work perfectly for you yes so yes it is he concluded free so what you do is you shake this and you fill the dropper you can fill it to the point 75 line and I mean you couldn't really use unless on this if you want you know that's perfectly fine I usually use like this much at the point 5 or the 0.25 and you know just use a little bit do you work in real time I think that tinctures really really do a great job when it comes to insomnia or anxiety I think that it does a wonderful job tackling that problem only said something but I've experienced um I like to take some before I go to sleep I think for your condition and the back pain I would recommend a cell for you there's also one other product that I want to show you it is a new product that just came out it is called - the body balm ultra and it is a different consistency from the south is it dries faster and it has a less greasy ER feel compared to the south and it has a little bit of a scent so if you're someone who isn't a big fan of sense roller to get a sense I would maybe recommend itself and really do that's which you prefer so have some of this tincture if you'd like I'm just gonna set it right over here and the next item here which I mentioned earlier activation time is five minutes this also has 500 milligrams of CBD if the two selves they're called a rabbit um the first one that I showed is 500 milligrams of CBD and the second one has 250 those are the two options you have and I'm the tincture again I have the seven so this one might be a little strong for you right now but I think you can start with the 250 rugged and I think after that this might work really well for you since this is less greasy and it dries a lot faster okay as you can see over here it's it's more liquidy there's more watery type of substance consistency what it does smell really nice it's not too strong you know it's it's much lighter than a perfume it's like a natural essential oil kind of smell which I can handle being someone who is quite sensitive to scents and perfumes and clothes and such so yes that one is pretty great again it's a new items so definitely check it out I'm gonna place this right here give it a little give it a go and yeah do you have any other questions okay perfect and which one would you like to purchase today excellent okay so I will put that in a bag I'm glad you decided to go with me nothing 250 so I think sure I think that you made a great decision yeah do you have to let me know helps me I like to rub this on my tummy from time to time it really helps with my cramps cramping pains are just pains and shadow makes it a lot more manageable and I hope that this really uses up the pain in your back yeah just gonna put some on right now if you want back there I notice you have been putting them on your hands so it only takes five minutes again that's pretty fast and the tincture is pretty fast as well just remember to shake it and put it underneath your tongue or if not you're putting food or um the drink yeah probably a drink like juice yes okay well there you are um I hope you have a lovely day and I will see you next time yes let me know what you think of the Frog song farm products I think that they're fabulous fantastic and they've just really helped me so I hope that they help you too okay goodbye", "UEfhjR8CQys": "i'd like to welcome you here to the seminar thank you so much for joining us whether you're joining us live or you're viewing this later as a recording we are so happy to have you with us my name is naomi hoffer i'm the program manager for the sherry servado berson brain cancer survivorship program and with us also in the background here as part of our program is alexa greenstein who is our survivorship nurse practitioner and mary des tree who is our marin expansion program liaison who's expanding our supportive care services for survivors and caregivers to our marin patient and caregiver community this webinar is part of our regular living well after brain cancer treatment webinar series which is part of our growing survivorship program thanks to a generous donation from cherie cebrato brisson i know many of you many survivors are interested in medicinal cannabis and have heard a lot about it but there's a lot of questions so what do we know and what don't we know we're going to talk about that today with our experts so first of all we're going to be talking a little bit about the history and overview what is cannabis and what are the components what are the therapeutic uses what do we know that it's used for and what it might be beneficial for we're also going to hear about the research and current findings that we know exist right now what do we know about this and um then turn around what this means for you as you're considering using this for your own therapeutic uses so after we hear uh from our panelists we're gonna have some time at the end for q a and we invite you to submit your questions using the q a box and then we're going to have an after the show segments where we will hear from survivors and hear how those who are using it for brain tumor recovery and management of side effects how it's going for them and we'll have a chance to hear from you as well and hear your questions so i feel very privileged and honored to introduce two speakers with us today who are very well versed in this subject matter dr donald abrams is the immediate past chief of the hematology oncology division at san francisco general hospital and professor of clinical medicine at ucsf he has an integrative oncology consultation practice at the ucsf center for integrative medicine the osher center for integrative medicine and we are pleased to have him also as part of our regular survivorship programming at the ucsf brain tumor center alongside his expertise in cancer nutrition and botanicals dr abrams has a long history of interest and involvement in clinical research that evaluates medicinal marijuana on various patient populations he co-authored the chapter on cannabinoids in cancer in the oxford university press integrative oncology text that he co-edited with dr andrew weil he co-edits the national cancer institute's cannabinoids and cancer website and he was also a member of the national academies of sciences committee that published the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids current state of evidence and recommendations for research published in january 2017. we're really honored to have him with us today and we also have dr eduardo rodriguez dr rodriguez is a glioblastoma or gbm clinical trial data scientist in the brain tumor center at ucsf he is a trained physician who graduated from national polytechnic institute in mexico city and also holds a master's degree in clinical research from ucsf dr rodriguez currently serves as co-principal investigator in the study on the impact of cannabis on the quality of life in patients with central nervous system tumors we are truly grateful to have him here as well to share his latest research with us we'll first hear from dr abrams and then from dr rodriguez and then back again to dr abrams but dr abrams thank you so much for being here and i will now turn it over to you thank you naomi it's a pleasure to be here so as mentioned i am going to start out by giving you a little bit of background on what cannabis is what cannabis isn't what we know about it and how long we've known what we've known so yes so this is my topic uh what do we really know i want to start out by reviewing a little bit the history of cannabis and what it may be useful for so this is the so-called siberian ice princess it's a mummy that was very well preserved in the ice in siberia she was so well preserved that her tattoos are actually being copied i understand by some millennials but in any event she turns out to be under an mri scan a woman in her mid-20s who appears to have breast cancer that spread to her bones and around her waist was a belt that had a pouch at the end of it and in the pouch were the flowers of the female plant of cannabis sativa suggesting that this woman dated about 2700 years ago knew about the potential medicinal benefits of cannabis it's postulated by the anthropologists or archaeologists or whoever makes these hypotheses that perhaps she was using cannabis to treat the symptoms of her cancer if not perhaps even the cancer itself and again i think that's a bit of a leap because we don't know that everybody in this tribe wasn't buried with cannabis around their ways so cannabis has been a medicine probably for the last 3000 years it's one of the oldest known psychoactive plants cannabis sativa or cannabis indica its reported first use again was 3 000 years ago in china south of mongolia made its way along the silk route to the indian subcontinent and then further west into the arab world where it was widely used as medicine cannabis was brought to the west by w.b o'shaughnessy who was a british east indie surgeon who was working in india and saw all the potential benefits of cannabis and brought it to the united kingdom at that time it had many uses supposedly as a pain reliever a relaxing agent anti-inflammatory against muscle spasms and also for seizures at the beginning of the last century in the united states most of the forerunners of what we recognize today as big pharma had cannabis products available for physicians to prescribe to their patients cannabis actually fell out of favor uh in 1937 with the introduction of the marijuana tax act where the mexican word for the drug was used to sort of fool physicians the act was introduced by a prohibitionist who felt that widespread use of cannabis by african-american jazz musicians and mexican migrant workers was going to lead to increased crime and mental illness in the united states so ultimately cannabis was removed from the united states formulary we know that cannabis is potent because of chemicals called cannabinoids which are present in the plant we believe that there are at least 400 different chemical compounds and of those about 140 are these structures that resemble delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol which is actually the main psychoactive agent in the plant delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has been studied in israeli children with cancer and felt to be an effective anti-nausea medicine for children getting chemotherapy and then all of us are quite familiar now with cannabidiol or cbd which again is a related compound to the delta nine thc again in addition to those three cannabinoids there are at least 100 others and there are other compounds in the plant itself that have medicinal benefit so again some of the non-tetrahydrocannabinol cannabinoids are cbd which i'm going to talk more about cbn which is a breakdown product actually of delta 9 thc and many people who use old cannabis which is rich in cbn says say it's very useful for sleep cannabinogirol or cbg is another non-psychoactive cannabinoid similar to cbd which they say is going to be the next cbd as yet it has not been studied in clinical trials but people are trying to grow plants that have more cbg than current uh strains do i think a very interesting cannabinoid is tetrahydrocannabiurine or thcv which apparently decreases appetite decreases appetite for food for alcohol uh tobacco and also for opiates so this is uh if we're going to go about developing individual cannabinoids as medical treatments this one is one that we might hear more about in the future and in addition to the uh cannabinoids there are also flavonoids and terpenes which give the different strains their characteristic smells and it's felt that all of these work together in the plant to sort of balance the effects of the delta 9 thc which again is the main psychoactive component so it's sort of like the other compounds provide the yin and the yang or the yin to the thc's young if you will so they help increase and augment the beneficial effects of thc and perhaps decrease some of the adverse effects so since cannabis was removed from our formulary we haven't learned a lot about what it does therapeutically because it's very difficult to study since it's a schedule one compound which means that it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use according to our federal government but over the past 70 years since cannabis has been prohibited we've learned a lot about how it works basically all of us have two different types of receptors for those cannabinoids the cb1 receptor is one of the most densely populated receptors in the human brain unfortunately we don't learn about that in medical school that shows you the extent of reefer madness the cdb1 receptor is distributed widely throughout the whole body and this receptor is found in all animal species down through sea squirts the cb2 receptor is was originally not felt to be in the brain but subsequently has been identified but not at the great density of the cb1 receptor the cb2 receptor was initially found in cells of the immune system in the spleen and in the peripheral blood in the natural killer cells and the b lymphocytes suggesting that this receptor has something to do with immunity so why do we in all animal species down through sea squirts have cannabinoid receptors you've never seen a monkey smoking a joint well similar to our own endorphins our own endogenous opiates that we make we also make endocannabinoids we make our own cannabinoids chemicals similar to thc and the other cannabinoid compounds the first was identified by my friend and colleague rafael machulim at hebrew university in jerusalem felt to be the father of cannabinoid chemistry and he named it anandamide after the sanskrit word for bliss subsequently another endocannabinoid to arachnodonyl glycerol has also been identified so why do we and all animal species have this system of cannabinoid receptors and our own endogenous cannabinoids the endogenous cannabinoids are synthesized on demand and when they complex with the cb1 receptor they cause changes in the cells particularly the cb1 in the brain cell which lead to changes in our appetite in control of immune function muscles and pain in our thinking in our nausea etc and when these endocannabinoids complex with the so-called cb2 receptor they're also involved in alterations in our immune function in cell proliferation cells dividing inflammation and also pain i think michael pollan says it best michael is a berkeley journalist who wrote the book the botany of desire and he has a whole chapter on cannabis and he says the reason that we in all animal species have these receptors and endocannabinoids is to help us to forget and in his next book the omnivore's dilemma michael is trying to gather his own food and in each chapter it's about gathering food and in one chapter he's sitting in the woods holding a rifle on his shoulder holding very still actually crouched in the woods and he said this is painful and out of the blue he postulates that the reason that we in all animal species dependent on praying pr e for our food have this system is to help us to forget pain so with that in mind the activities of both thc and cbd for example do both share analgesic or pain relief as their main probably activity thc unlike cbd is psychoactive the cbd is felt not to be psychoactive but it is anti-psychotic for people who have those sorts of illnesses and it also decreases anxiety so i think it really depends on what we mean by psychoactive it's obviously acting in the brain it just doesn't get you high and we live in a society a puritan derived judeo-christian base that thinks that being high is something that's not something we should strive for and that's something that's a whole other discussion so you know cbd has sort of catapulted to the top of the most favored cannabinoid list because it doesn't get you high but it i think it is psychoactive and we know that again as michael pollan predicted that in states where cannabis is licensed and available for patients there has been a marked decrease in prescription of pain medications anxiety is also anxiety medications have also been released it was mentioned that i was on the committee at the national academies of science engineering and medicine that reviewed 10 000 articles on the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids and these are some of the conclusions that we came up with as far as what it's most beneficial for the largest body of evidence is really in patients receiving chemotherapy that connect cannabis and cannabinoids particularly are licensed and approved to decrease nausea and vomiting we all appreciate that cannabis can increase appetite and again it seems to be very useful in patients who have chronic pain particularly most of the clinical trials have looked at patients who have neuropathy or pain generated from damaged nerves and cannabis in this situation seems to be much more effective than placebo and probably as effective as the currently prescribed gabapentin or neurontin i see many patients in my practice who really enjoy cannabis sometimes just cbd sometimes thcs sometimes both as a treatment for their insomnia saying that it definitely helps them to sleep and then the question of whether depression and anxiety are relieved i guess can be uh answered a little bit by the graph on the right showing that prescriptions for anxiety medications are markedly decreased in states where cannabis is available depression less so but definitely decrease so cbd again has gone from being an unknown cannabinoid to being uh the most favored and i attribute that to my friend and colleague sanjay gupta who did his first special uh weed in uh 2013. and in that show he showed charlotte figgy a young girl recently deceased who had refractory childhood seizure disorder go from a child that couldn't do anything because she was constantly seizing to the happy smiling girl on the right just after taking a drop of a cbd oil under her tongue and this ultimately led to gw pharmaceuticals developing the drug epidiolex which is now licensed and approved as a cbd treatment for children with this disorder prior to the large studies of epidialex there were really very few clinical trials on the use of cbd in humans most of the information that we had to rely on came from test tube and animal studies very few clinical trials of cbd existed but the in vitro and animal studies do suggest potential therapeutic applications we actually did a clinical a survey of patients at three integrative medicine centers in san francisco chicago and san diego as well as clients in 10 dispensaries in those cities asking people using cbd dominant products what they are using it for and as you can see here 50 reported pain is their main symptom that they used it for but fully 63 or two-thirds were using cbd for pain relief again 44 for anxiety a third for insomnia and 20 for depression and that's cbd dominant we also asked how effective this was and people rated it in all of these situations eight out of ten as far as being quite effective again this is not a placebo control trial but this is the sort of information that we need to provide us with sort of avenues to determine what we should study next personally however i think cbd is a bit over the top it's now a 23 billion dollar industry and at the farmers market at the ferry building we were surprised to see a cbd sunday for sale that was sold out and now there's cbd infused clothing that claims to prevent soreness before it starts and then last week or a few weeks ago stress zoo elephants are being given cbd oil to help them chill out and stop fighting i'd love to know if that worked or not so i am going to turn the session over now to my colleague who is going to talk about what we know about research in cannabis in brain tumor patients particularly thank you so much dr abrams we will hear again from dr abrams and invite him back and now i'm going to invite dr rodriguez to come up and as dr abram said to talk more about the the research being done currently with brain tumor patients at ucsf dr rodriguez are you here yes hello naomi hi i cannot turn and turn on my video it's been disabled right now um well thank you very much for an invitation and i would like to thank to all the participants for their interest in this this talk um and i think thank you to dr abrams for that good introduction on what's the overview of cannabis so now what i would like to address is what is uh naomi can you tell me if you're seeing my slides please yes we see it yes perfect um i would like to address what is being done in the realm of uh specifically neuron ecology with cannabis as dr abrams mentioned the research really in humans is being poor to say the least because of many hurdles and i think it's mainly because of all the legal aspects of it so i'm going to reiterate a little bit of what dr abrams already said so the potential uses for cannabis to treat nausea and vomiting induced by chemo radiation uh to help increase the appetite and therefore the weight in our patients when they are undergoing chemo radiation and cannabis moderately improved chronic pain and the only kind of not likely to have a role in depression is cbd uh although this is debatable because this all has been done only in um animal experiments and as we probably know too uh measured depression is a little bit tricky as well and uh like dr abrams mentioned most of the patients that report using cannabis say that it improves their sleep quality so medical cannabis as an anti-cancer the first article that was released let's say was in 1974 which actually was on a press release by the washington post where they claimed that marijuana psychoactive component thc slowed the growth of lung cancer breast cancer and virus-induced leukemia in laboratory mice and prolong their lives by as much as 36 percent i think this is um unique in the sense that it was uh first published on a paper rather than in a scientific journal and then afterwards the the scientific paper came out in 1975 and this is uh kind of like a screenshot of an enhanced image of course it's not the original uh image of both of those articles however it got the attention of the federal government and it was when when it got investigated and then it was put under schedule one by the dea which again it poses many legal hurdles uh since then uh there are there have been many efforts to try to prove that it's actually an anti-cancer agent but again most of the efforts have been done in animals and cells and much of the research has been done in thc because of the mechanism of thc is well known and cbd as well and information on the beneficial effects of non-psychotropic cannabinoids is right for in vitro and animal studies like i already explained and specifically to address the brain tumor realm is tricky because um most of the studies or most of the drugs are being developed to try to use as therapies to be effective in vitro or in animal models in rats or mice or monkeys but then when that is translated to humans it doesn't always work so that's definitely a place where we need to improve the the research that we are doing um on this realm in the brain tumor space cbd has shown remarkable results in vitro uh like dr abrams mentioned uh this this was first shown by uh the israeli group um but the mechanism unfortunately for which it prevents tumor growth is not fully understood there are many theories on why they do it uh some of them are they say because it depletes uh oxygen to the to the tumor cells and that that's a feasible uh mechanism but it's not proven um yet and there are very few clinical studies on cannabis and cannabidiol like i we already explained uh however uh all the in vitro and in vivo and animal studies suggests a potential therapeutic applications so what's the evidence in humans that we have so far where i have a few examples here and this is this was actually recently published on a systematic review that we that we did so we did an exhaustive review of the literature and we pulled some of the uh articles that we thought they were the most not only the most interesting but the the ones that add to the literature and in this topic so in 2006 in spain uh this is also a friend of dr abrams manuel guzman um conducted a pilot clinical trial study of thc in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and what he did was inject thc at different concentrations and different schedules in nine patients um unfortunately what this showed was um that it didn't even help so can you see my pointer uh naomi yes we can perfect so so these arrows this is just what i i just want to go over this really quick uh these are the mris of the patients and this curve what it shows is the growth of the tumor in in centimeters and cubic centimeters and the arrows is when uh thc was administered so as we can see actually didn't stop it uh same for here and this is this was uh patients who needed a resection so this drop that we see in in the tumor is uh the resection and then this is after resection so it actually didn't help however it was a small sample and of nine patients only and um and some of the measurements and some of the uh how it was applied it can be debatable but it was it's a step in the right direction uh in 2017 in england uh dr susan short conducted a two-part safety and exploratory efficacy study uh and what i like about what we like about this study is that it was randomized uh if people are not familiarized with this is when people are assigned assigned randomly to a specific treatment or placebo in this case so it was assigned to thc and cbd on a ratio one to one that means that it has equal parts thc and cbd and or to the placebo which was i think really while while there were undergoing uh those intense hemosolomide treatment in patients with recurrent glucose stoma um so the first part it was only six patients and it was just to to try to see if it was safe and it was well tolerated by patients and they determined that it was so they moved on to the second part where 12 patients were assigned to to cbd and nine cbd and thc and nine patients were assigned to placebo uh in this case they were it was actually demonstrated that it was safe and it showed good results for survival um in this case it is one of the best studies i think um the only issue is that is a small sample and it cannot be generalized to everybody as you can as you can imagine uh the results of 12 patients can be generalized to millions of people so that that's the caveat in this study but it's a again it's a study a step in the right direction and i think that this is um setting the basis for further research and then uh on one of the society for neuroecology meetings uh dr nicholas blunden published this poster the developing role of complementary cannabis therapy and glioblastoma treatment and uh he at the university of jail he administered oil concentrate of at least 50 milligrams of cannabinoid per day uh for at least one month plus uh standard of care treatments this means radiation or chemotherapy so but it was just voluntaries uh it was not directed to specific patients so it was to whoever wanted to participate in the study so 23 patients were registered and 15 of those 23 were using cannabis so they observed good results compared to low use or no use of cannabis meaning they improved their symptoms and they improved their their more tumor improved or got stable but the issue uh and i wanted to to remark really these words it was at least 50 milligrams and at least one month this means that it was not the same concentration for everybody and it was not the same time for everybody that they were using so again uh it's a step in the right direction but it's not necessarily the best way we can not generalize with this type of results and then in 2004 on the on the opposite side of the coin let's say as you probably know there are other efforts that have been trying to show the hasterts of consuming cannabis and i i like this paper as a good example on how some evidence can be misleading so in in this paper what they did it was a retrospective which means they went back to the electronic medical records of patients over time of a large amount of people but it was 130 000 patients from kaiser uh who filled out the questionnaire from 1977 to 1985. what i think is interesting here is that it was very close to that initial paper that was released in 1975 so so maybe the people people actually didn't answer sincerely because of fear of being stigmatized by either the government or their other members of society but they were at least 25 years old and patients were followed for 21 years retrospectively they were not actually followed they were not calling them in real time for 21 years and he identified 19 000 20 000 to round up people who use cannabis at least once the issue with this is that he categorized all these patients as cannabis users and that's problematic because if you used only once let's say that these are uh recent grads or even grad students level or on in the age range they could have been trying just for fun and he categorized them as them using cannabis he found that nine patients who ever use cannabis at least once per month develop glioma so again this is problematic because out of the 130 000 patients that we started he derived conclusions out of nine patients so um we need to put in context uh not only from the research point of view but also in time what's happening in society at that point and what's the age of the group so i will take these results with a grain of salt and now so after we pulled all that information uh dr nicholas wutowski who you may or may not know and see in the clinic uh he's a neuro-ecologist and he's a director of clinical research in in our department he observed that a good proportion of his patients were using cannabis for some kind of issue for sleeping for anxiety and they were saying that they were feeling better however in science and in medicine we cannot just say because my neighbor told me that this works i'm going to prescribe it we need evidence so we decided to do a observational study observational means we are not doing any interventions we are not giving cannabis to anybody we are just surveying where we are asking people how they use it and this is because of the legal barriers mainly uh the federal legal barriers so so and and we want to see how cannabis is actually impacting the quality of life of our patients over time so we decided to use uh quality of life because that's our main goal is to improve quality of lives of our patients um and we want to see if there's any differences between people who use cannabis in real time versus those who don't use cannabis in real time so what we are doing is we are enrolling patients we ask them a series of questions and then we every three months we ask them the same questions slightly different but essentially it's the same idea to try to see what how they are feeling and for one year uh i understand that this is not the the best the ideal will be to following them until they they get better or until they don't want to keep participating anymore however we have certain time constrictions so so we follow them for one year and then we try to analyze uh what's happening with quality of life so therefore all patients can participate in this study we have people who use cannabis and people who don't use cannabis and both are equally helpful for our study because we need we need to see if it's working and we need to see uh we need a comparator group so this is uh and what we have found so far um uh today we have enrolled 81 patients in our study out of 216 we are aiming for that for that number 200 people is fairly balanced we have 50 50 males and 31 females and they have various degrees of using cannabis i think it's interesting that the the females that decided to participate are the most balanced so it's almost 50 50 split which is great for for results and for us to be able to drive conclusions and then generalize those and um these are the main reasons why people are using cannabis in our clinic this is not that they are being prescribed is mostly uh why what's the symptom that they or the the reason why people think that is helping them so we have the the majority of people is actually using it to relieve any kind of symptoms and i'm going to go over that shortly uh some people think that is use is is helping them for the tumor treatment and of course we have the recreational users which is totally fine and then we have other other symptoms and in other symptoms we include include sleep aid and anxiety relief we understand that this is a disease that can create anxiety in people and this is definitely a an important point to make so these are the specific symptoms why people are using um cannabis which um they're similar to what dr abrams showed us before uh on the survey on cbd and the dispensaries uh is slightly different and we have here that the majority of our population is using it for because they don't feel hungry because of anorexia and they are trying to improve their appetite and their their weight for anxiety for depression in other we said we are including here um other symptoms that are not don't fit in any of these categories for migraine and for sleep aid and the rest of them are um i don't i don't want to discard them just out of hand but i think these are the more important ones and interestingly enough pain relief is actually not one of the main reasons why people use cannabis in our clinic again this is self-reported this is people are using cannabis uh because they think that is helping them with this kind of symptoms one of the interesting questions that uh is pushing for this uh research study is that when we ask people before using cannabis how they felt and this is on a scale from one to six and six is the worst they have ever failed and one is the best status let's say that they can feel uh before using cannabis they report a four a score of four which is fairly high and after using cannabis it shrinks down to to 50 to two so almost normal uh again this is self report and i know this is subject to some things that we call bias and and this is for recall by us because we are just asking if you remember where how you felt before using cannabis please let us know how you felt so there may be some some biases there but i think this is this is still really interesting and it's a good motivator for us to try to explore more of what's happening here again this is self-reported it's not actually what's happening so now um to measure quality of life we use a series of instruments we call it so surveys really that have been validated in large amounts of people and and we try to compare this right so the bars when the when the bars uh overlay that that means that it's not statistically significant but i think it's interesting to see how users people who use cannabis actually feel more fatty more nausea and more pain this is interesting because we will expect the opposite however this is how people start when when they they initially go into our study this is how they start so now the interesting thing will be to see if three months from now this this curve actually switch and the people who don't use goes here and and the people oh sorry the people that don't use goes up and the people that use cannabis goes down that will be an interesting flip to see uh we don't have enough data yet to show you those those data but um this is the this is how is the baseline of our patients and same for functional scales uh this this is actually the opposite the higher the score it is the better it is and the lower the score it is the worse it is so uh physical functioning role functioning emotional functioning and cognitive functioning uh all these are actually statistically significant and again this is how people enter into our study and what we aim in the following months or years is to to evaluate this data on on a time lapse basis so the conclusion and we think that uh this phenomenon also that we are seeing of how people using cannabis are actually doing worse it's not because of cannabis that they were doing worse is because they feel they have more symptoms and therefore they resort to cannabis so we need to prove this over time of course and we have we think this because 58 of our patients have a high grade glioma which is an aggressive glioma so and they are subject to feel more symptoms and this is why we think this is true however we need to complete enrollment to further evaluate cannabis over time and compare to non-users so the general conclusions here is that more formal studies like this one even if they are observational are needed but if they are controlled uh in a more controlled environment like placebo compared to placebo or compared to different concentrations of cannabis are needed to to prove that it's actually working it's also important to know that there are some interactions that we may or may not know because it hasn't been studied and it can be interfering with treatments and other medications that patients might be taking so we need to know more about this and we definitely need involvement of community physicians scientists lawmakers especially and other stateholders is needed of course in community patients are included because this is this is mainly driven for the benefit of our patients and we remember that what is observed if you come across with some paper or some press release that it claims that cannabis is helping for x or y reason uh if it's only been tested in test tubes or animals that doesn't necessarily mean that is going to work the same in humans and this is why we need more research in humans so having said that this is an invitation for everybody to join the study again we welcome both types of persons people who use cannabis and people who don't use cannabis they are equally important to our study to to come if you have any questions you can reach out to me or you can reach out to the general clinical research coordinator line and if you scan this qr code if you have an iphone or a newer android you can scan it and it will take you to this flyer and you can have that information thank you thank you so much dr rick rodriguez that's really uh great information and i feel like we need to kind of put a pin in this and invite you back when we get more of your study results so um thank you um mary has put in the chat box uh the contact information so you have it um i apologize for the clicking sound i don't know if that's gonna resolve itself because um dr rodriguez's mic but uh hopefully it'll resolve itself now so now we're going to turn it back over to dr abrams and really talk about what this might mean for you and some practical considerations thank you naomi uh really appreciated dr rodriguez's presentation and i i do want to note that many studies have uh found that same finding that the people that are using cannabis at the beginning uh have more symptoms and maybe that's why they turn to cannabis because they're not getting relief from their conventional therapies so what does all this mean let's put it together first of all often we're asked what is the best way for me to consume cannabis i see a lot of older women with cancer who go to the dispensary and they're told only eat a quarter of the cookie these are people that feel that inhalation is bad and eating is good so they eat a quarter of the cookie and nothing happens so they eat another quarter and nothing happens so they eat the whole cookie and then they call me three days later after perhaps a visit to the emergency room with a not very good feeling saying they're never going to do that again so they're describing the pharmacokinetics or what happens when we take thc by mouth it takes a very long time to reach a peak plasma concentration about two and a half hours and there's a delayed onset of activity which is why people say nothing's happened so they they consume more by mouth and then when you take the delta nine thc the main psychoactive ingredient by mouth when it goes through the liver on the so-called first pass metabolism the liver breaks the delta ix thc down into an even more psychoactive metabolite so that's why people get more zonk if you will when they eat edible products on the other hand if you inhale cannabis either via smoking or vaporizing not vaping i hate vaping that's the wrong word i'm sorry vaporizing then the effect is much more rapid the peak plasma concentration occurs in two and a half minutes and very rapidly declines over the next 30 minutes and since less of it goes through the liver than when you take it by mouth you create less of that 11 hydroxy more psychoactive metabolite so i tell patients if they would want better onset over better control over the onset the depth and the duration of the effect that inhalation is probably better than oral ingestion and when i say inhalation i mean vaporizing which means vaporizing the plant i've as an oncologist i've been quite concerned about this trend towards vaporizing an oil because i definitely know the long-term health effects of inhaling a vaporized or combusted plant but not an oil and i think that panned out to be a concern so i'm all in favor of vaporizing plant or even smoking in a bong or even cigarettes because i don't think the danger is very large we now have tinctures and oils and in fact even chewing gums and when you put these in your mouth you immediately absorb some from under the tongue and then except for the chewing gum you swallow the oil or the tincture so you get the sort of benefit of both inhalation and oral ingestion and i think more and more people are turning to these oils and tinctures people also in my practice have claimed that suppositories work who grows all the cannabis for the government research said that he doesn't think thc could be absorbed rectally but many of my patients make their own suppositories out of olive oil or coconut oil i forget and they say it definitely works and then there are topical products that patients often can use and get at a dispensary and find them very useful for local pain in arthritic joints or or muscle pain so there are many many different options for cannabis now again as an oncologist i am quite anti-sugar i think sugar is the worst thing that patients with cancer patients without cancer could consume so i am not a fan of the chocolate chip cookies that you see there i don't think edible cannabis products are ever medicine because of the sugar so as i said for better control over the onset the depth and the duration of the effect i feel inhalation is optimal it achieves the higher peak concentration and a shorter duration effect the slow onset of ingested cannabis may prompt one to overdose i mean you it's not like an overdose on an opiate you just feel uncomfortable and you need to get in a dark room and sort of lie down again the topical products uh probably have less systemic absorption uh and may have some benefits systemically but are probably best used locally so what are the potential side effects of cannabis well again particularly if people are not used to using it dizziness is possible especially if you stand up too quickly cannabis can increase the pulse rate and it can increase or decrease the blood pressure and that's why people who use cannabis and then stand up too quickly may experience dizziness dry mouth is common and again drowsiness is that a side effect or a desired effect i think for people who are looking for help with sleep it might be a good thing euphoria again there's that sort of being high is that a side effect or is that a desired effect uh you know i guess it's all not i have a beholder i certainly think that people who have a life-threatening disease are entitled to have some euphoria i think cannabis induced euphoria in my opinion is much healthier than the intoxicating effects of alcohol the blood pressure changes i mentioned red eyes headaches relaxed muscles and then there are some people uh who get paranoid uh increased anxious or depression and that's not good impaired memory is something that happens acutely but uh people who use cannabis chronically uh don't have any evidence of impaired learning or other cognitive issues on long-term follow-up tests we're often asked well what is the right dose and you know who knows what product people are talking about so it's highly individualized again everybody's cannabinoid receptors may be genetically different so some people smoke cannabis and they always get euphoric and some people smoke cannabis and get depressed and some people get paranoid and some people get no effect that could be set or setting it could be the cannabis that you have but it also could be the genetics of your cannabinoid receptors so giving a dose is difficult what we tell people this should be in quotes and have a s-i-c in parentheses after it because it's not grammatically correct but it rhymes so we like to say start low and go slow so start at the lowest possible dose and increase slowly to get to achieve the desired effect somebody asked the question 50 milligrams seems like a high dose while dr rodriguez was talking and i didn't catch whether that was thc which would be a high dose or cbd which in fact would not be a high dose because clinical trials of cbd have looked at up to 600 milligrams that's one thing about cbd people take from 10 to 600 milligrams that's a quite a wide range so again start low and go slowly but it's the mantra is go slow and then again you know talk to your doctor and see if they can help studies have shown that most physicians although they're in favor of medical cannabis don't really know enough about it to advise the patient so what i do is i tell the patients go to the dispensary tell the bud tender or the person behind the desk what it is you're trying to treat and ask them what might work another question that we get all the time is what is the right ratio of cbd to thc that i should take and again in animals cbd seems to reduce the psychotropic effects or the high if you will of thc when the ratio is eight to one or greater cbd increases the psychotropic effects of thc when the ratio is two to one or less so that's all in animals unfortunately and we don't really know that from humans and this little uh 18 to one eight to one four to one two to one one to one comes from care by design cbd which is a cbd uh company and this is what they uh postulate are the effects of the different ratios i tell my patients that the only ratio that's been studied in the medical literature is one to one and that is what the drug nabixamols is which is the drug that 12 patients got in the study that dr rodriguez described compared to the nine patients getting placebo so particularly for my patients with brain tumors who ask me what they should take i say well the medical literature right now supports a one-to-one ratio of cbd to thc so other safety concerns again older people people with cardiovascular disease coronary artery disease should be cautious i never say avoid really but should be cautious about use of cannabis and both thc and cbd interact with the system in the liver that breaks down prescription medications particularly cbd may cause a inhibition of that system so that prescription drugs are going to build up in the bloodstream and could become more toxic so that's why i'm often concerned about my patients who are taking these very highly concentrated oils of cbd or thc fearful that it may alter the dose of their prescribed medications leading to potential toxicity in our studies of the medical literature we really found that the only adverse effect in the lungs in people who smoke cannabis is increased uh cough and sputum consistent with chronic bronchitis we in fact did not see any evidence of increased lung cancer perhaps even some suggestion of decreased lung cancer and again people who have had bad experiences with cannabis excessively paranoid or depressed or too anxious should probably avoid it and then there's this rare condition that we're learning more and more about as more people use cannabis on a regular basis hyperemesis which means uh too much vomiting so you get repeated and severe bouts of vomiting uh in some patients it's a rather idiosyncratic reaction i would say because we think of cannabis as being an anti-nausea and vomiting medication but some people i guess because it's working in the brain on that center might get it triggered in the wrong direction and there are medications that people use to treat this some antipsychotic medications or many people say taking a warm shower is very helpful so do not drive if you're under the influence of cannabis is a recommendation that we're going to make but you know i'll tell you what studies are very unclear about what's happened in states where cannabis has become available recreationally whether or not there's increase in auto accidents is unclear and i think that people under the influence of cannabis actually are safer drivers than people under the influence of alcohol when this has been studied in laboratory conditions people under the influence of cannabis tend to drive more slowly and they weave a bit more but they stay within their lane this is quite different from alcohol when we looked at the adverse effect on newborns in women who used cannabis during pregnancy we did not see that many babies were born with a slightly lower birth weight but otherwise there were no long-term damaging effects but we're going to recommend that if you are pregnant you might want to avoid cannabis although many women who have prolonged morning sickness have found it very useful in the 60s and 70s and i think their children came out pretty normal so i just want to share a little bit about when you go to a dispensary you might be overwhelmed by the selection of products that are available so this is a menu from a dispensary that was online that i took a screenshot of you can see that the names people have done studies on these names and green dragon at this dispensary is not going to be necessarily the same plant as green dragon at that dispensary there's indoor and outdoor well why do they tell us the difference between indoor and outdoor well cannabis connoisseurs believe that you can really tell if something is grown outdoors in the sun and wind and rain or indoors under fluorescent lights and artificial fans and hydroponic water dripping or whatever so uh you know people feel that maybe indoor sometimes is a little more jangly as they say then they tell you if it's a sativa or indica and most of what you get in dispensaries are a blend of sativa indica it's unusual to get a pure product sativa in the folklore is felt to be up and mental whereas the indica is felt to be more down and physical so if you're having trouble sleeping you probably don't want a sativa if you're having trouble getting motivated you're not going to want an indica dominant blend and then this dispensary was just starting to look at cbd content the third one down has more cbd than thc the top two are the opposite and then they give you a little wine spectator one-liner a bright and cerebral sativa with euphoric overtones so you know we've come a long way in the cannabis world cannabis business i find a lot of patients that i see however are older a little confused they take a lot of different medications and they don't really want to go to a dispensary so a few years ago two pharmd's two pharmacists graduating from ucsf school of pharmacy came to me and said what would you think if we opened a dispensary and i said well that would be great so a year and a half later they came back and said you know what we found out it cost a million dollars down to open a dispensary so instead we started a concierge cannabis practice where we'll talk to patients and for a monthly fee we'll find out what meds they're taking what they want to treat and we'll send them as part of the monthly fee a tincture that we make up for them so many of my patients have benefited from talking to the folks at med1 specialty care their phone number is listed there in the spirit of full disclosure they want me to be more involved as a consultant and an advisor but we have at this point in time no financial relationship so i do offer this to people that are not cannabis sophisticated that might want to experiment with some cannabis products but aren't interested in going to a dispensary and being overwhelmed with all the selections that are available which certainly when i was growing up in the 60s was not a problem that we worried about so with that i'll thank you for your attention and hopefully we have time to answer some questions thank you so much dr abrams that's really wonderful information um dr rodriguez i'm going to invite you back up we do have questions uh that we had in the queue and please feel free to submit your questions using the q a function we do have about 10 minutes for questions so here's one of them i think i'm going to direct this to you dr abrams can you overdose if you consume too much cannabis again the uh overdosing usually means you know dying and and having your respirations turned off there are very few cannabinoid receptors in the brainstem which is where our respiratory center is so in fact there has never been a report of an overdose and it said that you would need to smoke 700 cigarettes in a very short time to overdose and that would be from carbon monoxide poisoning and not from cannabis poisoning thank you so much here's a question that came in um what are your thoughts on rso i don't know what that means but maybe you know yeah it's named after uh somebody who's currently on the lam this is a highly concentrated uh full cannabis extract oil that is being touted as being a cure for cancer and as dr rodriguez told us there is very little evidence in the medical literature that cannabis cures cancer i think if cannabis is going to have any benefit in any cancer it's going to be brain tumors because of the high concentration of the cannabinoid receptor in the brain but this oil and i'm not going to say the name of the man who is rs because i don't think he deserves that sort of publicity is something that's sold to patients and it's what i said i was concerned about highly concentrated oils being able to interact with people's other medications in a negative fashion so that those medications may become more toxic thank you so much um dr rodriguez this might be for you or for you as well dr abrams of email do you know if um medical cannabis is covered by insurance the answer is no no okay all right and for your study as well um eduardo it's there's no uh coverage as well they have to get it on their own and purchase it on their own as part of your study yeah but there's no cost for that it's just link surveys so there's no cost to be part of the study uh the only caveat that we have is that we we prefer people who are being treated at ucsf just because we also are pulling data from their medical records to to be a little bit more detailed on what information we get so if you come from outside of ucsf you will have to share those with us separately and that will that will be another layer but we can discuss if people are interested thank you so much um okay how do i know how many milligrams i'm getting if i'm smoking rather than using a tincture is there a measurement no no you don't know okay okay um and what sort of vaporizer would you suggest people buy any opinions on that well i mean we studied the so-called volcano vaporizer which is not a portable you know all of the studies that we've done have been done in the in-patient setting in the general clinical center research center at zuckerberg san francisco general the volcano is a table top centrifuge it looks like with a turkey basting bag was the original thing that you use to fill up by a heating element and a fan fills up this bed the company that makes the volcano stores in bickel has a number of uh hand-held portable vaporizers uh they are again much more intricate than a vape pen where you inhale oil um as i mentioned very concerned about inhaling oil into the lungs as a potential way to damage it so i would go for a portable vaporizer some people enjoy having their own volcano it's not cheap but it does deliver a vaporized cannabis which is probably associated with less harmful particulate matter than actually smoking a cigarette but a water pipe is also an acceptable way okay thank you so much and this is kind of a little bit of dovetailing on that what is the difference between vaporizing and vaping could you explain that again because you mentioned that in your i mean people people make use them synonymously but i think vaping has really come to be the term used for those little you know things where there's oil in one end and you inhale and it heats the oil and you're inhaling heated oil that is vaporizing an oil but that's become synonymous with vaping and oil vapor rising is heating to below the point of combustion the plant and inhaling that those vapors from the plant that hasn't been heated to the point where it's going to flame up and become ash but where it's just going to vaporize the active chemicals so i'm all in favor of vaporization but vaping has become a nickname for vaporization and i think it means something else okay thank you um in any of these studies how can you account for the possibility that people don't want to mention anything about their use of cannabis for example it's stigmatizing for their career um dr rodriguez do you want to address that first and then okay yeah uh fortunately this information that uh at least in the united states all the information that we collect is protected by hipaa so we do not disclose it and even if we share this information with others like we do in scientific meetings uh we do not disclose any any information that we call identifiers meaning dates of birth uh workplaces uh names uh even initials sometimes uh we change all those things to to be as anonymous as possible and um at least in our study of course this is study by study but in our study that information that is given to us does not go into the medical record so it's not subject to be reviewed by insurance or other third parties it just stays there for research purposes do you feel that that's the same for other studies as well they would protect that information uh in in our practice in our clinic yes um elsewhere i will i can speak for them okay thank you all right is there likely to be much political motivation either party democrats or republicans to remove cannabinoids from schedule one with dea federal government if not how is the cycle ever broken to do more research um rely on international studies anybody want to take that it's a very difficult question actually it involves many layers from my standpoint i think it's going to come down and probably dr abrams can say his own opinion is going to come down to how much money can people make unfortunately uh rather than how house impacting actually people's lives i don't know if there's i'm pretty sure there should be a partisan division there but i don't know if one side is more inclined to to move forward than the other well i think we'll just have to wait and see what comes up in the debates but uh my namesake the current has been the best president we've ever had on cannabis i have to say and it's because of what you said dr rodriguez he's a businessman and he appreciates that it's money and taxes and now pretty much every state has medical cannabis and even recreational cannabis and his opponent has always been an anti-drug person so i'm a little concerned okay thank you um there is a question about sugar use but i think i'm just we might table that um because that's a big discussion in and of itself and maybe we'll do another talk about sugar and cancer um so i'm going to read this question out this is one that that might be um difficult to answer because it's quite specific but dr abrams and dr rodriguez if you had an oligodendroglioma and it was 40 surgically resected would you go on a cbd thc regiment to hopefully resolve the remaining tumor so i'm just going to read a little bit more i do occasionally take um 90 to 90 10 ratio of cbd thc gummies in hopes that it will cure me i have no issues with my traditional cancer treatment side effects i only take these on hope to eliminate the remaining tumor so this is about tumor reduction any any thoughts about that for oligodendroglioma um yeah like we we uh stated before i think that um people need to be treated on a case-by-case basis uh these results that we are giving out on research is on the general level it's not an individual specific um but but like we mentioned we don't have uh the medical evidence to say that this will help in humans at least at least not not right now yeah i think that's the saddest thing i see in my practice or patients who are treating a potentially treatable sorry my dogs are being fed now people with a potentially treatable malignancy uh maybe not a brain tumor but who come to me having waited to see me for a number of months who now have a disease that can't be cured so i would say no you need to treat the remaining tissue the way dr rodriguez and his team would say to treat it and do not think that cbd or thc in any ratio will work thank you so much and i i think we're we'll have time for maybe just one quick question if you if you could um stay for one more uh why is thc associated with prop 65 label identified by the state of california to be a carcinogen to cause reproductive harm anybody want to take that one i think they have to say that about pretty much anything that they don't know enough about okay okay well i think that's all the time we have for questions from uh dr for dr abrams and dr rodriguez i want to thank you both so much for your time your expertise we really really appreciate it and um thank you again for for being here and thank you to all of you for joining us for this presentation it's wonderful to have you here we wish you well and hope to see you again in a future webinar [Music] you", "tjZ-qDLeid0": "welcome back to another edition of our cannabis vlog series with me your host tyler green today i'm going to be discussing a topic that i've been thinking about quite a bit this week and that is hemp flour versus cbd extract so there's been a lot of products that have emerged recently on the market that i believe are to cater for cannabis consumers people like myself who enjoy the consumption experience now have a bit of a choice when it comes to getting our cbd that moves away from the traditional oils bombs and other topicals right i've actually got an example of both here this is hemp flower you can find this online you can find it in several shops in the uk and this is what it looks like and then this is cbd extract the example i've got here is the goods lemon drop cbd shatter which is 99 cannabidiol today i'm going to discuss the pros and cons of cbd flour okay hemp flour and cbd extract aka cbd dabs just to try and figure out which suits who you know like what is going to make this suitable for you or this suitable for you let's discuss that right here so flower pros when it comes to hemp flour you can roll this up and smoke it with your regular weed you can also roll it up in place of your regular weed you can put it into a vaporizer and all of those things make it seem very natural to cannabis consumers so for people that are already smoking weed regularly then adding cbd weed into your diet your your cannabinoid consumption isn't going to present any challenges or really feel any different you'll notice a difference in flavor indeed there are different flavor profiles in the hemp world as well but typically you may notice that it is less flavoursome than your high thc strains um but you will be able to naturally gel with it as a weed product right just looks the same there are different hemp strains with different cannabidiol content so there is actually stuff out there that will suit you as a newer consumer or someone that needs a lot of cbd for their medical conditions so you can get cbd flower up to about 20 cbd i think i've seen and this overall means that it is a really natural feeling product right so really easy to transition or to add it into our existing consumption cbd extract on the other hand really really cool to get the dosage requirements that you can get when it comes to cbd extract so you can literally take your gram and portion it up into 10 or 20 evenly sized portions and then you know exactly how much cannabidiol bearing in mind that this has 990 milligrams of cannabidiol in this pot so that makes it really super easy to uh to deal with dosing much more easily than it is to deal with dosing when it comes to hemp flour right another awesome thing about cbd extracts is the ability to imbue them with these lovely terpene profiles so this one is lemon drop and it just smells like sweet sicilian lemons and you can really play about and get some awesome terpene profiles in the cbd world another benefit to cbd extract which hits less with cbd flour unless you vaporize it is the bio availability of the vaporized compounds that you get when you dab versus the amount of cannabinoids that you get when you smoke so if you smoke something you're actually absorbing sort of 10 to 20 percent of the cannabinoids whereas when you vaporize you're absorbing 80 to 90 percent of the cannabinoids so if you put these in contrast and you smoked this and you vaporize this then you would be getting more cannabidiol from the extract right even if they had the same amount of milligrams consumed you would absorb more into your body with the vaporization so that is a really key positive point for cbd extract it's also a tried and tested method of delivery for cannabis consumption so you can either put it into a vape pen or a dab rig both consumption methods have been used for years and both of them are prized by medical patients for fast and effective cannabinoid delivery and of course it's much healthier to not burn your material if you can help it and that is why vaporizing extract is a healthier consumption method than smoking flour so we've talked about the benefits of both consumption methods but of course there are some drawbacks to both as well so i'm going to discuss that before we make our final verdict the first drawback to hemp flower and one which is always on my mind is that this still sits in a legal gray area so the law never changed to make an exception for cbd flower and people sold it and continued to sell it on the assumption that it contains little to no thc therefore is defined as heaven but the legal gray area does make it quite tricky to operate in the market with some cbd flower sellers being raided by the police in reality this is unlikely to affect you as a consumer so you don't have to worry so much consuming cbd flowers but just know that that distinction doesn't exist in the law another drawback to consuming only hemp flour versus consuming the extract is that you're not going to have an idea of the accurate dosage like you would if you took another consumption method when you smoke flour and particularly when i smoke flour i just grind up a few buds put it into a joint and smoke it it's a really enjoyable experience but i'm not thinking about how many cannabinoids i'm putting into my body that is something to think about for medical patients and why they might opt to consume the cbd extract instead another really key point when it comes to hemp flour is that the cannabidiol content is going to vary from batch to batch just because you smoked it once a long time ago and there was an awesome amount of cbd and doesn't mean that it will have that exact amount again and there are actually some processes where people either spray can abu dial onto the buds or they can remove the other cannabinoids to make it come down to the legal limit as well so there are some practices which you might not be aware of which might put you off when it comes to hemp flour the cannabinoids and terpenes really really nicely so that covers the drawbacks of the hemp flour so let's talk about the extract one of the things that i think is important to mention when it comes to cbd extract is often not always but often you will find that it is made from isolated compounds and broad spectrum terpenes and cannabinoids have been added right so when this is extracted to its pure form this is extracted all the way through to pure cannabidiol from hemp plants grown out in europe so they've taken away the other compounds left the cannabidiol behind and then added in the terpenes and their broad spectrum wax which is 80 cbd also offers additional minor compounds minor cannabinoids making it broad spectrum rather than isolate but it's worth thinking about that this is full spectrum right so a little bit of thc and a lot of balance of all different stuff and then this is an extract so the pure cannabidiol there is a flip side to this obviously from a medicinal perspective you know what you're getting with the cannabidiol and that's a really good thing for patients another drawback to extracts on the cbd side is that you have the potential for low quality because it's a newer industry and growing all the time there are going to be some extracts out there which don't taste as great and particularly when i got started in the world of cbd extracts i wasn't enjoying the flavor so much this year however i've been impressed with the goods flavor profile and i know there are some other awesome companies working on terpene blends and really cool stuff that you can explore so the the high quality extracts are there as well consuming extract also requires another piece of equipment so either a v8 pen or a dab rig as i mentioned with the tried and tested consumption methods however this does make it a little bit more expensive to get started and you will have to buy yourself at least an entry-level product to be able to consume the extract unless you want to just put it in with your joints but then you will be burning it and therefore wasting some of the cbd and finally the extract may feel a little bit less natural to old-school smokers i'm talking the guys and girls that have been smoking joints for 30 years haven't really tried out other consumption methods this is a newer way to consume cannabis right and it doesn't look like it did in its herbal form so it feels less natural to people that have never tried it but once you take the plunge it can be a very enjoyable experience so what is my verdict when it comes to consuming hemp flour or cbd extract which should you pick it's going to depend entirely on you and your motivations but there are clearly some benefits and some drawbacks to both i personally really like consuming the cbd dabs in the morning they're a really good start to the day but i also find myself smoking and vaping cbd flour from time to time so there are benefits to both you know it's really nice to mix them sometimes as well during the day and have a bit of both in different sessions so i find it difficult to pick i really like the flavor profiles and i really like this sort of clear-headed feeling that i get when i consume cbd extracts which is very noticeable for something that's not psychotropic both forms of consumption are entirely valid but you'll get a clearer dosage with cbd extract i'll buy both i'll have both in my medicine cabinet and i will consume both of them but i want to know what your thoughts are on the subject do you smoke hemp flour do you dab cbd extract have you tried both and what is your preference please leave your comments below and we'll be joining

showed that co use of CBD and THC had much more benefit than using either one by itself and other studies have shown this as well well there's something called the entourage effect and that is when you use all the cannabinoids simultaneously you get the best effect there seems to be some kind of synergistic relationship where they just work together for more improvement but does that mean that you need lots of THC and very little bit CBD or give you just a tiny bit of THC and lots of CBD we don't really know unfortunately there aren't any large clinical trials and have looked at this and it's very difficult to get to these nuances in questionnaire based studies because people don't have a great understanding of what it is that they're taking due to a variety of factors it could be the route of administration it could be that the labeling is a good or it could be that people just don't pay attention or they could be using something that somebody else got and they don't know what it is so it's very hard right now to really hone in on what that ratio should be now there have been studies with a pharmaceutical that's been approved in other countries called Sativex which is a spray that goes underneath your tongue and that's a one-to-one ratio of CBD to THC which means that they're equal parts of CBD and THC and it's been used for a variety of conditions like spasticity and multiple sclerosis does that mean it's gonna work for you I don't know because at a one-to-one ratio you still might feel the psychoactive effects of THC because what happens is when you take THC and CBD together the CBD tones down that psychoactive effect of THC so some people that one-to-one ratio is enough so that they don't get high and for others it's like there isn't even CBD there and so there are formulations that are 30 to one of CBD to THC meaning that there are 30 part CBD 1 parts THC which would be very uncommon to be psychoactive but very sensitive people still might feel that and they're already chosen between you get a two to one sir we don't want to ten to one how do you know well you're gonna have to be a little bit of an experiment and equals one and maybe try some things again you want to start low go slow so my recommendation speak to a medical professional so that you can tell them what medications you're on what your conditions are that you're taking it for so that you can talk to them about potential drug interactions and then you want to find products that have a very high ratio of CBD to begin with take a very very tiny dose and work your way up slowly keep a journal so that you know how you're doing and whether or not it's actually helping your condition and you can sort of make changes on the fly I've been using medical cannabis for five years now to treat my condition of chronic pain and spasticity and pain and do since omneya and my regimen has changed greatly over the years as products get better as my condition changes I have to try new things to see what's going to work best [Music]", "xl63tar39F0": "today i'm processing my roots or at least i'm getting them out of the ground if you're going to use roots you want to make sure you clean them really good these are there's just the main roots i didn't take any of the uh the uh the strings it was just too hard to get out of the ground oh my gosh it took me forever to get this out but these are nice uh thicker roots that i can uh def i'll definitely use um i will be close to the video on uh what i do with them um i make sobs and i uh actually eat them i use it in uh with coconut oil and i put in my coffee every single day except saturday and sunday which uh i give my body a break but it does amazing things and i will share that with you so don't throw away your roots keep them bad boys they got to be uh dried hung up and dried and then i'll cut it off bro that good stuff is all right happy growing everybody since uh you have now washed and dried your roots they need to be really washed and dried and if you have grown organically if you've been using salt-based um nutrients i probably wouldn't do this if you're going to put this on your body or in your body you you want organic roots are filters for your plant and basically it's in your soil it's bringing up in into your roots so make sure that uh you are organically based what i do is i break my roots down i've got me uh these fisca big o clipper dills but basically you just cut your your roots down into the smallest pieces you can get and then what i'll do is i'll put mine in this uh mortar and pulse stone granite whatever it is and try to get this as powdery as possible so you're going to have all sizes um whatever you have if you have a little um ninja food processor thing that'll work too but you want to get it as fine and as powdery as you could possibly do i don't know these words um the words uh the scientific chemicals that i'm going to put up on the screen so you can see it but one is for protecting your liver and the other is um a cancer killer and what this cancer killer does it sends a signal to the to the cancer cell tells it to commit suicide it um hypothesis i think is what um what it causes and that's like say if you have a a tadpole when a tadpole turns into a frog it sends a positive this chemical to the tail to tell it to die and then that's how the frog will lose its tail basically does the same thing to a cancer cell cancer cells don't have the trigger that tells it when it's damaged to kill itself it just doesn't do that so what this does will do that i am not a doctor i i can't tell you um i don't want to tell you you know eat this stuff um how i do it is uh you need get a get from you know talk to your doctor if you're if you're in a situation where you got cancer or something i don't want it to ruin anything like say i i can only tell you what i've been doing um i put it in in coconut oil and then uh once it's extracted out i pour that coconut oil into a little jar i take take a teaspoon every day in my coffee except for saturday and sunday which i give my body a rest so i work i have it in my coffee i just put a scoop in there and then you need a creamer of some type like a powder creamer that it'll attach to easier for your body absorb if you're going to use in sauce i take that same um coconut oil and i will put it into my assab bomb making process um like i said i'll put the chemicals up what we're looking trying to extract out of there um i they're crazy words so um two ounces or two ounces of this you want to cut this up in two cups worth into your i put it in a crock pot your own crock pot here along with about four or five cups of water two cups of organic coconut oil um i like the organic um i don't think it makes too much of a difference it's just the carrier but i like coconut oil it uh it hardens up um if you put it once this is done you're going to cook this thing for 12 to 18 hours i go 24 you make sure you replace the water as it you know evaporates out simmers out but you want to um the oil will stay and that's what's going to collect all your uh your chemicals that we're looking for um like say i'm really after two um but you know we don't know what the uh what the other ones do um but for solves and stuff it's absolutely wonderful it's great stuff don't throw them out keep your roots so you're chopping them up roots coming off they're going to be all sizes i break them down and i got some big ones small ones i'm going to use this to grind it up and then put it in my coconut oil and i say i'm gonna do it for 24 hours i will put those chemicals up so you know what they are if you have any questions you're welcome to come to our uh facebook group it's called growers helping growers it's just a bunch of people that uh every we have every type of grower indoor outdoor hydroponic you name it we got it from professionals to people that just started yesterday we can answer

David Allen I'm a retired cardiac surgeon and a member of the International cam enoyed Research Society I crs that means I'm a cannabinoid research scientist and I'm here to tell you about the discovery of the endocannabinoid system the EC s and the significance and how it was will change medicine and we discovered the endocannabinoid system about 30 years ago and we really didn't understand the significance of its discovery and so we we found out that this is a chemical communication that your body has it's not electrical its chemical and it's kind of like the hormone systems that that people are familiar with and your body makes these cannabinoids they're endogenous so they're endocannabinoids and they perform some miraculous functions in the body and we're just learning the significance of these of these functions and basically the endocannabinoid system is responsible for homeostasis most people don't understand what that really means but it it it's it's the body's ability to maintain itself and function in the proper environment and so it's critically important that the doctors in the future understand this control mechanism and we're finding out that they that manipulation of this endocannabinoid system will control diabetes it controls cancer controls whether you can survive a heart attack or stroke and so this is critically important for doctors to understand this new science and the discovery of the endocannabinoid system is the single most important medical scientific discovery ever and will will save more lives than the discovery and application of sterile surgical technique and I'm a heart surgeon saying that so more people will be saved by manipulation of the endocannabinoid system then are currently saved by by surgery but recent research has been looking at cannabis and the different cannabinoids is over 80 plus cannabinoids discovered in the cannabis plant the second most dominant one besides THC is cannabidiol or CBD and the research now is over 1200 peer-reviewed journals on CBD it's probably the most exciting and researched ingredient or substance right now around the world it doesn't have a psychoactive or high that is associated with THC but it has a tremendous amount of other benefits including research shows anti-seizure anti epileptic which is why it's gotten a lot of popularity to go out with children with seizure disorders and they're getting benefits from this plant and a safe non-toxic way versus all these drugs that typically don't work and there's neuroprotective benefits so you see a lot with concussions and the NFL does all the research being done now with chronic traumatic encephalopathy or chronically banging their head or out it was anti-anxiety which is really important it's the anti THC of sorts that calms you down it helps you manage stress better which is how I look at it it's much more as a preventative or daily used substance than just treating disease states and this immune support there's it's a huge antioxidant this is a tremendous teaser sometimes to talk about what it doesn't do than what it does dr. alan shackelford is a Harvard trained physician he's also among a handful of doctors in Colorado who give prescriptions for medical marijuana from the moment Charlotte entered his office he knew she was in trouble while he was just examining her she had two seizures she'd failed everything there were no more options for her everything had been tried except cannabis here's how scientists think it might work marijuana is made up of two ingredients th see that's the psychoactive part that makes you high and CBD also called cannabidiol it's the CBD that scientists think modulates electrical and chemical activity to help quiet the excessive activity in the brain that causes seizures dr. Julie Holland is the editor of the pot book a complete guide to cannabis for a long time the work on cannabis and epilepsy was sort of inconclusive maybe it works maybe it doesn't they couldn't quite figure it out it's only when they really started separating THC from CBD that they saw you know definitively yes CBD seems to really stop seizures work so in the 1930s they made tinctures what were they making it tinctures for and why were they doing these teams well I mean the medicinal uses of hemp are just numerous that helps well we can talk about the cancer effects of hemp but it helps with inflammation it's very anti-inflammatory it helps with seizures it's very effective with PTSD for the vets that are coming back that it had post-traumatic traumatic stress disorder very effective at treating that it's an anti-inflammatory but then though the uses of hemp for cancer or what I've studied because of my book cancer step outside the box and the number of cancers there's about a dozen different cancers that have been studied in depth with MIT with medicinal marijuana with him and so the studies from brain cancer to prostate cancer to pancreatic cancer uterine cancer cervical cancer prostate cancer it's amazing okay so what is in hemp yeah that it's this THC correct well there's there's chemicals that are called cannabinoids right THC is short for Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol you said it because I couldn't that's the only time I'll get it right right so that's the 1 2 th THC is the one can ever know that everyone's are familiar with that's the one that's psychoactive and that's the one that gets you high if you smoke it okay but there's other cannabinoids one that one is called CBD cannabidiol and it's very medicinal II used it there's not such there's no psychoactive component of CBD so what did you extract these make tincture make tea out of you can make tea you can eat it it's a great superfood you're into raw a lot of people have to use brought him in there do you get high off of him no well just the scene you've got a heat you got to heat the THC to make it become psychoactive so people that eat the plant they put in a smoothie you know they're super green smoothies right you're not gonna get high off of that because you didn't superheat it but is it then if you put it in a smoothie like that is a good prevention to cancer it is it's very well it's it's got a perfect ratio of omega-3 Dhin to six fatty acids it's got its got more GLA gamma linolenic acid than any other plant so it's got some really great fats your your well aware of the importance of great fats in your diet so hemp has it's a perfect superfood to eat but it's also medicinal I just never understood why hemp had gotten such a bad rap and now I understand that it was really politically motivated by somebody who owned basically trees and didn't want to be in competition with the hemp to make paper and yet throughout the years after that so many people suffered because of that yes so I guess it's actually a good thing that people are coming around a little bit it is I'm really encouraged about the different legislation in different states that are trying to legalize medicinal hemp because of the fact that it is so good it is so it's not just a superfood it's not just great for industrial uses as we've mentioned but it is really it's a really good medicine thank you so much for coming on - I really appreciate you being here [Music]", "F9_syRGcN6A": "I know you love them your host the man's the mythological creatures the legend district critter man what having

"fYMCA_Tg_vk": "Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "1iuA5wDv3Jo": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make a CVD teacher [Music] so what exactly is a tincture and how is it different from other CBD edibles well a tincture is a medicine made by dissolving a drug into alcohol in this case we're dissolving the CBD on the hemp buds into the alcohol because of this CBD tincture is sort of the same thing as a CBD infused alcohol although with a tincture we're trying to maximize the amount of CBD then each drop to be used in small doses as opposed to a seaweed infused aloe Hall where each serving is most likely more than a few drops and by using the drops under the tongue the arterial blood supply under your tongue will rapidly absorb the CBD allowing it to take effect much faster than with any edible so first things first we're going to be using a lot of medicinal hemp because we need a pack a lot of CBD into each drop so half an ounce to a full ounce of medicinal hemp is needed second we're more interested in extracting as much as CBD off the hemp buds as possible then we are the taste of the alcohol so we're using the highest percentage of alcohol we can find from a distilled beverage in my case I'm going with a 750 milliliter bottle of Bacardi 151 which has a seventy five point five percent alcohol content and for those thinking why not just use rubbing alcohol event don't do this we're still going to be consuming this and most rubbing alcohol are made with isopropyl alcohol which metabolites is different from consumable alcohol and is very harmful if ingested now we need to decarboxylate the hemp and to do so Wolford grind it up onto a baking sheet decarboxylate in the hem will convert the CBB a in the hemp to CBB and is done so by heating up the hemp buds so after grinding it all up to help it heat evenly we'll place this in the oven which has been preheated to 250 degrees and we'll let it bake for 30 minutes after it's done grounded buds will have a darker baked colour and you'll want let it sit a little to have it cool down before handling it after its cooled will place the decarboxylated hemp in a jar and then pour into alcohol from here if you have the time to spare you can just cover it up and place it somewhere dark for a couple of days to have the CBD infused with the alcohol slowly over time just be sure to give it a good shake once a day if you're going with this method if you're short on time though there's actually another method available they'll infuse the tincture much quicker and that's to give the glass jar a water bath he will expedite the infusion process down to just 20 minutes except instead of beating a jar in boiling water you'll need a lower the heat until the water is down to a low simmer this is because unlike water which has a boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit alcohol has a lower boiling point of just 173 degrees Fahrenheit which means that the most we should heat up the teacher is a hundred and seventy degrees to prevent any of the alcohol from burning off as you can see from the thermometer this is what a low simmer of a hundred and seventy degrees looks like but even if you don't have a cooking thermometer and actually burn off a little alcohol since we're not drinking this for the alcohol content it shouldn't matter much just know that by doing so it'll make the teacher slightly more concentrated which will have a stronger effect you'll need a place something on the bottom of the pot so the jar doesn't have to write contact with the burner make sure the water in cases the alcohol but isn't so high that will accidentally pour into the jar and be sure to take the lid off the jar I also only recommend this if you have an electric burner I don't recommend using this method with a gas stove as it's too risky to play something with this high of an alcohol content near fire alternatively if you have a sous-vide cooker in your kitchen this is much better to use to ensure that the water stays at exactly 170 degrees with a sous-vide cooker all you have to do is clip it to a side of a pot fill it with water and then set the water temperature to 170 degrees before placing the jar in note that water is denser than alcohol so you need to play something on top of the jar to make sure that it doesn't flow I don't recommend using what I'm using but it's why I had nearby so I made it work either way you want to heat the tincture uncovered for 20 minutes after that we can take it out and just leave it out to cool until it's warm to the touch now for both the long method and the quick heating method the final step is to filter out all the plant material from the tincture and here you can either use a cheesecloth or a coffee filter just place out on a funnel and pour it all through making sure to squeeze out any alcohol left on the plant material so nothing goes to waste depending on how you plan on using the tincture you either want to put it in a dropper for easy consumption or in my case a jar to store for future use as a tincture is really useful for a number of recipes just be sure to store this in a dark place if available definitely use a tinted glass jar to further protect the tincture from light and that's it", "75kavv_ka4o": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make a simple CBD oil infused butter using an easy to do stovetop slow cook method there are multiple ways to make CBD oil but today we'll be going with one of the easiest methods which is simmering butter inhale over low heat which extracts the trichomes cannabinoids and CBD from the hemp it combines it with the butter making a rich CBD oil infused butter to make CBD oil infuse butter you'll only need three ingredients butter decarboxylated hemp and water or how to decarboxylate how to first convert the CVP a into CBD check out our decarboxylation guide first now you'll wanna use 1/4 of an ounce of hemp buds and trimmings for each stick of butter which is also half a cup of butter and of course the higher quality of trimming the buds you use the more CVP there will be in the butter now before adding the ingredients you'll want to first add some water to the pot the whole purpose of the water is to buffer the butter and health so that it doesn't touch the bottom of the stove and burn since the butter is less dense than water and will flow and no matter how much water you add it's pretty easy to separate from the butter after you're done I use two cups of water for this to give it a good buffer and if you're using a larger pot you can go up to 3 to 4 cups of water I'm now melting the butter in the pot of water throwing in the decarboxylated hemp and then once everything came to a boil I kept the heat on low so that it's barely simmering now you can leave this and check back on it periodically to make sure nothing has changed and if the water is burning off too fast you can always just add more water to the pot you'll want this to simmer for at least an hour and ideally up to five hours to make sure that all the cannabinoids have infused into the butter and for this I went with five hours and added another cup of water halfway through the process [Music] now you want to strain the entire pot through a strainer or a cheesecloth or in my case I didn't have either on hand so I used a new clean t-shirt if you're going with the t-shirt I have to warn you that doing this will ruin the shirt and make sure the shirts clean without any lint or detergent that could get into your infuse butter I waited until a mixture cooled slightly and then poured everything through it was still pretty hot so it took me a while to get every last drop but it was well worth it you can see here that after 10 minutes the CBD oil infused butter is already completely separated from the water if you want to use it right away you can use a baster to remove the water from the bottom otherwise just cover it up throw in the fridge overnight and the next day when the butter has hardened you can easily drain out the water how'd it dry and then store for future use to make all types of edibles or you can even put it into little capsules to make CPP pills [Music] and that's it", "AwseTJ_kvr8": "[Music] hi this is jeff the 420 chef and thank you for choosing my thc cbd calculator today i'm going to walk you through how the calculator works and all the different bells and whistles that it includes let's start with the bottom of the page you'll see that there's a home button a calculator button and a heart button let's just click on the home button to start here you have access to a lot of my recipes for example my can of butter recipe my can of oil recipe how to clean and prep your cannabis before you infuse your cannabis and how to decarb your cannabis before you infuse it into your butter and oil and more recipes will be coming soon in addition on the bottom of the page you'll notice an area for recent calculations here is where you can view all the calculations you've done in the past let's get started click on the calculator button on the page you'll notice that you have two inputs one for thc and one for cbd the strain i'm working with today is called harlequin harlequin is a high cbd strain low thc strain i'm using it today to illustrate how the calculator can work with both thc and cbd simultaneously this strain has 5 thc so you'll move the bar to five for five percent and it's 15 cbd you'll move the bar to 15 for cbd the next step is to enter your final dry weight this is the final weight after you have dried and de-carved your cannabis whether or not you're using my cleaning process or you're just straightly carving but before without putting it through my cleaning process you're always going to lose at least moisture weight i started with seven grams but i'm not going to put seven grams in this space at the end of my cleaning and drying process i'm left with 5.2 grams so i'm entering the number 5.2 the next step is to enter the infusion are you infusing your cannabis into butter or oil and what type of oil each calculation is slightly different let's click on butter because it's the first one now when i infuse butter i like to infuse an entire stick of butter an entire stick can be measured in tablespoons so i'm going to click tablespoons and i'm going to click eight if you need a quick reference guide for this you can look down in the green box and all the information you need is there now click the yellow button that says calculate that'll bring it to your results page at the top of this page you'll notice an area where you can actually put the name of your infusion at the top we're going to call it infusion 1. [Music] underneath that there's an area called strain name since we use harlequin we're going to put the name harlequin in there now in your green box you'll notice your total potency your total potency for this infusion is 95.55 milligrams of thc and 286.65 milligrams of cbd but that doesn't really help you that much more importantly look below that you'll see your infusion results are actually called out by tablespoon that's very important information so now you're left with 6.1 milligrams i'm sorry 6.1 tablespoons of canned butter that you produced meaning that you've lost 1.9 tablespoons in your infusion process and each tablespoon of your can of butter is going to be 15.6 milligrams of thc and 46.81 milligrams of cbd but that still doesn't really help you you need to know how much of your butter you're going to need to put into your recipe in order to achieve a specific infusion per serving that's really simple just go down to the bottom of the page and click on the toast button this brings you to the most important page in the calculator you'll notice that you can figure out just how potent you want each serving of your brownies for example to be now i want to serve 10 brownies i'm going to put the number 10 in the recipe number of servings but now if i don't know how much of my can of butter i need to use to achieve that all i have to do is move up where it says recipe can a product and start clicking on the little plus button you'll notice that if i only use one tablespoon of my can of butter i'm only going to have 1.56 milligrams per serving of thc and 4.68 milligrams per serving of cbd but that's not what i want let me click it again oh there we go now i've put two tablespoons of my can of butter into the recipe and each brownie is now going to be 3.12 milligrams per serving and cbd 9.36 milligrams per serving now let's go back to the previous page you'll notice on the bottom of this page you've got an area for notes you can type whatever you want in there since i love you guys i'm going to just type in here i love you and if you really love your infusion and you want to save it you'll notice that there's a heart button on the bottom all you have to do is click that heart button and you've saved it now if you don't like what you've done or you want to completely get rid of it you can either click the trash button to throw it in the trash or you click the start over button and start all over and that's it easy as pie i hope you enjoyed this demo and i hope the calculator brings you many years of use if you like the calculator please make sure to give us two thumbs up a great review and five stars [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "iD0D8AJl4tg": "i haven't filmed one of these yet so i just wanted to say that if you are not 18 or up please don't watch this video okay i'm gonna go hey what's up this is caoh and i'm miles and today as you can see from the title we're gonna be doing some edibles um just waiting on something to malfunction whether it be the lighting or something i don't know something always happens and i haven't actually sat and filmed in a minute because i've just been editing old stuff as i'm sure you guys know i just wanted to switch it up and sit and film i'm a little scared uh because it is going to be um 500 milligrams and i wanted to start off with at like uh 100 or so because i've already done edibles and everything but it's 500 sounds pretty scary to me um so we're gonna see how this goes i'm terrified low-key [Music] just a little bit i'm scared um even my girlfriend was like uh just please don't get sick it's just she flat out was like just whatever you do don't get sick and like and i have a story about it a time in which i did get sick from edibles but i'm gonna film a whole video on that debacle one day probably around the time when i'm at um the same amount of milligrams that i took that got me sick which was a thousand milligram situation so we're gonna lead up to that but for now right now i'm starting off at 500 milligrams um and i'm going to most likely be on 500 and 600 milligrams for a few of these um because like i said i do want to make it kind of a series but originally my thought was i wanted to start at 100 and build my way up and make a video for 100 150 blah blah blah um and then i also had an idea where i was going to do um like a mukbang situation and do a bunch of different ones i still want to do that um but i think um since i'm already starting off at 500 milligrams with this particular brand they have a bunch of different types of candies that i want to try that are also 500 600 milligrams so i'm probably gonna do this one and then just try them all and do a different video for each one that i try um but i'm starting out with the airheads extremes and the thing about it is i don't know if um do a little thumbnail i don't know if um this is made by the actual company like the airheads brand because nothing on it says any sort of um like fake candy name like um i'm trying to think of a brand but i can't think of one off the top of my head but like a lot of times with edibles usually when it's a candy it's like an off-brand kind of candy name and this one for some reason um it's just the straight-up brand so it makes me think that it is like made by the company and maybe the company just made you know edibles for adults um but i don't know that kind of seems a little weird that they would they would do that and not make it like a statement so i don't know if these are like illegal or like not illegal but like utility they're actually made by the company or not but either way i'm going to tap in and see if they are um if they look like the real candy because i did try a different one i can't remember what it which one it was unfortunately that's why i'm just gonna restart um because i don't even want to use the footage from that one um just can't remember what which one it was and i don't even think that we we got a lot of uh footage um but i i really want to remember i feel like i think i got i think i had gushers um and it did taste exactly like the candy um if i can find what whichever one i i did do i'll put in the clips from the one that i did to try because it's just a quick um because i just have a little bit of footage from it but i'm going to retry that one as well but that one did definitely taste like the candy so i have a feeling that this one will taste like the candy as well but um it's only one way to find out so i'm gonna get to opening it i'm pretty sure that yep when you open it there's a and then um just real quick i'm gonna show you the sides and what did all this says so it's a super potent formula which is scary 60 minutes activation which is really what we're testing the most i really want to know if it's going to activate in 60 minutes i feel like last time i tried it 60 minutes later i didn't feel a difference so um i'm really gonna time it and see so and then it says thc infused um i can't see but i'm sorry um this is thc infused air heads and then um yeah just a 500 milligrams per can and yeah let's get it open so [Music] and it looks like they do look just like the candy this is actually one of my favorite candies um so pretty excited to have it in the edible form see if it tastes the exact same so here is the first one which actually i'm gonna count how many there are so i got nine i was hoping that it would give me an even number but yeah so here's one and already it does not taste like um the candy there's not it's not bad just you can taste the wheat taste and i'm not a big fan of um when you taste the wheat taste and food stuff i like the taste of weed when i'm smoking and you can taste the flour um but i don't like the taste of weed and edibles or anything like that so that part's not too fun um well that was one and now here's two there's nine all together 500 milligrams all together it's hard to do i'm gonna fix the camera angle i don't like that i'm not where i'm supposed to be excuse me all right sorry we're back i just wanted to fix the way i was sitting at my heart said my face too much i couldn't see that's three other bit my thumb and that did not feel good it not hurts what the vibe so that's fun definitely a fun time for me definitely hurts i may need a moment i'll be back okay sorry so i did bite my tongue pretty bad but it was like literally in the very back on like my back two teeth get stung but i'm cool we're back for number four i believe yeah before there's five left after this oh i forgot to say the time if i just look and it's 9 22. so 10 20 i'll let you guys know how i feel i don't know if you guys could have just seen that i put a whole big chunk of spirit flew out of my mouth so you gonna talk with your mouth which is really hard when you're filming a video while you're eating and this is the fifth one i right this one one piece of hair there's just one one is to do it don't there whoa that's a challenge for real i don't have any water or anything with me i assure you i'm gonna go drink and eat some more food after this because 500 milligrams on a almost empty stomach is not an idiot and i'm not crazy um here's number six and i have to film the video right after and but i was so sleepy and i was like dude if you film this you're just gonna like knock out so like i just laid back on the couch and and i was like i'm gonna i'm just gonna lay here for like 30 seconds and then literally i passed out and it's funny because normally when i get home from work i'm super wide awake but today the day when i decided i was going to film i was so exhausted i couldn't keep my eyes open and normally i literally i can't go to sleep like i'm exhausted but i can't go to sleep because i'm because i need to smoke and stuff first and literally i didn't even need to smoke like i was like wow you're really that tired of course all right now we have three left two and watch down to the last one man they're definitely not they kind of have the same taste i feel like they are made like similarly oh that was kind of hard to say um but um if you look i don't know if you know what like the other ones are but the regular um air extremes are like super thin in comparison to these ones it's very hard for me to talk but like the stuff that's sticking to my teeth so i'm sorry all right that was nine of them so therefore i have now finished 500 milligrams so um i'll see you guys in about 60 minutes next time you see me i will not probably be in the same place because i'm gonna have to find a way to keep myself entertained for the next hour and not go to sleep which means i'm probably gonna have to go outside so see you in a second um so far i hope you were entertained um thanks for watching i don't know if i already said that um also i don't know how your day's doing but i hope you're having a good day and um don't forget that it's always a good day to get high i will see you in a second peace lastly i just wanted to add that the hardest part of this is going to be remembering that i took the edible for the next 60 minutes because i'm gonna forget that's that's how it goes i forget and then all of a sudden i'm gonna be like wait i don't feel this way and normally when we take edibles we end up like smoking right after or whatever so you can't even really tell if it's like the effects from the edibles or like because you're high from smoking and stuff uh but my girl's not gonna be home for a minute so i'm not gonna be smoking for a minute so um i'm only going to fill this i don't know it's good for you so what i feel like i already mentioned it but i'm upscaped um but it's too late turn back now it's in my body so if it doesn't go well it doesn't go well but i'm hoping that things aren't going to and badly there's only one way to find out though so peace so update it's now 12 13 and i'm not like smacked or anything we smoked a couple bowls right now and i felt more high from that that i was feeling so i don't know i'll keep you posted i guess um i'm gonna go probably smoke another bowl though i just wanted to go for a walk and see if maybe i would feel a little more late you know sometimes you gotta go outside but yeah you know the drill i can't do the piece because where i'm standing but i'll see you in a second all right so now i'm back home again and um definitely spacey yeah so so i want to do some sort of like test type thing where i have like different categories and i judge based on that with each nipple um so i could really test it you know based on like taste how high i get different things but i still have to figure all that out this is just like the first practice of like what i want to do with the videos so we'll see how it goes but definitely gonna make another video like this um i'm gonna try to figure out exactly how i want to do it um i want oh man i'm getting really sleepy that's for sure um i'm sorry i'm definitely getting really sleepy um and like it's hard for me to focus on what i'm saying so i'm gonna get ready to go um i feel like the video's probably been long enough i want i want you guys to get a bit of the aftermath it's just kind of hard because i also don't want to sit here and look stupid the whole time um and not keep be able to keep talking and stuff and like focus on what i'm saying but obviously i'm high so like it's kind of slowly getting all over the place but moral of the stories there's gonna be another one of these videos i'm gonna take a bong grip right quick and then i'm gonna say sayonara so one second all right now we're ready to smoke a little bit um just wanted to say before i do that um thanks for watching i'm pretty sure i already said that but just in case i didn't thank you i appreciate it if you want to find me anywhere else all that stuff is in the description and um i don't think i'm going to put any music in this one but still follow the music in the description because i'm still going to put my my friends stuff in there this is my brain trying to do the thing called thinking all right we're gonna get it which at this point probably is not the best option but i'm about to go to sleep anyways so i know like what a waste right to do all this just to go to sleep that's another thing i want to make another video where i do this again but like don't go to sleep after hopefully the next time hopefully the next time i do a video where um i take edibles i will uh stay up afterwards but like with the way my schedule is right now every day that i don't have work um i will have just got off of work so like if i don't work that night which is a good night for me to take an edible um i still worked that morning so like i'm still exhausted so i'm gonna need to go to sleep and if i were to take it like right after i went to sleep like i'm it's gonna mess up my whole like either way there's not like a good time for me to like be smacked basically so i'm just gonna go with it and like we're gonna do do what we got for now but obviously uh at some point or another i'm gonna take an edible and hopefully it'll be before the thousand milligram medical and i will not have to go to sleep after hopefully i'll be able to take one and then go somewhere fun obviously can't really go places right now so that's the other factor but hopefully i'll be able to go somewhere cool and chill after but you know what again rambling sorry y'all to be fair though like you kind of clicked on a video that was like gonna have me talking so i guess you kind of knew what you were signing up yep [Music] again still need to clean my body and um my dab stuff still waiting on it to get really bad so i can do a video on it so if you ever want to see that make sure you're subscribed hey i finally said some real youtube [ __ ] i was gonna say bye but i didn't play the pool i can't i can't play no games peace i don't know if i like my hat in the front i mean in the back i like my hat honestly this is the truth this is how i really would like to wear my head at all times this is why i wear hats since i was a youth this is all i've wanted peace i need this to be like my uh my thumbnail and like my icon on everything i'm ooh my id photo i want to put this on my license just when i get my license for the first time i'll just get it yes okay i'm gonna go i don't know why this makes me so happy okay goodbye", "3H3u7vwoszM": "hi welcome back to reveal cannabis today we're going to talk about how to make our cannabis oil which we made last week on the video link that down below we're gonna talk about how to make this into an awesome healing hopefully pain relieving salve so or a cream or a balm it's super easy to do at home and I'm going to show you how to do it right now my name is Andrea I'm a cannabis wellness coach for moms I help moms who are really struggling with just how tough life can be sometimes after you have kids and you had no idea it was gonna be that rough and you know that there's a better life but you're not like entirely sure how to get there that's where I come in I help you use cannabis exactly the way that you need to for your day in your life and I walk you through a bunch of other wellness practices that you can implement so that when you graduate my program you're living a much much better life than you are now that's the point so if that sounds like it would float your boat reach out to me at Rubio cannabis calm alright so I didn't talk about what we need today so first of all we have our half cup of cannabis oil that we did last time you can see that it's not liquid it's our live in Canada and it's cold here already so it solidifies so 1/2 a cup of your infused oil and then these are the basics you can go nuts on scythes and add like a whole bunch of different oils and combinations of things I went to my cannabis coach colleague who is the bomb making this stuff I he doesn't like 9,000 times a day and then we also have somebody in our group who makes this stuff for a living so I asked them how to do it like this most simple and easy way to say you and me all the googling so here we go this is cacao butter or cocoa butter I think people say it both ways it's basically the oil that they get from the cocoa bean and it feels amazing I was just playing around with that this is beeswax and this is shea butter so you can get those just out of your local health food store I'm sure amazon also sells them you're also need a tablespoon or if you're fancy then I prefer to use a scale because it's really actually hard to get a table actually gonna add it to my income I stopped today because this is for somebody else and I don't know if you want to smell like peppermint but you can add all those oils as well and then you're gonna need a double boiler or I think I'm just gonna do it right in here so I'm gonna get set up in the kitchen and we'll see you there all right so we're ready to go I have my infused oil the coconut oil that I just warmed up in the microwave I'm just gonna try to infuse it right in here but it's not gonna work and then I've created a double boiler here so that just means that you have a little bit of water in the bottom so that it reaches the bottom of the second pan and you put the second pin in and then pour your ingredients in and the reason that we do a double boiler is so that you don't you don't want to burn your oil you don't wanna get your oil to the point where it's smoking because that's bad so I'm just gonna add in my infuse my cannabis infused oil and then I ended up really having to shave the beeswax because it was so hard so this is beeswax here on top and then the shea butter and the cocoa butter the cacao butter so you put this all together this takes a little while you want to put it over like don't put a rolling boil on it or anything and when this all combines together then you're done so I'm gonna let this melt away and I'll show you what it's like at the end and just so you know I'll have all the instructions for this as well in a link down below not sure if I remember to tell you but there's an ounce or two tablespoons of each of the three other ingredients that we added in here so but that links down below so make sure you grab that so that you don't need to watch the video every time you want to make this okay so everything has melted all together you can see that the liquid like you can see through the liquid now so I'm just gonna pour it back into my mason jar I happen to have one of these for canning which makes this a whole bunch easier there we go this takes about a half an hour to set up so obviously we wait because it's gonna be quite warm and then you can apply this topically which means apply it to your skin so if you had sore hands or a sore back or sore knees this would be perfect for it there's absolutely no way for the THC in here to get you high at all so there's no worry about that and because this is a one-to-one straight it has CBD and THC in it then it will help with pain on both friends and inflammation so yeah this is gonna set up and I'm gonna send it off to the client and see what he thinks and we'll go from there thanks so much for watching this week's video I post new videos every Saturday I'd love if you subscribed and hit like if you liked it and if there's anything else that you would like to learn about please let me know and I just wanted to show you the final product it's quite creamy as you can see and when you wrap it on it takes a little bit to rub into your skin but it feels fantastic because of all the great additives that we added into it and then it absorbs quite well so I'm excited to pass this on to my client and see if it will help with his back pain if you have any questions please just reach out and I can answer them in the chat Thanks", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system

What we're talking about here is Dr 90 CBN cannabis of the 80 s being available in hemp. Right. It's available in hemp. It's legal, right still gets you stone, and it's made it legal under the same laws. It made CBD illegal. It's said to be 70 to 75% as potent as the real thing. The best way to think about that is for every two hits off of Delta nine. It takes three hits off adult to hate. So essentially all you all you need is to consume a little bit more in order to feel the same effect right now. The medical marijuana system We have to see a doctor every seven months. On you're fading like extreme prices for cannabis. Some of these patients can't do that. So it allows us to offer an alternative to that whole system, the DEA or Drug Enforcement Agency says it's currently in the process of reviewing the rules surrounding products like Delta eight THC, I'm not surprised because I warned everybody that. It really wasn't medicine for the very sick. It was the camel's nose under the tip, and we've not seen all that We're going to see, says Pull County Sheriff Grady Judd. It should be noted Delta eight will likely show up on a drug test. You could also get it, Do you? Why? If you're driving high on it, what we're seeing here today is not the end result. But the next step. And to find another way to Stone America. I'm worried about the health. Of your loved ones that's going to drive on the same highway with a person that takes enough of this low Delta eight to get stone. So it's not gonna be", "b4tD1jFpTPo": "hello everybody and welcome back to kj steve i hope you guys are having yourselves a wonderful day enjoying ourselves all that wonderful magical good stuff and for today's episode we're doing another edible review since you guys like the sour patch one i went out and tried to find myself other edibles i think would be interesting for you guys and for today's episode we got we got the little trillium edibles edibles i don't know if you guys have seen these before if it'll focus yeah so they make all different types of making of the sour patch to make the little watermelon ones all kind of different ones but since my personal favorite candy is trolleys i went out the way and found these and yeah so from what i can tell these are 300 milligrams in each packaging thc obviously and from what i've heard this brand is really good it's really high quality hopefully it's better than the sour patch ones which i hope it is so yeah before we get into it guys please like subscribe comment all that wonderful magical good stuff and without further ado let's get into this [ __ ] so real quick just in case you guys are out here trying to get your own and all that stuff please be aware when it comes to edibles cards all sorts of [ __ ] packaging like this can easily be bought off ebay amazon off the internet and people can be you know [ __ ] with your [ __ ] but just as a little reference in order to know that these are real each little metal packaging will have like the certain color coordination on the dip part so if this trolley is going to have the blue and red if it's sour patch it's going to have the green and so and so and also where it says the thc part right there if you you guys probably see it'll focus for you there should be like a little very gray doctor symbol on the back so there's that too so yeah so let's open this [ __ ] and let's get it so it smells like you know what you would expect gummy worms to smell like but it has more of that gourmet kind of snow and you can still smell a little bit of the weed is not too crazy so you know you can have these out and it wouldn't be noticeable get these [ __ ] out this is pretty much what they look for they're nice big worms they're not like i thought they're going to be more like trolleys like the actual smaller ones but not either pretty solid big so because of that there's only there's six in each bag which isn't bad so normally for someone who has a lower tolerance i would say go for three but if you're like me someone who has a higher tolerance or just naturally prefers to be higher and likes being high i would say knock all sticks down the 300 milligrams it's a nice steady high well we'll find out soon so we like to send [ __ ] in this channel i'm gonna go ahead and eat all six we're gonna eat a little part just to do a little taste review see how it [Music] this is hit say and they do taste like what i would say gourmet gummy warmers would taste like like if you go to a dollar store or any grocery store and they normally got like you know they got the trolley brands and then they got like the market brands it tastes kind of like the market brands but of course it also has that hint of wheat on it and what i do like about these compared to the ones um compared to the sour patches i did earlier the weed taste on this is a lot more subtle than it was on the sour patch one yeah it doesn't hit you in the face like you're eating it you merely taste gummy worm not you know wait so that's a good part on edibles so does it take longer to eat or are you just going slow this is a big gummy worm the regular gummy worm colors the blue and orange green yellow and the [ __ ] red another one sorry they are solid if you do start throwing more in your mouth you are going to get a little bit more of the wee taste but of course that's because you put a lot but yeah tastes good packaging is good six in each thing it's not bad it's a nice solid high i would assume and i would hope it would take you know just an average 30 to an hour to hit and hopefully since these look good they taste good hopefully it'll be a nice long lasting high oh again guys please like subscribe all that good stuff and you guys have you know any specific edibles you guys would like to do review on any glass any cards anything specific and he's trying to weed please let me know down below and i'll try my best to get my hands on it [Applause] but yeah just finished eating this and i would assume it'll take 30 minutes to an hour so i'll check in with you guys in about an hour or so to see how these are pretty much hit me so i hope you guys enjoy eating edibles too or just smoking along i'll be back with you guys hello everybody welcome back and we are about what i would say two to four hours deep on these edibles so it took about an hour to hit you know normally able to take and they are doing their magic they're great it's a nice body and head high and you know yeah it's what i would say if you've experienced edibles before you know saying your first edible you know what a good edible high is this is a very good one i would highly recommend yourself to get a metals if you can but yeah aside from that it's a great thing if you can try to get your hands on them you can try them out i don't know if they're all the same i'm gonna try to get my hands on some sour patch ones or some different ones but until then we'll see so yeah i would rate it you know 10 out of 10. if you guys get your hands on it you should try it so yeah that'll be if you guys have any other edibles again please put it down below i'll try to get my best i'll try my best to get my hands on it and yeah like always guys please like subscribe all that wonderful [ __ ]", "H_vVwcXn3Q0": "oh what's up easy bakers so today i'm going to be showing you guys how to make your own diy infused nerd ropes so if you haven't already follow me on instagram at daverny freeman i will be doing some giveaways so you want to follow me on instagram that's where i announce all of my giveaways and if you want to be a young young young young guy go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so let's jump into the video so this is everything you're going to need you're going to need some heavy duty aluminum foil it doesn't really have to be that heavy duty you can go get the 99 cent one whatever fits your grip baby so i'm gonna use some aluminum foil and with my aluminum foil i'm just gonna place them on a flat uh surface and you you will be putting this inside the refrigerator so boom pow now what i'm going to do is i like to create my own little mold i don't know if you guys want to go on amazon to see if they have these molds but i know a lot of people were saying they could not find any nerve rope mold so you really have to do them by hand so this is what i'm doing now i'm just making my own little molds which is just popping the aluminum foil up a little bit so it can have this barrier in between the two i'm doing that on each side so that's what i'll be doing right now [Music] and you guys do want to be careful when you're making your little liners because this is aluminum foil and it's easy to kind of tear through them [Music] so you guys i prefer to reuse these package this the packaging that comes with it so i ain't i'm not gonna buy normal packaging y'all don't play with me we're just gonna reuse these packaging what you do is you take where it's sealed all at either end of the rope and you kind of open it up like you will a bag of chips it's very easy to tear so you do want to take your time to open up the seal and once you open it up there should be a like a little cardboard against against the seal and you put your fingers in between the cardboard and the foil and you gently slide your fingers down in order to tear the packaging apart so that's what i do i do that then i set it aside and i take some nerds now this i do this all the time so i have additional nerve ropes and nerves in there and i like to take the nerves off of the rope which is very easy um so i don't have to buy a thousand boxes of nerve ropes yeah i mean i'm nerves when i could just use this now that you have separated your gummies from the nerves you're going to place them in a heat safe microwave safe bowl and place them in a small one i do recommend doing small batches at a time because if you do so many it's going to be kind of hard to control it so now you want to take your infused coconut oil i like to use liquid coconut oil instead of the coconut oil that goes back to solid and you want to use your tincture i'm using my eva clear tincture that i already infused with your cbd and they're going additional box of nurse just in case i need them but i don't feel like i will it's just whatever floats my boat and you also want to get yourself some type of piping bag or you can get a a condiment um container i think a ziploc bag is cheaper well not really cheaper but it's it works for me and i do reuse these so it's not like i throw them away because i know i hate plastic now i'm taking my coconut oil and i'm just coating this ziploc bag with the coconut oil if you do not want to use your infused coconut oil you can definitely use pam to coat this bat this ziploc bag but i'm saying if you're going to infuse something why not have everything be infused you get what i'm saying you're going to share but yeah so i'm going to do that and i'm also gonna do the same thing to my aluminum layers that i made my little molds because if you do not it will stick i don't care what anyone says in my i've been making these for forever in a day and they will stick if you put them in the freezer you put them in the refrigerator you will have pieces of aluminum stuck to your gummy now you looking at like a food like you're in third grade with goat with with aluminum foil in your mouth like it goes so yeah that's what you want to do just make sure everything is evenly coated then move on to the next step [Music] all right you guys so to my two rope gummies and six additional gummy bears i add half a tablespoon of infused coconut oil just to give you guys some type of starting point but this is definitely a trial and error type of situation so as you guys i have my tincture right here and i'm going to use five milliliters which is a teaspoon of t-shirt and i'm placing it to the side in a condiment disposable condiment container because i wanted to be you know on hand and you guys also saw that i had my liquid lecithin next to me just in case i'm going to need that as well so you want to take your rubber spatula or you can use anything that you're going to throw away i like to use this silicone rubber spatula because i could just wash it off and reuse it now i'm making sure that everything is evenly coated and i'm going to put this in a microwave for 10 seconds and it's going to look like this now i'm just stirring this around to make sure that my oil and gummies are combining together i microwave it again bring it back out stir it around and as you guys can see a little bit you see how they're the gummies in the oil is not coming together so what i'm doing is just trying to stir it a little faster and a little harder just putting a little bit of elbow grease into it to see if it's going to combine together and once it does as much as i would like for it to at this point i'm going to add my tincture to this i only add a half of the teaspoon into this at this time because you can always add more you really can't take it away so that's why it's super important to do this in small batches so you won't gotta worry about anything but as you guys can see the oil really did combine well with this so now i'm going to go ahead and add that t-shirt and do the same steps stir it around kind of be careful because it will splat it out okay y'all see what i'm saying i told y'all it'll splat out and that's nothing but my tincture splatting out honey that's why i'm like uh um let me let me try to put you back on in there girl then i'm stirring it around again just just to make sure that it is fully incorporated because if you do not do this you will have it will be set like oil and vinegar separate yeah this that's exactly what this will be baby your gummies will be to the right and your tincture will be to the left so you want to definitely make sure that it's fully incorporated microwave it again then you're going to place it in your ziploc bag or your piping bag remember this ziploc bag is already all uh down so i'm trying to give you guys a good angle but this is hot girl i'm like oh i'm about to stop the camera this is hot so you want to go ahead and pour that into there i use i try to use my rubber spatula to get the rest of it out but do what you can because it will kind of become you know it'll cool down a little fast so you will be working very quickly boo boo so once you get that together you're going to just whatever side you're going to cut it out you're going to cut it away from your workspace okay i cut it on the ground so you're going to cut it away from your workspace line a little bit of nerves just a little bit unless you want it real thick to the bottom of this pan and we're going to pipe on our gummies [Music] [Music] so you guys i am starting off with a thin layer i like to use at least when it when i like to make beans nerd robes i'm showing you guys how to make one and a half so with the measurements and things that i will put in the description box to my preference it makes one long nerd rope and kind of like um a quarter of one as well so what i'm doing now is i'm just going ahead and piping out my gummies and once i get done piping out the gummies i'm gonna take some additional nerd rope and sprinkle them on top of the gummies so they can have gummies on both sides i um really do this as a preference when it comes to how many nerds i'm actually putting on the rope so like i said this is really trial and error for some people you guys gonna have to figure out what what you like and what works best for you [Music] so all of those nerd roasts that you put on the side or if you're using a new box you're just going to go ahead and sprinkle as many nerves on this as you want to help you out you kind of want to make sure that all of the gummy is covered and go to your next step [Music] so [Music] all right so now you want to just go ahead and put your nerd roads in the refrigerator for several hours and once they harden up you're going to come back to them [Music] all right so now that it's been several hours i'm going to get my packaging my flat irons i don't use them on my head but i should use them for this okay and i get my nerd rose as you guys can see that it was covered up so you don't have to worry about anything getting on them [Music] now this is why it's super important to spray down that aluminum foil you guys see how easy they're coming out of here i'm definitely being gentle because i don't feel like anything cracking breaking or anything like that or in between boo-boos so you see how easy they're coming out but i'm just plopping them out ever so gently and now once i plop them out i'm going to put them on the cardboard that every nerd rope come with and i'm just going to place it on there and we're going to go ahead and package them so that's just what i like to do [Music] so now what we're going to do is i put them on my cardboard liners i'm going to flip them over so that the cardboard is facing up and i'm going to get the two ends of oh sorry you guys then we're going to get the two ends of the aluminum foil kind of put them together where where nestle had the glue already there so i'm just going to line them up as even as i can and we're going to heat seal them with our flat irons with my flat iron they go from like a one to a five and i believe i have them on a a two maybe a three i just want them to get hot enough so when my hand touch it my hand is not burning and i can kind of just like close it all together so heat sealing something together is really really easy you guys and that's just pretty much it you just heat seal them together and you will be all done with your diy infused nerve bros thank you guys so much for watching this video if you guys want to see any other type of infusion definitely put a comment down below and i really do appreciate you for watching this video i it means a so much so here go the little small ones that i did as well now this one i'm going to just do the same thing that i did with the longer one i'm just going to cut the nerd box so it fits this size you know what i'm saying so or you could just put them in your odorless airtight containers but you guys see how i have the little miniature one right there in front and that's pretty much all you do sorry for the noise you guys brandi and devin are outside playing tug of war with a stick yeah yeah yeah talk to you guys on my net video", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "INVzvJHc2PA": "hello everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video we are going to be making cbd oil with a crock pot but before we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support and if you all wouldn't mind please give this video a big thumbs up okay folks so you may or may not know but our farm is solely dependent on our sale of hemp flour and that's what we're going to be using today our hemp flour now if you guys are interested in cbd hemp flour to make your own cbd oil go ahead and check out the link in the description below also go ahead and check out this link up top okay so first and foremost we're going to need cbd flour to make cbd oil you will find an array of options on our website if you're purchasing from us you'll see large flour or regular flour you'll see small flowers you'll see trim and some other odds and ends on there as well but today we're going to be using regular sized hemp flour the variety that we're going to be using is biox which is our most popular flower which is my personal favorite but there's also cherry wine on there i'll sweeten it a bunch of others that are all great as well it really depends on what you're looking for um but today we're going to be using biox and that's probably our most potent flower as well and that really depends on your potency level also and the same thing goes with trim versus small flowers there's a whole bunch of different potencies if you guys have questions go ahead and email me i'll be absolutely happy to answer any and all questions that you guys have about the hemp flour okay so we're going to need some stuff to make cbd oil with a crock pot unlike using an expensive machine like the magical butter machine you're going to need some other kitchen gadgets in order to make cbd oil correctly at home with a crock pot and so first and foremost we need a carrier oil now this is obviously you use this for a magical butter machine or any other machine we're going to use mct oil today other popular carrier oils are hemp oil and olive oil i really don't like olive oil that's just my personal preference i do love mctl it's the best carrier oil of all of them but if you're looking for a little added flavor hemp oil if you can find it is really good as well but today we're going to be using mct oil and the reason why coconut oil and other oils aren't in this is well coconut oil will be solid at room temperature so that's not good for cbd oil and other ones don't have the necessary fats to be a superior carrier oil and you really need that absorption rate to be high especially for a crock pot okay obviously next you will need a crock pot um these are relatively inexpensive you can get them for like 15 online you don't need a large one uh your batches are going to be anywhere between one to two cups of oil and one to two ounces of flour so really you don't need a large crock pot a three to six quart crock pot is plenty um another thing you will need is something to decarb with now we're going to use our magical butter d card box i love it there's no point in using a pyrex dish if i have this but you can use a pyrex dish with a cover that works as well and this will be one of the first steps we do here as we make our cbd oil the next thing you definitely need is going to be a filter of some sort some people use a cheese cloth um i don't i've never used that i've always used the magical butter filters you can get this pack on their website or you can get any type of micron filter i believe it has to be 150 or more um that's just what we use uh you can go more or less probably depending on the amount of plant material that's going to go through or how many times you actually want to sift through it this package also comes with a silicone glove i really like using that too especially when we're squeezing out the oil but that's going to be later on in the video now this part isn't necessary um to use i'm going to show you how to get around this but a lot of people will use this to cut up or grind up their flower a nutribullet or a magic bullet of anything like this to cut up the flower pre-decarb but i'm going to teach you a trick today on how you can avoid that it takes a little time but there's a trick now if you buy your hem flower from us it's going to come in a package exactly like this this is a pre-packaged um one ounce pre-packaged from us and what we'll do is we're gonna throw this in the freezer for four to six hours and what that does is it makes the hemp fiber very brittle and once it's brittle you can scrunch it all up in the bag and boom you don't have to use a grinder to cut up a flower we've already done that process and here we go here is our scrunched up flower and a ziploc now you don't have to use the bag if you if you're not purchasing from us use a ziploc same exact method in there for four to six hours scrunch it up and we're good to go so we've already done this step i'm not going to time lapse it or anything like that you will need to cut it up one way or another whether it's the bullet or it's through uh freezing it so let's dive into making cb duo with your crock pot here at home and get into the next step okay folks let's get into making cbd oil with our crock pot here we have already measured out a cup of mct oil so we're going to get that in the crock pot now to get it warmed up this process doesn't take very long but this is going to be the first thing you're going to want to do is measure out your oil and get it into the crock pot we're going to put it on low and we're just going to let it sit all right we're going to move this off to the side here for a minute next thing we're going to do is we are going to use our magic butter d card box again you can use a pyrex dish as long as it has a cover or any other baking dish as long as it has a cover now what you're going to be doing is you're going to be de-carving so get your oven preheated to 250 degrees 250 all right so we're going to preheat our oven right now again 250 uh preheat and then once we put this stuff in there it's going to be going in for 30 minutes now again you're either going to this step you're going to be blending your hemp flour which i just don't like making a mess so that's really just not what i want to do but this is an option you can do that get that you take your um your shredded up flour whether you use the magic bullet or you use the freezer method like we did and you're just going to pour it in to your d carb box whether that's the pyrex or this particular box you're gonna make sure that it's nice and even you're gonna cover it and we're gonna throw it into the oven for about a half an hour once it's preheated to 250 degrees so that's what we're going to flash forward to next and then we'll start getting into making the cbd oil okay folks so let me move this out of the way here real quick all right so we have done we are done with the d-carb process again 250 degrees for 30 minutes and there is your nice fresh ground uh cbd hem flower so now we're ready to go um but before we dive into putting it into crop i want to make sure that this isn't the end-all be-all recipe so we used one cup of mct oil for one ounce of hemp flour you can use two cups you can use less flour you can use more flour it really depends on what you want but i'm going to stand by one cup per one ounce if you want to go less you know you can use 14 grams of flour per cup i really don't recommend anything less than that because i don't think you'll get a good experience with cbd i just don't think the potency will be there for you the other thing about the crock pot too it's not nearly as efficient as the magic butter machine so this is going to be a process it is going to be in the crock pot for four to eight hours really depends on when you're ready the longer it has to be in there to cook into the oil the more chance of a higher absorption rate so just remember that as well and again guys you can find all this stuff on our website or feel free to leave a comment or email me and you can find us on facebook and instagram as well if you need to get in touch with me through there okay so let's go ahead and get this going into the crock pot now remember we put this on low already the oil is already nice and warm we have our ounce of ground flour here and we're going to go ahead and dump it right into the crock pot okay so now that that's done we're just gonna move around the flower and we're going to let it cook down [Music] and that's really all we're doing now we're going to let this cook down absorb all into the oil we're gonna cover it again you can use more oil or or i wouldn't use anything less than a cup of oil but you can use more oil like two cups we're just doing a very small batch for the video but as you can see it's already starting to go right into the oil so now we're going to check it about every hour on low so we'll see in another hour and then we're going to repeat that for probably six hours for this particular batch so that is how we get started making our cbd hemp oil in a crock pot okay folks we have let this go for about eight hours i lost kind of track of time and we've been stirring about every hour and this is what it looks like right now very liquidy you know all broken down and that's what you want to look like again you got to go for the longer cook with the crock pot i know with the magic butter machine it's four hours but you're really safe with an eight hour on low cook um of course the setting is low for the crock pot so now what we're going to do is we're going to get our strainer again this is something you're going to have to purchase in order to make cbd oil and then we're going to get some gloves and we're going to slowly pour this into the strainer all right so here we go again it's a balancing act with the strainer just got to take your time get this out of the way here you're just going to let it all go into the strainer there kind of write it up a little bit now again we only did a cup of oil very small batch and what you can do now is get all the plant material in there much as you want because what you're going to do now is once it's in the strainer you can squeeze every last bit of oil out of the flour because the flour does absorb some of the oil okay now one of the things that you get with the magical butter kit uh when it comes to buying these strainers is they give you the silicone glove it's pretty important because it helps you squeeze out all the [Applause] oil all right that's about all you can have with that and then you can put it in your container whatever you desire whether it's a droplet bottle a mason jar but this is the finished product this is your cbd oil and you made it with a crock pot so that's really it for today's video guys if you have any questions feel free to comment in the video uh or you can reach us um via facebook or instagram or email if you guys are interested in the hemp flower that we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below but that is all i have for you guys today i hope you enjoyed the video hope you all stay happy healthy and i'll see you in another video", "uSBWBNl1h2A": "hey everyone welcome back to another video in this video i want to talk about four different cannabinoids that are underrated in my opinion so sit back and enjoy let's jump right in i feel like we talk a lot about cbd and thc on my channel and in life in general cbd and thc are probably the most common or most commonly talked about cannabinoids in the cannabis plant some of the cannabinoids on this list are going to be ones that are isolated and you can buy them on the market in the hemp market from cbd manufacturers etc one of these products is from a dispensary but for the most part these are all extracted from hemp so anyone can buy them even if you don't have a medical card the first one i want to talk about is delta 8 thc i did one video a while ago talking a little bit about delta 8 thc but let's talk about it again it's gaining popularity these days so what is delta 8 chc and how is it similar or different to delta 9 thc or regular thc delta 8 thc is going to be slightly different from delta 9 thc and one big thing that's different about delta 8 chc is it is federally legal so anyone can buy it over a certain age delta 8 is federally legal at this point and that's all that i have to say on the matter as far as legality goes i have some delta 8 thc here i have a tincture that was sent to me i really liked the gummies a lot better than i like the tincture honestly like wouldn't really recommend this tincture so it's delta eight hemp you probably want their gummies not their tincture in my opinion the gummies were really good so right now most anyone can buy delta 8 thc but what does it do why would you want it etc so delta 8 thc could be considered a legal way to get high because delta 8 thc can get you kind of high but it's not going to be as potent as delta 9 thc something i tried when i had some delta 8 gummies on hand was i tried delta 8 thc and delta 9 thc at the same time and whoa it was pretty crazy stronger than just thc alone i'd recommend it just don't overdo it because i can see it being too much like just unpleasant if you go too overboard with it i mean the most that i was 300 milligrams of delta 8 chc with like 50 milligrams of delta 90 hc and that was a lot honestly i was really quite medicated i was like hi like it was interesting i might do it again i kind of liked the combination of delta 8 and delta 9 thc together but you can definitely use delta 8 thc on its own of course and you can enjoy those not too high anti-paranoia high effects if you want to learn more about how delta 8 affects you go check out this subreddit i found i think it's just delta 8 is the name of the subreddit um it's a whole subreddit dedicated to this dedicated to people finding relief and joy and whatever else they're finding in delta 8 thc and there are several different manufacturers now let me know if you want a full video on delta 8 chc and brands that i've tried and we'll see what we can do over here but for now i will say i like delta 8 thc i think it's a great addition to the world i think it's lovely it does seem to get you kind of high without the paranoia i don't know how else to describe it but that's what i've read about it and that's what i've experienced with it so that's delta 8 thc moving on to cbg so one form of cbg that i've really been enjoying is cbg flower this is a hemp flower that's high in cbg as opposed to cbd or any other cannabinoid it looks kind of like cannabis but it's hemp hemp and cannabis tend to look somewhat similar depending on certain factors but there's your cbg flower i've really been enjoying this it gives me like a very mellowed out feeling kind of similar to cbd but something interesting about cbg is cbga the precursor to cbg is also the precursor to thc and cbd and so what's interesting about cbg is it decarboxylates into thc or cbd it can be called the mother cannabinoid for that reason because it breaks down into multiple different cannabinoids i wasn't able to really find any clear-cut scientific research on whether cbg actually decarboxylates while you're smoking it into thc or cbd or how that works exactly i just know that when i smoke cbg flour i feel phenomenal i feel so relaxed and like not high but very chilled out and mellow i really like it a lot i've been using the cbg as like a replacement for daytime thc because honestly i don't really love using a lot of thc during the daytime i like to use it more for night time when i'm relaxing when i'm winding down for the day you know kind of like my glass of wine at the night except not wine at all it's weed it's cannabis sorry i know a lot of people don't like the weed word but i treat thc as like my nighttime glass of wine these days or yeah that's pretty much how i treat it sometimes i'll use it during the day yes but for the most part i use it at night so my day time has been cbg i've been smoking this during the day and sometimes cbd as well flour again let me know if you want a video on cbd and cbg flour hemp flour let me know if you want videos on that but cpg has been shown to have a lot of promise when it comes to gastrointestinal issues so maybe like a cbg tincture could possibly be good for some people dealing with that but i don't really know this is not medical advice i really don't know at the end of the day so according to one article strains high in cbg will be beneficial in treating conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease crohn's disease and cancer so cpg has a lot of potential for medical reasons i have to be careful what i say because this is not medical advice moving on to our next cannabinoid okay this is one that i have not tried in isolate form yet i really want to try it because i get munchies really like a lot when i smoke thc really tends to increase my appetite like it does for many of us but what about thcv thcv is like your anti-munchie cannabinoid apparently it could be the anti-munchie cannabinoid um which i know i could use sometimes apparently it can act as an appetite suppressant so i just thought that was really cool and i wanted to add that to my list because wow i mean i'm i'm out here trying to break stigmas change minds show sides of cannabis that people haven't really thought about or seen in a while or maybe at all and isn't it just so cool that chcv does the exact opposite of what we think of weed as doing or what we think of cannabis as doing cannabis increases your appetite everyone thinks that or knows that but what about if it could suppress your appetite that is just mind-blowing just to think about separating out a cannabinoid that does one specific thing and i just think that's so cool i think i'm sorry i'm getting excited i think that cannabis research and like and all this stuff is so cool it's so exciting i'm not a scientist so i can't take any credit for any of like the monumental leaps and bounds of research that are being done right now but i can say i think it's really damn cool okay i think thcv is awesome i haven't tried it yet though so that's another thing i need to be careful what i say because i haven't [ __ ] tried it and i'm saying i love it so uh calm down i need to anyway this is all just food for thought really i really wanted to just bring up a few different cannabinoids that maybe you can go and do your own research on but yeah for what it's worth i've oh [ __ ] i forgot one i haven't done the last one one more cannabinoid and this is one that i have tried cbn so cbn so if you are a florida medical patient you can get cbn at true leave in capsule form but if you're not a medical patient you can also get it as a hemp derived cannabinoid that you can buy online it's just kind of expensive that way so anyway i have been trying these capsules which are cbn and i've been using them in conjunction with thc because i did some research on this and one article that i found from dr emily erlenbach she wrote for leafly about cbn basically in her words she said cbn doesn't necessarily make you sleepy on its own but cbn used with thc can enhance the euphoric effects of thc and can and just basically can enhance the effects of thc in general so cbn is almost like a thc booster in a way which i think is very interesting cbn is found in older cannabis because cbn is what happens when thc oxidizes so cbn is like found often in older cannabis and it's also found in this form here obviously but yeah this article says while cbn may not be sedating on its own you may be able to take advantage of its synergistic effects with thc to get the sleep inducing effects you are looking for and i have been using this again mostly at night so cbn i've been taking at night or just before i take my thc before i start smoking thc but i have been saving these mostly for night time i made like a few notes about this i remember them saying that the thc effects were strengthened by the cbn so that's my experience my experience is that cbn does help to enhance the effects of thc so if you're out here looking for something that's going to give you that boost and you're already using thc perhaps cbn might be something that helps you maybe because it can enhance some of the effects of thc according to that article so again i hope you enjoyed this this is all food for thought i really want you to take this information and do more research because there's a lot more you can read out there there's articles there's studies there is a lot of research being done in the field of cannabis and hemp and there are also lots of products popping up across the market everywhere so it's kind of helpful i think to know what some of this stuff is hopefully hopefully this has helped someone out there learn something about some cannabinoid i don't know which one but i hope something in this video helped you i just wanted to start a conversation about cannabinoids so here we go that's it that's the cannabinoid conversation so far but it doesn't stop there because you can leave a comment and i plan to read your comments so leave a comment if you feel so inclined and i'll see you next time thanks for watching i'll catch you next time i hope to see you in my next video so subscribe for notifications if youtube decides to send notifications alright bye", "GRriQ4OysuE": "that cannabis lovers beyond the Vespa smoking the best buds and today my buddy is Daisy and for this special weed Wednesday we're talking which i think is an important subject yep so I decided to bring my favorite top school on the show and Daisy brought her Oh taco as well yeah what she made yeah yeah so for people who don't know topicals articles are cannabis infused creams lotions balms gels you know that bath salts that softens are you put it on your where you have the most pain so are this inflammation directly on that and headaches as well totally I have heard that topicals have helped with eczema yeah psoriasis and with anecdotal evidence from so many people thousands of people who can prove that this is actually a treatment that works for them and what's really cool though topicals is that you get that therapeutic cannabis relief without that cerebral hive non-intoxicating and so is generally teach seeing them yeah you know you don't get that like you'll get stone from getting its down exactly just let direct area that you put that topic along how it works is that the cannabinoids and turbines right on the surface your skin penetrates and it does bind to see bt receptors but it doesn't go into your bloodstream which i think is like what a lot of people are looking for in the middle of the day at work you know if you have a desk job yeah if you have adjust your neck kinko then in front of computer like this on it yeah just around all the time so like that it's yeah it's really lovely daisy has had lots of experience talk tool she actually has some fibromyalgia and it really does but we were talking about this earlier from and you're saying like the nine points that you get hit with and even like under the knee just left yeah so issue yeah so far grow I would say like probably eighty percent of my life is spent in some form of pain some days is really bad whatever yeah but chuckles that cannabis in general like really help with all of that right that's a great way to get some relief and I like about what topicals - thanks about I said 30 to 45 minutes to kick in Chris depending on what's in your topical as well so many different variations you can get so many different benefit like even these two are like me different like different ways of infusing the cannabis into them right so there's so many different ways that you know like maybe an olive oil is gonna get down deeper and also I know that like terpenes and stuff that are in those will actually help them penetrate deeper yeah yeah area filena you can find carry off I'll intervene and black pepper and cinnamon and terpenes really mesh well with the can her cannabinoids - entourage effect you really get that synergistic effect today I wanted to show off the one that I use I actually got this from the headquarters here in Victoria BC the ingredients in this is coconut oil peppermint spearmint leaf cloves which clothes are found in human dr. bean and that's an anti-inflammatory turkey yeah as well as the black pepper eukaryote filing that one's anti-inflammatory as well as an anti analgesic red seaweed in this wintergreen oil honey bees wax now I really like this one is every the peppermint and spearmint in it that cooling effect so if I want like a gnarly hike worked out really hard that day it's like that's exactly what you need a cold one see what other people talk opposed to is they're like you know they can be used for any purpose like we said they can be used like a casual height like the bengay or something yeah they can be used for like really serious like you know like series migraine pain yeah headaches okay you can actually just rub him directly where you're feeling pain that's where it's gonna penetrate and really I mean like I said I always have mine on me so it's like a co-worker's a thing complains but a headaches and I'm like no try some of this I do not have a deal yeah but but ya know people love it like people are always just amazed yeah people have that idea that you have to smoke or eat we to get that benefit of the pain relievers that yeah you have to kind of get that psychoactive high yeah thing is people you don't and I think that's like what a lot of people are looking for so if I personally like the psychoactive cerebral I yea recommended if you're not looking for that high but yeah tell me a bit about the one that you have here yeah all right this is from big temples actually sorry BC as well the super grade I used to work there on infection made this batch a little bit ago and yeah there's all kinds of stuff in this instead of the more typical way of infusing it we used cannabis leaf oil so it's like olive oil infused with cannabis which is cool that's got some vitamin E it's as mucolytics the eucalyptus also kind of has that cooling effect then you're gonna get peppermint and stuff like that it does have a little bit of peppermint wintergreen as well some lavender some cinnamon which as you said that and inflammatory Antion is what it's all about boom it is I think it uh when I found this out I just my mind was blown it's pretty actually I was little little terpene in it and that was like the calming more like you Florrick effect to it really strong instantly I smell cinnamon yeah the cinnamon is over that's what I smell yeah [Music] yeah and so like there is my bulletin to you but it's actually actually people at this that gives like cool that's cool I love that we brought two different ones kind of show people that there's something out there for everybody and like I said you don't gotta just get like the lotions or gels yeah bombs my friend sports the bomb around ya the bombs are really good too you know able to dry lips yeah anything like that it's kind of dry in here someone never tried any with olive oil let me try some like lotus flower it just has some lotus flower it smells so good here I'll put the lid back on but let me go on take them dude we have a lot of pain central kind of around this back of the neck area a little bit yeah awesome broken bones brains menstrual cramp oh yeah very good for mr. right is pain as well yeah this really yeah touches babes with all that direct pain [Music] and you found some anecdotal reports here we are crew yes and we both ground on two different types of tacos yes coconut oil bees yeah coconut oil pretty different textures as well but pretty much do anything yeah and we're gonna make one super lavender actually made a bunch of lovely stuff last year at some point and oh yeah oh yeah hmmm Ireland I wonder if every minute I pick out just recycling like tingly effect okay reminds me tiger balm no we've done but are you yeah I actually have my tiger balm ultra and I will mix it in some lines see with these topical is just to give that like extra spice you don't really cares a lot of people don't like that piercing of cool yeah somewhere everybody yeah yeah but my tiger balm ultra you can make your own that's the exciting part yeah of course you can buy some from this stores and stuff but don't be sure to go online I've seen and read a lot of amazing recipes and it's always gonna be natural and medicinal healthy for your body and things all Avoyelles lavender exactly really take it yeah just like they have yes up before you try your own just like our beautiful Daisy has and it like it's pretty [ __ ] up honestly once you get the basics down you can toss anything you want in it of course yeah but yeah anything you want you want like a jalapeno and I have jalapenos in there get some spray yeah actually like the cooling exactly you can I would like to know what kind of infused tacos you guys have done is there anything that you would recommend you think it's like it weird spice or weird ingredient that really you thought helped and more people should know let us know we're open to more ideas here yeah yeah a lot of

even here look the different colors they're little squares they're not the little sour patch figures and I got about like 10 of them so they smell like candy I do smell a little bit different in

they didn't do anything for 15 bucks I bought these at a dispensary in Compton and yeah these are not worth it at all guys definitely 15 bucks down the drain but you know you pay for what you get or

an interesting door that we're opening i guess so with cannabis growing there's something new coming out almost every day it seems like today i'm going to be discussing something that is almost brand new to the cannabis market i don't even think there is any products that currently have this that are available yet you guys want to know what it is stick around and i'm going to be going into it right now [Music] [Music] me [Music] what's going on everybody my name is inya welcome or welcome back every week i go beyond the bud talking about all things cannabis this week i'm talking about delta 10 thc yes i am talking about another thc compound if you've watched any of my other videos and i've discussed what delta eight th she is delta 90 she and now i'm going to talk to you guys about what delta 10 th she is it's so new that i literally just found out about this and as soon as i heard about it i was like i have to make a video and i gotta tell you guys so for the first and most obvious question what is delta 10 thc delta 10 is one of hundreds of compounds found within hemp and cannabis think about delta 10 dhg it only appears in such trace amounts cannot be extracted naturally though it is a artificial cannabinoid because it's found in such small amounts even some labs have even had trouble identifying it they've misidentified it as cbdc or cbl i believe it is important to note that because this is such a new cannabinoid or compound to the industry there is still so much research that needs to be done on it delta 10 thc likely interacts with our endocannabinoid system much like delta 9 thc and delta 10 thc according to david from private label hemp lab delta 10 can absolutely get you high delta 10 has a lot lower psychotropic potency it's kind of more like delta eight in that sense but it's going to be different than delta eight david from private label hemp lab describes it as delta 8 thc being more of an indica type of high where delta 10 thc is more of actually a sativa type of high which i found that really interesting because i did not know that previously the effects that delta 10 thc may offer this could be different for everybody there is no products yet out there really for me to try so i don't know this is just going based off some articles that i read but once i get my hands on some products i definitely will come back and do a full review on that but the effects that delta 10 thc may offer increased euphoria and focus without having the negative side effects like paranoia and anxiety another important fact to mention when you are going to be looking for any type of cannabis products whether that be hemp cbd also 8 delta 9 delta 10 always look for a coa or certificate of analysis just to make sure that everything has been tested because these things are so new it is really important to know what's going into your body delta refers to the double bond so delta nine thc is gonna fall on the ninth carbon delta eight is gonna fall on the eighth carbon and delta ten is gonna fall on the tenth carbon chain what does the future of delta 10 thc look like i mean if you have been following along with delta 8 thc then you know that it's completely blown up within really a matter of months i feel like the thing with cbd cbd blew up and it's just been on the rise i think the same thing is going to happen with delta 10 it is such a new thing and i think that it's going to be more available it's going to be legal so more people are going to have access to it it does get you high it does have some benefits so i do think it's gonna grow super super quickly it's i mean i predict it's just gonna take off like crazy once products get released there are a few brands and companies that are currently in the process of producing delta 10 products and they should be available in the upcoming weeks so i'm super excited to hopefully get my hands on some products to come back and do a review for you guys products that you can expect to hit the market are going to be very similar to delta 8 and delta 19 thc products you will probably be able to find edibles vapes being disposable or just a regular vape pictures and syringes shatters concentrates and then you may even be able to find some type of flower but the flower is going to be sprayed with delta 28 shape that's something that's really interesting because this is so new and this is an artificial cannabinoid it's just an interesting door that we're opening i guess so we are the guinea pigs of this new cannabis world and lastly who is delta 10 thc gonna be made for like i said because i'm trying it i don't know exactly what the effects are what to expect but i do believe it's going to be really beneficial for people that live in states where you can't legally buy delta 9 thc maybe cbd isn't enough this is going to be something that's really beneficial because it's going to be able to take the edge off when cbd can't they are technically legal and making it in compliance with federal regulations another thc compound how crazy you guys super exciting though hope you guys enjoyed this video ask me all the questions let me know when if you guys have tried delta 10 products once i get my hands on some i'm gonna come back and make a video so stay tuned for that make sure to subscribe give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed and turn on the little bell if you guys don't want to miss any of my upcoming videos have a great rest of your week guys [Music] is", "kHDc_1VjFI8": "what's good it's your boy breadwinner ai

it and i was talking to like my neighbors about this and basically they were like you know 500 milligrams is a lot you only need to eat a couple of them but i think for the video it's probably best i eat all of them you feel me because with the with the uh walk lean video people wanted to see me drink more and people wanted to see me um you know like the aftermath like oh my god how much did you drink how much did you eat so uh yeah we're gonna check it out i took the top off and just looking at them they definitely look like normal gushers so uh let's check them out am i scared no i'm not really scared i'm excited a little bit let's see if i can take them all okay here's what they all look like out the pack so i guess let's just start eating them i'll do one out of time actually it tastes like real gushers like i was expecting it to be like a candy that just looked like it but it's definitely real and uh i think instead of playing with it let's just fast forward are all of them if you're interested in getting these you can get them in california or there's certain sites where you can order so i will say they taste super good they definitely taste like gushers can you taste the weed yeah a little bit but it's not like it's going to overpower it and make you not like it so i definitely recommend them definitely check them out and i just ate the whole pack like that so i'm about to go run some errands and uh i'll take the camera with me and stuff and then i'll give you like an update in about 30 minutes if um if i'm like feeling it or if it kicks in heavy or anything like that i've had friends who've had them let me say that they weren't good and they was i guess feeling them or whatever so i'll definitely let you know on the scale like one to ten how hard it works but a lot of edibles i've tried in the past they're kind of like i don't know if i really feel anymore if my mind is just telling me i feel them so yeah my tolerance is pretty high so we'll definitely see stay tuned i'll give you the update but there you have it the sour infused gushers the weed gushers 10 out of 10 on the taste um how the package looks and all that stuff i actually put mine in the refrigerator just to keep them like from milton stuff but i wouldn't say there's nothing bad about taste wise on it and yeah it contains marijuana so keep it away from children but you

20 minute mark definitely recommend it okay i'm back and this is gonna be to wrap it up with the uh sour infused gushers i'll give them a seven out of ten on like you know the scale of feeling it and

cbd moon rocks they cost an arm and a leg bro i'm talking like this much for like i don't even want to discuss what they cost but here's the deal dm blair has his own line of products now i'm sure you guys know that by now i've been posting on instagram on my facebook my facebook group any and everywhere i can tell you that the bho is hot bro the bho is hot it's selling like crazy i blew through two rounds of lifter and a round of electra i got some electra left probably about i don't know eight grams i'm gonna do another run of bho real soon some more electra for sure um i got i got plenty of biomass i got plenty of everything okay um making it over here okay but i'm gonna try my hand at making some moon rocks and if these turn out good i'm gonna bring you all with me we're gonna learn together these turn out awesome i'm gonna have some labels made i'm gonna buy some containers and i'm gonna make you [ __ ] happy because i'm gonna make some moon rocks if this turns out all right and y'all y'all gonna love them y'all gonna love them so what i did was i went out and i got a shaker i don't know if what you all know what this is i'm gonna do a review of this later but it's part of this here so i'm gonna give you a sneak peek at this okay so basically oh that's on there tight okay so you grind up your junk you put it in there it's about just about a half ounce of electra i ground it up real fine put it in there right and then you and then it comes out the bottom fills up the bottom with that right there that's keif okay so here's the main ingredients of this little experiment and if this works out we're gonna we're gonna manufacture some y'all gonna y'all gonna love me so what i got i got some choice picks of electra flower here okay i'm we'll put them out here on this little this little spot here all right some electric nuglets some chunky flowers okay and then i got some electro bho i blasted myself right there it is this is one of the last like eight grams telling you this stuff this stuff is going fast i am getting calls left and right forward back up and down my phone's ringing off the hook guys you don't want to miss out on this if you want some of this you gotta get a hold of me okay so here it is there we go delicious looking stuff okay so main ingredients you're gonna need to be able to get your keef so we got the keefe you obviously need your your flowers you got the flowers okay we got the bho the honey oil that's what we call we just caught some honey oil because it's delicious and i got one of these little handy dandy little [ __ ] right here i made check this out now i don't want to get all sticky and oogy if i if i find i want to make like a thousand of these because i got a whole bag of flowers so i got me a little dowel rod and a little thingamajig here i don't know what you call this a flugel binder a widget of some sort i guess i guess it's to hook like wires together or something i don't know but what we're going to do is we're going to take this flower here and we're going to hold that little sun [ __ ] just like that just like that so i don't get all shaky see and then we're gonna take this tool and we're gonna scoop up this oil like this see it on there and we're just going to begin to paint this flower like this we're just going to cover this flower and lovely stuff okay paint it with this now you gotta make sure you get a well-trimmed flower because anything shaggy or straggly is probably not gonna work out too swell but we're just gonna smear this all over this flower just like this um excuse me guys hmm okay so now we got all but the underside covered so now we're just going to take our keep here you know what let's just let's just dab it hill with it well that's looking pretty much like a moon rock to me well now that i've made one i'm beginning to understand why they're so expensive i probably got four grams keith here and i got a gram of bho and probably a three-quarter of a gram flour so one of these right now i just made this is probably worth 70 bucks really i mean that's a bit steep that is a bit steep now granted companies that make this stuff they make this stuff on on a larger scale you know what i'm saying guys on a much larger scale and they probably do it at pennies on the dollar because they can afford to blast large amounts of bho and they can get really cheap flowers i mean i i can say i get biomass so i mean i get a hefty deal but it's not you know it's not like i'm breaking any records of my purchases here but as you can see that's a pretty nice moon rock right there i mean uh that looks like a moon rock to me i mean that's pretty sweet it looks pretty tasty too so i would say mission accomplished but i don't know man if you're a bigger company and you make moon rocks like say you're with uh tweedle farms or mystic roots or somebody and you got the 4-1-1 on how to make this affordable for a guy starting out hit me up with my phone number it'll be in the it'll be in the description but there you go guys there you have it my tutorial on how to make moon rocks i got i got a handful here yet that imma make um i think what i'll do is i'll probably uh pause this and uh yeah you know what let's just send it here i mean why do you gotta watch me make like six more here it is it's a moon rock but now you know what goes into making it and how to make it easier i mean you can see i got nothing on me i fiddled with bho bho flowers uh keef and uh i'm pretty much clean so i thought this through pretty well before i started making a video because i wanted to make sure that i showed you guys if i was going to educate you on how to do it how to do it really well and not make much of a mess because most people you know we're medicating at home i mean your your dining room table your kitchen table your kitchen counter you don't want [ __ ] everywhere you know you don't want to have to be because i mean the only thing that gets out rosin is spit i mean what do you want to go through all that for you just get some wax paper make yourself a little handy-dandy little widget here to hold this flower in place and just bounce with it you know now i'm not trying to take business away from tweedle farms or any companies that make things okay but if you're around your house and you got some bho and you got some keefe and you got some premium flowers now you gotta remember this electric flower electro bho and electric keef because i got a ton of electro flour in fact there's like four more pounds over there you can't even see all completely 100 legal hemp per the 2018 farm bill so don't even think about busting dm blair because my herbs are legal that's a disclaimer for the doo guys but if you have this around your house i digress if you have this stuff around your house you know my mom always said why go to the why go to the restaurant up the road for an omelette when i got eggs ham and cheese right here i can make you an omelet for free makes sense to me so and and you know and you feel more accomplished i feel i feel like i accomplished something here i mean i would really like to make these and sell them that was another point of this video the description down below or not the description i'm sorry the the comments the comments let me know if you think this is practical and if you'd be interested in buying some if i uh if i went to all that i mean i can just stick with the products i got but it seems like the hot thing now this mean i'm not like trying to ride on nobody's coattails or or steal their thunder but i'm in the business of making medication for people and i'm in the business of helping people get well and this seems to be working for a lot of people so why the hell not so to recap before i bounce get your shaker this is a cheap one i got this at uh excitement video smoke shop in new york pennsylvania completely legal i bought it in a store over the counter guys it's not paraphernalia like nine bucks i got my bho i made myself right there some premium flour and the keef down here right there now you can see how much i used i used a good bit so excuse me so until next time guys be safe be well be kind thank you for coming along and learning with me um i hope this helped i hope this helped cut the curve a little and show everybody that you know you can do it all

"0S9U37dTubc": "hey everyone so if you know anything about DC or just you know the cannabis life there you know that Sunny Patch was popular for a while and so things started to get a little weird my really really reliable pop-up shop lady stopped carrying these because she said they stopped putting actual cannabis inside of these edibles and you know at first when I would get these from this woman they provided the best experience a very powerful you know it was a very powerful high and the best part is like you know you didn't have to smoke weed because you could just pick these really yummy sour candies but when I made my first videos on stony patch a lot of people were telling me oh no this stuff isn't real this stuff is you know hogwash this stuff is fake and I was like I don't know what you're talking about the first several times that I got sunny patch packages it was like the best thing I've ever experienced and oh just a heads up cannabis is completely legal in Washington DC DC if you know anything about DC you know that there are no legal issues with consuming consuming cannabis okay alright so with that said now that we know so knee patch is unreliable altogether there is no centralized provider for stony patch I just want to talk about some alternatives so I know a lot of people are not in the DC area but if you're in a DC area and you want kind of reliable edibles then you know what I think a good alternative would be this this is Capital confections - came in here yeah yeah - came inside and the gummies are in the shape of puzzle pieces and I'll just take these out these are really good as well so it looks like this gummy and the gummy is sugarcoating oh it's hard okay so it smells sour and really kind of a sieve and the directions on the back I'm gonna read them for you they say nibble half of one gummy and wait one hour before consuming more I think that's a good idea cuz this is this also tends to be really strong I don't know if these particular gummies these gummy edibles are as strong as the first time I tried the good stony patch ones but a lot of people here on my channel had been telling me that when they try a sunny patch nothing happens it's fake like just nothing is happening so with that said in the fact that the supplier lady stopped carrying these all together I think it's safe to say that for a lot of people who Sony patch was like a scam but I promise for me the first time I tried sunny patch it was not a scam and the reason why I'm like making this video is because I finally got confirmation from the lady that introduced me to this edible that yeah this is a no-go now okay so this is why I am suggesting maybe if you are in DC try this and hopefully you'll get a better experience with this one okay so if you have any more questions you can let me know um [Music] these tastes really good and I like them and yeah they'll do but I really did like the stony fresh ones as well and I'm sad that they're kind of fake so yeah see you guys later bye [Music]", "Ymw4TTchKNk": "[Music] there's a lot of information on the internet about CBD but what is fact and what is myth here are the top six myths about CBD myth 1 CBD will get you high false the psychoactive properties in cannabis come from THC not CBD CBD is not psychoactive and will not get you high with tested and purified CBD you won't fail a drug test for work myth 2 full spectrum and isolate CBD are the same false isolate CBD and full spectrum are not the same CBD isolate has been removed from hundreds of other cannabinoids found in him full spectrum CBD includes many other compounds from the hemp plant these compounds work together synergistically resulting in increased efficacy and bioavailability than CBD isolate myth 3 synthetic CBD and hemp derived CBD are equally effective false synthetic CBD only mimics CBD but doesn't account for all the other plant compounds this makes it similar to an isolated CBD pharmaceutical synthetic full-spectrum CBD does not exist myth for him to arrive CBD isn't as good as marijuana derived CBD false CBD from hemp and cannabis plans are the same CBD is CBD no matter its source him naturally has less THC than marijuana making it a safer choice for CBD oil extraction myth 5 CBD is the same as medical marijuana false there are two types of CBD hemp derived CBD and cannabis derived CBD hemp and cannabis are different varieties of the same plant species hemp derived CBD is not cannabis in most states hemp derived CBD is available without a prescription myth 6 CBD is only safe for adults false many children safely take CBD regularly however like anything CBD may not be suitable for all children do thorough research and consult a physician to decide what's right

and while we're at it i'm going to tell you about cannabinoids which determine the intensity and it determines the physical sensations you're going to feel in your body and i'm going to tell you about terpenes which determine the smell and stinkiness of the flower so when you go shopping for flour online you're going to be able to find the best stinkiest flower that just really smacks so without rambling too much i'm gonna get right into it my name's chris with cbd extract.co i've been in the cannabis industry for 10 years and hemp specifically for three years and what i can tell you from my experience is that the words hemp marijuana and cannabis all mean the same thing technically but thanks to our good old buddy donald trump he now made federal legal definitions for these terms for example marijuana is defined as any cannabis product that has more than 0.3 percent delta 9 thc now we're not talking about thca we're not talking about delta 8 thc and we're not talking about any other form of thc we're only talking about delta nine so if it's above that threshold it's marijuana so and that's really weird because on a federal level that's a controlled substance it's a schedule one controlled substance so it's up there with meth heroin crack cocaine whatever those drugs are i don't know specifically because i don't do those drugs but what i do know is that it's in the same category which is totally bogus and messed up but what's crazy is that hemp is defined as less than 0.3 delta 9 thc so what that means is that all the other cannabinoids like cbg cbn thca delta athc these are all compounds that have free reign to be bought sold and shipped over state borders on a federal level it's completely legal and usps will actually ship this no problem they will not confiscate your product as long as it has a lab test in the package now what this means for you is you can literally go on google right now you can go on google right now and type in hempflower or delta8thc or cbg and you can literally buy products that look like marijuana but are completely legal to be bought and shipped to your house that is literally crazy that's insane so and as a matter of fact if you want to get your hands on some indoor flour you can get an eighth totally for free at cbdxrack.co we actually give a free eighth of our greenhouse or indoor grown flower completely for free all you got to do is hit the link below so definitely check that out um it you got nothing to lose it's totally free we covered the pot all you got to do is cover the postage but anyways to figure out if the product is legal or not so it's actually safe to be shipped because keep in mind marijuana is illegal to be shipped over state borders you don't want to send marijuana over the border or buy it accidentally online and then you get caught and get in trouble so what you need to do is look at the lab test and so i'm going to pop this up on the screen right now but if you look at the lab test you'll see the triangle 9 thc as long as that percentage right there is less than 0.3 you're in the clear and it's considered hemp um if it's over obviously it's marijuana that's considered hot hot hemp as they call it and completely illegal unless you live in a recreational state so um and keep in mind like i said total thc doesn't matter on a federal level um the thca doesn't matter delta a thc cbg cbn none of that matters only the delta nine so keep that in mind i know i'm like a broken record at this point with the delta nine stuff but that's literally just how it works um so if you want to find the best quality this is the we need to look at because we're already looking at the lab test i might as well teach you how to get the best quality hemp flower there's a lot of people there's a lot of crappy dirty ditch wheat out there but basically if you look at the lab test you'll see the total cannabinoid percentage cannabinoid cannabinoid i don't know everyone says it different but basically the higher that percentage is the more you're going to feel so for example if you have a high cbd flower it's going to be relaxing if you have a high cbg flower it's going to be more stimulating because cbg is considered a non-psychoactive stimulant some people react to it differently they don't know too much about it but obviously each cannabinoid has a different effect cbn it's actually slightly psychoactive and it um makes you sleepy all right and then obviously if you have a high thca product when you smoke that thca it turns into delta 9 thc so obviously it gets you high same thing with delta 8 thc okay so basically you can buy these products online okay so if you want to get the products that really smack because a lot of people say oh hemp flour kind of sucks like it doesn't really make me feel like anything you need to get a higher percentage flower okay it's really that simple it works just like the medical industry with marijuana the higher the percentage the more you're going to feel and like i said you have different ratios of the cannabinoids the the percentages of them the next thing you want to look at in terms of the smell is going to be the terpenes now the terpenes are essentially the oils found in the bud that give it that pungent smell so if you're smelling pine you're smelling skunk you're smelling weird marijuana smells or whatever you know it just smells like weed in general that's a result of the terpenes and these terpenes actually indicate whether or not it's indica or sativa so for example uh limonene is considered a sativa uh terpene and mercine is considered a indica so if you look at the lab test you can see which terpenes are dominant that actually determines what effects are going to feel because these terpenes actually indicate um how you're gonna feel right they bind to your receptors in the same way that cannabinoids do so it's really crazy and one more thing to look out for when you're shopping for hemp flour online is don't just go off the pictures because you're gonna see these big dank beautiful buds you're gonna see like all these reviews and stuff but you might get it in the mail if you're going at it blindly and you'll be like man these buds are like dull smelling they don't really do anything they kind of smoke it i got a throat itch and a headache you don't want that so always look at the lab test right because the lab test is like your safeguard to make sure you're getting quality product you don't want to be wasting your money you don't want to smoke dirty ditchweed and also you want to see on the lab test if there's panel testing for pesticides because who knows maybe they're selling pesticide hemp flour you need to protect yourself so always look at the lab test and that's pretty much it so hemp flour yeah it actually can get you high if you buy a certain type of product just have in general you can get high if you buy a certain type of product but really guys it's just so simple if you want to feel good look at the lab test check the cannabinoids and the terpenes and you're going to get good product so that's pretty much it i hope you

certified nutrition consultant with foods that heal you and I'm going to talk about CBD hemp oil and how it might be able to help you with your arthritis pain there are a couple different types of arthritis there's osteoarthritis which is the deterioration of the joints and then there is rheumatoid arthritis which is an autoimmune disease so CBD hemp oil can help reduce inflammation in the body to help reduce pain from arthritis and I'll go through a couple different suggestions or types of CBD oil that might help you address the arthritis that you're suffering from but a couple other things to note is that CBD oil there is more evidence now that it might actually help stop or slow the progression of autoimmune disease because autoimmune disease starts in the gut with the leaky gut so there's a lot more going on with autoimmune disease but the CBD oil is a great supplement and a great place to start you'll want to do other things like probiotics and there's just a lot of other things you want to do and you can always schedule consult with me if you'd like help with further addressing that but then osteoarthritis is the deterioration of the joints so that's going to have a different route and you'll want to address the pain of course again which is helping reduce the inflammation but CBD oil is also shown to promote bone growth now I'm not saying is gonna regenerate your joint or anything but anything that's gonna help promote strength and bone growth like collagen protein powder is really excellent or bone broth is even better but homemade bone broth that's really great for both autoimmune and for joints so alright so moving forward here the different types of CBD oil that I would recommend for arthritis you it depends first of all on the level of your pain but if you have rheumatoid arthritis oh I will I guess or osteoarthritis the full spectrum is probably going to be a great choice or best choice for both of those the full spectrum would be like the pure oil concentrates I've got the gold here the green or the blue would both be really great choices as well they're full spectrum the Tacey drops our full spectrum they might not be quite as concentrated or strong but they're still full spectrum and the reason I I'm in full spectrum is gonna have all the plant properties and compounds which promotes healing so if you buy if you're looking for something that's just gonna strictly reduce inflammation and you're not concerned about any other yield potential healing properties then you could always try the vapeshot it's fast-acting I really like this I personally use this for helping with daytime just to calm me down if I'm having a tough day or stress this is not full spectrum but it's extremely effective against inflammation so all of them are gonna be great for inflammation it really depends on what you're looking for again I like four different things like autoimmune disease I like the full spectrum and then another thing you can do is we have a topical muscle salve right here AB annoyed that's also on my website which I forgot to tell you the link to my website will be below this video and but anyway this salve and I've been using it for an old egg ankle injury as you can see it's a real it's in Nice check texture I really like this but you can just use that for localized pain for example I have people with arthritis in their hands or their knees it works really great it's working great for my ankle it can work really great for local pain or even skin conditions but that I would recommend in addition to the gold the pure oil concentrate or the vape or whatever you choose internally is the best way to address inflammation but like with my ankle I noticed that the internal wasn't quite cutting it for my ankle you know the problems I was having with some aching and stuff where is the salve it was a direct topical solution that has just kind like icing on the cake in my opinion I wouldn't personally use just the SAP I would start if you're on a budget I would start with one of the it oral solutions of the CBD hemp oil and then but if you can afford it I would absolutely recommend adding on the topical safe and there might be some situations if you only have for example some arthritis in your hands which a lot of people do actually then the topical solution might be enough for you it's really up to you it's experimental because everyone's different on what works best for them how much they need I'm just trying to educate you to help you make the best decision for yourself and then also I have articles if you can follow us in my community on Facebook and ask questions on there learn more on there you can subscribe to my youtube channel I really want to help educate people on the health benefit and how CBD hemp oil can really help reduce inflammation and help you live a more pain-free life so thank you for watching this video and I'll see you in the next one", "RybfqE03gmI": "Sometimes our digestive system can stand in\nour way. Now, what I mean by that is, when you take\nsome kind of oral supplement or an oral compound, you have a level of degradation that occurs\nsimply because your digestive system breaks things down. Now, does that mean that it's bad? No, absolutely not. Does it mean that oral compounds don't work? Absolutely not. That is not what I'm saying, but what I am\ntrying to allude to is the fact that if you have a specific area where you're trying to\nget some relief, let's say in the way of maybe some stiffness or anything like that, well,\nCBD can work in a transdermal topical form, and because it ends up skipping that oral\ndegradation and that gut biome degradation, you might have a better chance of relief at\nthat given area. You see, a lot of the pain in our body can\nbe indirectly or directly triggered by what is called inflammation. Now, one of the unique properties of CBD is\nthat it helps promote the healthy modulation of inflammation within the body. So, what that means is that it works upon\ninflammatory cytokines, things that would normally trigger inflammation, and a lot of\ntimes you'll have these inflammatory cytokines or have inflammation at a localized source. So, in essence, if you use some kind of topical,\nit makes it so you could potentially directly affect that inflammation at that very spot. You see, one of the major roles of CBD is\nthat it slows the cytokine production of immune cells. So, when you take it orally, you're working\nat a systemic level, but when you take it topically, you're working at the very topical\nlevel, although you do have some effect that still trickles down to the system overall. Now, additionally, CBD is unique because it\nactivates what is called the TRPV receptor. Okay. This TRPV1 receptor is also known as a vanilloid\nreceptor, and it controls a cell signaling protein, if you will. So, it controls this mechanism from the top\ndown, as far as inflammation is concerned, which is pretty neat. So, when you're looking, again, at the modulation\nof inflammation within the body, this could be a really cool way to target some of your\njoint pain, maybe some of your stiffness, things like that. Now, let's jump over really quick to a study. Okay, this interesting study was done on rats. Now, I know what you're thinking. Because it's done on rats, it's not applicable\nto humans. Well, no, it still is applicable. We could still take the common knowledge and\nthe common denominator from this study and apply it over to humans. So, this study took a look at rats that had\narthritis. So, they induced arthritis in their specific\nareas of their body, in their joints. Okay? Then they applied four days of 6.2 milligrams\nof CBD topical. Okay? It was really interesting what they found\nout, okay. They found that it significantly reduced the\njoint inflammation. So, what they found is that the joints, on\naverage, went from 72 millimeters all the way down to 65.6, in just a four-day span. Now, millimeters, we're talking small little\nrat joints here. So, that's a lot. So what they're finding is that the inflammation\nthat comes in from arthritis could be modulated by the CBD in this particular case. So, we translate that over to how it could\nwork for someone's given ailment as a human. You can see that there's a lot of potential\nbenefits. Pretty wild stuff. Now, the cool thing is, is that you don't\njust have CBD coming into the equation when you look at Octagon Biolabs. Okay, there's beeswax in the mix, okay, and\nbeeswax draws moisture into the skin, which is really interesting. So, it makes it so not only the skin is healthier,\nbut it makes it so that you're going to be able to hold in the compound a little bit\nbetter, as well. Additionally, MCT oil, which is going to make\nit so that there's a little bit more of a moisturizing effect, but also lavender oil,\nso there's a calming effect, and lastly, eucalyptus oil, which has a unique property when it comes\ndown to being antibacterial, but also being calming and potentially anti-inflammatory\nas well. So, when it comes down to utilizing CBD for\na specific thing within the body, a topical CBD might just be the solution for you. So, there are a lot of ways that CBD can affect\ndifferent things within the body from an anti-inflammatory standpoint, acting upon endocannabinoid receptors\nlike CB1 and CB2. But when it comes down to brass tacks, being\nable to directly impact where your pain points are, or directly impact where you're having\nsome bothersome issues, that might just be the quickest line from point A to point B.\nSo, as always, make sure you're keeping it locked in here with Octagon Biolabs.

I have been involved in\nthe cannabis industries since about 2007. There has always been\nabout smoking the stuff and getting high. However there's a whole\ndifferent side to cannabis and that's the medicinal side. I never really believed in it until when my mum started to take CBD oil. She has arthritis-like symptoms. Let's talk to mum herself. Please welcome my mum. Hey mum, thank you for being here with us. We wanted to ask you a few\nquestions about your CBD oil. - Hello, yes, we can do that. - Okay, why are you using it? - Because day in and day\nout I was in terrible pain and couldn't get relief from pain pills. The pain was always there. And of course, that burdened me a lot. - What kind of pain was it? - It's a pain in the joints. The whole body was stiff. My ability to move became worse and worse and I was getting desperate. - And in the past you used\npainkillers I believe? - Yes I used painkillers, one in the morning and one in the evening. And I've been using a\nrheumatism medication. - And then you started using\nCBD oil and what happened then? - I take one drop in the morning\nand it lasts the whole day, and I'm much more flexible. Everything is much easier,\nmuch more pleasant. And in the evening I take two drops, which makes the night\ncalm and I can sleep well. - Okay and we also wanna\nsay that you work in H Care and you work a lot with doctors and pharmaceutical medicines. You know a little bit\nabout this stuff, right? - Yes I think I know my way around. I just sat over everything\nand took the drops. I have now reported to the doctors that I'm taking these drops, and the reaction is zero. I have a feeling that the\ndoctors think that this is great, but they are not willing to prescribe it. So I got this privately. - And does it make you high? Or is it addictive? - No, not at all. This oil just makes my pain\ngo away, and nothing more. I have been taking this one\ndrop for weeks and months now, and I have not had to increase the dose. - Can you show us the\noil that you're using? - I think you can't go\nwrong with one drop anyway. - And were you able to\nstop using the painkillers? - Yes I have stopped\ntaking the painkillers and I'm using much less\nrheumatoid medication. - Okay, thank you very much and I'm gonna put this in our video and I hope this will help other people who have similar symptoms like you. - Yeah, maybe this can\nencourage other people to get in there and take CBD oil too. - Thank you very much. (foreign language) - Now there is a problem with CBD oil because at the moment\nthere is kind of a hype. There are thousands and thousands\nof products on the market, many of them are really bad. For example it happened to\nus that we bought CBD oil, the taste was horrible and\nthere was virtually no effect. The best way to buy CBD oil depends on the country you live in. In the USA, you now have service providers who test CBD products for effectiveness. This website here, they test products for\nCBD content and quality. The advantage is that you\ncan be sure that the value that is given on these bottles are true. I am going to show you two\nproducts that I recommend. This stuff is what I\nknow worked for my mom. So it is safe for arthritis problems. I would also try this stuff here. This is a full spectrum oil, that means it has not only CBD, but it also has these terpenes in there. So if you wanna imagine an\norchestra that plays music. If you wanna have a nice song, you will need many different instruments. I think this is the new way to go. In the future, all oils will\nbe full spectrum like this. There are different concentrations of oil and you wanna start with\na low concentration. You can see here, 125mg, 250, 500, 1000. There is such thing as tolerance, and if you start off\nwith just the highest, most concentrated oil, then you have no room to go upwards. You wanna start with a low dose first. So for example, the 250mg. If at some point you get tolerant to it, you can use it a bit more often and you can also use a higher concentrate. If you live in Europe, things\nare a little bit different. I have experience buying\nCBD oil over there, and I'm going to recommend you the product that we have\nbought and that we know works. It's called Candropharm100, from this website called cbdoilkaufen.de. The link is under this video. So there you go. If you haven't tried CBD oil yet, give it a go, because it may help with\npainful conditions you have. The link for products\nare under this video. Thanks for watching and\nI hope to see you soon.", "GxvBQZF1rE4": "cbd oil and hemp oil have both experienced a rise in popularity over the past few years but they are different products that offer distinct benefits both compounds are derived from different varieties of cannabis plants cbd oil is extracted from leaves flowers and stems of the cannabis sativa plant while hemp oil is made from the leaves flowers and stems of the hemp plant both oils are associated with cannabis but what's the real difference between them cbd is short for cannabidiol which happens to be an active ingredient in cannabis plants while some cbd oils do have low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol thc it is not enough to experience the euphoric feeling associated with other thc infused products on the market cbd is sold over the counter as a remedy for pain relief and neurological disorders some studies claim that it helps improve moods and can even lower blood pressure and improve blood circulation cbd oil interacts with the body's endocannabinoid system cannabidiol works with the body's own endocannabinoid system which is a complex cell signaling system experts don't completely understand how cbd interacts with this system but they seem to think that it helps to treat certain ailments as well as regulate sleep mood memory nausea and appetite hemp oil might contain low levels of cbd but not enough to have the same benefits as cbd oil however there are many brands of cbd hemp oil on the market it is worth noting that hemp oil and hemp seed oil are sometimes advertised as the same thing but they have differences hemp seed oil differs from hemp oil in that it is manufactured from the seeds of the hemp plant because of that process hemp seed oil does not contain much cbd or thc as a

sad well marijuana max makes ginger - such a big freakin deal okay here's what happened why I am made sad which brunet give him a quick go down on what do you think of the sad oh it's very nice it soothes it suits better than anything I've ever had it suits how many other different marijuana sizes and he tried about three about three different kinds yeah this was the best okay um I think it's more than three but let's go with this that wasn't me man and the reason I had to make sad this because I had some oil and it was four years old and I loved his smoke on it was very viscous and it started getting to the point finally where I was wanting to make some food out of it but instead of grabbing me Everclear to meet in strata I accidentally grabbed the ISO and so I had to make an ISO product base and then I used coconut oil to mix it in with real simple penises want you mix in a lotion or this or that thank you basic and simple coconut with a coconut cream oil coconut oil that's organic extra virgin coat a big old [ __ ] tub it's not too expensive okay let me take the oil you mixed it with ISL which makes it into a liquidy base and you mix it with the coconut oil all kind of mix it good you use a blender I you have to use my hand and just round it up the toes next up and then by that time I was viscous I poured it into here and then put it for sure now the same thing goes with making it easier simply these tensors that they're putting in food they're taking really crappy low grade stuff you can take a gram you know oil mix it with Everclear say ten to one and shake it up really good and you have yourself one hell of a texture use five dollars or five grams 0.2 0.5 holy [ __ ] twenties five point five which is one-half of a drop or four that on your in your drink on your food or something give you a nice buzz use more than that you hang it high you know you [ __ ] can drop before the law you know whatever you need but I'm just saying one dropper flow is going to be sufficient which brings us to make an oil today and it's lots of pretty oil help the cake to do or yeah I have one big piece or you see how I'm using the parchment paper I am getting it all up thank you sure you know one get as much as I can I'm just such a Jew I might be or so cheap but just trying to be frugal not be wasteful of all the oil on there and so I can see you're being crazy so if I got more than that it's also helpful to tape it all up to when you're grabbing it and you don't get it all over your fingers this parchment paper and you can do what you want with it but now it has to sit out and I put it in a jar but this is kind of a lot so the laughing good job anyways folks I say that you should vote to legalize marijuana getting involved in voting to legalize marijuana make sure you shave I don't shave coming here I'm gonna do a video anyhow what can I say well I can tell you more but that's about it for today vt LM", "WCFvdEdVLlw": "good evening you're watching spotlight San Diego give any idea what CBD stands for I can assure you it's not in the same category as lol WTF or s MH in fact it has nothing to do with texting we're talking about hemp oil which you may not know a lot about but it is legal in all 50 states and apparently is we're about to learn vastly different from medical marijuana our next guest is Charles vest he is the vice president of communications of hemp medics px' and I want to make sure I'm getting this all right they're gonna be presenting a discussion on February 1st at the UTS successful living expo called what's the buzz about CBD so here with a sneak preview is Charles vest what's the buzz about CVD Charles good to see you it's my pleasure to be here alright the company is called the companies called hip meds PX tamp meds PX okay I want to make sure we get those are close okay right okay hemp oil medical marijuana people here hemp they think marijuana may be hemp is guilty by association but yet from what I've researched hemp and marijuana to vastly different sorts of products they are Scott and the differences could be used of the analogy between oranges and lemons for instance they both come from the citrus family but they're entirely different so what is CBD we're using this term CBD and I don't know that most of us know what CBD stands for well CB d stands for cannabidiol which is the compound that is found in cannabis and if you look at cannabis there's two major compounds there's THC which is the part that gets you high and then there's CBD they both are on totally different extremes so if you want to get you know the psychoactive effects of cannabis you're gonna look for high THC but if you want the healthy aspect of cannabis you're gonna look for as much CBD as possible okay CBD hemp oil is legal the company that you work for is a publicly traded company yes this is not something I mean there are gonna be folks who are watching today they're gonna say I've heard about this I know what this does and there's many other folks watching going I don't know what CBD oil does so what are the health benefits why would someone want to take CBD oil it's good question well first of all we're deficient in CBD you know the last time that we got a cannabinoid this is cannabidiol the last time we got a cannabinoid was probably in Mom's milk and so from that point on we have receptors in our system that are waiting for CBD and other cannabinoids to come in and fill them up well once you get these receptors filled up then our sales can have the right activity and great things can happen on the health health purpose like for instance you can have you can have anxiety or stress well those receptors are looking for CBD to common so what kind of products currently might I find I mean is it something I might eat something I might drink could I go to a health food store what would already have CBD in it number one yes number two yes number three not yet so I brought a couple problems let's find out what some of these products are because I'm curious to hear about the health benefits of what CBD could do for me well let's start with a gun how about a gun lets you chew once or twice a day it has 10 milligrams the CBD in it and there's a US patent for cannabidiol and that patent is patent six six three zero 507 and it actually is for the study of CBD and so this has 10 milligrams of CBD that you can get in a fight so let me get this straight I chew this this gum absolutely okay what does it taste like tastes great like double mint gum okay I chew this twice a day and what what's what's good about that why would I well let me ask you a question do you have any stress or anxiety in your indeed why is the pope Jewish I don't know but you know what I'm saying I do any course hour I think he's polish everybody's got stress yes recent so calming absolutely so the receptors that are in our brain that are looking for CBD actually have associations with stress and anxiety but but not getting high the zero psychoactive okay all right so gum okay all right again there's also an actual oil this is usually seen in situations where there is extreme need for CBD and there's a what everybody example an extreme me would be for instance you might have saw the Sanjay Gupta special on epilepsy and and seizures this is the type of CBD that we would want this is a very very potent cannabis oil and you actually use this syringe without a needle it goes under your tongue very small amounts okay and so okay so when you have this whole thing you're not you're not ingesting all this as a matter of fact it's amazing about the great about the size of a grain of rice okay and so you would put this out of your tongue and and what it tastes like like what you might find under a lawnmower oh really it tastes like wheatgrass okay gotcha like wheatgrass okay not bad and and again you this would last for a while right I mean this would last that's about two weeks worth right there okay and and and one more time epilepsy or things like that seizures and there's you know we're not making any claims or you know any type of diagnosis but it's been shown to have a great effect on seizures and other disorder okay very including PTSD and other disorders that so here's there's two kinds okay and then I want to let you know that kind of daily base like what was scott Kappa News well I would suggest that you take a drop an eye dropper full of CBD tincture it tastes great it has a peppermint flavor to it and this will give you 10 to 15 milligrams of CBD a day and you can let us know what type of effects that it has well could you use any of these products this is the one I use and what have you found what's different in your life well for me it was actually a surprise I went to my doctor after taking this product for a couple weeks and found out that my blood pressure had been completely perfectly regulated and that's that's unheard of for me I've had high blood pressure since I was 15 okay and so this is a daily products I mean you just put underneath your tongue just a one from an eyedropper full a day tastes terrific and I can get CBD back into your system okay alright and that is for you by the way oh this is for me yes all right now remember zero psychoactive you won't get high from it but you can get very healthy from it okay and and again it you take it and I would then report back to you is what you're saying I'm asking what what what would I find I mean you're not gonna tell me what I'm gonna find I would have to take it try it and tell you hey I've got more energy they're sleeping better I mean what those are two possibilities you see we have these receptors that are just waiting to get filled and it depends on what the challenge is that you have maybe the challenge is that you have you no pain and aches and and different situations going on maybe migraines maybe you can't sleep maybe your kids are having nightmares these are all the type of testimonials that we've seen from using CBD and getting it back in your system all right this is very interesting because again I think people here hemp meds you know they they hear the name of the company and they think right away medical marijuana that's not the business you guys are in you're not in the marijuana business right you're in the hemp oil business okay so so totally different deal you compared it oranges versus lemons people will hear more about this and get to understand more about what your company does about more what these products do and what are available what is the buzz about CBD is the name of the discussion that's happening at the UT successful living expo tell us about that it's on February 1st well it's coming up on Saturday and so we're going to be there we're going to talk for about 45 minutes in the main ballroom and we're going to talk about the value of CBD why should we get CBD back into our system and then we're also going to talk about the history of him because you know back in 1937 there was an act called the marijuana act and that made it illegal to have any type of cannabis where those marijuana or him but with with world war ii there was a large group of people that actually shared that we need him in our in our diets we need it in our lifestyle and so we were able to make uniforms and things like that from it so now hip was now brought back into the country for instead you can find it on your shelf and I guess maybe the most important things you want to leave everybody with here is is that hemp is legal in all 50 states we're gonna teach that yes I have another surprise really quick okay go for it alright now you've heard of e-cigs right ecigs okay the electronic cigarettes absolutely well those aren't the most healthy thing for you because they have nicotine in them how about an e cig that has CBD the healthy aspect of cannabis no nicotine no carcinogenic and in a papaya or a strawberry flavor ha this is one of the highlights of what we have and I have that for you as well I'm actually sig and again you use this but but no you're not gonna get high you're not going to get high right so this is but you will what well you will feel relaxed you will feel stress relief from it I call it the shoulder dropper and I like and it comes with a USB cable so you can charge it absolutely on your computer or in the you know for an iPhone or whatever yes Charles what a pleasure thank you for introducing us to all of what hemp can do hemp oil successful living Expo this Saturday February 1st the discussion is called what is the buzz about CBD this was a sneak preview but I know we'll hear more coming up this Saturday what a pleasure to visit with you sir I will try this and I will get back to you immediately and I'm gonna I'm not gonna tell my wife with this let me see if I can calm her just give it to her at night you'll find maybe there's other benefits I see hey that I need you know that you know this all you guys do out there thank you very much my pleasure", "z_fXtcoGBzE": "hi all welcome to my youtube channel my name is ben aka notions and this is a video uh cbd strain review of some cbd hemp bud which i had arrived earlier but from uh purchased from gradedgreen.com which is where i usually buy my cbd products from and they are based in the north of england in the united kingdom quite obviously so yeah the australian i am reviewing right now is called star dog i have in the past smoked it before and i have also smoked ordinary green star dog with with our thc in as well as cbd so i'm quite experiencing uh this strain of cannabis or in this case hemp flour if you'd like to see how it looks when it comes there you go i'm sure you can see through the uh bag and see how big the buds are and i was quite impressed with the size of the buds and also as you can see the amount i bought there at the last one because it's the highest amount they do uh well the highest amount the greatest green had in stock yesterday when it was ordered and obviously it says 14 grams so half an ounce i have just uh had a smoke of the cbd hemp mud shard dog 23 cbd apparently and i feel quite chilled out and pretty relaxed to be quite honest considering i only smoked a flyer which i i could use the word flyer to call a single skin joint so i smoke my joints with a little bit of tobacco in the bottom and the cannabis sprinkled well hemp flour or hemp i'm not cannabis because hemp is different to cannabis i sprinkle the hemp rod on top of the bucky and usually pack my joints so it has a decent enough effect so i don't have to keep smoking one after another and the star dog has quite a nice aroma it's quite pungent and the aroma is just classic cannabis type of aroma and as you might not know that cbd hemp but smells the same most ordinary weeds but it's pretty similar and most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference and i am quite impressed with this stuff hence buying more again and i've also got other strains which arrive today such as amnesia which i think is either 20 or 23 cbd content as well as moon rocks which is meant to be 65 percent three grams of each of those two i just mentioned and another one as well which i've forgotten so i had four items arrived today from gradedclean.com and i haven't tested the other three yet i can't test the moon rocks just yet and i will but i will be trying the moon rocks in a little while and i'll be making a video as such about the my experience first experience actually of smoking 65 cbd uh moon rocks so yeah please subscribe to my channel and also share my video on social networking platforms if you wish to i really don't mind and also yeah basically that's it to be honest i hope this video has helped you and if you want to order me a star dog then i really do recommend it i have a feeling that it will help with sleep as well and if i remember rightly the first thought i tried did help quite quite a lot actually with my sleep and yeah so this should be the same loadout so yeah thanks for watching this video everybody hope to see you again soon cheers for now bye all cheers", "PBpvVWY5jLg": "good afternoon everybody and welcome to my youtube channel my name is ben aka notions and as promised this is a review of moon rocks see cbd hemp and it is apparently 65 cbd and 0.2 thc or lower and the low thc content is due to the law in the united kingdom stipulating that uh cbd products have to contain lower or equal to 0.2 thc in order to comply with the law so the online retailers such as the one i use mostly all called graded dot and there is another which i have uh used before called cbdhempweed.com or it might have been code.uk i really can't remember but i exact domain name now or url if you know about computer stuff and yeah i smoked a couple of joints of the moonrock cbd yesterday and yeah it is very nice it is very relaxing and it helps me sleep last night even though i smoked uh two joints of the cbd moon rocks during the daytime and not directly before i went to bed so the effects are very long lasting and also i was told that it would which meant the taste of green like ordinary cannabis obviously but it does taste a lot more like hashish or house or pollen some people call it depending on where in the world you live or were brought up or wherever you bought or buy your solid or as some people call it hassle hashtags from and i've had some stuff before but with slate and it was like a millimeter two millimeters thick it was like it was like 84 bits of paper but hashish at the time it would crumble with my fingers into a slip well i should see a joint which obviously contains a layer of tobacco at the bottom and sprinkle sprinkling of uh weed on the top whether you see the flower or any kind of matter but you can't obviously roll joints without any tobacco at all but i wouldn't try doing this with moon rocks or ice rocks for that matter because it will probably end up tearing the wristlet but i have never tried this but obviously it's quite hard to crumble up the ice rocks but the moon rocks crumble much much easier than the ice rocks which makes them much uh well i think it makes them much better personally and i would recommend the moon rocks over the ice rocks despite the nine or ten percent difference in cbd content percentage-wise i think the moon rocks are a smoother smoke than the ice rocks uh and basically the moon rock uh tastes better the ice box in my opinion tasted very synthetic and were very harsh on the throat but this is not to say the moon rocks 65 stuff isn't harsh on the throat it actually is quite harsh and it would be quite difficult to smoke two or three moon rock joints in a row due to the harshness on the throat in my opinion but if you want to buy moon rocks and i think it's 34.99 for three grand off raidedgreen.com which distributes throughout the united kingdom but i'm not sure about ireland northern ireland obviously is part of the united kingdom so people living over there will be able to order some great between i would have fought and as i had ordered 187 pounds worth of cbd products which obviously arrived yesterday uh graded green nicely sent the cbd stuff out special delivery and special delivery in the united kingdom by royal mail uh costs about seven pounds and it is guaranteed next day the next working day delivery well including the saturday but not on a sunday of course uh and it will arrive at your door free that box probably before 1pm so yeah a very good service from royal mail and as usual 90 95 96 of the time graded green uh products arrived to go in that's worse today so i was very happy about that so you have to order before 3 p.m to get your yeah it's all good and that's that's a highly recommend great experience for all the cbd needs and i'll leave this video now as it is as i've explained how the moon looks felt and the duration of the effects were along long acting and it helped me sleep quite well last night and still feel a bit tired now to be honest and i don't know why but it must have been that must have lingering after effects so yeah all good yeah so please like this video if you have enjoyed what you've seen or heard and subscribe to my channel if you wish as well and also please if you want uh to share on social networking platforms such as instagram and facebook it would be much appreciated oh yeah and of course twitter as well if you use it it'd be very nice for my videos to be shared and searchable would create a larger fan base or subscribe account as such so yeah i thank you all for your time and patience and waiting for this video but obviously uh watching the video okay thanks all bye for now cheers", "Au9gbr1yD_g": "miracle CBD chiral care is a CBD cannabidiol based topical green it is scientifically designed and formulated penetrates and absorbs into the

youtube it's your boy adg stuffy scuffle420 corey coming at you with another video man in this video uh we're going to be smoking on some delta 8 but before we even get into that this is a 21 plus 18 plus video i'm a kent new jersey medical marijuana patient cannabis patient and yeah this is a cannabis video so if you aren't 21 18 deuces but yeah man wow this [ __ ] doctor a product is fire and literally i haven't smoked any delta nine since yesterday before i got this delta eight so so far i've been smoking delta e only i want to see how long i can do that you know no doubt the nine i mean tonight i'm probably gonna smoke some delta nine just because my mom's boyfriend's coming over to smoke and [ __ ] with me and he he only smokes delta nine blunts and [ __ ] so but i'm gonna try to give him a dab of this delta eight here man i made a dent in this [ __ ] yesterday like i feel like i did but then again i didn't like now this is a 10 gram jar right here and i probably smoked like two three grams yesterday bro i mean probably not maybe like two grams but i think this is over 10 grams though because usually loud house hip just puts it makes it over 10 g's that's what i've been seeing already but man this [ __ ] is the only thing the only problem i'm having with this [ __ ] is it's kind of hard to [ __ ] work with but man this [ __ ] is actually [ __ ] fire straight up a little dent in the jar right there but it's other than that that's still a lot of delta even still a lot of wax but yeah i just uh actually [ __ ] had some hot chocolate with like a i literally scouted out and everything it's on my snapchat score story at scuffy the god on snapchat but um yeah i just scaled it out it was a point six of delta eight distillate and i dropped it in my uh hot chocolate mixed it around with a spoon i mean majority majority of it uh melted some of it didn't melt but it's whatever but damn that [ __ ] just tasted fire and i know i'm gonna be big this [ __ ] like i'm already big because i took a little dab here i didn't even finish it that's how [ __ ] baked i am already but yeah delta is fire man before we take this dab i'm just gonna heat this up real quick finish whatever's in there so cheers cheers i'm waiting to get my uh terpene cannabis derived terpenes um delta 8 distillate i have 10 g's of barry white i think coming soon probably i think it's coming today honestly either today or tomorrow i got some of the delta eight lean come in the [ __ ] delta eight syrup the water soluble hmm so [ __ ] big bro this [ __ ] gets you literally ripped as [ __ ] she literally gets you ripped i don't know how this is like a thing and you can buy this [ __ ] but i should get you ripped with a more clear head definitely i'm going to turn the fan on for a minute should definitely get you ripped with a clear head bro i don't know how this is allowed heard a lot about delta we heard a lot about it went into this thinking that it was going to be you know i i was thinking it was going to be good but like my expectations were low like i did not think that it was going to be this good man definitely recommend anybody in an illegal state to [ __ ] buy some delta distally that's what i suggest haven't tried the carts yet those are coming soon i'm waiting for skye hiyo to ship those out uh so yeah those coming we got the water soluble [ __ ] thc lean about the athc we got i got an ounce of delta nine wax coming yeah we got a whole bunch of [ __ ] coming to a review on the channel man it really now it's a delta and i wax i really don't know why i'm getting that to be honest like this delta 8 way more worth it bro because just because of the price and it's like the same [ __ ] basically but you know i might as well still get down to d9 wax just make edibles and [ __ ] but jeez man this [ __ ] is it rips i'm not gonna lie to you and this is like no flavor so there's like no terpenes at all no smell no flavor i mean when they said no smell like when i was watching lighthouse hemp's youtube video and they said no smell to their [ __ ] and i was like [ __ ] no [ __ ] way there's no smell like how how do you even do that but yeah raw terpenes no smell but raw uh raw [ __ ] unterped distilling no smell it was dead ass they said it might be a slight smell but not this [ __ ] has no smell like i think i got coverage symptoms or some [ __ ] like there's literally nothing coming off this that's crazy that's fire man that's dope as hell and this is legal bro so like this is federally legal bro so like literally you can move across state lines with this and all that like so [ __ ] if i'm ever on vacation or anything and i want to dab i'm definitely bringing some [ __ ] d8 this still maybe that's fire next year this year when i go on vacation in september i'm going to still be smoking d8 by then i guarantee when september comes around you're still going to be seeing me buying delta 8. i guarantee it unless it's [ __ ] federally banned by then but i doubt it so definitely going to see me with this [ __ ] on vacation next year i'm going to bring a whole [ __ ] 10 gram jar oh a second but yeah i plan on stacking the [ __ ] up on disney bro hold on one second we're back i had to run downstairs to grab something real quick but jeez i am [ __ ] baked hello beast i'm gonna try to heat this [ __ ] back up yeah definitely if you're [ __ ] debating on trying to update oh oh my gosh hmm if you're debating i'm trying to definitely try it oh my god dude i'm [ __ ] baked like that is crazy i can literally get some [ __ ] wax [ __ ] this is literally you know it's basically the same [ __ ] thing as delta 9 take a higher dose if it's not working for you it's literally the same thing as [ __ ] wax fat ass dad will be coughing but yeah if it's not like not getting you to where you want to be so now i'd say just take a [ __ ] bigger dose because as soon as i started smoking this [ __ ] i dab fat because they say it's not going to be as strong as [ __ ] weed so i took some fat ass dabs like [ __ ] it i'm [ __ ] baked already boys and you can literally just eat this [ __ ] like if you want to which is crazy i mean i wouldn't recommend just eating it straight up because it's [ __ ] a [ __ ] to get out of your teeth about i'd say drop it in some hot chocolate put it on the spoon put the spoon in the hot chocolate just mix it around baked it feels like it's [ __ ] damn [ __ ] diamonds or some [ __ ] like i'm high as [ __ ] let me pause this real quick we're back tissue but man i am [ __ ] still baked i'm gonna clean this banger out but boys this [ __ ] d d8 is actually insane bro i can't believe that it's so [ __ ] like strong this [ __ ] is actually strong as hell and i'm an everyday dabber man like you got it you know for the most part i'm an everyday dabber 100 percent everyday smoker you know for me to say that this [ __ ] is strong and i've smoked out the night in a day damn near now i mean because you know i mean i smoke delta live all i would say all day yeah i smoked out the nine all day yesterday until i got my package at six in the afternoon what six came around i got my package i was like i would i thought they ain't not but from six all the way up from six at night all the way until now it's been delta it only and when i woke up i was like damn i want to [ __ ] smoke that delta hate again that's just fire some guys i ain't [ __ ] smacked plus i got that edible about to kick in too i don't think it's like the edibles really kicking in yet but i'm definitely high i think that's just from the dab though i got some uh i got i got [ __ ] 10 grams of terpt berry white distillate coming in today well hopefully today either today or tomorrow i got a gram of some diamond sauce or whatever it is without the eight coming in today or tomorrow and then i got 98 disney from bulk disney i got an eighth of that coming in tomorrow or the next day probably i got loud house hemp uh water soluble uh like the leave but it's not really mean it's uh just syrup water soluble salad [ __ ] syrup coming in who knows when that's coming in i ordered that yesterday so that's probably not gonna be here for a while but probably a week at least maybe a week or two and then uh i got one more pack oh and two cards from sky ohio i got those coming too that's why i've really been just dabbing the [ __ ] out of this disney because i got so much [ __ ] coming this all again but yeah i'm gonna definitely uh start buying bulk though i think next month i would probably buy a [ __ ] to the bulk dusty like maybe just like two grams of probably that's a two grams two uh ounces probably a couple carts probably i might just start making my own cards if i figure out how to do it i make my own cards [ __ ] behind them the [ __ ] just i mean they're not that expensive but [ __ ] behind you but you can make your own so i might you know i'll probably [ __ ] around and get uh i want to try that hash i didn't i didn't even order the hash i had i was gonna order the hash but cancel it took it out of my cart and i ordered the diamonds instead because it was like five dollars cheaper i was like [ __ ] get that instead so i want to try that hash that they got at uh highest elevation south florida so that's going to be a cop probably like in the future maybe next month and uh i'm trying to think what else i want to try i got so much [ __ ] [ __ ] they got ounce of an ounce of bull rocks you can get but it's like the only thing about the morocks it's like cbd bud sprayed without the eight topped off with with uh cbg keef i think or without the eight keefe and then something like that uh bud sprayed in hold on let me get this right so it's bun spray delta a cbd bud sprayed in delta eight wrapped in delta eight distillate um wrapped again in cbg force or i think it's cbg keef that's it's supposed to be fire i think the cbg is good for like more relaxing you would make you sleep but i i might be wrong i don't exactly know what cbg is man i might be wrong but they got that [ __ ] and i'm like damn they got an ounce for the load like less than 100 i think so i'm like damn i might have to get that [ __ ] man out of some more rocks even if it is uh it's still got delta eight in it so it's gonna get you high you feel me like definitely might try that [ __ ] i'm still back as hell but i'm gonna take another dab just for the channel we gotta we got headlights out there we got some coming in you know we ain't worried about it it's just not expensive this [ __ ] is really fire the mailman is your plug bro i saw some [ __ ] on the reddit yesterday and by the way if you're in the delta eight uh thc reddit get in there bro it's just called delta eight already join that [ __ ] that [ __ ] is [ __ ] popping anything you need to know about dalda is in there hey look at that monster right there where are you taking that i'm already baked as hell right now we ain't taking no crazy crazy dab but yeah uh yo we got a oh what the [ __ ] just happened we got a [ __ ] rise there was a rise or was it no zen leaf we got zen leaf dispensary coming to neptune new jersey that'll literally be that's like my area that'll be here that'll be like that's literally no less than five ten minutes away from me show me i know exactly where it's gonna be and everything so we got a dispensary oh a little bit of distillate it's floating all around caught in my mouth but now it's probably hanging from my mouth you can eat this [ __ ] man that's the crazy part you can literally eat it i said [ __ ] it i'm gonna just get that [ __ ] so i don't get on my dress with my uh my [ __ ] [ __ ] table that's still a fat ass dab i'll be treating this [ __ ] like it ain't like it's like it's nothing just because it's delta e like even you can really take small dabs of this maybe a little bit bigger than you would but you don't need a point when that [ __ ] i've been taking point once but you don't need you don't need a point but it's a [ __ ] globster and this [ __ ] is more like now it's more like rose pink amber color and that's because of me though because i hit it with the [ __ ] with the hair dryer and it you know i had to though because i had to get it to fall down so i hit it with the hair dryer and it oxidized it whatever it's called oxidize i think that's the word a little bit i mean that's fine though you know it ain't affecting the poets all right i think i'm gonna put my hand a little bit take this off throw this [ __ ] in there cold started come on don't stick to my [ __ ] fingers man now it's sticking to the banger oh this is a l i like my [ __ ] finger for a reason bro i literally i lick my [ __ ] thumb for a reason hold on a second let me fix this boom we got that fixed take a little look at that real quick that's a [ __ ] glob look how [ __ ] [ __ ] up the banger is now man [ __ ] smoke reclaimed out of a good banger because that will happen i was pissed when i [ __ ] noticed that [ __ ] it's my fault though i smoked reclaim out of this [ __ ] banger and they got like a [ __ ] mean eyes reclaimed on the side of it i'm [ __ ] baked already cheers god that [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire i'm so surprised every time i dab it bro i'm just like how oh i'm [ __ ] baked out of my mind bro jesus christ i think the edibles i think the edibles hitting a little bit starting to get that sleepy ass [ __ ] effect okay i'm so [ __ ] high man i love the way they had this don't they [ __ ] set up to where there's not
