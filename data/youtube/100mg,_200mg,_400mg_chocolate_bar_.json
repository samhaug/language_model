{"FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "tQvZcmtJXUg": "look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar recently i've really gotten into making my own edibles from concentrates i've gotten from the dispensary you guys have been asking me to make youtube videos about some of the recipes i've made so today i'm going to show you the easiest one i've learned so far today we're going to be making medicated chocolate bars it's extremely simple and that's why i wanted to show you this method first all you're going to need is a chocolate of your choice mct oil or coconut oil and either distillate or rso today i'm going to be using distillate but both will work the same for this recipe you can use any form of extract as long as it's been decarb some equipment you'll need is a heat safe bowl a pot a rubber spatula a pyrex measuring cup some measuring utensils a plastic syringe you can find these in most pharmacies and then you'll need a mold for the chocolates if you don't want to do bars you can do molds that look like anything you want there's stars there's bears you can really get creative now the amount of chocolate you use depends on how potent you want your chocolate bars to be the more chocolate you use the less potent your edible will be today i'm using a granite distillate that has about 830 milligrams of thc in it and i'm going to be making two chocolate bars so each chocolate bar is going to have about 400 milligrams of thc i'll explain how to calculate how potent your edibles are a little bit later on in the video but for now let's get started making our edibles first thing to do is fill your pyrex measuring cup with water and put it in the microwave for about two minutes after that two minutes is done take out your now hot water and drop your syringe of distillate in that water this is to make the distillate more of a liquidy consistency so it's easier to mix in with the chocolate you do not want to skip this step distillate is very thick if it's just been sitting in room temperature but now we're going to set up our double boiler by getting a pot with a little bit of water not too much you don't want the water to be above where the bottom of the bowl is going to be sitting on top of it bring that pot to a boil then turn it to low while topping it with your heat safe bowl the heat from the steam is going to be our heat source and now we're going to add just under a teaspoon of mct oil mct oil or coconut oil supposedly helps speed up the digestion process of an edible allowing you to feel the full effects quicker you let the mct oil sit for about a minute let it get nice and warm before you add your distillate and now we're going to take that distillate out of the water and pour it into the bowl just look how easy it is to squeeze out of the syringe it's going to mix perfectly now stir the distillate with the mct oil let it all get mixed together and now we're gonna add our chocolate i'm using just under two and a half ounces of milk chocolate here it melts easier if you break it up a little bit mix it while it's melting and make sure your stove is on the lowest possible temperature you do not want to burn the chocolate keep stirring until it's liquidy and now we're going to fill our syringe and transfer the chocolate into the molds you don't need the syringe but the syringe makes it a much cleaner process and since the chocolate is medicated i want to waste as little of it as possible so i feel like the syringe really helps with that this process takes a minute but the result is worth it i put a little cutting board under the mold to help them keep flat this especially helps when you're transferring them into the fridge and make sure the molds are filled completely nobody wants airy chocolate you can bag and shake the molds a little bit to help everything even out once the molds are filled you want to put them in the fridge for 30 minutes after that 30 minutes you want to transfer them to the freezer for about another hour and now it's time to enjoy got my molds fresh out of the freezer right here you guys gonna show you how good these look don't want to break it it's nice and frozen so typically they're not going to break on you oh yeah look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar bust out the second one oh yeah holy crap you guys that looks like a professional chocolate bar my plan is to cut these in half to their 200 milligram squares i feel like that's a little bit more of a realistic dose i've done this before and gotten a little bit more creative this is like a cookies and cream bar i used white chocolate and oreos since i used oreos i had to use a little bit less chocolate so i used about two ounces of chocolate to get two chocolate bars here's another one i've done where i added marshmallow and graham crackers to it so it's like a medicated s'mores bar all of these chocolate parts were made from the same strain with the same batch of distillate and the same amount so in theory each chocolate bar should have the same amount of potency and that's kind of what i was shooting for here i just wanted a bunch of different chocolate bars that i all knew were the same potency if you use two different types of distillate or rso and another one one might hit you a little bit harder than the other but since these were all made with the same amount the same strain from the same batch they should be a very consistent high and the reason why i like these little squares is i feel like it makes it easier to dose out a lower dose if a chocolate square like this has nine little chocolate squares in it and has 215 milligrams it should be somewhere between 20 to 23 milligrams per chocolate so i can either have like nine doses of 23 milligrams or an entire dose of about 200. it's super easy to find out how many milligrams of thc is in your edibles it just takes a little bit of math and a little bit of knowledge all you need to know is the amount of product you put in it and the total thc of that product if you're using a gram of distillate that has 80 thc it has 800 milligrams of thc in that gram if you're using 2 grams of distillate that has 80 thc there's 1600 milligrams in that batch so once you find the total thc in your batch just divide that number by the amount of treats you made so if you use 800 milligrams of thc in that batch and you got 20 candies each candy is going to be roughly 40 milligrams of thc this concentrate i was using had 83 percent thc in it so it has about 830 milligrams of thc in the gram personally i like to take a couple milligrams off my dose because i feel like not all of it makes it from the bowl into the edible so that's why i consider these bars 400 milligrams instead of i hope you learned something about edibles and i hope this maybe even inspired you to make your own it's super simple and all edible recipes are pretty easy if you can bake or cook you can probably make edibles and let me know if you guys want to see more edible videos in the future and if so what kind of videos you want to see do you want me to make tutorials do you want me to just consume some edibles here and film my reaction do you want me to make super easy edibles do you want me to make super potent edibles you want me to make super challenging edibles let me know because i want to make videos that you guys want to watch so please give me any input if there's something that you guys want to see on my channel let me know in the comments down below i was thinking about doing some reclaim edibles i don't know if you guys have even heard of that before but you can actually use the reclaim from the rig shoe dab to make edibles and i've been collecting that for a couple weeks now and i was thinking about just making some comically strong edibles with them but that's the video you guys thank you so much for watching make sure you click like if you enjoyed this video and subscribe for more videos i got a bunch more on the way leave a comment let me know what edible related videos you want to see in the future and let me know which chocolate bar you think looks the best between the s'mores bar the milk chocolate or the cookies and cream and don't forget if you haven't already check out my online website pponlineshop.com it's the

"iwMgD51_zEk": "first off I just want to give a little disclaimer saying that I do not condone the use of any legal or illegal mind-altering substances the contents of this video are created purely for education it's inevitable that there will be people who consume these substances therefore it is extremely important to educate people on the effects and how to properly use them so edible pot is a lot different than smoking it it's more potent it's processed in the body differently and the effects lasts longer the difference with edibles is that the active ingredient the chemical that gets you high THC is processed in the liver before the user experiences any effects the original THC from the edible is converted in the liver into a more potent metabolite 11 hydroxy THC it's estimated that this compound is about four to five times more psycho active than normal THC and because the edible has to go through a portion of the digestive process before effects can be felt it can take 30 minutes - as long as two hours before a user feels any effects because of this people who don't feel any effects after an hour so might want to reduce only to have the entire thing hit them like a train all at once an hour later so my advice just wait it out it may take a while but it will come on and unlike smoking cannabis in which the effects last about two hours and gradually drop off after a quick climax right after inhalation edible pot takes its time before it reaches its peak in effect and this peak lasts longer typically the effects of edibles lasts four to eight hours when it comes to the effects there are certainly similarities between smokeable and edible weed but there are some properties that appear to only occur strictly on edibles there are two main reasons someone would want to consume an edible the first is for medical benefits such as aiding symptom relief of stress or anxiety or to help one sleep and the second is simply just for recreational purposes just to have a high and have a time aside from these two reasons there are actually a few people in the psychedelic community who use edibles and very high doses in a similar way to what one would use LSD or magic mushrooms for but we'll touch on that aspect at the end of the video so now we are going to get into what you can expect to feel from the different doses of weed edibles but firstly it's important to know that tolerance is everything tolerance plays a huge role in your experience and if you're an everyday pot smoker you'll likely have to take a much larger dose of an edible that someone who has no tolerance to THC in order to feel the same effect so take the following effects of doses I give with a grain of salt as this is just generally what you can expect to feel when you take this particular dose so first off we have the micro dose and this ranges anywhere from one milligram to about 2.5 milligrams of THC it's unlikely you'll experience any active effects from this dose but it is possible for people who are hypersensitive to the effects of THC this dose is more just for purposes such as mild relief of pain stress anxiety etc people who Micro's THC edibles might also report increased creativity and focus the effects of this dose are pretty passive you likely won't feel any different fundamentally this can be somewhat compared to people who micro doze LSD and magic mushrooms who do so for similar purposes next we have the low dose which ranges from two point five milligrams to about 15 milligrams and the two ends of the spectrum can be very different especially for people with low tolerance to th see someone consuming the edible for medicinal purposes will experience stronger symptom relief and this dose can also be used for people who have trouble sleeping you may begin to feel a sense of euphoria and that classic high feeling where coordination is slightly impaired and overall perception is altered but if this dose the high is unlikely to be overwhelming and because of this this may be a good dose to try for a first-timer in my own experience there isn't a significant difference between this dose and edible in your average smoking weed high the medium dose ranges from 15 to 30 milligrams someone with a decent THC tolerance still may not be feeling heavy effects here but for many vistas can make them pretty high it's at those dose that people may start to feel negative effects such as anxiety and paranoia you might ask if people use weed for relief of anxiety stress then how could this dose bring on anxiety and stress well THC has biphasic effects which means the substance can have opposite effects in different doses anxiety can be reduced in lower doses but can actually be stronger in higher doses so if you're taking edibles for symptom relief it is important to be aware of these biphasic effects the drug in half coordination and perception will likely be altered at this dose that agree to which it is altered will likely depend on your tolerance some people might start to get the classic red eyes from being high maybe some people experience close eye visuals for me personally I tend to have a close eye visual on low to medium dose weed that looks kind of like this let me know if you have experienced the same type of visual in the comments the high dose ranges from 30 to 50 milligrams this dose will likely bring a significant high even to someone with tolerance and for someone with low tolerance this can bring an extreme high their coordination will definitely be impaired somewhat you might feel a strong euphoria maybe you'll feel very laughy some people's mouths get very dry and get cottonmouth this is due to THC mimicking a naturally occurring chemical called an and amide which binds to cannabinoid receptors in our saliva glands which causes saliva production to decrease you might also get the classic munchies and just want to absolutely binge eat it's important to remember that the effects of THC impacts everyone differently so no two people's high will be exactly the same and you likely will only experience some of the effects I listed not all the very high dose ranges from 50 to 100 milligrams I would say it's more likely than not that you will probably experience some negative effects at this dose but the high may become so intense you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed people often experience a rapid heart rate panic nausea in headaches at this dose so definitely don't venture into this realm if you don't know what you're doing for someone with an extremely high tolerance this dose might not be too heavy but for the average person this will likely be overwhelming there are still medicinal benefits at this dose but is only used for people who really need it as this dose is sometimes using cancer patients to boost appetite and is also used for people with certain inflammatory disorders personally any dose at this range or above just completely puts me on my ass the come-up is nice for me as I feel very laughy energetic and social but once the effects really start peaking I honestly begin to struggle to stay awake and wish to do nothing else but to find a cozy place to lie down and fall asleep this may have been due to the strain though as THC isn't the only psychoactive chemical we it's just the most prominent CBD is the chemical that aids with sleep and this chemical also plays a role in the overall effects of the weed and the amount of CBD in the strain will most definitely impact your experience and finally the extremely high dose is going to be anything above 100 milligrams I've heard of some edibles having 250 milligrams some having 500 and even some containing as much as a thousand milligrams obviously the effects will get significantly higher as those increases a 100 milligram edible might not be incredibly strong for someone with a very high tolerance but certainly 500 milligrams is going to put anybody on their ass be very careful of consuming edibles this powerful as there will certainly be negative effects due to the intensity it's in these very high doses that have experienced visuals reminiscent of a psychedelic trip on say LSD the visual might be something kind of like this and speaking of psychedelics there's many people who report having psychedelic like trips from high doses of weed edibles the world-famous Joe Rogan likes to discuss edible pot as along the same lines as psychedelics such as LSD psilocybin mushrooms and DMT saying that edible pot can take you down the rabbit hole there's a comment I found from someone on reddit that I thought described as similarity of the psychedelic feeling on high-dose edibles perfectly not long ago I did a hundred milligrams of THC edibles and had zero tolerance on my couch my eyes closed and no music it was awesome and the peak was over three hours I swam through the psychedelic mind a tunnel with many doors and behind each door was a memory of mine I went through them and had Total Recall I could recall past memories memories of being born my first laugh before thinking and the experience that my first thought as an infant the pure thrill of thinking now the effects of THC in the brain is nowhere close to resembling that of a psychedelic classical psychedelics interact directly with the 5-htt to a receptor in the brain and cannabis does not do this from doing research it seems to be that weed edibles tend to resemble psychedelics more often for people who have already had experiences with psychedelics in the past it's likely more often that this psychedelic feeling is also associated with strains with higher THC levels and lower CBD levels as CBDs antipsychotic effects will likely lessen the psychedelic effect but if you find yourself feeling like you're in the middle of an intense psychedelic trip I'll say what I've always said before let the experience consume you surrender to the substance let your mind flow freely and try not to attach yourself to these thoughts just simply observe don't make any attachments so that's about it for this video hopefully you have a better idea on what you can expect to feel by the different doses of weed edibles if you're new start low THC affects everyone slightly differently so see how you react to the substance stay safe consume responsibly and you'll be fine if you seek to support my work on a deeper level

subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time wonka bar edibles uh i had one of these over a year ago um but when i had it it was a bit fatter this way it was a bit wider and it was 500 milligrams instead of 300 and also they didn't have these um flavors it was just the milk chocolate but now there's a bunch of different flavors mostly based around cereal i think there's some like candy based flavors as well this is the captain crunch it says it's basically like a black market edible i don't think these are sold in any dispensaries that from what i've seen warning contains medical marijuana each chocolate bar contains 300 milligrams plus 300 milligram milligrams plus of cannabinoids i got your nutrition facts right there three grams of protein wow um 220 calories serving size one bar i don't know how some people can just eat edibles like that but i they [ __ ] kill me like i i cannot handle edibles very well anyway if we bust this bad boy open i i swear i'm pretty sure the one way back actually had wonka like on the chocolate but i guess i could be wrong because i don't remember it that well but i'm a big fan of this chocolate to be honest um very potent i would say as well for for for a uh black market not extremely legit edible they're very reliable and consistent for what they are so i would definitely recommend them but i would also be very careful unless you are experienced with edibles i guess unless you eat a ton at a time and know where you know what your limits are if you have any limits i know some people that can just eat tons and tons and tons of these things and i feel nothing my dog's complaining in the background what bud i'm making a review one second anyways in conclusion if you're looking uh for you're not trying to spend a crazy amount of money if you're if you're in the realm of uh black market edible then i would definitely recommend these if you're okay with that pretty cheap only about 25 bucks a bar if you're just buying one 25 30 dollars definitely worth it this captain crunch flavor pretty good and i'm not the biggest captain crunch fan so i'm sure the other flavors um are even better so thank you guys for watching i got a bunch of videos like this if you enjoyed it uh drop a sub check out my other videos and yeah later", "G70-Bp6kHGU": "is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear goodness gravy I've got a story for you guys today listen in the pursuit of life sometimes we run into bumps along the road the bumps vary in size and severity sometimes it's a little tiny pebble in the road and sometimes it's a giant [ __ ] boulder like for instance if you were hiking and you got hit by a giant [ __ ] boulder we're doing our best alright and sometimes things don't work out the way we would we would prefer today is one of those little interesting conundrums that we run into every now and then in our lives and it happened to me I ran into a bit of an issue so sit back relax and let's talk about how I once accidentally drugged myself with the largest edible I've ever eaten last February for all the coronavirus garbage happened I traveled to Los Angeles for spring break and one of the things that I had to do was I had to sign a [ __ ] ton of posters for u2's there was probably more than three thousand posters that I had to sign and the posters were being kept at the house at The Misfits YouTube group were staying at in LA Carson was there Schlacht was there Cooper's there we were all just trying to like sign all of these posters as fast as we could because there's so many of them and it was take us it was taking us literally hours to do at this point there was maybe about five or six people in the house at this time and that's because at that point the whole main misfits crew had gone out to dinner somewhere I don't know if you know this about the misfits in general but they smoked a lot of weed every trip they do they probably spent a couple thousand dollars on weed okay they smoked the mary-jane they do the weed in order to make the process of signing these posters go a little bit smoother I had smoked like half a joint of weed so I was already decently high because I hadn't smoked in a while either sign in a way crossing my eyes Dodd might ease however my personal reaction to weed is that I get the munchies I get the munchies pretty hard I smoked a little bit of the mare Lona and then I say oh I'm gonna eat an entire sleeve of club crackers with no cheese because gluttony I originally planned to go to dinner with my girlfriend and her father so I was trying to wean off of the hi and just kind of sign the posters and wait until it kind of wore off and then I would go and do that one of the things that they had at this house was they had a giant counter in which a bunch of snacks were all laid out there was chips there was more chips there was I think pizza I don't [ __ ] remember as I look across this horizon of bountiful snacks I see a nerds rope and my monkey brain is like oh and I'm thinking to myself man I remember nerds rope I haven't had nerds rope and [ __ ] forever dude I'm thinking back to my childhood where we would go to a campground in Maine and I would wattle on down to the snack shack and grab myself a nerds rub and before eating it considering its potential applications as nunchucks or trying to tie a knot with it but then realizing I'm a kid I don't know how to tie knots and my prefrontal lobe won't even be done cooking for another 20 years so what's even the point give me a slush puppy give me a Game Boy SP let's [ __ ] it up but lord have mercy did I learn in this moment I no longer was a child but a man a man who experiences consequence in the worst way possible so I'm signing more posters you know I'm cruisin I'm having a great time all right nerds rope tastes a bit strange but that could also be my perception that I have of being already high and it's kind of you've ever been high before it kind of messes with your perception of taste a little bit it was like drinking a diet coke versus a normal coke where there's like you know there's something there there's something there but I don't fully process why it tastes different so I finished the Nerds rope and then I go to have another nerds rope because I'm high and have the munchies as I'm biting into the next nerds rope one of the misfits guys says Ted don't eat those those are edibles hmm sorry I said I'm back I must uh I must have heard you wrong um scusi yeah Ted that's inedible so I say no [ __ ] way how much was it he says I think I think it might be like 60 milligrams what 60 milligrams to give you context the largest edible I'd had up until this point in my life was 20 milligrams so of course I asked are you sure one of the guys walks over to the counter and picks up the package of the Nerds rope and with the most you are [ __ ] face I've ever seen in a person he says it's actually 400 milligrams now remember I've already freaked out when I heard that it was a 50 milligram edible and I've just been told that it is actually eight times that amount so you may be asking yourself Ted how the [ __ ] did you not know that that was inedible and that's a good question let's start with the packaging that's the packaging it uses the same packaging as the actual branded Nerds rope it's got a thing that says Terran share as if it's just a normal candy in hindsight that's very much so implying for a good reason that you really should be sharing it and not eating it entirely on your own if you're not really paying attention and it's been like eight years since you had a nerds rope this is pretty easy to mistake for a nerds rope in addition to that there was a very specific and deceptive way that everything was laid out as snacks in the misfits house and I'll just let swagger CIL's explain that for me there was a very reasonable way like we set it up because the Nerds rope was inedible it's a 400 milligram edible and he didn't read the packaging but we have on that bench it's a big-ass bench it's snacks and food chips Pringles gummy bears all that [ __ ] munchies and then there's weed food which is edibles in between that and the weed which makes sense like a spectrum dangerous that's the thing is that it would make more sense to kind of put the weed food away so that you don't confuse confuse you've ever been in a car crash even if it's not your fault there's a certain feeling after it immediately happens it's this mind racing feeling when you have absolutely no idea what to do but you also know that something has to be done or you're [ __ ] aka panic so at this point I begin to freak for three reasons first of all I didn't know if I was personally prepared mentally to get as high as I was about to get second of all I had made plans for dinner with my girlfriend and her father that night and I definitely won't be making it and I'm pretty sure she's gonna be a little bit pissed and the third reason I hadn't smoked weed in two months which meant that my tolerance was rock-bottom I like to explain this with what I like to call the skyscraper analogy right here we have the tolerant skyscraper which represents my tolerance to marijuana let's just say that whenever I smoke weed I started the ground floor in the lobby if my taunts were higher then maybe I'd go a couple stories up to the mid-level apartments that's where all the stoner kids from high school hang out and they're all pretty high up there but it's nothing really to be worried about you're probably couch locked but you'll be fine with my tolerance at zero though I knew in my heart and my soul that I was going all the way up to cheech and Chong's [ __ ] penthouse as an unwilling and unexpected guest for an undetermined amount of time as things stand right now I don't even live in the building I'm from out of town and I sometimes commute into the city oh it's a Friday night oh we should go we should go get drinks in the city that's the that's what I'm operating on I know that I'm on a timer most edibles take about 45 minutes to an hour before they kick in but I know that I've taken this edible about 10 to 15 minutes prior which means math I've got about 45 minutes before this edible hits me and I died although other things can affect this such as being on an empty stomach which I was my first thought was that I need to make myself throw up because if I can get rid of as much of this edible as possible I could potentially mitigate the level of inebriation that I was about to experience so I stumble over to the bathroom and I start to gag and I'm trying to make myself throw up but I've never made myself throw up before I don't know how to do it so the next step is that I got Carson on his phone looking up how to's on wikiHow on how to make myself throw up and then Cooper's in the kitchen and he's making cups of saltwater for me to chug because apparently if you chug saltwater it helps with the throwing up process I'm not sure how true that was it just ended up with me just throwing up a bunch of pinkish salt water so I can't speak for its effectiveness but there you go and I'm pretty sure since the Nerds rope was sort of a candy sugar based food it was really easy for my stomach to digest it really fast so I'm pretty sure if I hadn't thrown it up within maybe five minutes there really wasn't that much that I could do from there so by the time I was done throwing up some food that we had ordered earlier arrived and Cooper basically advised me that the best thing that I could really do for myself would be to just fill my now completely empty stomach from this point on all I could really do was buckle up strap in and get ready for the [ __ ] high of a lifetime god bless my soul [Music] so I'm gonna give you guys a walkthrough of what this high was like it wasn't fun I also have some video footage that Cooper took so link to his channel in the in the description once I kind of came to terms with the fact that I was gonna have to ride out this high no matter what I decided to give myself a home base just somewhere where I could ground myself and not really need to worry about moving around or anything I found myself a nice armchair and I sat myself down there and prepared for the ride of a lifetime the first thing that happening was a classic weed symptom which is cottonmouth which is when your mouth gets really really dry so I was pretty much just constantly drinking water I remember starting to get colder and The Misfits they had a room where they just had a bunch of extra merch laid out where they could just give that to friends and stuff while they were in LA and I kind of just walked in there and just threw on one of the sweatshirts and then just went back to my home base and sat down and I was wondering for myself if that cold symptom that I was experiencing was real I did research on the symptoms that I was experiencing and this was something that actually happens informally it's referred to as weed chills the THC literally lowered my internal body temperature so I actually was getting cold another thing that happened and I think this also might have been a symptom of being cold but I started getting shaky and it's really funny the way that I described that when I was high and I actually have video footage of that right here welcome back it's gotten worse friends we are it's been about 45 minutes since last and bad okay I think you need another stick of butter I feel like my entire body feels like rubber bands pretty much after that point was when things started to get um they started to get bad the shaking was also the reason why in the video you can see me clasping my hands together because I was literally like shaking so much that I had to hold my hands together really tightly and keep my body really tight and close so I could be in like a comfortable state and then I get into what is called the painful zone or the first level of weed hell pretty much any position that I was sitting in felt painful don't do too much weed I was in the pain hotel and I was its only guest any surface that I touched whether it be the arms of my chair putting my hands on my knees anything like that just felt bad and what I think I would attribute that to is just being so high my sense of touch was just so elevated that my brain was just overloaded or something most of the time I was just trying to like breathe deeply and kind of maintain my composure but whenever Cooper would turn the camera on me and he would start recording I would sort of like try to elevate my attitude and try to seem as cheery as possible because I didn't really want to seem like an idiot hi stoner on camera you know at a certain point I had to move my home base because it was too disorienting to be sitting straight up I had to go and get [ __ ] horizontal baby I pretty much had to make a mental agreement with myself just to survive is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear it was during this time of unbearable dizziness that my good friend Schleck decided to use a [ __ ] handheld massager on me I'm just getting the lactic acid fun I just want to get the juices I just want to get the juices flowing if you please organism do you see my attitude there I wonder why I wouldn't like that a rapidly moving massager if you want a lesson on what not to do to someone when they're high that really takes the cake eventually the fateful moment happens I had a weed barf I honestly think it was really just because of how dizzy I was getting from being high and luckily for me I had a whole sandwich about an hour ago I literally had to run across the entire room and just run into the bathroom and throw up after I threw up though that's pretty much where the high took the downturn now it was cleansing I had it was a cleansing barf yeah it was uh it was detoxifying I went to go eat some skittles but without even knowing I was on camera I went around to people and not trusting my own ability to determine this I asked them if the skittles were edibles or not I ate the Edible at about 6:30 p.m. that day and I stayed awake all the way until about 4:00 a.m. that night I woke up at about 9:00 a.m. and I was still very high but I was definitely a manageable amount of hi what struck me though was I was high for the entire next day I went to bed that night hi so in total after eating a 400 milligram edible I was high for about you know 26 hours if there's one thing you guys shouldn't take away from this is like any anti weed sentiment from this video I think weed is a perfectly healthy drug to use recreationally but we'd like everything else follows the rule that too much of anything is definitely a bad thing obviously only consume weed in a state in which it's legal and if you're of age I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know if you want more stories from my life I don't really know how many stories I have to tell this is like the second one I've ever told on this channel but I hope you learned a thing or two and if there's one thing you should take away from this it's this weed is for sinners and I'm going to help [Music] ped accidentally took 400 milligrams of edible", "ujlzxde5q9w": "usually i'm high as [ __ ] when i'm eating the candy not eating the candy to get high as [ __ ] [Music] we have a snow day today here in pennsylvania i physically cannot make it outside of my house to ship out any of the orders so i'm just gonna get astronomically high what better way to celebrate a snow day am i right on this table right here i have a bunch of edibles that equal a thousand milligrams of thc i have this medicated chocolate bar it is 400 milligrams of thc in it i have the smaller chocolate bar that has 200 milligrams of thc in it i have a medicated nerds rope here with 220 milligrams of thc in it that equals 820 milligrams for anyone who is in the slow classes and then right here i got a bunch of 15 milligram chocolate bears this is 12 chocolate bears at 15 milligrams a piece that's 180 milligrams all of this combined is gonna be at least one thousand milligrams of thc i rounded down for all of these so it's actually a little bit higher but enough talk and let's get started first i'm gonna start with the 200 milligrams medicated s'mores bar down the hatch i'm gonna need some water that tastes pretty weedy not gonna last all right 200 milligrams down 800 to go i really should have titled this video how to ruin your day all right this is the 400 milligram chocolate bar cookies and cream by the way um i hate that like mild weedy taste you get from edibles it's weird how it tastes good and then like every five bites you're like oh wait i just ate a nug and then you like start eating again you're like oh wait no it actually does taste pretty good oh wait no there's some weed it's like eating a candy salad ugh i do have to say though edibles made with this lit tastes so much better than edibles made with rso oh all right let's finish this white chocolate off so we can move on to the next ah so much chocolate i had to wash it down we can get like a tongue ulcer from this jesus christ all right you guys i've consumed 600 milligrams of thc now i am going to work on the nerds rope sick of eating all this chocolate at least mix up the flavor a little bit these are some ghetto ass nerds rope i mean but they taste fire this is a lot of candy to eat not that i've never eaten this much candy but usually i'm high as [ __ ] when i'm eating the candy not eating the candy to get high as [ __ ] i'm not done eating all the edibles so i'm gonna start this time right now just so i have an idea for when it's gonna kick in because i'm over 600 milligrams at this point probably closer to seven or eight so it's gonna hit me like a brick wall all right let's finish this oh i really should have gotten high before i filmed this video just to make the eating of the candy a little bit easier all right you guys i still got to finish all this nerd drip and all this chocolate and then we are done eating a thousand milligrams all right i'm gonna switch to the chocolate a little bit try to mix up these flavors these little bears are so small i'm just gonna try to pop them like little pills that's one that's two all right this is three these little chocolate bears are for sure the worst tasting edible uh just trying to like chew it and swallow it not trying to let it touch my tongue at all pause keep going those ones really taste horrible holy crap six more to go i'm halfway done the chocolate bears i honestly think if i eat six more of those straight i'm gonna throw up so we're switching back to the nerd drip oh my god i'm just gonna start sandwiching these chocolates in between the rest of the nerd trope ugh these ones stay so bad i don't know if it's just because the amount of distillate that's in the chocolate but holy crap i can hardly get these ones down number ten number 11 and the last one number 12. dude i'm not kidding those ones tasted so bad all that's left are these two little bites of nerds and i have consumed a thousand milligrams of thc bottoms up all right you guys i just consumed a total of 1 000 milligrams of thc between all of those edibles now it's the waiting game just gotta wait for them to kick in should be about an hour and a half or so but i'll let you know as soon as it kicks in thanks to my handy-dandy timer before this when it comes to edibles the most amount of thc i've ever consumed in one sitting was 500 milligrams so this is going to be twice the highest amount of thc i've ever consumed at one time but while i wait for these edibles to kick in let me introduce today's sponsor me make sure you guys check out my online headshot pp online shop you guys it is the number one online headshot on the internet anything you find at your normal head shop you can find at pponlineshop.com i got rigs torches water pipes hand pipes carb caps bangers anything you need besides weed i gotcha and not only are you supporting a content creator you like but you're also supporting a small business and they say that supporting small businesses is important so [ __ ] you jeff bezos there's a new jeff in town he's gonna be taking your internet sales bezos but since i made these edibles myself i know i'm about to have a real thousand milligram experience my big problem with buying edibles i just don't trust that people put an accurate amount of thc that they say they do in the edible it might be more it might be less i don't want it to be more i don't want it to be less i want it to be exactly what i know it to be so i believe if i make them myself i get the best idea for how potent they really are going to be but enough talk and i'm going to come back to you guys in a couple minutes with a little update let you know how i'm feeling all right you guys we are an hour and 20 minutes into the edible and i'm already feeling pretty lit so i'm nervous to where this day's gonna take me usually you don't really feel the full effects of an edible for at least an hour and a half if not two hours so the next 40 minutes are going to be very interesting to me because i'm getting a little bit higher every second i just finished shoveling all the snow outside and i felt like i was having a race against time because i do as soon as this edible kicked in it was gonna be hard to move that snow so i banged it out i'm very thankful for that but now i'm just gonna sit here and wait to see how this edible kicks in because the next 40 minutes are really telling on how the rest of my day's gonna go i see this going three ways the first way i've already peaked and i'm not going to get any higher than i just gotten right now i find that very unlikely option two i get way too high and i get to the point where i'm uncomfortable having anxiety attack and possibly even sick option two is also unlikely but more likely and then there's option three which is the one i'm really hoping for i hit that like perfect ideal super baked out of my mind astronomically high feeling that we all know and love you know that first time you got stupid high and you were just like holy crap i love this feeling that's the feeling i'm chasing today i'm really shooting for that third scenario right now i think it's about to be a fun day all right you guys time check it has been an hour and 41 minutes i don't know if that's in focus but it's safe to say i boarded my flight and i'm taking off to big town holy [ __ ] i'm high and i'm not in focus i don't think why am i whispering i have no one to hide from i know someone's probably gonna mention it at some point but just a heads up you guys i have a weird superpower where my eyes do not get red they get like really baggy and they'll get like really low but they just do not get red maybe after a thousand milligrams they will be but usually like smoke has to get in my eyes for them to get red like it's not a cannabis reaction it's something weirdly hereditary i think i got it from my dad my brother has the same thing so it's just our weird superpower i don't even know what to do when i'm this high like my brain is just going a mile a minute in all these weird directions just thinking all the stupid [ __ ] oh my god i really don't know how entertaining this is to watch so even let me know if this is gonna be a fun video for you guys if you guys want to see me eat an absurd amount of edibles and film the reaction again leave a comment let me know i think next time i want to do some sort of variation of like i ate x amount of edibles and did x so give me ideas here we are in the smoke room i figured while i let this edible kick in i'll show you some of the new stuff i've gotten let's see what i got in here that i can show off for those of you who don't know this is what you use to make most edibles this is distillate and this is rso rso stands for rick simpson oil there's a lot of information about this you can do your own googling i'm not gonna sit here and explain it while i'm high as [ __ ] but these two extracts are what's in most edibles if it's not can of butter let me show you some of this weed i've been smoking on this strain right here is called notorious it is absolutely beautiful nice dense nugs it was testing it like 30 thca i picked up a quarter and the entire thing looked like this it is truly some beautiful weed this strains pretty nuts it's called plum crazy by gti this is one of the many reasons why i don't shop based off of the thc potency you guys a lot of people be turned off to this strain just because they see 16 a lot of times under 20 people just do not want to buy it but personally weed isn't all about just the thc percentage and the amount of high you get i appreciate the beauty the smell and the aspect of cannabis all in all and this [ __ ] right here is some pretty ass weed and it smells great smokes great it is a great strain to have definitely not the craziest put you on your ash stream but i have a thousand milligram edibles for that but look how beautiful this weed is man it's just the most perfect mix of purple green and just white trichomes bursting out everywhere last strain i'm going to show you is this lemon g from moxie to be honest the strain isn't the craziest one i've seen from moxie but i really like the strain lemon g so i'm not really complaining too much nothing really worth bragging about but definitely not bad weed at all all right but real quick i want to show you this thing called the wacket grinder you guys it is an electronic grinder with these little beads in it that spin around and grind up your weed you can get it as chunky or as powdery as you want and look how easy this is to grind up weed boom nice and chunky if you want a little bit more powdery just run it for a couple more seconds super easy just pick the stems right out [Applause] and perfect for a joint all right i'll give you a little piper update my treat i'm gonna treat it sit do a tornado tornado good girl i love this dog good girl so as you can see piper is doing well living the dream that's my dog all right you guys we have passed the two hour mark and it's about two hours and ten minutes and i'm still getting higher but i'm tired as [ __ ] i'm more of like just like a sluggish stoned not like a giggly like big tie as much as i expected it to be at least i just want to take a nap man i am tired i'm surprised the munchies haven't kicked in yet but that's probably because i ate all that candy just to get high so like my stomach just does not want any food right now but i'm gonna sit my ass on this couch turn on the tv for a couple minutes chill with my puppy and try not to fall asleep okay i fell asleep so did piper i don't know for how long it's three hours and 20 minutes since i ate the edible netflix hit me with the are you still watching i was watching our carly this show is [ __ ] fire isn't it paper she actually doesn't like it that much apparently well i'm tired and really high i'm kind of seeing like 2d slash 3d i'm seeing like two and a half d i think it's time i take a dab see if that kind of helps even out this high a little bit sorry this video is kind of all over the place but that's just kind of where my head is at right now so that's what you're gonna get in this video about to take a dab on this antidote recycler i love the function on this little guy about to finish up this lime skunk i've been working on this stuff looks beautiful i love this strain if you've been watching me for a while you remember back in the day i was all about the strain when i first got my medical card and i still like it to this day so that's that's a statement all right you guys first dab after a thousand milligrams let's see how this goes [Music] oh that's terpy god damn oh my god that that dab did the trick oh my god i'm feeling way higher than i did just off the edible smoking on top of an edible definitely get you higher i don't know if it's because that stream was a sativa or if it was just because i dabbed in general but i feel much less groggy than i did before death have a little bit of a turp tickle in my throat now oh my god this lime skunk is so flavorful that even before you put the cap on it gives you a little bit of a throw tickle but i'm glad i did that i feel like first on the edible i was starting a little anxious and i was getting really tired and i felt like i was just kind of like getting into like a little shell and after i took that dab i feel like i just like burst it out of a cocoon a butterfly and i'm just like perfectly high and exactly how i want to be and i'm ready for a good rest of the day i feel like this high is a long while to last but i feel like the ride is almost over i feel like the crazy part of it is done i feel like the come on is really the craziest part when you're like oh my god how high is it gonna get me how much higher am i gonna get how much higher am i gonna get i feel like i've hit my peak so i don't think i'm gonna get too much higher than i am now but we will see we're three hours and 38 minutes in as i say that all right it has been four hours since i've eaten the edible and that means i've been high for about two and a half hours and the munchies have finally kicked in i am not gonna be able to wait for dinner so i'm about to eat real quick i might be putting you guys on to something but some of you guys probably have done this before i call this a torch s'more so you get two marshmallows put them on a stick you get your torch [Applause] and there you have it y'all torch more just look at that oh my goodness fire i'm high so yeah you guys this morning players are following me around it's cracking me up all this edible's really done is got me to take a nap and hang out with my dog all day maybe i'll take a couple rips out of the peak pro i don't think this really counts as smoking you just get kinda high i mean it gets you high but it does not get you as high as a real dab does nothing gets you high like an authentic dab with a rig and a torch the peak definitely serves its purpose it's a great mobile dabbing device definitely better than bringing a torch anywhere and it gets you pretty darn high but if you dab just off a peak for a week and then take a dab off a raid you're going to be so much higher off of that one dab off the rig than you are off the peak or at least that's for me speaking of my experience but my favorite thing about the peak compared to some of the other e-rigs is the app i just think it has so much custom ability to it it's literally insane you can customize your own heat profile and what color you want set and then they have this little lantern mode when you're not using it where it'll do all these crazy colors this is the disco setting change the lighting in here a little bit that'll help show off the colors a little better that's just something fun it's nothing crazy you can change it to literally any color you want on the spin wheel that's fun it's cool to play with when you're high it's like getting a new iphone but people have asked me to do a review on this and honestly i just haven't used it enough to do a review on it i don't like to do a review on something until i've like really delved into it and feel like i have enough information where i can share it and as you can see down there i've only taken like 30 something dabs out of this but i'm about to take a dab with this gmo wax the app reads the temperature of the chamber which is pretty cool but it's time to smoke uh it never ends there we go it's not even over and that's the puffco p pro and i have the pro on my website pponlineshop.com if you want to check it out they sell fast but i try to get them as often as i can and let me know if you think i should really dump into this puffco peek and make a youtube video about it i still need to use it more maybe we'll take a couple more dabs later i feel like this is idiot proof and i feel like an idiot right now my brain is just going all over the place i can hardly think straight look at this weird ass angle i have the youtube video set up at like everything's a mess right now you guys let me try to fix my life that's how i feel peak i am so high i'm looking at two cameras right now two of them five pound cameras you see let's open some snaps hey found out this guy's name real quick paper you're ruining a moment big shout out to you peter thank you for the support much appreciated i'm definitely gonna need luck with this thousand milligram edible the dabs didn't help maybe they did what do you think i was asking paper i posted it about how i was taking an edible so a lot of them are just messages i appreciate the messages i'm not trying to sound like i don't but i figured i'd like show pictures and stuff let's see what else is popping on the webs no power oh my god this is so sad oh my god i feel horrible i shouldn't have opened my snapchats when i was this high this made me really upset i have to respond what day is it [ __ ] thursday thursday the 18th i really i had to look it's thursday february 18th right now and a couple days ago texas got hit with this horrible storm and a lot of my followers are from texas and i know a lot of people from texas i said this in previous videos my girlfriend and i were in a long distance relationship and she lived in dallas so i've been to dallas a bunch of times so it really makes me feel horrible to see what they're going through right now and i made a post about it today on my story and people are responding to it obviously and uh makes me feel so shitty hopefully you guys are watching this a few days in the future and everything like instantly came back on like tomorrow morning and it's not even an issue anymore but currently i have heartbroken for everybody at texas and i hope that the power comes back on soon should i try one more see if it's any better hey someone else got a piece from me thank you so much for the support homie oh and he's dabbing on some fire okay i see you bro i see you bro all right this edible took a minute to hit me but it's hit me all right the rest are just text messages and i like to be coherent when i read those so we're just gonna leave them for now but make sure you follow me on snapchat pot underscore porn i also have pot.porn but my main one is pot underscore porn i'll put a little screen code thing in here like they have in all the restaurants now but if you just type in pot underscore porn you'll find me sounded like a weird seductive ad all right we are reaching the six hour mark i don't know if i'm showing that properly but it has just been about six hours since i've eaten edibles i am preparing dinner right now making sesame chicken letting the chicken marinate in the fridge i definitely still feel high as [ __ ] but i don't feel like i'm any higher than i was when i last caught up with you guys but i also don't remember the last clip before this so that's kind of where i'm at in life i've just doubled the biggest edible dose i've ever taken and i'm doing fine i'm about to make dinner smoke some more weed and that's gonna be the rest of my day but i feel like edibles really do have a peak high because every time i've seen somebody say they've had a thousand milligram edible before i've been like no way that just doesn't seem possible and like i feel like that would just be like another level of high like you're gonna be tripping balls but i just had a thousand milligrams and it's not too much crazier than the 500 milligrams to be honest like i smoked on top of it i wasn't dying like it's at least fully been in my system activated for four and a half hours so i'm gonna say i've just fired at this point it's just a longer high if anything i feel like by a 200 milligram edible piper hush fine i'll give you this room but as i was saying i feel like if i had a 200 milligram edible i would have been maybe not as high and not as long of a high but it wouldn't have been too much crazier than this but also do not try this at home my tolerance is crazy high if you don't have a crazy high tolerance or if you don't smoke a lot of weed you should not try this at home probably should have said that earlier in the video but regardless take it from me don't try this at home it's a waste of money and waste of time but since it was a snow day what better thing to do than eat a thousand milligrams of edibles and take a bunch of dabs gonna end this video while i was taking a dab of this bubble of course sugar i'm just gonna throw it right in the peak got the peak heating up again if you want to get one of these for yourself you can check out my website pponlinechop.com oh it's hot it's ready to go oh yeah that's nice oh my god this thing's hitting all right this is one of the better tests i've gotten off of this peak i [ __ ] with it yeah gotta love the peak fam dabbing of the future but that's gonna be the video you guys click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and don't forget to subscribe for more videos we got a bunch more on the way leave a comment let me know if you have any crazy edible stories i'd love to hear them i've definitely gotten a lot higher off of a lower dose before but my tolerance is so high right now that i've been like training for this this is nothing if i took a week off of smoking and tried this again it would be a whole nother story i would be [ __ ] rocked and make sure you check out my website pponlineshop.com it's the number one online headshot on the internet it's only getting doper every week i got new products coming all the time but that's the video you guys 1000 milligrams later my name is jeff peace", "8OJ6v23ah6w": "good morning guys I wanted to quickly go over how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful

hit the car like a train but we'll see what happens i don't really eat edibles ever so you've never eaten edibles i have before like once or twice but never like this amount we'll see how it goes you're down to do this oh hell yeah all right he's gonna eat the whole [ __ ] bag yeah you ready he's [ __ ] down that [ __ ] again it's gonna taste like ass no it tastes pretty good i mean it's [ __ ] gummy worms let's see how it goes but um yeah so for those who don't know delta 8 is actually 66 percent the psychoactivity of delta 9 but i mean 500 milligrams you know oh man he's just down and look at that how's it taste [Music] yeah so these are the sour gummy worms so you just downed it we're probably gonna check back in in an hour it's gonna take two hours to kick in but we'll check in every single hour to see where he's at you're gonna he's gonna be drunk yeah i know he's gonna get screwed up dude he's gotta wait 40 minutes yeah no he's gonna get [ __ ] up it's 500 milligrams dude fun fun dude i mean we'll see what happens i don't get that [ __ ] up normally one hit of a bomb and i'll be [ __ ] fried you're gonna be [ __ ] up i'm hoping i'm like paralyzed that's what i'm hoping for so yeah [Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good you're good 25 minutes how do you feel better cousins not bad not bad i don't think it's i feel like it's not hitting yet all right we'll check back in it's a placebo effect right now i his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips oh no like stuck to my teeth so wait you what do they feel like they feel like nothing yeah basically wow incredible dry can i get some water hey can someone get this man water all right they're saying no man they don't want you to drink it all right homies aren't looking out for you huh oh we gotta do that landscape that's good well let's get oh flip the camera hold on tell me when to alright so go like this and then do it you know like just take the camera okay one two three go dude you gotta flip it man okay okay okay one two three go okay we flip okay so connor just the results are just bad he just he got so [ __ ] up and uh it just didn't feel right filming him he puked so we were gonna do like a one-hour check-in and two-hour check-in three-hour check-in we only got to the first check-in and uh after that he's just like i'm [ __ ] up so yeah uh moral of the story don't eat the whole bag only eat one or two if you want try the edibles yourself

in my video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it

100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys for watching do not forget to Like comment and subscribe but

hit you guys like I said before in the last clip chance to say bye you guys Nuala by my okay yeah so bye see you guys in the next video and Cheers", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "qfdpEsrfu84": "[Music] give me a w w give me an e e give me an e e give me an A hey give me a t t give me an S s what does that spell wait sweet sweets hello everyone welcome to we it's the marijuana review show or we hope you guys make sense of your in dispensary classic classic review today we are taking a look at an edible and a brand I already know that I love quite a bit that is we are taking a look at our freshly legal review of Kiva Kiva their new 100 milligram a THC ginger dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of CBD as well as you guys probably know if you tuned in often I'm not much of a CBD guy um but I am a THC guy so this one's a little bit more expensive than the standard Kiva because of the addition of the THC everything that cost me 25 bucks at night dispensary in Long Beach plus taxes so it's quite expensive but I hope it's going to taste as good as all other Eva products are and even most importantly I hope it's going to be as potent as Kiva has been now you can see the crazy packaging and has to go through this Kim in a sealed bag with a childproof seal and then this itself is in a childproof bag sealed and you always have to figure out how to open these and I can never figure out how to open them because I am NOT a smart person it's some point so we're gonna try to figure this out together you do this and that and then you pull away and then you say [ __ ] it and you get scissors that's how that's actually how it works you try what it says on the back and then used to get scissors and then surprise surprise on the inside is the exact same thing with all the pertinent information on it as well it's got lab tested results nutrition information all the good good stuff you want to see on it and that great Kiva minimalist card word packaging I really like their packaging design I'm outside of this unnecessary bag it's minimalist its well-designed and it does the job so I'm excited about this I like ginger like chocolate I'd loved every kiba flavor I've ever had and they've all got me a very very high so let's see if the tradition continues and here we go can't really smell anything just yet each piece contains five milligrams of THC so I guess this is gonna be twenty little squares or rectangles in there and there we are there are our 20 rectangles with some little design on it and oh it smells a lot like ginger that is a heavy ginger scent let's give it a taste it's like a symphony in my mouth and the conductor is weed it's good guys don't know matter that's what much else to tell you um except if you don't like ginger you are not gonna like this because this is heavy on the ginger flavor I happen to be pretty a fan ginger so I enjoyed this the chocolate itself is great quality there is a slight cannabis taste to it nothing overpowering nothing that's gonna make you throw up but if you hate the taste of cannabis maybe avoid but for me please punch mmm okay well I've been in there sixteen rectangles to get through but don't worry I'll finish off all of these and then once I finish off the last one I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling okay it'll probably be closer to three because I'm on my way to go see bad times at the El Royale is that the name the new Drew Goddard movie the guy did cabin in the woods excited about that so I'll cut you guys after the movie and I'll let you know how this kiba there are a lot of pieces of packaging here key the ginger dark chocolate bar is hitting thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you in just a bit and welcome back to weeds it has been about two hours 45 minutes and change since I last seen you guys and I come back to you surprisingly conflicted about the kiva ginger dark chocolate bar if you will look at my eyes they will tell you I am quite high and I do feel very relaxed very at ease very peaceful however I don't want to say I feel high per se I feel just sort of more easygoing and more relaxed and I might be confusing this I might this might just be a total placebo a factor I've sort of gotten into my own head and the confirmation bias type thing um I have heard however that's for some people CBD counter affects the psychoactive properties of THC and this can make you feel the CBD sort of effects and you know the more relaxing effects of THC as well but not this sort of more whoa man kind of high aspects and I think that might be what happened to me here ah for some people that's gonna be great that is going to be a jackpot that's gonna be exactly what they want for me it's not what I was looking for I was really hoping for more of a the classic head-high experience especially seeing the movie I just got out of Drew Goddard bad times at Hotel at the El Royale something like that I can't remember all those nouns so I was hoping to be really high for that movie because Drew Goddard likes to spend some crazy yarns and said I was just really chilled out and and you know I was a little disappointed unfortunately this is not gonna be the Kiva for me however I am NOT gonna give it a disapproval or I'm not gonna give it the thumbs down because I think for this a certain customer one who perforce prefers the more gist chilled out relaxed style of weed might really love this for me however it's just not exactly what I was looking for not what I was hoping for but that is not Kiva's fault I I knew that that was a possibility going in so just wanted to give you guys that heads-up that the CBD seems to be pretty effective in here so if you love CBD and THC maybe give this one a shot if you are like me and like the sort of Moorhead high this sort of more psychedelic sort of side of I wanna you'll want to stick with the traditional Kiva's which I have no problem recommending wholeheartedly so this one is a little bit mixed for me unfortunately but again that is not not an endorsement or not telling you to avoid it so I'm going to before I bounce here though guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that I do not have mixed feelings over and that is another Drew Goddard movie because I did have some similarly mixed feelings to this key lebar about bad times at hotel Royale something elroy out whatever the name of the movie is but his second movie I think cabin in the woods from 2012 is a fantastic movie I'm sure you've probably seen it and I'm sure somebody if you haven't has spoiled it for you but if not check it out it is an utter utter riot one of the most inventive movies and years just an absolute blast love that movie two thumbs up for Drew Goddard cabin in the woods one thumb up one kind of half cocked for the hotel Royale and about the sort of same for that keepa bar I think that sort of sums it all up I'm still pretty high just not the same high I wanted to be and that's gonna do it for real this time thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "ORCdvawQ69w": "but now I hope everyone is having a good ass day today I plan to it's a shitty [ __ ] Monday and we're gonna start things off right it's about 950 in the morning and I got one of these to get me through the day this is a medicated nerds rope seriously strawberry 400 milligrams of THC this is going to be wild yo it says I like I don't show you guys the whole thing just like sharing hair I get from Cali it says da right there I'm in Maine so other side of the country I shoulda thought about the fact I have braces it doesn't feel like I should be eating it and like 10:00 in the morning but you get strong but no this is obviously gonna take a while so I'm just gonna eat this real quick for you guys and check back in later at some point I'm dropping little nerd [ __ ] everywhere [ __ ] sweet I like don't eat candy but actually not enjoying this I really don't like this it's like the Nerds of the sour pirate but I don't even think that that has any THC in it it's probably all on the gummy so [ __ ] not pleasant to eat I'm sorry [ __ ] it's so [ __ ] sugary like halfway there it's all in my teeth gonna be tasting this [ __ ] for like an hour bought some blackberry Kush mostly endicott [ __ ] within because if you guys ever wondering if I have like a strain preference I mean I guess it's based on whatever I want to do like if I had like a whole day planned out where I wanted to get stoned but I had to go do things I'd pick a sativa but what the [ __ ] but most of the time I smoked to relax so I do enjoy like in the car better more often doesn't taste like weed at all that's not what I mean when I say it tastes bad it's just so [ __ ] sweet it's like early [ __ ] I took a shot of whiskey like it was like a little bit of whiskey and like a glass of my my throat's been like getting sore if you ever like feel like your throats getting sore and you take like a shot of alcohol or something for like an hour I'll just start to feel better but so I have that like sitting in my stomach a little bit and it's [ __ ] tangent well I'm sorry I from choosing if I'm chewing my mouth or talking on my mouth shooting with my mouth open I might already be stoned I don't even know fully last little bite here the video and see how this 400 milligram edible hits me etc ear actually I miss that but I guess it's supposed to work in 60 minutes I don't think that's a hundred percent if that's not represent accurate everybody obviously everyone's metabolism is [ __ ] different through it you'll make it hopefully I'm making it I'll check that few guys in a little bit all right so checking back in with y'all it's about two hours later I'm pretty stoned but like I don't know definitely not a stone as I like thought it would be so I'm just smoking now but I don't know I'm just I'm definitely kind of time just like feeling a little more tired but it's nothing like it's nothing like too crazy rolled up a little Jay got the absinthe flavored papers but he'll be here left this the main live cards as I've showed this pen yet but it's got like a little different voltage options of warm that up this cart is some blackberry Kush hybrid mostly indica so yeah I think I told you guys fun at the end of coz oh yeah let's give it a rip should I turn it down a little bit right there to about like 2.75 and then we'll take a blinker and hey I hate it like it's so awkward because like the cart [ __ ] never like screws on to like match up with the button so like five buttons right in front the [ __ ] mouthpiece is like awkward Cheers now I'm pretty big but I want to try some [ __ ] like I want to have either like a few 500 milligram edible doses all at once I'm just see what that's like because I really want to see if y'all got if you all remember my own the first time I ever took edibles story - it was crazy we don't really know what the dosing was but there's a slight chance there might have also been acid in it which if you eat that with edibles just makes it like way more I'm trying to think of the word like it just enhances the effects of like both highs I think and but yeah I know I want to see if that was like if that was the case or if that feeling is like 1500 milligrams worth of edibles because if it is I'm trying to [ __ ] get there - yeah that was such it was a good day but it was like a terrible day at the same time cuz like I wasn't expecting it is there I don't know there were times I was like worried there's a long [ __ ] story you guys should go back and watch that video if you haven't thought was a [ __ ] it was a banger oh [ __ ] well battery's just about dead anyways plug this [ __ ] and I know I think you know this this is like a pretty decent edible for me I just I need to take more but now mm-hmm I hope you guys enjoy the video I'm definitely gonna be takin I'll do a video of me taking a shitload more edibles um have like a big-ass me I'll have like a bunch of different [ __ ] to eat drinks it's actually a dope idea anything but no drop a like if you guys enjoyed the video comment and favorite way to smoke away smoking from state country whatever but yeah stay lifted everybody have a good a stay in peace y'all", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "FU08QFLnMkI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we will be talking about los angeles's own la familia chocolate the mint flavor to be exact [Music] now la familia is a la based edible company that specializes in mexican style candies and drinks the packaging my goodness tell me how gorgeous this box it came in is now the first time i tried la familia was around three years ago and the packaging was very different i think they've done two rebranding since so it comes in this small box and i really like all the details on it the the name you can see on the side in the back here you'll get all their kind of like calories ingredients and all their disclaimers i love the little detail on this part on the bottom where it says there's no taste like home i love that so basically when you get the packaging you open it up bamboozled there will be a statement from the creator which i really like and then up here you'll get a little diagram of your candy bar and i'll show you how every little stick of the chocolate is 10 milligrams which is super cool now inside that packaging you will find this little bag and this bag contains your candy bar now again i love the color i love the whole theme but i do have some bones to pick with this part of the packaging because it doesn't work it doesn't work basically like this your candy bar goes across um right here it shows where you're supposed to put your fingers and your post a pinch and when you pinch the plastic as opposed to kind of flour open and you're supposed to be able to peel it back and grab your candy bar but since the candy bar is so big where you pinch the candy bar is still there so you can never get it tight enough to where this opens up i was trying for like 30 minutes trying to get it to where it would open and i was never successful at some point i just gave up and i took my scissors and cut it open so that's that's the problem so whoever is in charge of that maybe kind of rethink this i don't know something needs to change inside of that you will find your chocolate bar now i love that they have their name on it as well i thought that was super super cool and it does have a little wheat leaf on the side here so in case a parent finds this and it's like can i give this to my kid do not give this to your child now if you're someone who's into micro dosing or taking less at a time the size of this candy bar is a real benefit because if this is 10 milligrams then of course this will be five and then this will be 2.5 so there you go that's a really nice part of this product because it leaves it open for you to be able to dose yourself how much you need so let's talk about the flavor and the smell so if you're concerned about cannabis smell or taste you definitely don't get it at all on these edibles not one bit the mint flavor is very tasty very strong and it's mixed with a dark chocolate which i loved and it gives it a really familiar taste very similar to you would say like an andes mint or anything like that it's just a really tasty chocolate so if you like dark chocolate and you like mint the combination on these two is to die for you you won't be making a bad decision i'm telling you it's just a really great tasting chocolate you can't go wrong with it you can tell the quality when you try it as for the high the high is very heavy and i loved it i'm here for it the body high is strong i felt it was just a really great high i felt the body high is intense and so is the head high it is just a really great heavy edible if you're someone with a higher tolerance this is inedible than i would suggest if you're someone with a lower tolerance micro dose it as low as possible as you think around 5 to 2.5 and see how that feels for you for me this was great at about 40 milligrams i loved it i was i was chilling um another great thing about this high is that it's not extremely long uh it only lasted for me for about four hours and then i fell asleep which is great though because sometimes you're not looking for highs it'll last you your whole day sometimes you do just want to knock out wake up and have a brand new day which for me this was that now if you're someone who is going to be going to maybe a party and you're going to want to stay up and you're going to want to drive home at some point la familia chocolate is not for you but if you're someone who's going to be chilling at the house maybe hanging out with your family and looking for something that also can help with a sleep aid or some sort of body recovery some sort of muscle recovery this chocolate is absolutely great um i did get the heavy sleeps but that is something sometimes you want from an edible so for the overall experience i would definitely suggest la familia chocolates especially if you're someone like me who takes edibles quite a bit and likes a heavier edible this one is for you it is really tasty really nice the cannabis flavor is nowhere to be seen on it so yeah if you guys go out and you guys see a lot familiar i would say pick them up as for the price i've kind of seen the price range between 19 to 24 so i guess it just depends on what dispensary you go to and what they're selling it at so yeah try it out i loved it it's definitely something i'm going to be buying again and again and again so my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for watching the haze please leave a comment below let me know if you guys tried the law familiar chocolates let me know what you thought about them did they hit for you did they work because they definitely worked for me um please hit that like button please hit that subscribe button i'm trying to get to 100 subscribers so that would be super awesome again my name is sarah b you're watching the haze and we'll catch you next time [Music] you", "4P2-eqMOeT8": "[Music] welcome to week skies the marijuana review show and I'm the one with the cavalier lis throwing around these scissors and I've got scissors in my hand not because I'm reviewing scissors I'm sure that there probably is a market out there for somebody who wants to review scissors no I've got scissors because I'm here to open a tough package one that I knew I'm gonna have trouble with but one that I am excited for because it is my one of my favorite kinds of edibles and that is the chocolate bar ooh the Sun is making that very difficult to see bad son bad bad son la familia it's the product of Los Angeles the mint flavor I read all the Spanish in English oh it looks like there's like four years of Spanish paid off so this is the la familia de la I almost said that terribly mint to flavor 200 milligrams of THC really that is quite obnoxious how that shows up they're very thin curtains I have um very simple packaging on this it's just like a little aluminum wrapper on this green kind of iridescent packaging you can feel not much to it again just like a sticker on an aluminum packaging it does have nutrition facts and ingredients on the back which is great but no lab test results so this is came from a black market or gray market dispensary in California because we all we all know all legal edibles are now 100 milligram edibles topped and they have to be ten servings or more this is an old-school 200 don't give a [ __ ] how many servings so let's go ahead and cut open the top here take a look at this chocolate bar give it a taste and if you've never tuned in before and if you have tuna before you must really [ __ ] hate here this by now but if you haven't the way of the reviews work here on weeds is I'm gonna eat a little bit of this here in front of you not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but rest assured I'll eat this whole thing and then after I finish it I will come back to you guys in another two hours write us about when you'd be peaking to let you know how the product is actually hitting because that's what you're really in it for that's what you really care about is you know is it really gonna make you is it really gonna work not so much how it tastes okay Wow a very basic looking chocolate bar here totally basic it doesn't even have like an imprint with their logo on it or anything it is just what 12 squares of or twelve rectangles of chocolate I'm not gonna break it off into single rectangles let's just give it bite on three it smells like no I don't really detect a cannabis odor to it definitely a mint odor I'm a fan of mint chocolate I know there are a lot of mint chocolate haters out there I don't understand that but teach their own okay that's pretty good chocolate I'm decent quality chocolate for sure the mint flavor is not overwhelming I've definitely had some mint chocolates that are way more minty flavor more of a hint of mint here which is nice really no cannabis tasting I can't really detect much of any no hmm well what I hope that means is the chocolate is excessively masking the flavor of the cannabis and not that there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there mmm I never got to mention I picked this up on at the dispensary that I mentioned for $17 I believe which is two dollars more than they charge for a two hundred and thirty sixty milligram delta-9 which are excellent so high expectations for the la familia mint 200 milligrams here well guys I'm gonna eat another nine squares of this and then I will be back to you as I said in two hours let you know how it's hitting thanks for watching weights guys see in just a bit peace [Music] it's two hours later hi guys welcome back uh it has been 2 hours since I had the la familia and that still does not show up very well on this camera and I apologize for that there's a little bit of a better angle and the familiar the family that la familia is together families together is my review the end no my more elaborate view is it's pretty good it's not the most potent chocolate bar I've ever had chocolate bars are usually I believe the strongest and best vector for THC this one doesn't feel like a - like a kiva equivalent to me certainly not not even close really but it's still pretty good I'm at about a 6 right now some somewhere in that range so it's not you know terrible I've had 200 milligram edibles that are way worse and it didn't it tasted pretty good there's really no cannabis taste so you know on the whole I it's not the best you know there are certainly better chocolate bars out there I still would even probably recommend one of the new Kiva 100 milligrams over this la familia 200 milligram but if it's although your dispensary has and you like the chocolate bars this one's got a good taste it'll still do the job it's just probably not honest about that 200 milligrams would be my guess so if you have no other options and you like chocolate grab it otherwise go with one of the better brands pick up a kiva pick up a default say even probably a chill that one doesn't taste as good but I think it's more potent so stick with the bit the bit better brands if you can otherwise la familia is not a bad alternative and that is gonna do it for this review and before I go I'm gonna give you a very quick cherry on top guys just a soup quick little cherry on top something just so delightful and hairy I'll get you out of here real quick and that is cursing swearing profanity I mean I've been profanity since before my teenage years [ __ ] I [ __ ] love cursing it's the [ __ ] [ __ ] damn [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] it's great um if you if you don't curse a lot you should curse more if you don't curse at all what the [ __ ] is wrong with you cursing is the best the science is on my side you know they say that people who curse are more intelligent they're more honest they're more empathetic I've read that they actually have bigger dongs and that they're also better lovers to that I most of those are things that I've read so uh curse say [ __ ] a lot you'll like it la familia it's not that shitty thank you for sticking around to the end of this cherry on top thank you for sticking tuned to the end of this review appreciated Alice always guys it's been a [ __ ] blast see on the next week's peace", "vOZQqYB52Lk": "[Music] what's up fun wolf and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show we help you make sense of your dispensary cocoa cocoa classic episode today and that means edible my favorite of all cannabis products we are taking a look at ed abou and I believe our second product may be third from Moon Moon Moon intergalactic milligram each intergalactic milligram each milligrams milligrams so this is a 100 milligrams of they're a rocket fudge sounds good I've had their spaceman mint bar before also 100 milligrams and I found it to be excellent so I'm coming up this one with some pretty high expectations we've got some pretty standard packaging but nice you know it's got everything you want to see on it including the lab testing results right there on the front from SC Labs which is great and then on the back you've got your nutrition information your ingredients and then right there whoops on that side mirrors are reversed it shows you your different ten milligrams serving size suggestions I think they're supposed to have discrete different little things but they don't but who cares and I picked this up from a brand new dispensary in Long Beach opened just yesterday called the lift and I picked it up for 20 bucks which is pretty expensive but not that expensive for a Long Beach okay oh wow and then look at this we've got even more packaging there on the inside with the childproof zipper thingy I think I figured out this one boy I have seen probably probably five that seems about right five different childproof mechanisms these modern child proofing packages I've seen and they're all different and they all are infuriating in their own little ways like this one I can see what I'm supposed to do but the mechanism isn't lining up right let's hope they get this [ __ ] ironed out soon because it sucks not to have that all right oh here we go here are the moon bars there are half of them there all right no there are six so there should be four remaining in here oops and there we go there the other four they say THC on them and this is the rocket fudge let's shut up and stick it in my mouth hall and of course guys I'm gonna be eating the whole thing not just the one ten milligram piece um that eat the whole hundred milligrams and then come back to you guys at the end of the review to let you know how all this is hitting so two hours later I'll come back to you guys mmm yuck as far as chocolate goes that's one of those cannabis tea tasting chocolates I've ever had um this chocolate doesn't mask the cannabis flavor really at all but that could be a great thing I've got my fingers crossed that that means this is potent as hell and they've got a lot of strong THC and vibed weed in there but if taste is important to you stick to your kiba's stick to your defenses cuz this does not taste good I'm actually surprised by how bad it tastes mmm well it does have me optimistic that this thing is gonna rock my world when when we come back so again taste ooh not so great especially for chocolate but it's all about that potency and so guys I'm gonna eat the last remaining six of these and then I'll come back to you guys two hours after I finish the last one to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching to this point and I'll see you guys very soon boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom moon moon moon moon moon if I want to get banned from it YouTube I'd show you my ass right now guys it's been about three hours since I actually had moon that's because I was feeling so nice and so relaxed and so high that I wanted to just keep on with that bus and three hours later I am still quite high this is another real win for moon it tastes bad it's one of the worst tasting chocolates I've ever had but but but it is only a hundred grams or sorry grams calories which is so much better than like the Korova mini cookies I know I just had like the Pete's mini cookies and they had 700 calories you had to eat a [ __ ] it tastes really bad to be honest but you have to only eat so little that little chocolate bars only like that big you know that wide so you just you know you can eat it in three bites and be done with it it's not gonna be pleasant but you are gonna get really stoned and you're not gonna have to eat a whole lot if you want to just grab something to split between three buddies pop it in your mouth man this will get three pretty people probably pretty feeling pretty high before like a show movie whatever moon has been surprisingly man for a smaller edible company or seemingly smaller I don't see them a lot of places I have really enjoyed my time with them this is a big big thumbs up for me guys so if you see moon in their rocket fudge or I think I reviewed their spaceman mint before go for it man they're great and guys right before I balance here I'm going to share with you something that is weed related as a cherry on top I knew I normally try to share something without you or share something with you that is not weed related but I want to go ahead and share with you something that you can definitely use I've had this bad way for a year now although it's oddly gross on the top this grinder is amazing Black Tie grinders used it every time I have flour don't really have to clean it very often it's just a very very sharp very very handy grinder I think it cost me 20 something dollars on Amazon you know upgraded from like the two dollar pieces of plastic [ __ ] to something really nice and the Black Tie grinders is quite as as nice as their logo implies so that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review both great products wholeheartedly endorse both thank you so much for watching to the end you big jerks and by jerks I mean Best Buddies thanks again and we will see you guys on the next review doses"}
