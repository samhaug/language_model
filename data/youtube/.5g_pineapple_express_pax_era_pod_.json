{"mW3H8wB8HAY": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy terpe time and welcome back to my awesome medical cannabis review and this one as you guys can see snow monster by strain live live pax

hard through the mouthpiece quickly to clear the airway if the clog remains insert the pod into the device and take two to three short hard puffs on the pod also try increasing your temperature setting on your error pro device with the pop and click gesture to increase vapor production unless you see an odd blinking pattern era is functioning as designed if the airpath still seems clogged we recommend returning the pod to the licensed dispensary you purchased it from sometimes in colder environments the wick in the pod may have trouble absorbing the cannabis for vaporization keep the pods stored upright allowing the contents of the pot to stay in contact with the wicks keeping the pod close to your body heat to keep it warm enclosed in your hand or in a pants pocket also try increasing the temperature setting on your device to increase vapor production sometimes a pod might appear to be half empty this can happen when a pod is left on its side and is not stored upright if your pod shows oil on only one side of the tank stand it upright after a few minutes both sides should be filled pods that have thicker oil sometimes stay to one side longer as the oil moves slowly through the pot", "e5_B8K5nk2U": "loja brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your friend came back to do another review for y'all today got something interesting for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there we've got a pax era pod for the old packs era coming from Soleil it's Salette unplugged this is a hybrid strain that's coming in at six hundred and seventy three milligrams THC and ninety seven point three one milligrams CBD so it's hitting about seven sixty seven percent THC in about nine percent maybe ten percent CBD not much yeah I've tried this before and flower from Soleil it's always been pretty satisfying before it's their version of rock star cush unplug so really eager to try it out in a packs air pod it's 0.5 gram pod it's like a 510 threaded cart but you use it for the packs Eric comes in these little pods like this and you just put it on there and away you go works a lot like a jewel like a jewel nicotine device just like an e-cigarette same thing same device same idea in fact it's the same company jewel started out as pax labs and broke off into jewel so pretty innovative product pretty cool I haven't seen a lot of these around really wanted to try it out ever since bought my pax era down when I was in Oregon tried a whole bunch of pods out down there in Washington love the thing been really eager for it to show up in Canada and finally I got my hand on a few of these pots so we're gonna check this one out today I just want to show you on the side here it shows that it's a hundred percent plant-based ingredients so any added terpenes are plant-based and not artificial so it's good to know that it's a bit of a unique package here let me just also show you here at the packaging date is December 5th 2019 so it is what June 3rd so it's been sitting around for a little while but it should be okay I think yeah it's an area company so a the one oh yes what I wanted to show you was packaged it's it's unique it's weird so it says here push finger through circle then push and hold the inner tab firmly in continue holding tab pull and flap to open like there's a little bit complicated here for something that is a pod that's about this big let's check it out so tells us to push here alright and hold tab in and pull huh I don't understand so you hold this in and you pull this part out it's not very easy to open so push finger through help push and hold the inner tab firmly in hmm very strange packaging design here by some way we're just gonna rip it open cuz this is nuts nice job alright so once you get inside this insanely labyrinthine nutso packaging here completely unnecessary by the way oh you get your little slave packs pod so there you go it's got the THC logo on there as you're all used to assess branded with so late um doesn't say unplug anywhere on there you can see this is what the oil looks like in these packs air pods it doesn't look like a lot but there's 0.5 grams in there and I've had these before they're pretty concentrated they're pretty good the ones I've had before so all you do is you take this off you're not if you have one on take your packs error make sure it's fully charged take it just like a jewel device put it on there you go it lights up it's ready to go um you know unfortunately I would love to show you the app that goes with this but it's really not set up for the Canadian market yet what a cool feature on this is you can go in here and you can look for the pod that you've bought choose it and select certain temperatures it's not set up for Canada at all yet it only shows states in the United States where it's illegal and in fact even searching for Canadian LPS or any products comes up with no result it's really disappointing that you know the releasing packs pause in the Canadian market and their app isn't even set up for it yet because it is a pretty cool app I've used it for the American pods before it comes with sort of preset temperatures for each pod for best flavor best vapor it's kind of cool neat little temp temperature settings in there kind of cool um I just got it set to sort of a basic temperature right now I actually can't remember what temperature the last pod was but we're just gonna rip on this and see what it's like straight out of the box right into the pack Sara whoa Wow dad there's a lot of taste going on here it's very fruity uh first thought when I inhaled this and took a drag with fruity pebbles this tastes like fruity pebbles there's a lot of flavors going on there I'm very fruity probably one of the most flavorful cartridges or pods that I've had Wow I know it's Rockstar cush is what this strain it's their version of Rockstar cush I've never got a fruity pebbles taste from Rockstar cush before but while I'm really enjoying this taste very fruity very yummy yeah first impressions on the taste very good nice and smooth very smooth packs air pod like I said just like a jewel pod it's gonna last a little while but we're gonna get back to that because of course as always I'm gonna be smoking this over the next couple days gonna come back and finish up the review gonna let you know my final thoughts and let you know what to think about the soleil unplug pax air pop alright so after vaping this pack Sarah Soleil unplugged pod the last couple of weeks got some thoughts for you um I really like this pod the flavor is still there mmm it's a fruity pay the fruity pebbles flavor I really love it very fruity very flavorful I love it the flavor is lasted throughout the whole pod as you can see I've been vaping a lot of this here it's getting down to the nitty gritty they're not too heck of a lot left as it looks but looks can be deceiving with these packs air pods a little bit goes a long way in there as you can see it's not a very big pot to begin with but it does last quite a while I've been ripping on this quite a bit almost like a jewel going a little overboard that's one thing I'll be careful with these things so you know standard use it's gonna last you quite a long time never got plugged up once always nice and clear always a good vapor never harsh like I said unfortunately the apps not working in Canada packs get your act together get this app working in Canada so there's no settings for it I did find a similar pod an American pod I've got it vaping at about five hundred and six degrees those curious out there with the temple eyes and you know it produced a really good flavor really good vapor for the Sun lay on plug like I said the flavor last the throat the effects you get off it it's a little bit mild it's it's really it's happiness it's happiness strain you feel really good you feel happy you feel mellow just feel relaxed like you're floating along like I said there's days when I really ripped on this a lot and get a little foggy great you know it's not really energetic go get a lot of important things done kind of strain but you're gonna be coast and throughout the day and just feeling really happy real conversational real mellow I really like the buzz you get off this it's not super strong like I say you have like three four drags it's kind of a mild effect overall but you do notice it and you just feel really good you can't help but keep smiling I like this thing a lot great job so lay on the taste great job sway on the effects great job on everything except the packaging that packaging was ridiculous get better packaging packs fix your app get it working for the Canadian market because it's a really cool app and I'd really love to use it so it all of us here so get it working for us the price is good we'd love to see it be cheaper it's 45 bucks approximately for one of these pods really like to see the price come down but I really like to see all the prices come down so that's Universal but for what you're gonna get 45 bucks it's comparable to about a 5-10 thread cartridge there's also point five grams lasts about the same amount of time and I got to tell you packs air pods in my experience a pretty potent really good stuff so my review is overwhelmingly glowing I'd say thumbs up find yourself with a pax era device definitely seek out these pods you will not be disappointed thanks for watching hope you all found it informative if you've tried this before you agree with me if think I'm right think I'm wrong whatever the hell is on your mind leave me a comment I like to read them all I replied every one of them while you're here click Subscribe I do videos all the time I like to make new friends so click Subscribe you'll be the first one to see when there's a new one you know what brothers and sisters I hope you're all staying safe out there taking care yourselves taking care of each other until next time keep smoking", "7pdgC2TnHfk": "[Music] today I'll be reviewing and comparing the tax era and the cz against each other to show you the differences the pros and cons of both and which is actually worth it one of the interesting things about pods is with the tax area you get pods that are licensed out to processors like abstract here in Washington but Stevie actually makes their pods under their own brand of Stevie but is working with local processors and flour I'm sure you guys want to figure out which one is best for you so let's just jump into it first up we have the steezy this brand started in LA but has started growing rapidly to other states I purchased a prefilled cartridge for $30 from a local dispensary and the battery was free with a pod purchase after you get through the one-page instruction booklet and the micro USB cable you get to the actual Stevie which is a little bit more difficult than it looks to get out with bigger fingers yeah the battery again is very basic no buttons no visible indents just their logo on the side and a place to plug in many people have issues with fakes TZ pods and batteries this can be extremely harmful to your health but as long as you purchase from a trusted retailer and not your plug on Instagram you should be fine but they pride themselves on labs tested premium quality concentrates unlike their packaging which is not so premium due to their childproof compliant packaging but if you're a rebel like me you can open it differently you can also spot fakes TV pods by they're slightly different packaging including black trays holding the pod I did have one incident where the gold pins on the bottom of this easy pod didn't allow it to connect to the battery overall the stevesie is a great option for taking your concentrates on the go it's a simple and discreet device that makes even seasoned divers think twice about pods now let's take a look at the PAX era my dispensary didn't have any deals on the battery so I paid the full $30 the packaging on this is great and really makes the product feel premium and hey the even has a cutout for a big ten people longer instructions for all the features they packed into it and a sticker to wrap the brand as I mentioned before I went with more of a premium concentrate with AD abstract cartridge local processor you sell pods for around 30 to $75 each this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the quality around you the packs has this useful feature on it that shows you the battery life and you can use to change settings on-the-fly the packs instantly became my everyday carry and is the one I would prefer having out of these two I really do enjoy the airflow and the strength of a hit from a cz but the smooth reliable hit from a packs and the customization of your experience along with a beautiful design and a feature-rich device the packs also connected via bluetooth to control temperature hit size and even play games if you want me to dive deeper into either one of these vape pens have a suggestion for another vape pen or just a question let me know down below if you want to see more cannabis related content like this stay subscribe to see my newest videos like the next one we'll be showing you how to refill these pods with your own concentrates or follow me on social media if you enjoyed the review please leave a like thanks for watching", "GkRne8rVJek": "hey guys and welcome back to my channel to my youtube channel in this video I want to show you and tell you about some of the packs pods that I have tried with my pack era that's this thing and I do have one video about the PAX era device if you want to watch it I can link it below for you or maybe I'll put it in the recommended so suggested thing so look out for that if you want to find out what the PAX era is where you can get it in Florida etc I mean I guess I can spoil that right now because I'll tell you where the PAX pods came from pax pods in Florida are currently being dispensed by Liberty Health Sciences which is a Florida medical marijuana dispensary so these are for purchase only by medical marijuana patients right now we do not have recreational marijuana in the state of Florida it's just medical at this point and therefore medical marijuana patients they're not for sale on this channel I just have to say this as a disclaimer I'm not selling these this is not an advertisement it's not sponsored it's simply a video made up of my own opinions so I hope you guys like it and let's jump in here we go now the first packs pod that I would like to discuss with you why am I talking like that the first pack pod that I am going to talk to the first packs fun but I'm going to talk about in this video it's going to be the riff hybrid strain called Jack Frost so Liberty Health Sciences is selling their own name brand Liberty Health Sciences pods I think that's the case I know that they're definitely selling obviously this brand or sub-sub brand can we call it that for the sake of this video out there selling this sub brand called riff and then another I'm calling it a sub brand Mary's medicinals which I do believe they also have products that are in other dispensaries in other states possibly Canada if I'm not mistaken it might just be Canada I don't know go do some research but I'm pretty sure the Mary's medicinals is not unique to Florida it's out there in other places too about riff I'm not sure I didn't really look into riff too far but yeah so these are couple of the different sub brands that you can buy of packs pods at Liberty Health Sciences I started out with one of these and this was the first one I had so there's barely any product left in this pot at this point I got it when I got the pack era device and that was a few weeks ago I want to say like two weeks ago maybe so I talked about this a little bit in my pax era video but I didn't really go into too much detail but I did say that this has 400 milligrams of THC which is true about about 400 milligrams think you ever take a few milligrams for the person that told me that I don't know what a half gram is the easiest way to explain to you that there's a half to show you that on the package it literally says it right there net weight half a gram so just a side note when you're buying a medical marijuana product in Florida the milligram amount that's listed on the product is usually the amount of active ingredient in the product not the net weight of the amount of product that you're buying does that make sense I hope it does if it doesn't let me know in the comments and we'll do a video all about that if you don't know how to read the products I can give you some pointers on that it's pretty simple once you figure it out but I will say that milligram account thing does throw some people off like so back to that riff pod for example so I said this is a half gram pod and that is true it's just there's 80 percent THC so there's 20% more grams in the net weight of this product than 400 milligrams which equals 500 milligrams for a half gram so I know it's kind of annoying and confusing but anyway I just wanted to mention that it looks like what I could see on the internet I'm pretty sure that no matter where you are like all the packs air pods are half gram size so yeah they don't believe I saw any that were a gram or anything like that but but I do feel like I got a lot of drugs of vapor out of the pod because you do have like I said in the pack zero device video temperature control options so you can use this on a really low temperature and still get a nice inhalation of vapor or you can use the session control or you can use both simultaneously so and that'll help you to extend the life of your pod longer than you know then you might be able to without a pack Sara device so okay I did say that this has 400 milligrams of THC which is true roughly about about 400 milligrams think give or take a few milligrams so I um so I said this is a half gram pod and that is true it's just there's eighty percent THC so there's a twenty percent like there's 20% more grams in the net weight of this product than 400 milligrams which equals 500 milligrams for a half gram so I know it's kind of annoying and confusing but anyway it looks like everywhere from what I could see on the internet I'm pretty sure that no matter where you are like all those packs era pods are half gram sized so yeah I don't believe I saw any that were a gram or anything like that but I do feel like I got a lot of Jags of vapor out of the REC pod because you do have like I said in the packs area device video I'm version control options so you can use this on a really low temperature and still get a nice inhalation of vapor or you can use the session control or you can use both simultaneously and that'll help you to extend the life of your pod longer so the Rif accrued strain and Jack Frost this pod is $65 when you buy it from the dispensary or at least it is at the time that I'm making this video like I said there's not a lot of product in there anymore but there's a little bit and there's enough to get a few drugs but it's really not much according to the patient insert for this product this pot is made up of the following ingredients the only ones listed are Delta 9 THC CBD and cannabis plant extract on the rift pod that is the THC level of this product is 80.4% the CBD amount is only 0.2% with the active ingredient totals coming in at 80.6% the remaining 19.4% is most likely terpenes which are a common ingredient in inhalation THC products especially here in Florida I mean probably everywhere but yeah they're definitely present and a lot of the vaping products that we have that are made with THC and or CBD what's more terpenes are definitely listed in the ingredients of the merese medicinal pots that I got so I'm assuming that that these also have terpenes why would they not know but didn't say on the packaging in my experience I don't think I don't know I lost this part of the Rif packaging so it may have set it on here it may have set it on there but I don't have that anymore so the distillate inside of this pod was definitely the darkest out of any of the three pods that I had it can be described as having a dark amber color to it the distillate that is while the color is dark it still has a high level of clarity and you can see it into the pod according to the patient insert and product information sheet for this pod the oil is extracted her if I'm using Liberty Health Sciences proprietary process which maintains a full spectrum of cannabis terpenes and cannabinoids so I don't know what extraction method they're using for this because it's a proprietary thing I don't know what it is they're right in the insert that combined with a high-quality wickless ceramic coil this product provides a clean smooth aromatic vapor while maintaining the entourage effects of the plant I would say that's pretty accurate and the taste of the Jack Frost podge by the way just so you know what it tastes like kinda it's not super weedy tasting but it does have some really nice it's kind of very like tones to the aroma I think it's really nice really yummy it was okay now let's discuss another pax pod from Liberty Health Sciences this one is going to be the Mary's Medusa THC sativa blend pod and that is in here so here's the THC pod this is the THC blend like I said the color of this oil is going to be a little bit lighter for shirt and the rift pod oil it is a similar tone in color it's kind of like an Amber it's like the color of honey almost it looks like to me and once again the distillate is very very clear it looks like it's not cloudy in nature it has the marries medicinals two M's engraved in this side and then this side has the THC blend name on it which is awesome because then you don't not know which one you're using if you don't take note of like what the color looks like or whatever this way you have the name of the strain right there and the Jack Frost did have that as well I like that they have that on there makes it a lot easier in case you're not always using the right packaging your for your pods when you're like running around and you have your pods with you so this is where it says Jack Frost on the rift pod and it says R it's on this side but this is the Mary's missiles so this pod was not quite as expensive as the rift pod and he's really the same price these two Mary's medicinals once I got this is the 301 CBD blend that we'll talk about in a second this is the THC City machlin and these were each $50 from the dispensary so on the note of pricing let's talk about that for just a second I think that this price is a little bit more reasonable for packs pod we have a selection now of prices for the pods I was excited to see when they included these on the website that they were 50 dollars and not 65 and 75 like the first round of pods were that they released it looks like in other states it's pretty standard for the pricing to be anywhere from like $40 is where it seems to start in some states and then it goes all the way up to 69 and 79 dollars in some cases I'm guessing that those higher priced ones are gonna be your like higher end or perhaps higher THC higher strength but you have a lot of different options in the other states you have different brands you have different dispensaries selling these and so you have all different kinds of options so we're kind of getting our own options here - with Liberty Health Sciences they're giving us the $50 pods that we have the $65 pods and then there's also a $75 pop that they sell but I'm glad that they don't go up beyond back in California it looks like the PAC's pods range in price from about $40 and up to as high as 69 and 79 like I said the PAC's pods are on the PAC's air website you can see all the different states and all the different pods when I first heard that we were getting the PAX era here I ran over to that website and saw like all the different pricing on the differ States versions of packs air at pods and I was like okay this is what I expect for the pricing and yeah I will say that $65 and $50 for one half grand pod it doesn't sound like a it doesn't sound like a good deal whatsoever but if you're somebody that's looking for a deal you might not want the packs air the pack Sara is kind of like a higher end device it's gonna be a higher price and it seems in my experience having used it now and looking at it and just experience again I talked Sara's like really well-designed and you can tell that it's a quality product so I'm the kind of person that doesn't mind paying for quality if I want quality and something I'm not mad about paying more and I understand that something that's better quality is gonna cost more so that's not to say that buying a gram of oil for like $60 at truly versus or Tara that's there's nothing wrong with that very sativa I really haven't finished the this paragraph already good the product is described as having the following amounts of active ingredients this is Mary's sativa button facts pod the product is described as having 56.9% THC so it's not as high as that 80% rift pack spot this is where the pricing does make a lot of sense to me you got your 80 percent THC pod at $65 you've got your 56.9% THC pod at $50 there is some consistency there you're paying for not as much off to active ingredients so you're not paying as much money which is cool because that's kind of how it should work I think all together it comes to 50 7.3% active ingredient that's the 56.9% THC 0.4% CBD and together it comes to 50 7.3% active ingredient it could be assumed that their remaining 42.7% of the product is terpenes because that's the only other thing that's listed as being in the ingredients list I don't know if there's any residual solvent in this product so the sativa one had a really nice taste to this pod reminds me so much of the sativa true pods from truly which I actually like a lot so those are out of my price range I can't really afford to always be buying the $94 two pods and I'm the obviously the person that likes to try like tons of different products so I'm not gonna like commit to one product if I don't have to and if I do I'm not gonna spend the $94 I could buy an oil syringe I truly get the same amount one gram I'm true clear and get that for $60 and 794 dollars so look at the sativa blend pod tastes a little bit like this a tiba2 pods like Gerben haze no like Durbin poison and Jack Herer now let's talk about the CBD pod from Mary's medicinals this is not just a CBD pod it's a three to one ratio of CBD to THC pod so it's not a straight CBD pod does have some THC but the CBD is gonna be definitely the highest in this product out of the three pods that I've been talking about here it doesn't have as much THC as the other pod see there because it is a three to one ratio of CBD to th the contents of the three two one pods are as follows 46% CBD and 17.4% THC the remaining 36.6% is presumably also terpenes I'm guessing as in the other two pax pod set because the other G pods have share means with love whatever the only two ingredients live still in the Mary's and there's no pods I got our cannabis extract at natural terpenes the color of this product is definitely the lightest of the three it's like a really really pale green kind of like the color of a peridot stone which is my birthstone it's like really really light green and it's also very very clear it has a pretty hue and light has no trouble passing through it the extract is translucent and clear the first time I had held the vapor from this poet I was surprised by the taste of it it's very different um it's not bad it's just really different it's not really what I was expecting but um I'll try my best to describe it to you it's a really clean tasting vapor look very very clean I guess would be the word that I used to describe it almost tastes like a spearmint sort of flavor but without a cooling minty experience cuz you don't really get that with this not like they think I'm menthol like anything it just has like that's the only thing I can really think to compare the flavor to is sort of like a spearmint peasant other than that it's almost like a salty breeze to like like if a salty breeze and a non minty spearmint had a lovechild that would be the taste of the CBD pot so the first time I inhaled from that I was like a little bit taken aback by the taste it was like wait why it's like I said it's kind of almost like a spearmint taste and it's actually kind of yummy so I'm done with it well the taste is definitely unique I wasn't mad at it and I didn't mind it I liked it actually that's about it on these pack spots for today that's about all I got for you guys I hope like the video so all I got for you guys today I hope that you liked this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up if you liked it let me know if you want me to try some other pax pods or let me

and we're going to be looking at fume extracts in the collaboration with gage cannabis they get their orange cookies on a full spectrum aeropod for the pax era and pax era pro roll intro [Music] so good to have you back for another video welcome back like i mentioned today we're going to be looking at the orange cookies tr signature from few max tracks it's a collaboration with gage cannabis for the pax era and here we have it and here's the little pod so what's a paxera it's a vaporizer for oils extracts uh you have packs also the pax 2 in the pax 3 and the pax 1 which are herb pax 3 actually does concentrates it too but that's a whole another world on another video that i might do in the future so pax era it's actually very similar to a jewel i'm not mistaking dual create packs labs or pack slabs create a jewel or their same system but this is for cannabis so in canada we don't have that many options when it comes to pods it's starting to grow more producers are starting to partnership with pax to create pods um so it's not that many producers right now in the us crazy but yeah canada's not that much but fortunately there are some really good ones like this one this is my favorite so far that i've tried this is my third pot i believe so i waited a little bit to try it a few times to do the full review um i mentioned this is a gauge cannabis strain orange cookies so this is a collaboration and let me give you a little uh description so orange cookies is a full spectrum oil it's a limited edition full spectrum extract from the tr signature line orange cookie's sweet citrus aroma and robust cannabinoid profile provide connoisseurs a sweet flavor and a full entourage effect the orange hookah strain is sourced from gage cannabis and process using fumes solvent less terpene extraction method followed by a proprietary co2 extraction to create a premium full spectrum oil and uh full spectrum extracts made with canada's premier single harvest craft grown flower so the strain translated so well into this full spectrum oil the taste the aromas the high is so smooth so good just delicious like i mentioned this is one of my favorite ones i have tried different uh pods and so far not too impressed but that's when fume comes in so they did this one with the gauge canvas freaking amazing they also did the ones with 48 north the day trip and the moonlight which i am going to be reviewing coming very soon and also full review of the pax era and the pax 0 pro once i get the pro so we're here for this one though so this one is coming in at a 76 percent thc and that's actually broken down into 60 thc uh 10 thc a and a two percent of cbga and then you have four percent of the terpenes which will give you that orange taste uh profile that it's in the in the flour and it translates really well into the oil um so this has no cbd and it's just freaking amazing so packs you have a little pod let me show you guys how to open this because i remember seeing a review of somebody's somebody opening a pod or trying to open the package and they couldn't figure it out it just like ripped it so obviously all of the stuff that you buy in canada has a chow lock or child proof packaging for this pods all you got to do is on the right side you have this tab that you push in right and then inside of there if you press all the way to the end like this there's a second tab so all you're going to do is just put one finger pressing both both tabs and then pull from here make sure you rip the seal first otherwise you're not going to be able to pull it out and there's your pod take it out of there make sure your thing is charged you don't need the app you can use this with an app and i'm pretty sure the app only works with android so it does not work on apple apple took all the apps to control vaporizers so it's only for android like i said it's not really it is good to use it if you have an android just because you can control the temperature by the degree so like by one degree perfectly from i believe it starts to like 3 20 all the way up to 420 um but also these pods uh on the on the packs regular uh you won't you have to manually look up the pod on the pax era pro the newer ones that have this red seal actually has a microchip that will communicate with the packs let it know which part it is so like i said on the pax era regular i'll show you on the app you can pull it up and then you can change the temperature but it also recommends you best temperature for flavor best temperature like expert that they are recommending the best temperature to use with this specific pod and then a best vapor temperature that will give you the most clouds but then you can bring it all the way up to 420 but then again that would be a little too hot you might be burning the oil um but at least you got the control through the app if you're going to do it manually you can still do it as well i'm going to show you guys in a second but let's get to what we got here you got your pot you got your packs area you're dying to try this because i've been talking for like six minutes and you're like dude just smoke it so all you're gonna do is just put in the pot in doesn't matter which side you'll see the four lights go on the main set is ready and you just take a drag through the app you can also change the color of this make it brighter dim it or dim it mine is pretty dim it's usually brighter that's it very nice vapor so this is always ready to go you don't have to press anything all you got to do is just put there's no sensor on the pot either so it's just by putting your lips in here you create a seal and then there's two holes on the side that drag air through here into the wick by heating it up so it's breath activated you decide how long you want to do your drag right now i think i have an expert temperature so it's the temperature that's most recommended by um fume so if you don't have the app i'll show you guys how to do it in the app you can change the temperature and all that but you don't want to use the app or you just don't have it because you're an iphone let's say so if you want to change the temperature all you're going to do is i'll let you know too now when you shake it like this you get the lights that's your battery um meter if you do that and then one more time you shake it again for like three seconds it goes to blue that's pairing mode for the app okay but let's say you don't wanna use the app and you wanna change the temperature all you gotta do is you shake it and if you pull out the pod it's gonna start going through the different petals see they eliminate those are the temperatures you have temperature one two three and four so in order to change it once you shake it once and you pull out the pod it's gonna cycle through the temperatures one two let's say i want temperature three put the pod back in it's on temperature three now and it's ready to go change a pod as simple as take one out put another one in uh it'll stay at the temperature that you last used so let's say that temperature might be too hot for this one i would bring it down like i said all you gotta do is shake it pull out the pod you change to the temperatures pull it back in and you can change the temperature that way um so there we go one two usually i keep it a three or two i usually don't use temperature number four it's too hot i already feel a little high from just those few pulls so remember this is a 76 percent thc so it is pretty strong so if you're uh novice or if you're new to uh cannabis especially thc extracts i would go very slow and low there's a reason why the app has microdose option you can tell it to microdolls and do small doses medium or large like i mentioned i'll show you right now what it's going to do is it's going to keep track and as you're pulling on it once it reaches 100 on what it knows it's to be a micro dose it cuts you out obviously you can override it but it's kind of like an aid to try to keep your either know how many doses you need so in that sense if you're new and let's say hey i don't know how much i should do before getting too high or whatever if you put on microdolls you can start like that do a microdolls and be like all right you know what i can handle microdolls or i can do two of those or maybe a medium or small so those are options to try to control the way you um you consume another thing with the app is that you can lock it so on android if you have the app i can actually lock the pack so if somebody were to try to use it it actually doesn't work uh i don't remember how i think as long as it's paired up it'll stay locked uh and then if it loses connection i guess it will unlock i'm not 100 sure that will be in the full review i'll mention that um okay so i think this video's getting uh long enough so what we're gonna do is hit this one more time because why not it tastes so good the high is amazing i feel pretty ripped now actually so we're going to stop smoking this because uh something to function thank you so much so much for tuning in make sure to check tr signature from fume extracts and their orange cookies engage cannabis collaboration they are going to be making other brands collaborations as well i am going to be reviewing the 48 day trip and moonlight uh pods so it's the indica and the

next one", "RBpsFKdqaHw": "I try to get to you know one or two shows a year like the American Jail Association or the American Corrections Association Jamie Mosley is a successful inventor who started a company and made a lot of money with an e-cigarette designed to be smoked in jails specifically his Jail how we doing on time you know 15 minutes Mosley is the jailer of Laurel County Kentucky he says he came up with his cigarette which he calls cross bar out of necessity when I developed the product it was really not with the intention of starting a company I was just trying to solve a problem with within my own facility Kentucky banned all tobacco products in jails in the mid-2000s over concerns about secondhand smoke it may have made inmates healthier but Mosley says it also made his life as a jailer a lot harder you know many of these inmates are coming in in a very intoxicated state whether that be from drugs heroin coming off of all of that and then without a cigarette at the same time sometimes can create very very volatile situations the idea for a jail specifically cigarette came quickly figuring out how to make one that inmates couldn't use as a weapon took a little longer one of our main objectives when we started was to be able to do this I mean everything out there had a metal casing or was a very very hard plastic casing that could be hammered down into a shank we've dressed that fairly easily but we also wanted something with a very low voltage so that you couldn't utilize it for an ignition source to start a fire with but we wanted something that was very you got to think of everything like that you do and that's the big advantage I guess that I have you know I live with 550 inmates every single day and I understand their behavior 986 today okay so you're gonna get the inmates ID make sure he is who he is give him his ID back next thing you want to go do is you're going to check and make sure this is the one I sold him last time I came around these men in Mosley's jail are part of a specialized drug rehabilitation program for them ethics are a useful crunch how'd you end up here well my drug addiction led me here cocaine charge and a theft charge and I've been here going on 90 days well you know their facilities where they did where they didn't have any e-cigarette option uh yes I've been another for sale these fake and has no way to go up sir down there so what's that like when you show up there and you have nothing oh it's nerve wracking this imagining won't for smoking two packs of cigarettes on the straight to nothing what what do you think when you got here found out they had this I was thought I was in Haven for a minute you know if you know Mosley's invention may help keep inmates happy but it's also a lucrative business cross bar is available in some 33 prisons and jails nationwide and the company is expected to do three and a half million dollars in sales this year you know there are also of course kind of a classically captive audience for your for your own product they're addicted yeah and they don't have any other choices you know we're not trying to capitalize on the or develop customer base you know to sell these people beyond release it's a tool and it was designed for the benefit of the facilities and if it helps them to cooperate and keeps my officers safer that that's a win-win for everybody it also means a lot of revenue for the jails they buy each ecig for Mosley for two to three dollars and then sell them to inmates at ten to fifteen bucks a pop at Mosley's Jail which buys the e-cigs at cost the proceeds are put back into things that benefit inmate welfare something kentucky state law mandates so one of the first things that we did was we brought in an electronic health record system this is an item that a typical jail would not be able to afford with everything that we got was about seventy-five and dollars and we were able to purchase that through our commissary proceeds that the profits that were generated from the sale of our electronic cigarette we will regularly phone to the register of course the people who pay for these benefits are the inmates themselves it's considered a luxury yeah it is definitely exclusive items my dad he's the one buying them for me so I don't I don't like to ask for anything so the cost of them gonna keeps me from smoking them as Muslim we heard there the the number one purchase at the commissary itemizing they probably are are you helping inmates or are you also kind of exploiting them to um you know I think that's a great question I think the same thing can be said for should we begin from caffeine are we making their blood pressure go up because we're getting on chips and have sowed they were loaded with sodium if you own the chip company I can't figure out if this is like a story about you know all the things you're able to do because of the e-cigs or if it's a story about a jailer who saw an opportunity and made a whole lot of money I guess that'll be for everybody else to decide when they say it making money selling e-cigs is very easy that keeping people alive and helping people is very hard my heart and my passion is here [Music] you", "Iz71qE_kLwk": "what's going on youtube i'm shar this is charles reality and today i finally have a video that you've been asking and waiting for for almost three years but it's okay because i'm excited to have like a full actual review on this product right a big deal in the cannabis industry so uh today we are going to be going over the full score of the pax era and i'm gonna give you my full opinion on all my different categories and at the end you're going to have a full score out of 100 of where i place it so i actually have something a little exciting today i have two eras to show you so i have one that is like the original and it's just black basic not super exciting and then mine that has a laser engraving and it is from phil lewis art his studio is in boulder colorado which is actually where i'm from how dope is that um but you can go to his website and you can get this for the era i believe you can get it for the packs too but definitely the pax 3. he has a bunch of different designs that you can pick from and he also has some super dope art in general so you should check it out i'll have the link below um i wasn't sponsored i paid full price for this bad boy but i did it because it was definitely worth the money um not only is it a studio in my hometown but also like i just think that the quality is super dope because it is laser engraved um and it hasn't like faded or anything and i've had it for almost two years so i love it so uh without further ado let's get into the video as far as my actual scoring so the first category always is the ease of use right like how easy is it to use this device and like real this is such an easy device to use as far as like physically using it because you literally oh my battery's a little weak on this one we'll switch to the other one um but like i said you know like i just showed you literally just take a breath in and then you release your breath and you're done the cool thing about this is there's no button so it's not going to just randomly activate in your purse in your pocket in your backpack whatever it's not just going to activate like some of the other ones would or that you would have to remember to turn it off after you uh don't hit it for i think it's like 30 seconds or something like that it thinks that it's already needing to turn itself off and it'll just shut itself down it powers back on just by the draw of the lips on the pod there we go so as far as ease of use just being able to use the product that quickly um when you get a pod from the dispensary it's gonna come in a little case which i've gone through on my first video and i'll link that below for those of you that haven't seen it um but it just comes in a little case and then you just pop this guy out of the little case and right in it's that easy and then you can go ahead and draw so for ease of use alone i'm going to give it a 10 because like how could it be any easier take it out of what it comes in put it in draw all you have to do is make sure your battery is charged that's it super easy uh so we're gonna move on to battery life so the battery life on this bad boy is pretty good um it definitely lasts a long time and it's the little mini us micro usb charger so it's just a usb you just plug it in to computer outlet anything you know uh block um and it charges really fast and it stays charged for a long time so because it's so small and it stays charged for such a long time i definitely give it a pretty high score uh because i feel like with how slim this is and how small i kind of expect it to die a lot faster than it does so i'm going to give it a nine so a nine on the battery life we move on to user friendly now in my first video i was ready to hit this number so hard and be like oh this is going to be like a 9 or 10 because it's badass you can connect it to your phone with a bluetooth which means that instead of using the four preset settings that are already on the device which you do not need the app to use i'll get to that in a second um you could get it like bluetooth it to your phone all you did was shake it again there's a demo in the first video um and it paired right to my phone and then i literally could change the temperature to whatever i wanted which was so  cool to me um but apple has since removed the app from the market so i still have the app downloaded on my phone um i can shake my phil lewis art era right this one because this is the one i have paired to my phone i can shake it it shows that it pops up it says it's connected that's it you can't do anything i can't change the setting which also means that um i have this one set that when i draw on it i don't know if you can see this it changes to like a sunset pattern and i thought that was like so dope but i can't change this one to do that now because you can't do anything on the app so that is very frustrating to me that it is so cool that you can change the temperature but now you can't change the temperature so that bothers me as far as the user friendly because having to i hadn't used my era in a while i got a pod i popped it in realized i couldn't change my temperature on the app and was like how do i even change the manual for set setting preset settings that come on this device and i had to google it and i had to research it and i'm like god this is a lot to deal with just to change the temperature now once i figure it out it is fairly easy right so you all you do because i'm just going to tell you before i even give you the score so that you hear it right you're going to shake your device it tells you how much you have in your battery life you're gonna pop out your pod and it's gonna start cycling there's one two three four lights once i got to the fourth one i popped it in now it hits red and says i'm on the fourth one so if you wanted the lowest temperature you pick the first leaf second temperature second leaf right it's like four different leaves and they get hotter as they go so i always pick number four to get into the hottest but i can't pick the actual temperature i want and that is so frustrating to me so because of that and because i had to like research how to do it which is just annoying i'm sure it's in the book and i could have found my book but where's the  book right so i'm gonna give it a five because i'm very frustrated with that yeah uh we're gonna move on to portability and storage this is where the pax era gets a great score so because it doesn't look like your average like cartridge thing device right because it doesn't have like a screw-on 510 thread which is much bigger um and it's not like a much thicker one with the bigger pods it literally looks identical to the jewel so as far as portability and storage this thing is tiny like where to go it's tiny you can put it anywhere put it in your pocket put in your purse put in your backpack whatever then on top of everything else as far as portability goes this is the part that gets me the most is that almost every and i have not found all of the companies that are in all the states but almost every single state that's recreational has a company that is contracted with pacs to fill the pods which means that if you're going on vacation and you're going to a state that is legal and you're coming from a state that's legal leave your pot at home take your battery you land you walk into your local dispensary you get a new pod you use it while you're there then when it's done toss the pod go home with your battery this battery has nothing on it it's not paraphernalia it's just a battery so this portability makes it amazing amazing so because of the portability because of the storage it's 10 all day long solid 10 because now i can take it anywhere i need to go and it doesn't leak this pod i have never had the single pod leak ever it's amazing so 10 on the portability and storage we're gonna move into the price point so i'm pretty sure i spent like 60 or 70 on my engraved one now when i first bought my first era almost three years ago i believe it was twenty dollars um i did exactly what i just talked about where i took it on vacation i went to colorado i went and bought a pod i showed one of my family members he thought it was the coolest thing ever next thing i know i get taken for my battery and he keeps it so he still has it he uses it it's been almost three years now like i said and he loves it it's still going strong he drops it he's done all kinds of things and it's great never had a problem so 20 for the original one not a bad price 70 i think is what 60 70 like this a little more expensive right but unique and so for me that was worth the price okay so when i checked today before doing my video um i want to make sure i knew what the current price point is and if you go to pax's website it's 30 and that's for just the basic era so 30 bucks again it doesn't connect with your phone anymore with the bluetooth so i mean i kind of feel like for 30 that's a lot you should be charging 20 since it doesn't connect connect to apple devices anymore which cuts out at least half of your market because the major companies to have a phone with is an apple or a droid right so if it only works on the droid market and it doesn't work on the apple market i feel like it should be back to the 20 price point not 30. so because of that i'm gonna give them an eight because i feel like it should be 20. okay we're gonna move on to accessibility so um you can you can get them online right you can get them from pax's website and depending on where in the world you live you might have to pay import it might not make it to your country depending on your laws uh in america you can get it shipped anywhere 30 bucks you're going to pay tax and shipping on it because they don't think they do free shipping at 30. um generally the dispensaries that sell the pods sell the batteries as well and oftentimes you can get deals where like they have you know buy two pods get a battery free or different things like that enticing you to get a battery for free or for cheaper which is dope um but a lot of the small smoke shops and vape shops won't carry packs typically and for a while now pax charges a lot of money meaning that like you have to buy a certain amount of devices that is a lot in order to carry their products in their shop so as far as like smaller mom-and-pop vape and smoke shops they're just generally not going to carry them because it's a higher price point to get into and it's harder to carry in their store so it kind of leaves you with only dispensaries and only online so it's not terrible it's not hard to get them but it's also not super easy so because of that i'm going to go with a seven yeah i'm also gonna hit this again okay so the next category is durability and i feel like it's relatively durable i as you know if you've watched previous videos of mine i am definitely clumsy i drop um i've definitely dropped the out of this and it doesn't have any scratches it doesn't i mean it has a couple like little dings in it but nothing huge and it seems to be working like a champ um so i don't have any issues but i definitely think there's always room for growth right so i'm going to give it an 8 on the durability so the next category is accessories and purchasables so like normally when you purchase a device especially you know like a higher end packs is a higher end brand a name brand um there's going to be some kind of accessories that you can purchase for your device except the era there's nothing absolutely nothing like nothing no carrying case no nothing not even like a carrying case that then had like a little section for you to have like different pods with you or something like nothing absolutely nothing um so and i was also surprised that there wasn't even like a customized little color like sleeve or something since the era only comes in one color whereas most of the packs devices come in different colors it was like there's not even a silicone sleeve nothing so um okay so that's going to bring us to the accessories and purchasables so i i mean like i'm pretty surprised when it comes to this category with packs with this device because one this is the only color it comes in all their other devices come in multiple colors this is the only color again and in order to get the engraving i had to go to a separate person it wasn't even on pax's website i happened to find this on instagram i found who it was i went to his website i realized that he was licensed to do engraving through them that it was an authentic device blah blah blah blah went to him right but there's not even a color option so that's my number one thing number two is that there's not any accessories available not a single one there's not a single one there's not a silicone sleeve to give it some kind of color difference there's not a pouch that you could carry this in with like a couple pods and like a battery pack or something so or you know just something simple so that it would make it even more portable um so how do you have such a large company such a dope item and not a single accessory not one like i mean i guess you could count a battery pack on their website as an accessory but when you click on the accessories it doesn't take you to anything there's nothing why because there's no accessories for it which leads me to believe that they deserve a score of two so two like literally a two and if you've watched my previous videos which i hope you have and if you haven't i'd love for you to go watch them um i don't ever score that low like but i feel like with such a big name brand and so many options on other devices it was pretty sad to me to see absolutely nothing nothing nothing so two and we're gonna move on build quality and warranty so it comes with a one-year manufacturer's warranty um like i said i got my first one three years ago it's still going strong in colorado um i've had this bad boy for uh about two just over two years and then i was gifted this uh in february at the champs trade show um which is dope it was given to me by one of the pax reps and she's phenomenal and um she just said you know have you ever have you seen the new one and i was like what's the difference so she let me see this one which is the same that she gifted me this one which is the same as the original and they do have like a newer version which is not that different and it still doesn't connect to your phone so but it was really dope to be gifted that um as far as like you know the build quality i feel like they're great um i haven't had any issues i haven't had any issues with any of my pods connecting or anything like that um so i mean seems to be a great little device so as far as the build quality and warranty i'm gonna give it a nine um which leads us to our last category before i give you my final score which up until now i'm sure you've calculated where we're at which is not super high um now this is going to bump it up just a little bit because i do absolutely love the device i love it i absolutely love it i love that it's super small i love that it's lightweight i love that i can plug it in it charges really fast i love the battery lasts forever i love that pods taste so good it's unlike any other cartridge i've ever used i feel like pax definitely is choosing the right companies in the right states to be representing their product because it is high quality product that's put into the pods as far as all of the pots i've tried in multiple different states right um so i absolutely love it and i would give it a full perfect score if it wasn't for the lack of connectivity to the app now i understand that that's not pax that has done that it is apple but it is still very frustrating to not be able to set my device to the specific temperature without using a droid now i am tempted to download the app on a droid just to be able to then do the exact temperature that i want but i'll deal with it i love that it's portable i love that i can take it everywhere so my overall is a nine it gets a solid nine because the reality is you can change the temperature to the four preset ones it's not that big of a deal i do love it i do just enjoy it and i think that it's a badass little device so my overall score is a 77 which is really sad because i feel like when i first got this device it was gonna be like a hundred and ninety something like take you know take the cake like this was the this was the creme de la creme but the lack of accessories the lack of a color the lack of the customization as far as like being able to change the temperature and things like that and the app not working anymore and there's just a number of things that i'm like well that sucks but i would say if you are looking for a device that you want to be able to use in different states you do like pods you do like the way it tastes the way it works that kind of thing this is a great little device um you can definitely check out phil lewis's art so you can pick one that's more your style he does have a number of different ones um and a lot of other art as well um so that is that that is the pax era full

colorway oh that's looking nice yo what is going on g fam welcome back to another video by your boy sebi g guys i got a new pod system for you guys this company right here is called left coast extracts i know a lot of you guys have heard about them because i constantly get them in my comments yo sebi have you tried left coast extracts have you tried left coast extracts and i i have never tried left coast extract so i took it upon myself to try them all right guys so you guys are probably like yo i thought you quit this lit bro what happened your last two videos with the new normal and now you got left coast extracts what's going on so guys i feel like the market right now it just doesn't have enough live resin companies that are making cartridges so it's not i have nothing to review for you guys so what i've been doing is really really doing some research and trying to see okay which distillate cartridges out there are really really freaking good and are really a reputable brand that makes really really clean distillate so i hit up some of my friends some of my homies that are in the cannabis industry and they've told me that left coast extracts has some really really high quality distillate okay so i was like you know what let me go ahead and try them out so i'm gonna go ahead and take the first hit of this because i feel like i've just been talking too much i haven't tried it out so this is gonna be my first ever reaction to this brand okay we got the pineapple express you guys know me pineapple express is one of my favorite strains of all time so let's go in cheers everyone oh my goodness yo that's clean literally not even cutting anything out that is so freaking clean that taste and the taste just hits you right the first hit you don't even have to wake up the coil but i'm gonna go in on number two because this thing tastes fine let me show you guys life oh yeah yo this is this is the wave bro this is good but this is oh my gosh like dude if you guys know me i've been rocking with distillates since the beginning of this channel since before i even started youtube and a lot of people hate on this other card she's like oh quit smoke and dislike and i even i said it before but the thing is guys like all right in the beginning of the game when distiller first started there's like there are so many companies out there making this product and i felt like you know me only sticking to those companies really didn't leave me room to try other companies such as left coast extracts and then now that i'm trying these other companies i'm actually branching out it's actually opening my mind and like just letting me know yo dude there's actually way better distillate than the normal stuff you usually vape like raw garden and stizzy and things like that so just you know this coming from me men really branch out and try different things because this thing right here guys i really didn't have high expectations for it i'm not gonna lie but you know after after what people told me that it's really really clean i feel like i heard that so many times and i just had to try it for myself and now that i'm hitting it this thing actually tastes really freaking good yeah that is super clean dude so after the first initial reaction hits dude though this is actually really really clean i can tell you because i have not been coughing i haven't even had the sensation to cough once just when i rip it really really fat and you know you get that sensation to cough with the really big cloud that's about it but honestly this thing tastes super spot-on with the pineapple express and it just tastes clean and pure all the way through so one thing that i wanted to talk to you guys about this device that's really really dope in my opinion is so you know there's so many companies that are just competing against each other nowadays and they're just like rivals to each other right no one's really trying to help we look out for the main person which is the consumer which is the consumer just like me just like you right so what they did they said you know yeah you might have to buy your own battery but if you really don't want to buy your own battery it's all good we still want you guys to try our pods and they they look they were like okay what's one of the biggest brands out there right now that most people have which is stizzy so what they did boys what they did is they made their pods stizzy compatible look at this all right stick it on your stizzy if you want to take fatter rips whatever the case is like this dizzy big peep this there you go they they took it upon themselves to be like you're really really looking after the community because you guys know everyone's you have those individuals that don't really mind buying another cartridge i mean another battery me personally i own like 500 batteries i don't mind buying another battery but you do have those small percentage of consumers are like you know what bro i already have one battery i want to stick with this brand of the battery and you know whatever the case is which is cool but left coast extracts man you know they they're like they're just thinking ahead of the game they're thinking ahead of the game and they're like yo you could put stizzy pods on this one you could put the left coast track pods on this one if you want to try our pause on a stizzy battery you know you could do that too you can mix and match and have so much variety and i feel like that's good man because they really really are looking out for the consumer and that is something that actually caught my attention right away i didn't really notice that that they were compatible with sizzy up until i read the box so i'm gonna go in for another hit yo cheers [Music] personally though i think that this battery is way doper than this disney not trying to bash dizzy i love sizzy you guys know sizzy's one of my favorite companies but the colorways guys the colorways that you're just spot on bro like i like red and i like you know i don't like it to look so basic i do kind of like to have some flair in my product especially when it's something that i use every day you know people look at your stuff and they're like yo yo what is that you look at this and you're like yo that's pretty dope it looks kind of it looks like someone actually put some design into it rather than just slapping a color onto it okay so talking i like i can't even stop hitting this bro this is like my sixth or seventh hit yo cheers you know i had to hit a blinker one time that did not taste burnt at all which is actually pretty astonishing man because usually when i take a blinker off of a pod system you can really really taste like the burntness now that i'm looking at the oil on this guys this thing is super clear like usually i don't even look at the oil anymore because i felt like you know at first when i first started looking at pods i used to base it just off of the color but now you know as a as someone who's been doing this for years you kind of have to know that not all oils that are super super clear are going to be good and not all not all oils that are dark are going to be super super bad it just depends on the way that the company manufactures it and in my opinion for some distillate you always really really want to go for some clean clean clean distillate because in my opinion from the clear the distillate the better that's what that's the way that i see it when it comes to this you don't want some really really dark stuff the clearer the better and um yeah man this thing is hitting on so many freaking different levels i also make wax just like syringes if you want to refill your paws and they also sell diamonds which i have some myself maybe i'll make a video on those because dude i've seen them i haven't tried them y'all yet i have them sitting in my fridge because i've just been waiting for the right moment and i feel like i have to make a video on those because man i've heard nothing but good things alright guys so i'm gonna take another blinker and just pretty much tell you guys the overall experience of what what i feel like you know this pod system is so cheers yeah that's good that is so good dude like i just love that it doesn't give me the sensation of cough i feel like i can literally hit take this hit after hit after hit and not be dying the high that i'm getting off of this is i think pineapple express is a hybrid if i'm not mistaken i am getting that hybrid sensation it's not like a couch lock and it's not like a sativa it's kind of in the middle i do feel faded but i do feel like i have like i'm kind of i feel light dude i feel like i could float around right now that's how good i'm feeling right so the overall quality man like i'm saying i love the fact that they made these stizzy compatible like me personally i really don't mind buying a proprietary battery like i said i feel like proprietary batteries are really do the job and you know they do what they're supposed to do which is burn the the company's oil at their specific temperature because everyone's oil burns at a different rate everyone knows what their strain um you know burning rate is so that's why i usually go for the proprietary better but if you guys don't want to go that route and still want to try the left coast extracts you know you could always use a stizzy battery so with that being said guys i would definitely give this a 9 out of 10 man i don't know i don't know what's not what's holding me back from giving it a 10 out of 10 maybe the fact that it's desolate you know but yeah i don't know i just feel like i want to give it a 10 out of 10 but you nothing nothing in the world is perfect so we're going to leave it at 9 out of 10 and with that being said guys we're shutting out the video here if you guys enjoyed today's video do me a favor hit that like hit those comments and most importantly hit that subscribe alright have a nice day", "Kjg2d_bHtqI": "hello everyone and welcome back to my channel alright so in today's video I'm actually gonna be doing something a little different so if you can see what this thing is in my hand this is called a pax era device so let's see if the camera wants to focus on it of course it doesn't it wants to focus on me hello alright so this is what the device looks like so the device is just this thing and then you have what's called a pot so the pot looks like that mine currently is empty so you could see kind of clear through it there's nothing in there so the cap to this one doesn't exactly come off so I'm going to show you how to refill this really fast and very easy so you're gonna grab whatever type of oil you're gonna be refilling in there so here's mine so I'm just going to put that into this so if you want to see how I do that keep on watching alright so inside the packs pod there are these little like rubber gauge type Stoppers that are pretty much right under the mouthpiece you won't be able to really see them in this video I'm gonna post pictures in the video you know somewhere like right here alright so hopefully that puffs up and you'll be able to see exactly what I'm talking about so instead of puncturing and going right through the hole with this here you're gonna be able to just go right along this side so I don't know if that makes 100% sense to you but what you're gonna do instead of going right through the stopper you're going to just put this on the side and kind of push that stopper slightly back until it's out of your way and then you'll kind of feel it go down so right now I kind of already got mine to go through and if the needle was super long you'd be able to kind of see it there in the camera unfortunately you cannot because it's pretty short and it's pretty much at the top but you will see oil go in there so now do it you'll take your refill syringe whatever you're using and you'll go ahead and connect it so I like to connect this first just in case you don't have the oil squeeze in and spilling out everywhere so I would keep the needle the way it is until you're ready to put it in so let's go ahead and do that cuz see I almost dropped it right now and if the lid wasn't on there could have lost a whole hundred dollars so let's not do that alright so took it off little safety cap is off so I always try and pull back on the syringe a little bit so that air goes in so it's not completely shooting out before I want it to and that's still where it's at so we're just gonna screw those two pieces together and watch me squeeze so let's see hope the camera could focus for that nice sparkly little nail polish on there alright so I'm gonna start squeezing and should see a trip yeah see that one side filled up alright so what we do here so we're just gonna take the needle just pull it out you don't have to do anything special let's see I wasn't careful and I pulled this thing off before the cartridge luckily no oil spilled so we're good here so what we're gonna do is we're going to hold that pull this out and put it where it needs to go on this side so again you're just gonna well-well I do this I guess I should cap it up and be a be as safe as I tell you to be so let's just put that back on there the safety all right now you're gonna go through the top so what is that a fuzz keep your stuff in your pocket you get a fuzz alright so you're gonna go into the other hole so since there's oil on that side now you could just wait for it to travel if you wanted to and then refill it through the same side if you didn't want to deal with going to the other side but I rather just do it now so I'm gonna go through so pretty much let me see if I can show you on the down angle you just go through I'm pulling slightly back a little bit so you could kind of feel the rubber stoppers and you just play with it for a second until you get it to go in so the other one shall right in and the same thing here so can't exactly see the needle I don't think but you'll be able to see the oil go in at just a moment all right so let's see take the safety off all right squeeze that back on all right and then you should see it go in nice and easy see [Music] all right so that's both sides filled up and that's pretty much it some bubbles in there because we're getting towards the end of the syringe but it's normal all right and then I have another cartridge to fill up after this so I'm just gonna pull that out it's nice your PAX is ready to go you don't have to wait for it or anything you could give it a second to absorb the oil in and you could just put that right back in your pax device let's see if I could get my camera to focus on me again hello hello hello all right and so we're gonna take the PAC spawn put it in your device activated and notice that you uh put it in and see if it works tada all right you now know how to fill your own pack spot and you didn't even have to break it now go and try what you just learned by Beautiful's see you then in the next one bye and don't forget to subscribe and click that little red bell icon so you can see every

depleted the pod will appear empty\nand the device will no longer produce vapor", "OUNdoGEa79Q": "hi to anyone watching this video my name is Ali I am doing a review today on the PAC's era pod yeah packs era battery and pods this is the PAX era battery this is what the pods look like inside of it and the one inside here right now is cherry pie this one is by bloom farms I just wanted to do a quick little video here on a different battery the last one I did was the state C or steezy battery however you say that um this one is the PAX era pod this one is cool because it does connect to an app on your cell phone which i think is kind of cool because you can play games on it you can change the levels of it the temperature of how you want to smoke it so if you're kind of into that or you like doing that or you think your batteries are getting too hot then you can do that and change it with this when you hit it on this little leaf right here will light up just this one yeah so the one thing that is kind of a good downfall is if you don't use it for a little bit um it can get stuck like that so you do have to like clear it but as you see um lit up just create quite a bit of smoke but for some reason for me for the pucks I think that it's not as hot as other batteries and I personally do like it the one by bloom Farms is really cool this is how the packaging is which is not even a bloom Farms one this one is by Island this one is the lemon rex it's Eva so this is how it comes it comes childproof so you have to make sure it's clicked right there to be able to open it it has a seal so that it's new so I'm going to go ahead and take off the seal and put it on the back then I'll open it and show you guys that's cool and then it fell so I try to put that in there kind of nice so that's how it would come inside the little packaging and you just basically to put a new one in if I were to take this out snap the new one in and this one actually tastes really good the island lemon wreck this one is super like lemony super fresh the bloom farm stripe I was like a darker deeper flavor and then I have a third one here which is tangi sob which is a hybrid by Island I'm not gonna test this out right now but I just kind of wanted to show this battery I'll show what it looked like show with the pods look like this compared to this TV I like the pax era that's just me personally I do like this DZ and of course I do have the batteries and the pods too that I do like it but as far as a hit flavor I like this one I like how this one is designed how it looks the cz one is a little smaller than this I would say without the pot in it is what size like this DZ would be but yeah I just wanted to do a quick review there's people walking around but it's okay I'm at the Krispy Kreme parking lot I just wanted to do a quick video because I'm not always very consistent with my videos and I got these two new pack squad so I just wanted to do one really quick I personally really like the pocket or a battery I think it does hit very strong it doesn't make me cough as much as some of the other cartridges do yeah I just wanted to do a little car session a little car vlog again just a little quick one a five-minute one because some of mine I know get very long they get like five ten minutes long and 15 20 and I just wanted to kind of make it simple I make these reviews quick I personally like it no sponsor buy packs they're not paying me they didn't say to do this I just wanted to try out their battery on YouTube and show what I like about it personally compared to other ones like heavy hitters kingpin regarding p2 there's a lot of hurt ones which go on the seesaw which I personally like those too those are a lot easier to carry around they're more Universal you can switch it between batteries which is really nice but I do like about the packs one though is it is USB so it's really easy to charge versus versus seesaw which you know you have to have the adapter to plug in which isn't hard to carry but it's annoying to have to have that extra piece when usually someone around has an android charger around you know or an old one or a thousand of them so yeah I just wanted to do a quick little car vlog here you guys have any questions about the path spot or anything you were wondering about leave a comment I just really wanted to just do a quick little impromptu our blog just where I'm talking about it showing it showing how it is it's really nice and magnetically just fits in I'm sure probably should have done a little better of a review than that but I just wanted to do a quick little car vlog car sesh if you want a more in-depth one where I show like the box and in the packaging and everything I can do another one of that anyways I hope you guys have a great morning evening day whatever's going on with you guys if you have any comments or questions leave them down below have a great night bye", "durJ5kcVdOs": "[Music] what it is

looking at the carts and everything you know I'm saying doing my like research on which ones are like pretty good for me like as in like what's gonna be like best for me type [ __ ] like I want to get a nice car and not just know 510 thread and that's what I'm like kind of talking about I don't wanna I'm trying to look for something like my buddy Earl he has the Ares Pro I'm pretty sure that's what it's called and that has like a specific it's a specific battery for a specific car and that's basically what I was looking for you I feel like those are pretty nice I did some research and I saw that the pack spots are pretty good they had packs pods out here so I was like yeah yeah I'm gonna get a pack spot you know [ __ ] yeah I heard really good reviews from them I saw some different videos on myself pretty pretty good stuff about him so I thought why not give him a try you know definitely I was researching cardis and pods like that was because for work you know saying buddy boy back in the workflow and I'm saying I'm trying to do some discreet and someone low-key on the go in this that's why I think car DS are friggin perfect for you know then that I might think red ribbon in my bunker smoking a nice fat joint got my hands on some blueberry headband from rhythm you know I'm saying and I've been smoking on this since Saturday it is Thursday right now or Wednesday I'm sorry I've been smoking on it for a nice five days you know and I'm actually surprised by it because he's right here I feel like I've had point two fives and three miligrams and i run though i run through those in like two days you know and this one actually lasted me almost a week I'm basically almost done with it puffing on this bad boy you know I've been puffing on it all day actually to get a nice review on everything you know I'm saying overall I'm really happy with these but let's get in-depth there enough for the background story to even let's get into this I got my you know shot to rise that's where I got it from specifically this is this is the box right here it's the pax era of rhythm balance 500 milligrams you know I'm saying I opened there a day after I got it from rise you know and I got the I got the unboxing video right here so yeah I was able to get my hands on a pax era from rhythm you know it is one other balance they got balanced energized and relaxed I'm pretty sure that's what they are it is a nice hybrid of 500 milligrams you know it is a blueberry headband you know blueberry itself is pretty nice and well-known and same with headband it's really well-known as well got this out of rise and Niles it is a half millet it is a 500 milligram cart or pod I should say and then total the total th II came up to 84% and like the way you open this bad boy was pretty I think it was pretty unique you know it's really locked and certified you gotta push this in and then there is like a little there's also like a little a little tab I want to say so another little piece of paper inside there other piece of cardboard I mean that you gotta push that and then as well push that other piece of cardboard in and there's another slim piece of cardboard on top and you just pull that bad boy right out and I really like the packaging first first things you know packaging is really nice you cable and I like how they would they put blueberry headband right on the actual pot itself which was really nice it's coming out from rhythm rhythm hasn't really I got to say I've had some nice stuff from them yeah it's pretty nice guys I've been puffing on it for like I said for five days and this guy's been pretty good cars like the vape hits and everything it's really smooth really tasty you taste those SERPs for sure pax era blueberry head back from rhythm a 500 milligram pot what's really cool about the pax area and what pushed me to actually get this compared to other card cards or pods is that it actually has like a web support system has an app but not for Apple users only for Android but at least you can I still go on the web app itself you can just go onto Google and then type in the PAX web app it'll bring you up to this should be the first one it'll bring you to the home page of this you know just click connect now you know ask you which one is your device as a pax era they don't tell you to put in the serial number on the back of your pax pod device and then you can connect through a Bluetooth you've got to shake your device until it turns blue on the light and then you're able to connect through it once you do connect you're able to get to this screen and I'll show you all this stuff right here you can starting out you can what's really cool is you can lock your device and no one else can like hitting if let's say you left it at home or something you know what nobody's to be hitting your chez while you're gone you can lock it from there another thing is also for the pod results it said it's coming soon just to see all the results for your actual pod itself that you got from the dispensary but what I think is really cool is when you go to add your actual pod to this so right now I'm going to select my state and then apply it's all rhythm rhythm is the ones that are making these pods and hybrids indica climb sativas and even CBD I'm gonna choose mine I have blueberry headband and I go press this plus sign before that I'm gonna show you guys 84 THC blueberry headband which is DJ short blueberry I'm Rolo G Sour Diesel pre-money a bubba kush is a hybrid trainer featuring lemon earthy blueberry and future aromas and pleasant brush even gives you a description of it and the genetics that's really cool but yeah you go press this plus sign to add it to you to your packs air device and then what's really really cool is that it gives you the freakin expert tongue which is amazing expert temp is the pod and preset for optimal temperature for the string is chosen by the extract and extract is the one who's making this there's the one who's telling you what's the best temperature to smoke this out of for the best experience and it's a 700 you can go ahead and just drag this and put it at 700 and boom just like that boom just like been you can have your [ __ ] set and controlled all through the web app which is awesome blueberry headband tasty percentage everything you can even lock it from here and just test results are coming soon which is pretty cool but yeah that's another reason why I chose this pax era pods compared to other ones another really cool thing is that since I'm only gonna be smoking out of these packs vapes as in a pod wise and instead of going through each dispensaries website to see what's on them I need to see if they even have these I can go straight to the packs itself it's they have partnered with Jane so you can just hover their pods in our region let's go ahead and click this tab right here and explore now they'll bring you to this page go ahead and enter in your location and you put in my zip code hmm you know tell me what's in my region you can go and select the distance if you don't want to go too far let's say I'm only trying to go 20 miles you know this is gonna be what's around in 20 miles I know it's a cold nice car that's good if you can get like to switch my loud we do well yeah I can go right here and check where it's at you know let's say I want that brownie sky right here go and click it show me where the two stores near me that have it rise Mundelein and that leaf right here does say uh medical I'll go actually back and switch this recreational exhale make you see only when I got to actually that's who excited right there you know go ahead and click the Mandarin Jack and I'll tell me which soars head rise nails yeah you know yeah guys that was pretty cool another thing I just wanted to throw in there yeah guys I'm like I've been saying I'm really I'm really happy with this I'm really happy with the purchase and with the pot itself as the taste goes I'm really happy with that as well you can definitely taste the terpene so you can definitely taste the headband you know let's talk a little bit about the strain the strain itself the strain blueberry headband is indica dominant I'm pretty sure it's like 60/40 or 70/30 something like that you know and it's a hybrid I really think it is a well-balanced hybrid because I've been smoking on this all day even at work you know I like it's it's pretty so I wouldn't I wouldn't say it's you Florrick it's calming and uplifting and then it's also it's also kind of energizing so I get a little bit you know a nice like eyeless let's get it let's get this [ __ ] done you know I'm saying I don't get that set back like we're like crazy indica like puts me up excuse me pushed me on lock you know I'm saying push me puts me unlock puts me on the couch like I'm not trying to work on highs hell no it was like a perfect well balanced hybrid I want to say and that's like that's really good you know blueberries a nice is a nice strange so is headband you can definitely when I was hitting this you can definitely taste the like sour D and OG in there like he was definitely you really Turbie on that and then you got that nice aftertaste of like some blueberries like some berry ish berry stuff you know it tasted really good and as far as like you know let's get it let's get another puff right here sugar a quick because I'm on two right now no that's like 50% haven't charged I'm pretty happy with this with the battery so I'm gonna do a nice review on the actual pockets of the packs era in the future I need to get a couple more pods to get it up you know a nice official review let's take this it's really nice really smooth really tasty I give it basically I want to give this like a ten out of ten I'm gonna give it a ten out of ten I think this is perfect honestly like even to the end I'll show you guys to the end like it gets a little you know most most cards do get a little target still still pretty golden I want to say but yeah guys this I'm really happy with this I want to give this guy's a ten out of ten this is the first one so you know might be giving it a biased review because it is the first one and I haven't actually tried other ones you know I'm saying but this one's definitely gonna be a ten out of ten I love the flavor of it I love the smoothness of it everything as far as the high goes it's definitely as definite like I said it's definitely a hybrid because like I was it was nice I was up there you know I'm saying I was uplifted but now like euphoric you know I'm saying I was it was calm at work I was chill and I was also like at the same time kind of like energize your new sounds and I bet let's get it you know I'm chill I'm relaxed I'm mellowed out it was nice it was a good clean hi I want to say definitely a hybrid because like the other day I wasn't really that like lazy you know when as far as like you would think blue would have been since it's an indica dominant I think it's more like a 50/50 I want to say cuz like it maintains that that balance and it's really nice and that's I guess why they call it that balance now that I think about it you know and it's I really like the high O's calm calming uplifting and I want to say it definitely a little bit energizing yeah guys that's all I got for you guys I hope you guys really enjoyed this review you know I'm really happy with my purchase out here from Rhys and I also if you guys haven't seen that video you know go check that out on my bike over there and cop some dog walkers I was really happy with those dog walkers as well if you guys saw the later cake that I posted in my last video just you know just a little quick flip up and you try to get my hands on

available at the hand corner icon now it's like 30 bucks for this vaporizer and then you buy these cartridges see the West Coast matching cartridges and this is what you get so first and this is the the Girl Scout cookies in here so basically let's just open up the the cartridge and show you what the cartridges so you get this little package here right you twist your little bottom here thing is where they line up there's the cool thing to alter that hope is Bobby at the healing corner it's a body even quick tutorial on how to use this so I and I obviously had to charge it so I didn't open

never any type and again you can see I brought a and these cartridges they're a little more expensive right now around 80 bucks per cartridge about 400 milligrams but they're supposed to last a hell of a lot longer than the other regular cartridge head and they're supposed to be guaranteed leak proof the healing Carter said if you have any problems with these whatsoever just bring in to them and they'll gladly take care of it and then the battery the vape itself's got a one-year warranty or something like that so that's awesome um normally I recommend taking us off because it makes you look cooler but uh since I don't have the time I won't okay so basically is it this is your cartridge just drop this [ __ ] Hank let me show you what this is now so now this is where we get [ __ ] pretty

sheets are potent fantastic way to get medicated some new high-tech [ __ ] hope you guys go check this out there at healing car.com right now guys I got to go JC do please", "uRmAiAdehAs": "what's up guys i like weed a lot and i'm here to give you guys a comparison between the pax pods and your standard 510 carts i see this question asked all the time if pax pods are worth it what's the benefit of a card and they basically do the same thing but i figured i'd go around a little bit of the differences the similarities how you use them the mechanics of them and just give you a little bit of a brief rundown show you how they hit so this is your standard 510 cart this can screw onto like damn near any battery that's one of the nice things about it you can find these batteries batteries like that with a little screw hole um well you see the [ __ ] screw right there you can get batteries for like you know eight bucks 12 bucks you find them real easy all over the place the other thing about the carts the standard 510 carts is they usually have a lot more flavors and they have liquid live resin often which is sometimes in the pax pods but more often than not tax pods are distillate they have distillate in these two but you can get liquid live resin ones that just means they take the fresh plants and they make the oil right there at the fresh plants rather than the distillate where they're making the concentrate by itself and using a lot more um chemicals to separate [ __ ] out and then moving the terpenes that they took out of the plant back into it all that stuff in the liquid live resin it's just one big flash process you keep the whole plant profile with the liquid live resin so you can set the volts on these batteries to get a little bit of a bigger hit i tend to keep them low um pause the button i don't like frying off the coil i've never fried out the coil but i've always been told to pulse the button so you don't fry out the coil so that's what i tend to do so i'm going to take a rip of this you see nice big thick hit that's the thing about the 510 card today you can get a big hit real fast basically take one big hit two big hits and be good to go for as long as you want i'm high enough also there's two hits this is this is blueberry spicy space cake by cresco i would recommend it but a lot of the carts you can get frx makes the parts uh cresco gti and this is just in pennsylvania moxie the whole shebang basically every standard forms every driver processor makes the standard 510 card so it's a nice easy introductory way to get into the vape cart game now the pack squad this rather than the cart use this little paw this guy is getting there he's almost empty but there's still a bit in there and the you have to use one of these pax batteries with it these are in about 30 bucks there's a pack that's called the pax era there's a pax era pro that's 70 bucks and these you can change the temp on using some type of settings depending on which device you have and it sets it specifically to the temp you want if you have the app i have an iphone vape apps have been banned on the iphone i believe you can use google chrome if you have a pc to set it up so like i believe the temp range on this goes from like 400 maybe 500 to 750 790. i can set it to any degree i want in that range range so you can fine tune your experience you can i believe set a limit so like if i take x amount of hits it'll just shut off and not even let me take another hit for i think 5-10 minutes you ain't gonna get as big as a hit per hit from this compared to this from my experience at least that was about this same amount of time i hit this just a little less vapor overall excuse me the thing is i think personally that the pots taste better and they last a lot longer one of these will last me maybe like five days maybe a week and i don't i don't get it that often only when i'm out about an intermittently these i can get about 10 days almost two weeks it's the same amount half gram half gram pod half gram card and uh these last a lot a lot longer in my opinion but i'm also taking usually two or three hits per session with that one i'm taking usually one or two hits per session to get me where i want to be um i have three hits i'm [ __ ] high i'm losing my transplant i know gti makes pack spots and i know liberty makes pax pods i may be forgetting one but in the pa program those are the only two people that makes the pax pod so you have a lot less variety compared to the 510 cart and most of them are distillate rather than liquid live resin there are a few liquid live resin ones that come around but they're mostly distillate that being said i think the distillate tastes a lot better of the pack spa than it does ever out of a cart they're it's about on par with the liquid live resin so six one lay half of those in the other yeah little bit less vapor but it doesn't draw all the same um your batteries they usually charge via micro usb usbc um some if you get some batteries they got like the old e-cig you steer them on plug it into the brick and it'll charge it that way these charge usb-c the pax era the pax error pro charges usb i don't know this is us mini usb the pax error pro is usbc and it charges in about half an hour 45 minutes maybe an hour no it's not that long these sometimes take a little bit longer to charge but they last the long times too so again six one way half of those on the other the real benefit of both of them is that you can put them in your pocket you can take them around wherever you want super easy to conceal and keep uh discreet the added benefit of the packs in my opinion is that most e-cigs now don't look like this they used to but they don't look like this anymore a lot of adhesives look like this the jewels the views all that kind of stuff so if you get pulled over and you're worried about oh like some cops gonna ask you what that is if they're you have it you know wherever you have it you encounter the cops um if you fly i'm not advocating flying with to illegal states with it but most people are going to look at this and think this is a jewel and you may not have that luxury with this i've never experienced anyone dealing with cops with the cart uh i did get pulled over i actually got a dui and i had this in my pocket told him it was a jewel and i just got doi for drinking he just put it right back in my car he was like he left thought of us and he said so i mean there is that going for it um i mean i think that's about it i think i covered the bases about what's different about them if you want more variety if you want um yeah if you want more variety and just a simple easy thing going for you i would say probably get the 510 cards if you like tech and think like tech stuff is cool if you have an android you can download the app or if you want to mess around with the computer fine-tune your experience a little bit more go with the pax paws a lot of them now with the era pro the manufacturer will actually there's a little red line on here that's what designates if the pods era pro compatible but i would i could plug it in and the manufacturer will say let's say 510 and it'll just automatically set the 510 and i take out this car and i put in another part and the manufacturer says 600 it'll swap between that automatically without you having to do anything so that's pretty cool and uh i personally like the form factor of the packs more i use the packs more it lasts a lot longer for me i'll blow through cards like nobody's business if i was just smoking cards these tend to be 50 bucks half gram sometimes 55 60 the pax pods tend to usually be 60 dollars for a half gram consistently across the board i've seen them at 55 occasionally never 50 dollars on at least since i've been in the program so uh i appreciate all the love guys i hope this was informative and helped you guys out and gave you a little bit of a run down between the packs uh pods and the 510 carts and will help you make a decision in the future if you guys give me a like to subscribe that'd be awesome i uh i'm going to keep trying to pump these out i have a bunch of gear like bongs vapes all kinds of [ __ ] like that i'm trying to add more of those into this because really there's only so much we like to review you know it makes you sleepy it makes you energetic it tastes like this to taste like that but i got a lot of cool [ __ ] i could probably show you maybe make some dabs make some or use rso cooking some [ __ ] like that let me know if you guys have any ideas of like things we want to see done i can basically do it all so all right guys i appreciate the love again have a good one", "OtE6cdtc5Sk": "this channel is for educational and entertainment purposes only if you are not 18 years older please do it shut the [ __ ] up it's about that time what's going on my stomach's a stone age it's your girl ea and i'm back again with another lit video yeah we got a lit review today i'm gonna be reviewing papa herbs granddaddy perk distillate pod along with the pax era so i've had these for about three days now so you know what i'm saying i got a little experience with it this is my first time having a pax era and this is my first time trying a pod i've always wanted to try a pod to me this pax era is like a stizzy pod or a plug and play pod [Music] the function of this packs area reminds me of the puffco because it has an app to it you can connect it to your phone you can change the temperature the colors all that stuff is so advanced everything is so advanced and you can't do nothing without your phone that's crazy so this distillate part is granulated perv it's 74 thc it's an indica cheers guys it's really tasty guys so i had this for about three days it's holding up pretty good i hope you can kind of see it [Music] it's really tasty and discreet guys no one knows what you're puffing on it looks like a jewel it's really sleek and discreet [Music] i take this everywhere with me up and on the go i'm really enjoying this i'm really enjoying this part guys i picked this up from liberty health science so far the other dispensaries i've tried liberty health science has the most selection of carts and pods and all that than all the dispensaries i've been to so far so i think a liberty health science is going to be my go-to person for carts and plus they just so cool the people that work there they're so cool awesome working at a dispensary is like working at a gas station i used to work at the kangaroo and i didn't even like blunts but they every time some new blunts came out he's like who wanted to get that because i'm going to try it i wonder what it tastes like so working at a dispensary every time some drop i'd be like oh yeah i'm gonna try that i want to see what it's hitting like blah blah blah it's like working at a candy store it's a smoker's dream [Music] i cannot complain guys i cannot complain but back to this i'm loving it right now guys you see it it looks so awesome it's so freaking awesome you see it lights up you can change the uh temperature all that stuff [Music] i can sit here and explain it to you and all this stuff like that but you can just go out there and buy this [ __ ] yourself to get it yourself it has the instructions on the back it has all that good stuff you can just go out there and get it yourself i ain't a teacher i'm just trying to put you on something you know what i'm saying i hope everybody out there having a good day i hope you smoking along man if you can't smoke i smoke for the both of us cheers [Music] y'all i want to attempt to do a blanket but you see how that had me i'm not even gonna attempt to do a blinker but i really really really really give this i'm gonna give it like a seven seven or eight give or take it's good though you know what i'm saying get the job done and give me medicaid it's other brands out there so i don't want to just give it a 10 a 10 out of 10 off rip and i haven't tried other things so yeah that's my little review on uh pax error and papa herbs it's your girl ea i'm at this piece like last year don't see it suck dumbass", "dAsUk8NTUes": "yellow welcome to true buds TV it's your buddy Jack and we're chillin on the first of a plug I was doing some editing I wanted to get some cartridges so I ordered EES got a little bright carts here and never seen these before actually we got a sour tangi and a Skywalker gu save that Skywalker for nighttime oh yeah this is just a first vape vlog I figured I'd just chill with you guys like right now I'm editing the can of butter video the same can of butter I use in peanut butter rights bites the candid but the peanut but there veyts and it's the strongest can of butter I've ever made so I'm excited for you to see this recipe you really don't need that much I've given these peanut butter bites as some friends they're like yo dude I had like this much man and I'm freaking lit so I'm happy for those but yeah we got the bright they got the sticker right on there yeah overall though I've been really enjoying the packs like it more than the Gio and you guys know I was all about that Gio that Gio life let me throw this in here so yeah I was gonna upload that cannabutter video today but I'm like legit [ __ ] chill talk smoke a little weed nice taste citrus coming through to me and join that one yeah so what else do I have in my library here that I'm editing kind of keep you guys several more cannabis and cocktail videos I got coming at you oh yeah I went to Lowell farms it's the or they say America's first ever cannabis cafe and I went there the other day hoping to get a dope video for you guys but it wasn't open yet as a matter of fact actually I think I have a little footage of that I'll just throw in right now so you can see me down there kind of see the outside of the building a little bit I don't know if you can see the Billboard right there behind me it's America's first ever cannabis cafe which I find hard to believe that Colorado hasn't ever had one or anything but uh came here supposed to be a post up on the patio blaze up have some CBD THC beverages it's looking like it's not quite open yet god it looks like they might be doing some work back there but uh you know I came prepared with the pre-roll here actually usually don't buy the pre rolls but from crew so figured I'd still shoot something out anyway here but I'm excited to try this place out because it looks dope cool place to kick it lays up have a drink have a joint outside lay back but seriously the place looks dope like I'm hoping eventually and I believe that these will be all over the United States where you can just go chill meet up have a drink smoke a J with some friends and it's not this thing that we have to like you know be super low-key about especially in states right now where it's illegal so that's interesting to me and I've definitely been in terms of just vaping feels like something's oh the things not in there all the way still hit now but in terms of vaping I'm definitely since I've been in California you know coming on for years now have definitely been vaping the most I ever have because in other states where it's not legal you can get the cartridges you know buying from people and they're cool but first of all you can't always trust them second of all they're not always around so like just the vape aspect is really convenient just have it take it out real quick one pub literally so discreet nice but I also just like the flavor you know it's hard to beat smoke though smoking like to me like that nice you just can't replace that smoke ever for me maybe it's cuz how I started out if I started out with the vape who knows maybe I'd be more obsessed with vapes even though I like I've obviously been smoking a [ __ ] ton on vapes I don't know all I know is I love the packs I'm I love baby and this brights pretty nice here couple in and definitely feeling the effects oh yeah I also wanted to talk about one of the true buds on here he's been here for a while leaves a bunch of comments david r Engler and he reached out to me and was like hey man is there any way you can help me basically he needs to take cannabis oil to help him with cancer I said of taking all these drugs which you know make it worse and that's me simplifying it he has a video on his Facebook page I'll put a link below so you can donate to him you know I'm gonna go ahead and donate to him myself because I'm here to help that's what I say on these videos I'm like you don't hit me up if you need something I'll try my best to help so this is me kind of trying to do that so if you have a extra dollar you know you want to help a guy who has cancer who wants some cannabis himself I think that's kind of cool and that's what I'm trying to do for your David so I hope you're feeling good David hope this helps man and thanks for being a true bud please comment below to let everybody know you've seen this and they just keeping it real out here man we all wish you the best so thanks David for real thanks again man really appreciate you bro what else we got new coming in the podcast is official I have the first four episodes lined out but I'm gonna shoot about eight or so I want to get a little library of episodes so I have a little backup because I'm doing it in a studio space because here right now we're pretty lucky it's pretty quiet not too loud but I want it to be optimal I want video so what we're gonna do is do about our session so I'll have a guest on for about 50 minutes to an hour okay kit talk you know about cannabis related topics obviously and just chill see where it takes us and this will also be coming on YouTube through a video as well and I might not actually add some other stuff on to the YouTube one just to make it a little different add that little extra element so I can keep everybody on YouTube happy as well as you know the podcast fan as well I hope they're just one big fan that likes to kick it I'm excited to get some really cool people on here it's gonna be fun I'm really pumped up about this you know what I always think though when I have these I'm like I feel like there should be some type of recycle program for the cartridges I feel like there still could be reused or some components maybe just a little metal in there I always felt like you know if you remember those Box Tops for Education maybe it's like pods for packs you send them in and they give you something for yourself except your school but seriously I actually have most of mine safe because I feel weird throwing them away and I just want to see all the different varieties that I've had I'll show I'll do a video of that one day for you just kind of showing you everything because there's a lot of them a lot [ __ ] it let's taste the Skywalker you let's taste it what's your thought on baby what do you rather smoke or vape just ingots in here good see that's what I mean that's good I mean the flavor in all these the flavor literally in almost everyone I've had has been amazing apart from some CBD mint one I had a while back I don't remember what company was that I think that that was kalila if I'm not mistaken I'm pretty sure actually pure taste the sour

guys are above the age of 18 and 21 and you're in a legal state where you can consume cannabis so thank you guys for watching and let's get it right while jokes aside though this is the first time I've ever been in front of a camera in like ten years so please bear with me everybody and I also have not smoked today so this is gonna be the first time getting high so this will really tell you if this product will get me high and buy the title of this video you will already know today I'm going to be unboxing a pod and a pod system battery that I purchased so kind of will go over the process of today I went to this place called Northeast alternatives like right down the road from my house I obviously picked up a packed pod granddaddy purp indica dominant only first off I have the pod itself it's called a pax era let me grab the pod itself this is the pockets pretty light it is made by Serie Naturals dot-org we're looking at 75 percent THC for all I spend 111 bucks it was 65 for the pod and 30 for the battery so she'll pretty gnarly looking oh I didn't even read the bottom Syrah Naturals in Milford mouths thank you guys pretty sick it's pretty cool packaging all right so first off push finger through a circle then push and hold the inner tab firmly alright this is a lot darker than I thought it was gonna be it says indica GDP Syrah Nashville's it's very dark you can tell but ah I'm pretty excited I like this and assuming you just push up making this a lot harder than it should be sorry guys my first time being a youtuber pretty much every part it buddy Prather says that all right we got a insert extract pod pulses when connected and enjoy the era alright don't need anyways Wow looks like a jewel micro USB connect - ain't moving sorry my fingernails do not mind the fingernails guys sorry all right I've held this for more than a minute long this video is a minute long so I can't wait to rip this this batteries over here - charging hey Alexa tell me a joke how do you turn a mosquito into a fruit I couldn't tell you squashing [Music] [Music] [Music] there we go [Music] was hard alright let's take another [Music] so at first it's really smooth and then after like five or so seconds when you're exhaling it it hits like a dab like it hurts in the back to throw and it like feels like you're hitting a peak you don't I mean like it feels like a really hot Pete I mean I'm pretty amped on this like I love how small it is and how you could just take it anywhere and like I can have a DAB you know what I mean like on the run well if I have like somewhere to be and I can't bring my stuff this might be the play I am like very high if you guys can tell I don't really talk like this in front of the camera I feel like I love now I because I change the temp I love how it's like much smoother it's actually not harsh at all so if you guys want to support the channel there's links in the description I have a twitch channel that I'm gonna

great day [Music]", "2uwqcupoXIk": "here we have the pecs era thing pretty sweet pod it's empty these things are like $60 a pop so it'd be ideal to refill them and I'll show you how to easily take this off you need is some of these c-clip pliers so they can do this [Music] now they'll do this which is what we'll need so I'll show you these are a couple of taking apart first try taking the top part apart which is just a mouthpiece and it's hot on these two little things and then in theory you can syringe or push these plugs in and syringe from the top but it's kind of a pain in the ass and totally not ideal so then the second thing you can do is take the bottom piece out and it looks like this see how these little filters on each side like so sometimes it'll stay and then it just pops back in like so so I'm taking it out be careful so if you don't get enough pressure and then you pull this part out it'll pull these metal things with the wicks with it and then you'll get something that looks like this that's really pain to put back another thing I've noticed some of these cartridges gonna leak through the seal that's right around this edge there's a gasket right around there and when that happens you get all the filters or I'll get all soaked up with all the oil so this one's kind of useless too so now no syringe of some new oil I'm gonna fill it up touch this plunger [Music] there take that off and we can put this needle pour it on and we want to do is fill it up but not get it in the hole because then I'll just pretty much come out the mouthpiece good this is a 1 grand cartridge I didn't fill it all the way up as you can see and then we get the full cartridge plug around and test it up", "vAkq-3CkUAg": "what's up everybody it's your boy mastermind here for ohio cannabis live we're back with another video we're trying to reach 2000 subscribers so please do me a big favor and hit that like subscribe button right now and make sure you hit the notification bell to be updated for the latest and newest videos and reviews and news all right today we're going to be talking about luster pods and lustre pod batteries and we'll be talking about pax era and pax pods and batteries so let's jump right in [Music] another mastermind hit [Music] all right we're going to talk about this luster pod first lesser pot was released by grow ohio back in the summer and they had several different strains but the breakout strain that everybody loved was the lyric cake and um you know this battery is pretty basic it doesn't have any buttons there's a little light here that tells you when it's in use or when it's being charged there's a micro usb port here at the end that you can see and um you know it's pretty simple the pod that goes in it i'm gonna show you a pod that's used this pod is no longer functioning but it does a slide right into the device like this and this is what it looks like with a battery in the pod together cost wise it wasn't really that expensive because it gave you a kit major drawbacks with this battery was or had no way to tell you you know when the battery needed to be charged it doesn't have any type of temperature controls or dose settings at all and one thing that commonly happened is the wheel be clogged up in the mouthpiece as you can see here and um this this this thing was just a really a disaster product far as i'm concerned i have had nothing but problems with these uh luster pods and um you know royal ohio did refund me uh in the form of a visa gift card for this pod that i'm showing you here in this video so i do think that grow ohio is one of the few companies that does have a refund policy listed on their website that basically tells you what process to go to to submit a request for refund for a defective product now the next thing that happened was another company called clutch decided they were going to use the same system and they decided to go with a black pod which you can barely see the oil in it this is an ice cream cake pod um you know the oil is not the problem is the device just the fact that this one also clogs but not as bad as the grow high pod so it still works um and i haven't had to contact clutch um for a clogged pod but it does still clog um not even after a day of use but maybe after hours of use these things clog up this is the primary uh drawback with this luster pi battery so next thing that happened was uh another battery come out this been around in the market a lot longer than this luster pod this is a pax era this is made by the same company that makes the pax uh one two and three dryer vaporizer and concentrate vaporizer um also the same company that um you know has had a little bit of controversy when it came to the pods that they use for their nicotine devices but one thing i will tell you is that this device functions uh it gives you a lot of different features just for comparison purposes we're going to look at how much weight difference there is between these batteries because weight matters when you're carrying this thing with you for the butterfly effect luster battery it weighs 36 0.2 grams empty without the pot in it let's put a pot in there keeping in mind this pot is nearly empty but just for a reference point 42.4 grams is what we're getting on the weight there and the other one the pax era it weighs 16.5 grams empty with no battery and another battery that is pretty much almost gone you can see the oil in there it's low put that in there and that takes up to about 19.7 grams so you know the pax era battery is definitely lighter than the and it's a slimmer profile too if you look at them side by side you can clearly see that one is smaller than the other one is definitely lighter than the other and you know we really don't have any more features to talk about when it comes to the luster pod when we're talking about the pax era you can use the same app that you use for the pax 3 so if you already own a pax 3 device you can use exact same app and some of the benefits here with this device is that as soon as you put the pod in there um you know you're able to control the temperature from the android app unfortunately for iphone users um they block the packs app from their apple store so you can't use this with apple but you can always get a tablet and use it that way get an android tablet still be able to control your battery most of the 510 batteries on the market um just aren't designed in this way um this still has a micro usb charge but you can upgrade to the pax era pro which i'll show you another video um that actually takes the c charger so if you have a newer modern phone you can use the same charger to charge your packs that you would use to charge your phone which is i think pretty handy another thing too is that i can clearly see how much oil is in this pod it is a half a gram you do get more oil in the luster pod up to 0.85 grams of oil which is still under a gram but for the pricing you still get a good value on the oil in those luster pods but this oil seems to last a lot longer than the luster pot oil and again much less clogging is going on here with this device and what i also want to let you guys know too is that um with the app which i'm going to show you here on the screen you can actually see that the lab results for the oil in the cartridge um any oil cartridge that is made by the ohio processor cure ohio all their test results are loaded into the packs app which allows you to be able to access not only the lab results for your oil pod itself will also allow you to access the terpene profile for that strain so if you're in the terpenes like i am you can actually see what terpenes are actually in these strains in these pods in this oil and then also you know you can adjust the temperature on the app for 430 degrees all the way up to 790 degrees i don't know any other uh vape pen this is small this light that has that type of capability also you know i'm going to show you have a lost and found feature if you lost it there's a way to locate it and also for security purposes there is a lockout feature to lock it out to keep people from tampering with it um this thing even has a brake system so like you know if you're hitting it really hard some people like to hit their device really hard this thing will actually turn on a little break i'm gonna give you 30 seconds so that you can take a breather so this helps minimize the coughing and choking cost wise this battery is 20 dollars paired with a coco or cure ohio packs half a gram pod you know you're going to see those priced about 50 bucks so for a battery and the pod you could be out of 70 in ohio's market sometimes the dispenser run a promotion where if you buy the pod they'll give you the battery for free and if you can get the sale on the pod usually the sale on the pot itself can be up to 20 percent off of the retail price which is like i said about fifty dollars plus tax so i'm looking at the luster pot and the cost of a lester pod kit um they're about 70 as well so the price is very comparable yes you get a little more oil in the luster pot however you gain a lot more functionality with the pax era so you know in the final analysis here i would say that um cost wise you really can't beat the price of the pax era even if you're buying it for the first time i'm strongly recommending to all processors who are using other devices such as luster pods and other 510s to consider using the pax era system that way our program can just have one device and everybody can just stop buying all these extra batteries because when you look at some of the other devices out there it's just not a very good functioning device with a lot of controls i think this device offers something that other devices doesn't and i think dose control is an important feature to have if you're using it as a medical cannabis patient so that's my thought process no one paid me for this review this is my own thought and opinion after months of trying both of these devices and spending time with them to figure out which one worked better and at the end of the day the pax era is the winner so if you like the video and appreciate what i'm doing make sure hit the like subscribe button and i will see you next time peace", "XmDIsktVOZk": "I was spending money and bakeshop spinning cup on his head to make shine seen a couple money's in the base shot okay this y'all honey tell you Meister I was spending money and bakeshop spinning Cup on is it the bake shot seen a couple money's at the base shot okay this y'all I need a base that I been getting elevate ladies and gentlemen can I please have your attention I've just been handed an urgent and horrifying news story and I need all of you to stop what you're doing and listen [Applause] [Music] man welcome to the big sub Chronicles my name is Michael and I'm Felipe we're gonna be showing you guys how to use the pack spend the day so this is the pack cerumen we're gonna do a little review on it today show you guys how to use it show you the cool features that it has but you could hook it up to your Bluetooth device and do a couple more things on it then which is pretty cool cuz if they just told me right now that you actually can play three games with this thing you have the separate device that you can lock it and you can actually change the temperature on it which is pretty cool so what you guys get in there is your guys's packs ped you guys also get a charger included with it and you guys will also get a little booklet of instructions it's it's pretty easy to use it's not really hard so let's get to it so to know when your device is on all you really do is you got to shake it and you see those little leaf petals right there that's how you know how much charge you have on the device each petal thereafter that's 25% battery life so your first bet will be like zero to 25 second one twenty-five to fifty third one fifty to seventy-five and last one is gonna be your 75 to 100% these guys do take a pod which are these little guys right here they're a special specially designed for the PAX era pen you can't use it with any other device and it spits it's fairly fairly new to the market attacks has been around for a minute now but we're really picking this up just because a lot of customers come in here and ask us about the Indigo pro pen Indigo Pro pens good stuff but the thing is these guys have a little bit better features on them and you're able to deliver there it's good mark it's a smart bet yeah it's like a smart battery pretty much repo I mean it's have indigo Pro you know I was at offenders of the vibration or the vibration you know but you know that's has been it's cheating me well since I first got one and it's less the packaging can just go it is the magazine is dope this about like all right you guys so let's uh let's get to it man this right here all you have to do really is just put it up to your mouth after you insert your guyses pods and just pretty much just take it and smell comes up just like that oh man that flavor flavor how is it oh I'm kind of flavour you getting out of it I don't think that's the dippin dots man I think that's the Jack Herer so you guys just saw not a vapor in that this little guy produced right now Michael's over here you know recuperating from that so you can actually change the temperature on this device without you connecting it to your phone so right now to know what too much you have you shake it light comes on you pop the pot out and renounce on the medium temp so you guys see those little petals it'll start kind of flashing and doing a rotation on where the temperature is so like I said we shake it we pop and it tells us the temperature it also cycles to do so if you want to lock it onto like the hottest temperature you just push the pod back down and it locks the the petals into that hot temperature so once you take a hit more smoke and like I said you do sacrifice a little bit more of the flavor with so what do we wouldn't we selling these are at 45 I'm not mistaken for the battery right you actually are mistaken so these are actually 40 bucks 40 bucks okay but the pods themselves themselves are dollars but if you guys come on wax Wednesday when it's 10% off you guys get 10% off any of the packs so hit it again man and then we'll turn it down to the one of the lower temperature so you guys could kind of see how much smoke you get from the lower temperature so as we said remember we shake we pop the pod and then we let it cycle low temp right there that little low temp a right there it's just flavor all of it flavor flavor flavor smooth on the throat not so harsh II and like I said once you turn the temperature back down on these pods I'm not sacrificing the flavor it's gonna taste like it just barely came out of so the cool feature on the device is you can control it via an application the application is called the PAX mobile app you can find it on the App Store or and the Android Google Play stores that as they call it and it pretty much gives you a connection to your device via bluetooth on your phone and you're able to kind of change the color of the pedals regulate the temperature and play those three games that Mike over here was so so so excited about I've really ever played smoking was baseball when you're a baseball passing on a bunt something today alright so that little guy that screen is your temperature regulation when you start moving the dial to the left or right side it's gonna start telling you for going kind of hot or kind of more on the cool side and it also tells you more flavor as you go over to the left-hand side I believe so we go all the way to the bottom and as you guys could tell a little leaf petal should be changing according to the temperature on the on the device here so when you take a low temp not that much smoke came out reason why is because it's super low so you're not sacrificing the flavor of the cartridge it's just all flavor and just deliciousness I love all flavor on my dad's doctor phone so once we go back to the hot temperature once we go over to this side we can go as hot as seven hundred ninety degrees that means what it is wow I'm right all the way behind those little guys shut up oops so this guy right here should have flashed red so the next time you take that hit you produce those fat clouds that a lot of people love about the depends man so since Mike was complaining that we did take a hot tip dab we're gonna hand them the pen over there and we're gonna go all the way back to Mike about the four hundred and yeah it's the lowest setting I was four hundred thirty 30 entries so you wanna take the hand like so another thing that you can't do it as Mike was hitting me I started increasing the temperature so if you would hit for a little bit longer you would seem a lot more smoke came out at the end you Brian up like dying on the confident just because I got we had a blue bit for him but we're doing we're gonna tell men so thanks for that that's a nicer perfect pom-poms want to set him I got a waste in a tasty in order to you know definitely right at that flavor that so he can also taste out in the pale colors over the little uh little guys right here so you can do the different colors red yellow blue change the dim of the light on it so I mean if you make it really dim we're gonna make it super bright and it also doesn't come with a little video tutorial on how to play the games you were really not gonna get much into the games this episode but probably in the near future we probably will get the game will show you guys a little bit on the game solitaire but for now we're just pretty much doing anything you want to smoke it show everybody how it smokes and pretty much the taste of the oil that these guys pretty much give off man you know I'm I mean I'm a pretty chronic smoker and you know that a couple hits I just different I've got no so-so pain baseball man so say I take a hit all right I'll take a hit pass it he takes a hit I hold my hidden until it comes back to me then once you pass it back to me hits my hand I exhale that hit and then it you know called Facebook so who starts it then I have to hit this I mean just like a hot tub for like let's do a medium you know like in the middle of the head and Chuck he passes it back to you you learn something new every day today and then okay so how long do we have data for is there like a certain limit like 10 seconds 8 seconds no just take it hit your normal hit like something pass it back right yeah this depends on how data hits you want to take all right oh I just kind of find out what spin is man so spin is pretty much like spin the bottle but you don't spend this little guy the little petals spin themselves so whichever whichever light it lands on that person has to take that hit so by I'm Ted over here the ghost has to take two and then we do the next one beautiful hit that's one of the games that is included with it so if you're with a bunch of friends and you know you guys kind of want to do that spin around play a spin it's called at this moment in time I'm blind I spin the bottle pretty much what it is but with the pact syrup and whoever lands on get to take that oh yeah a trip out on this this is one of the features that we forgot to kind of mention real quick it's that there's something lock the device so like a little quick scene right here me and Mike right now or you know we're smoking real quick and like I don't know man let's say this guy was not as full as it is right now and you know I'm taking that in then it's Mike's turn in this guy's already been hitting there for like I don't know come along you know I mean like he's hogging it he's talking being social hitting it not passing at all you know I mean one of the ball huggers as a penny would calling the investor ball so I say that's the Kobe but Kobe fat so you just hit that lock device right there I am now a Dubrow that's a no you got to say man my pen just messed up I think it's ready out of oil which cash it's done can I have that back please thank you very much and then you know what I mean once you leave your friend's house you just hit that little button right there it goes back to green and back to smoking and that's pretty much you know a little cool little feature that this thing does have or as other people say medicated all right you guys so if you guys want to try out the pack spin era make sure you guys go over to the bake shop myself Michael when will these I would run Ruthie Moore Michael myself will be over there and remember you guys wax Wednesday every Wednesday 10% off and out of pods so you guys get them for pretty much like a 45 45 45 ish taxes included but yeah that's pretty much it man and come visit us and we'll get you guys going on

blackberry Aylin you need to try it out guys see how it is 91% - you see I don't know about that but we'll see the same company from Redondo is distillate guys natural terpenes solvent free and I plugged it in my packs alright mine is that 700 700 temperature Fahrenheit excuse me there that's my preference guys that's the way I liked very my loyal under little handout thing little this thing

for the cartridge and I tried it once or twice and it was a bomb but that was the last time I tried honey bear that's been years honestly if you tried it it kind of tastes the same as honey babe the Highland blackberry end up honey big blackberry kind of the same obviously the percentage could be there I don't know man but on our line it says 77% so who knows right other than that does give you a good high I would want them to be more consistent under TC percentage cousin you know then I'll just be grabbing Hyde and low higher than Lord I just I want to be on point you know what I mean that's just me so blackberry OG gonna bomb bomb really good oh my god bomb guys hmm now since I got it on 'yes i think everybody's on price points is different i think la la County's like $40 for the half

review today i am excited because i've got a special guest what's good appreciate you being here today we're going to be reviewing a product that she recently received as a sample at mother nature's remedies so we're gonna check it out we've never heard of it never tried it brand new so um why don't you tell us a little bit about it i believe it's a new vaporizer or vape on the market normal i picked a pineapple express it's a full gram i'm a sativa smoker so i haven't had pineapple express actually hmm what are we going to do what are we looking at for the numbers um well let me see the ingredients of 100 cannabis oil terpenes nothing from outside the plant okay so that statement clearly is saying cannabis dripping at that point right and it says total thc 908.61 milligrams okay so point 90.8 ninety point eighty six percent pretty potent ninety four ninety plus percent is pretty popular cbd one point seven seven milligrams or point seven two percent and it was a date manufactured august 5th okay so not exactly super fresh but not old either this one's called social so that's the sativa that's the social what strain did you say was i have like pineapple express so that'll be super cool um this is the starter kit looks like we have a the new normal premium cannabis vaporizer design device designed to empower you to transform any mood or activity conveniently and discreetly included in this starter kit is one 330 of what i believe is megahertz rechargeable battery one usb charging cable the instructions say to insert the pod into a charged new normal battery inhale to activate for best results inhale for two to five seconds and wait five to ten minutes in between inhales to gauge effects for vaporization use only do not ingest orally or apply topically all right so super cool you ready yeah we're going to do a classic one hit review where we talk about it y'all second hit we'll give you guys a square out of ten if it doesn't come charged stay tuned for the review video where we end up having to you know hit him with a little bit less of a score because all these should come first a little bit it's just backwards so this is the device up close it's pretty pretty i like it this pink rose gold color a little bit of the color it's basically see-through i don't even see any i see a tiny bit of gold coloring but for the most part for the most part not much um this has a lifetime warranty i've never seen that before have you on the device yeah no that's dope i like that register your device and get a lifetime warranty i don't know i'm not using it right oh wait there's a rubber stopper at the bottom okay oops details those details matter yeah look how tiny that is does come charged dope okay first hit it's nice it's girly it's in my opinion looks girly yeah it's it's definitely super nice i i feel like it's smooth uh aside from the stopper kind of tricking me there at the beginning i think it's easy to rip and pull a little bit larger clouds my nose is tingling from the terps i didn't did you get any kind of pineapple flavor i did you ripped it first though it's a harsh cue i feel like it's a tiny bit i mean it's really like i feel like it was harsh or i ripped it too hard i don't know i don't know well this is why we do two hits this is why we do do it all right here we go what are you thinking the pineapple's so subtle and i don't mind i like that it's not overpowering but it also lacks a little bit of flavor i think decent it's like tangy cross with something else for cleaner clothes for us i forget what it is but for me i don't know let me try it oh i'm gonna hit it softer first and then bigger on the other side so let's see if it's hard if it's easy i can't say that i'm already feeling both reps so like that's super easy to get that just by like breathing in and flavor-wise it's like it's fruity for sure but you can also definitely taste that it's you know they're not claiming to not be disliked but it's definitely just the vape and pineapple express um the reason i wanted to try it is because many people say that it can make you a little anxious yeah it's definitely been able to it comes with that you know the the anxiety comes with most of the higher thc strains when it comes to citrusy things are you getting a cottonmouth yeah i get it mainly from just vaping in general i like to fill my whole mouth up with the vape and then kind of let it out and breathe the mood in well i would say this is the first time it happened for me i'm when i think of a score out of 10 combining the custom battery you have to to use this pod you need their battery i believe um i don't know if i'm gonna buy a whole another battery just to use one brand's pod especially just for a distillate pod but it's around around fifty dollars yeah over 50. was it was it a foreground pod it is a full get it's a full grain five program you know i like that it's a full gram um the presentation the appeal i think it's all there i like the the colored vapor on the box uh right here i like the colored vapor here on the box i think that's super cool how it was branded with the vaporizer and then on this it has social with the same color vape but i don't know for me for me i'm sitting around like a it's just like another man i'm sitting there like eight i'm being nice you're really nice being nice give it a date i like the presentation i like the branding i like the box but it's just to me it tastes like this honestly it doesn't taste like weed it tastes like botanical botanical servings tastes like it tastes like fruity terps it tastes like cannabis which on the box it says that everything comes from the plant nothing from outside the plant but the problem is that it doesn't taste like that i just like this then everything yeah the packaging is great i wish they did i wish this was the device for more things i like that yeah i like the hardware for sure yeah i'm gonna give it a 8.2 8.2 all right jazzy's coming in at 8.2 i'm gonna sit in here at the eight even that's what we're that's the final score where we're at y'all new normal the highest percentage of happiness is what it says but i only feel 80 of the way there it's a beautiful device this is the west coast we tour we're keeping it real i appreciate you all for the love following along the way we've been doing a lot of these

we're gonna be doing the unboxing of the Mary's medicinal cartridge for the new pax era we're gonna unbox a pax era first it's by far the most exciting part of this so inside you get the device itself pulling back through the cover you get a micro USB so the charger is a lot more Universal if you have an Android phone you'll be able to use one of those and you can plug it into your laptop or one of those wall warts and this little sticker came in the box and it looks like it's about the perfect size for somebody's iPhone moving that box out of the way size comparison for scale if you have an iPhone 10 I'm going to show you guys how to pair the device to your smartphone so the pairing process is extremely easy you just press two buttons and then shake your device a few times you see the first time I shook it and kind of stopped because it only had one light you got to shake it until you have all four lights once you're past there you name your device entering your email and then I was prompted to do a firmware update you can change between four colors there is red yellow a blue and white you can also change the brightness of the lights you have packs games down here in the app that you can play on the actual device you have video tutorials just in case this isn't in-depth enough and at the very top you have your control center and that's going to be where you change your temperature opening up the cartridge next this is a Mary's medicinal one-to-one CBN to CBD the seal is kind of interesting it pulls away just like the PAX logo and you have to line up these two little areas to be able to pop the cartridge out it's pretty much it for this little one I'm going to be doing another review of this cartridge as well as more reviews of this device so stay tuned for those until next time [Music] you [Music]", "RzXMTAz-gjY": "what's up everybody it's your boy mastermind here with ohio cannabis live and we're back with another video we're trying to reach 2000 subscribers so please go ahead and hit that like subscribe button now and sit back and enjoy the show [Music] another mastermind hit welcome back to another video today is not a review video today we're going to do a comparison video today we're going to compare the pax era versus the pax era pro okay this is not going to be a real long video so don't worry i'm going to make it real simple for you the pax era is a 20 device the pax error pro is a 50 device so price comparison there's a thirty dollar price difference i'm not accounting for tax um and sometimes you can get a promotion where you can find uh the pax era for free if you purchase a pod with it sometimes you they'll give you a free battery sometimes depending on where you shop now as far as designs um they are very similar both of these are basically the same form factor as you can see here um now charging wise um the pax area uses a micro usb charge port where is the pax error pro uses the c charging usb port which is similar to what may be used on a samsung cell phone so the other thing that's different is that um one's black one silver there may be different colors but um there on the back here there's a little bit of a lip here now as far as what they both do when i shake them they both light up and it's telling me my battery status is what it's doing one's lighting up green and one's lighting up just white now you use the same app the pax app to control both of these devices um as far as inside the app some of the major differences for me are the way the dosing works on the pax era it has the dosing on there and it's a micro mini micro full medium something like that and then on the other one it has dose one two three four so that's different but still the same concept being able to control exactly how much medicine is being used per draw i know some people said they use this device and they didn't like it because they didn't like the airflow it didn't like the amount of vapor that was coming out of the device now that's all possibly due to the fact you didn't have your dosing set right now you can set this up to some you put it on a maximum dose like i tried to do a full dose on the past era and it was it was it was strong um where you know it's the same thing i put it on number two or three dosing on the pax pro and it was strong um so i i think what people ran into was when they got these devices they treated it like any other battery you just pick it up and you hit it pick it up and hit it and then you hit it until you're done hitting it and that's it but with a pax era i mean your pax era or pax 0 pro what you want to do is set the device up using the app because when you do that you can program it to your liking you can set it to the temperature that you want you can set it to the right dosing that you want so you're not getting enough medicine when you take in draws you can adjust that other 510 batteries like this guy here it has a voltage adjustment here that you can use to adjust the voltage no apps so you know that's that's kind of a primitive way to to do something similar to what this device does um also by connecting the app which is only available on android and that may be a setback for some people but you can also control the pax error pro on a computer so that is different uh but you can't do that with the regular one the pax error pro has a vibration feature that the pax era doesn't um if you're trying to decide whether one or the other i would simply say that um if you would like a few extra features like there's vibration um there is a little bit more easier way to get to your information like because this does provide you the test information and the terping profile and it just makes it easier to access it on this one but it's very the information is the same information no matter which device you use so if you're if you're on a budget and you don't have a lot of money you don't care about extra bells and whistles i'm going to say buy the pax error for 20 bucks because for 20 bucks you're getting a device that has bluetooth connectivity has lost and found it's very light um it's a charger that you probably already have a cord for laying around somewhere and um the pods are only a half a gram but with the with the control in here to adjust the amount that comes out this saves you money and time and the feedback i hear is that people that are using the app um they're seeing the oil last longer people who are not using the app um are not necessarily satisfied um and i think that's just because of a learning curve and i think that's something that pax could work on um if i had to give some critical feedback is that pac should definitely invest in educating people on how to use their products more thoroughly and that's the feedback that i think packs you hear from somebody and not just all happy talk that a lot of people get frustrated with these devices because they're not familiar with how to set them up now do you need the app every time you use it on either one of these devices no you don't regardless of whether using the pax era or the pax error pro you don't need to add all the time because once you set this is the one of the things i like about this guys once you set the app to your liking the device will pretty much remember those settings until you change it again as long as you keep it charged don't let it go dead um you will be able to keep the same settings now when you switch out to a different pod that will be one of the differences between these two devices if you switch the pod out of here um you will still have to reconfigure everything in the app on the pro on the other hand it will actually remember the pods you put in it so if you put two or three different pods in here it will actually remember those in memory so as soon as you put the pod in the device and connect to the app it will automatically identify which pod it is so that is definitely a very handy feature like i said i just want to give a quick comparison didn't want to take too much of your time if you haven't already make sure to like subscribe button and we appreciate you being here we'll see you next time

for a number of years now but today they are launching their new AeroPro it's a new vaporizer that actually connects with these specific pods right here to be able to give their users more specific precise information test results on the CBD content the THC etc in the strains that they're smoking not only does it give you more transparency in the information but it also lets you personalize how you take hits so right here you can see that you actually get to personalize how hot you want to smoke a given strain and also you get to choose how many doses you want to take for every inhale not only does it give you full transparency on the test results on the strains that you're smoking but it also lets you personalize how you smoke it straight so that app actually stores your preferences for each strain so maybe one you want to burn hotter and one you want to just sip on over time right and basically by storing that information and sort of adapting over time to how you smoke you gain sort of a more personalized experience to you're smoking houses right and the arrow Pro actually provides haptic feedback so when you inhale you get a certain amount a certain dosage and if you inhale hard or soft it actually still tries to give you a sort of adapt it tries to give you about the same amount and it actually vibrates it gives me kind of haptic feedback when you finish the dose so it's kind of a cool contraption here it adds it a lot of transparency a lot of smarts it's really cool to see this shift over time where they're adding so many smart and so much transparency to this burgeoning industry for more of the latest tech at CES check out our youtube channel otherwise thanks for watching [Music]", "yNtg2D9VSXw": "today I'm gonna show you how to refill packs pod the easy way there are a few videos out there that show you taking apart the bottom of this and pulling this all out but it's really messy and you run a risk of damaging the coil as well as the wick that is running through the coil inside of the pot so this is going to be a demonstration on how to do it differently and actually this is the way that they fill them to begin with so this here is a pod that I've already kind of torn apart for demonstration purposes and what we'll do is if you take this black cap off then this is what it looks like on the inside so this here is the actual chamber that holds your oil and what you see here at the top are two silicone bungs that fill these holes seal them off and there's a gasket on the inside of this as well and that's how they fill these to begin with and what they do is they actually puncture these gaskets with a needle and then just insert the oil that way now what I will do is something along those lines but slightly different the only difference being instead of puncturing those bungs we're just gonna work around them it's easier and yeah it gets the job done the same way so what I have here is there's just an empty refill cartridge and this here is a blunt tip needle it's a 18 gauge needle I tried I bought this kit here of multiple gauge needles and this is the largest one that I feel comfortable using the next size up is a 16-gauge and if you look they're pretty noticeably different in size in diameter actually to the to the extent that this one almost fits inside at the larger 16 gauge and trying to use the 16 gauge to get past these gaskets here just doesn't work so the connector type is a lure lock and you'll need that for most of these common refill cartridges so all you have to do is let's put this on there just screws right on like that and what you'll do is you'll work this needle around the outside of this gasket here and it's pretty straightforward you just kind of push it out of the way and then pop it right in and as you can see that goes really quickly and you can see the inside of there then and what you'll also see is inside the gaskets actually folded over right there and when you pull this out it'll close right back up as well see if we can show that a little bit more clearly you can see it moving there and you just bypass it and then when you retract the needle out it closed it's on it closes on its own so this one I actually used a the syringe that came with these refill kits this guy right here if I can pull this out I forgot it and sanded it down and what happened is it actually created this large hole right here inside of this that it still works just it's just messy there's no need to do it and you can see this big black piece of the gasket that's been cut off so don't do that that's the short of it and then you can just fill this cartridge up it looks like you can fill it up pretty full I wouldn't recommend doing more than half a gram or a little bit more than that at most so what we'll do is we'll get rid of this demonstration cartridge and take a real empty cartridge and fill it up here is some oil that I have stain ground and when you're using a needle that is smaller gauge like this you'll want to warm it up just to be sure that it flows well and I just have a incandescent desk lamp that I just set it under and it works pretty well to warm it up so with the lid on here this black plastic cover you kinda just have to go by feel but basically you go in through these ports right here and it says the same gaskets one on either side and you want to go on the outside so on the on the outside of this and at the inside of this gasket because there's more sealing sealing gasket on the inside and it just gets in the way so we'll just I go in kind of on the top and then just feel it and then just push it through and you can already see it protruding in there see wiggling around in there yep and then once you have that done I have to do is then start rotating this wrong direction this way it'll start feeding and we can watch it go right in I check them in here and you can see already that's starting to flow in that's about it so keep working it you can see it's filling up nicely depending on the the syringe kit that you buy you might need a different lock system but the ones that are here use the luer lock and it works just fine now I don't know if it's necessary but you can always once you kind of fill it up past that this black line or the lid is you can then retract it and then fill in the other side if you'd like you can you know it's all it's all one giant chamber in there so you can fill the whole thing up from one side as you can see but it just really depends on personal preference at that point so for demonstrations I'll just switch to the other side then to just pull it out flip it over go back in again we are in there and continue hardest part honestly is holding the holding this could you get the pinch it here and then turn it counterclockwise and just it's a weird feeling I love that childproof it does take a while when you have this narrow gauge needle compared to the one that comes with but there's a really clean easy straightforward process again use a use a blunt tip 18 gauge needle and you have to work your way past that gasket and you save yourself about 50% versus the cost to buy a brand-new pod and once were there so this looks pretty good let me pull a little more in I mean that's good for the demonstration and we will those are refilled pod and just take our packs plug it in you can see that smoke path but works just fine yep and there it is you're all set", "-vJe9Gfb06c": "the pax era is a sleek smart vaporizer device designed for easy and discreet consumption and

review show where we help you find fine fine fine fine fine folks make sense of your dispensary and guys we're about to enter a new era here on weeds a pax era because we're talking about the pax era today that's right guys we are talking finally reviewing the pax era system this is actually the second time I have reviewed the pax era system that's a little insider knowledge I lost it the first time in the middle of the review so coming back around to it a little a little bit later um okay so we're talking pax era again today the third of the sort of very popular pod line of vaporizers I think that's what we're gonna call them is the pod vaporizers you've got the most popular steezy and you also have plug and play in this space and then I'd say probably the second biggest is gonna be your pax era behind it steezy so this is made by pax who started off as a herb vaporizer I herb vaporizer company I own a pax one and two and I love them quite a bit and they have now gotten into the portable vape game they have they're sort of different than steezy and plug and play in that they partner with different farms and different companies to make pods for them they make some themselves but you'll see pods from like select or you know a bunch of different companies making packs era pods I assume packs gets some kind of cut today we are going to be looking at specifically the island mango haze from pax I believe this is a paksas own brand or one of their own brands I believe yes yes this is from PAX themselves they come in a very interesting so little package here you've got this shelf tag and then a little plastic thing that I guess has the pot in there very handsome packaging a little bit you know there's a it's not too wasteful but it's very colorful very vibrant I like that and then it says up to three times the vapor of compared to the original packs pods cool so this is one high-intensity cannabis vapor and then on the back we have got our lab and batch testing and all that neato stuff this comes in at seventy seven point five two percent THC which is medium high for cartridges or in pods out there without any further ado let's go ahead and open up our little box here I have already opened this and went ahead and charged it I've made that mistake in the past so here it is the charged packs here is our box comes in a little sleeve and then right in here is the pax era that says insert era pod and underneath we've got you know your register your safety information nobody ever reads another microUSB cable a sticker I like stickers and photobombing at a desk and then this thing imploring you to download the new pax era app on your phone which is pretty cool pax has an app I think that syncs through bluetooth I'm not sure it's downloading right now and I'll be sure to get in this in the second half the review in which you can actually change the temperature and intensity of the hits that you get which is really neat when you with just easy and plug-and-play it's one setting and that's it so this allows you to sort of mess around with different settings which is pretty similar to the PAX dry vaporizers themselves I believe this is what is the size of the battery I'm here I think it is also a 500 milliamp hour battery the same size as steezy it doesn't say for sure I will try to find out and let you know that as well um okay so let's go ahead and take off our stickers both of these have these little the packs itself and then the little pot has these private or piracy stickers on them I'm sure they don't work but you know I definitely purchased this from a legal dispensary and that's a good time to go ahead and talk about the price um I got this from the website the weed website is calm the pax era actually came free or it cost a dollar with the purchase of a pod which is pretty good the pax era itself I believe is a little bit more expensive than both the steezy and plug and play it usually retails for about 30 bucks but there is that little added extra tech in there that the others don't have and then the pods themselves do seem to be a little bit more expensive than steezy but less expensive than plug-and-play I think they only have half grams this one was 42 I believe so runs a little bit more expensive than steezy but not outrageously so I am having trouble figuring out how to open this maybe not through any fault of their own but only because I am a doofus I don't see where it's telling me what to do to open it and I feel like I'm just gonna break it if I do that okay I can figure this out you know I'm a real boy oh they're a ghost it was just pulling open got a pull pretty hard to get that thing open and here we go here is our packs pod it says Island Mingo right on it there if that'll focus okay wow it is I assume a lot of the oil is hidden under that mouthpiece but it looks like not a lot of oil in there doesn't look like half a gram to me but I'm sure somewhat quite a bit of is obscured by the packaging so let's go ahead and insert our pod I think it either way works and it was supposed to give me a buzz it says I didn't feel it but let's try it oh my god wow that is tasty as a ax [ __ ] holy [ __ ] my god um Island mango what a perfect name for it this tastes like you know a Caribbean vacation and your fourth to fruity drink you know with its massive piece of fruit that you take out and never actually eat this is what that tastes like Wow okay yeah that is that is excellent tasting oh my god um easily one of the best tasting cartridges I've ever had if you like them sweet if you like them fruity uh-huh wow that is absolutely incredible absolutely love it and then the oil itself that hits themselves great man they hit super super hard I think it hits a little bit harder than it's easy you get bigger drawers then steezy and the as I said the taste is amazing and its really potent it it feels may be stronger than that seventy seven percent that they're advertising which you know fine with me I'm sure that's what it is but it feels quite strong I'm really really pleased with the potency here young Wow I I mean I like the taste of different strains in weed and I there's some that I really enjoy but this is one of the few that I I mean even if it didn't get any high it's just it tastes so good it's really quite something um okay so this first part of this packs Arivu really great we'll take a quick review here so this again the packs itself is about 30 bucks at different places and the pods are a little bit more expensive than steezy certainly more expensive than your normal 510 cartridges on average but you are paying for that sort of pod premium experience now one thing I have noticed just holding this negatively is that I am a little oh you can push down on it guys that is a tip that I'm gonna give you right now it'll work just fine like this but you can feel it and it will just come right out be sure to put that extra little pressure and insert it all the way in you'll feel it kind of not really click but sort of slide in and now it's quite stable so be sure to do that it's not like steezy where it just sort of magnetically clicks into place um first impressions super positive love the taste love the potency really like this system on but we have some stuff to get into here we'll talk more about the little problems that might arise like the cartridges being easy to fall out I'll dive into that app and let you know how cool that is being able to change all that [ __ ] I mean I'll let you know Oh does this pod really seem like half a gram does it seem like you know you should pay this sort of slight premium over cz well all those questions are going to be answered I'm going to be using this system until I have this half grand pod depleted probably take me to two and a half three days to get through and as soon as I do I will come back here give you all the notes on the battery life give you all the notes on the whole system let you know about that app experience but for right now if this is all you're ever gonna see I'm really really pleased with the packs era pod it seems to you know make a case for itself in the already crowded pod market place so that's gonna do it for this first half I am really looking forward to working on this and I will see you guys right back here as soon as I finish thanks for watching [Music] well friends I am back and it has been three days since I started on my pax era journey enjoying this island mango strain there and it has been a beautiful wonderful incredible journey oh my god um so there is my empty little pod right there first and foremost this thing is deceptively large it kept delivering over and over and over and over again it it lasted a lot longer than a traditional half gram for me it's probably the way it was metered out its maybe the drawers are smaller than I thought but it wasn't like I felt like I was lacking on a decent good high these past three and a half days not at all this is this is really strong stuff and I hit it just as much as I hit anything else I just kept noticing like the the pot itself wasn't depleting wasn't depleting and even when it those levels started to lower it sort of kept going down at a slower pace than I imagined which to me is great I was not expecting it to provide as much oil seemingly as it did again there's probably a half gram in there it just seems to be the way that it distributes it and that delicious delicious oil that it distributes as well again one of the finest tasting oils I've ever had super super tasty um another thing I want to bring up is actually how cool the app is the app is actually pretty neat I don't think you ever really need to mess with it if you don't want to but there you can as I told you before you can adjust the temperature you can adjust how long you want your drawers to be like it'll auto shut off after a certain length of time that you've determined and it also has games that are one it's crazy that they're there and two I don't think I'm ever going to play them because they're dumb but you know it's cool they're they're really this is worth the premium of the the pot itself I'd say you know runs about five dollars on average more than a cc half grand pot or $10 more on average than a normal 510 half gram cart but it is a really great experience if if you're not on a tight budget and you're looking for one of the best vape experiences out there the PAX era is not going to disappoint it certainly didn't with me I'm glad I didn't lose it this time because I anticipate using it over and over again in the future oh one thing that did remind me again be sure to really push that in there I know at one point during this past couple of days I passed it to somebody who's wanted to take a quick dragon he wasn't paying attention sort of flipped it up and the things shot off into the air so a slight design flaw just make sure you really put that pod in there so it doesn't you know you don't lose your precious oil like I almost did awesome great great great great stuff totally love the packs and the packs era system if you're looking for something to do you can totally give those games a try if you're bored of every switch game and iOS game available you know you've got your pax era to dip back into cool alright guys but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top I liked this pax era so much I'll share with you guys a little something extra just because I'm feeling real generous uh and I'm sure a lot of you have already heard of it because it seems to be doing pretty well man the boys on Amazon the new Amazon Prime series about a group of guys who are trying to take down a very grounded sort of superhero world where there are superheroes that are sort of like corporate mascots that also have superpowers and are also terrible people and there's this rogue group that wants to teach them a lesson it's extremely violent extremely funny and it is written at least the original graphic novel by one of the best in the business Garth Ennis also the writer of the incredible preacher that's a cherry on top for another day if you like ultra violence if you like your super hero e stuff really give the boys a shot I am super pleased with it it came out better than I could have possibly hoped just like this pax era and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this pax era and mango island pod review extravaganza thank you so much for watching

your boy turpy tom welcome back to my awesome medical cannabis review and this one obviously we got ourselves a pax era pro pod a hybrid bodega bubble gum odega bubblegum live resin packs pod yes see the numbers see all that good stuff right right there we have it um now my buddy was asking me about this and and you know i was telling him what all the the benefits and all the good stuff that this battery actually has like the new tracking uh thing that that the app has for it so if you misplace your pax battery you have the app on your phone you can link it and it will literally help you find where your [ __ ] battery is keep track of all the the pods but what you purchase uh keep track of all the test results all that good stuff so so this battery is smart just like your smartphones i mean it's pretty dope but the prices on the other hand i do not like the prices on these i mean 70 [ __ ] dollars for a [ __ ] half gram pax pod uh of live [ __ ] resin whatever the [ __ ] it is they want to call it but the thing i do like about these is that they last a lot i mean they last a long time like i've been puffing on this one for since i did the review you know what i mean it's been like a week or so and as you can see it's still about halfway full and i'm still getting nice pulls nice taste everything out of it like i love it that's that snow monster is annika so i like i gotta tell my buddy i love it at night i wake up in the middle nine and i gave it a couple pulls the next thing you know i'm waking up in the morning like i feel refreshed you know what i mean but anyway let's get into the [ __ ] bodega bubble gum strain all right you guys seen the numbers you know how to open it you push in push and you pull now remember if it does not have that red line it's not real this one is by liberty i've had strain rhythm and now liberty [Music] one cool thing is about this is that it actually says [Music] this drain on it if you can see it it's really hard to see it's kind of smudged out but it does say uh bodega bubblegum sauce this is a sauce [Music] live resin but this is sauce so uh i don't know that's that's kind of weird we're gonna pop it in here i will i will um see the battery life on it i guess is that the battery life yeah that's the heat all right yeah okay okay so we're gonna start the heat off at number one i will take screenshots of the information that's on the um the app and posted in the beginning of this video or at the end i don't know we'll see but uh yeah there we go cheers bodega bubblegum live resin or sauce cheers [Music] let me get much of a taste of that head there [Music] that's different that's different it doesn't doesn't really taste like potato bubble gum strain to me [Music] what it tastes like is almost like a salad bar like a ranch dressing almost like i don't know but terpy it's kind of weird be honest with you i don't mind the taste it's not a bad taste wasn't what i was expecting now kind of has like a a greenery kind of like a salad greenery kind of taste like you're just eating lettuce almost yeah i was expecting more of like a fruity kind of bubble gum taste with bean bodega bubble gum you know what i mean i have i have had bodega bubble gum before uh i believe in concentrate and in flower so i mean i was expecting that kind of whatever but uh yeah there you have it guys a quick little fast one for you um bodega bubble gum a liberty so-called live um resin but yet the thing says sauce on it so i don't know anyway there you have it three batteries left uh i like them they definitely expand the lungs they definitely get the job done um it's it's to me it's not like like uh doing a dab which some cartridges the live resins are like taking a dab you know what i mean this one here just doesn't compare to it maybe i just haven't hit it hard enough or something which i'm not going to because i use these for on the go and i really don't smoke the carts at home with that said keep that in mind that cartridges are really good in convenience and uh stealthy and [ __ ] you know what i mean for when you're out and about and on the go so make sure y'all smash that like share subscribe all the [ __ ] has been here since day one i appreciate y'all uh 2021 let's let's just keep this year positive right let's keep this thing going positive all right peace out mama i love you yo one thing what i did forget uh with this review uh is to turn the temperature up so i did turn the temperature up i'm at 75 percent temperature um and i did taste more flavors i tasted like lemon uh maybe like like a kind of citrusy so it's more like like uh lettuce and lemon kind of like a salad lemon kind of flavor uh it's not too bad like i said i expected uh bubble gum uh kind of cushy kind of flavors but you know it's pairing to my phone right now that's what it's doing but uh yeah cheers i just figured to let y'all know that because i only hit it on the on the lowest setting and i never turned it up during that review so i figured let's just hit this thing does have more of a taste so i will give it a a more of a yeah go pick this one up all right [Music] you", "buiGq3jlHm8": "[Music] buddy what's up what's up guys this is Chucky Fuego coming to you from Los Angeles California and today I'm reviewing the jetty extracts unrefined live resin vape so it's really cool about this vape is that first off it is a pax era pod so you've got this sleek looking babe that you can just walk around with very very chill the pod comes off just like that super super simple pops right on doesn't take a long time to charge that's number one number two why is it called unrefined live resin well I did my research I looked up on jetty extracts website and let me tell you a little bit about this so of course we all know that live resin means when they pick the nugs off the plant to actually run the nugs when it comes to making your concentrate they take the nuts directly off the plant freeze them take those right on over to where they're going to run it and run it a lot of people take the nugs off of the plant a lot of people run trim a lot of people rerun chemicals what's great about this product is that you're getting a full spectrum hit of this plant so what that means is that if you're smoking Romulan which this is the strain that I'm smoking Romulan which is an indica heavy hybrid I'm getting the terpene profile of that actual plant I'm not getting Terps added in afterwards I'm not getting any different flavors added in I'm actually getting the terpene profile of this actual strain so let's go ahead and [ __ ] hit this and see what's up [Music] but II see what's great about jetty and I've been following jetty for a really long time these guys are from San Diego err the most humble gentleman and they've been around since before regulation and so knowing that they're a company that is still around says a lot these guys take a lot of pride and what they grow and then the product that they create so check them out online if you can but I really do like this product I really really like to know that I'm actually getting the plant that they say on the vape I'm not getting a flavor add it in afterwards I very much [ __ ] enjoy this I'm gonna take another [ __ ] hood Oh like I said I'm not usually a vape man but with this full-spectrum taste you're getting the taste of the actual plant and so you're not getting like a chemical taste or anything like that you're getting the terpene profile from Romulan so I very much [ __ ] enjoy this now what's great about this too is that because it is a babe you can travel around with it bring it to the beach that's usually what I do when I go skate is I bring it with me sits in my pocket and then you get that good body somewhat of a body high off this because of that full-spectrum unrefined live resin this vape is [ __ ] amazing you can blow clouds with it let's blow some clouds as you know I always like a good cloud sesh oh and this one it definitely does not deny you that whew so I 100% recommend this [ __ ] check them out jetty extracts calm this is their unrefined live resin I got the Romulan but I definitely do know that they have different strains out there one other positive thing that I love to point out about this company huge positive thing and you guys I think will like this too on their packaging on the very back it has everything laid out for you that you need to know let me just read a little bit of the back so you guys know what's on there so it's got the unrefined live resin Romulan indica dominant hybrid so let you know exactly what strain you're smoking what you know what exactly it's going to offer being an indica dominant hybrid so on the back it says it's 100% uncut extract that's not distilled that means a high concentrate of THC a unlike refined live resins that convert THC a to THC the result a true full-spectrum live resin with the real plant flavor and feel that's pretty [ __ ] awesome I like that they spell it out for you exactly what's happening that but here here's another thing that I love that they put on the back of the box I mean there's just these little things really get me to that point of being like this is a product that I want to revisit it actually tells you when it was boxed when it's best buy and the batch that it was in and the license number of what it was made then it also has the ingredients right there below ingredients cannabis oil terpenes you have to understand we were getting that full terpene profile from Romulan so if you guys have time check out Judy extracts unrefined live resin there are packs air pods out there and I also know they have a concentrate that's out there too that you can dab so definitely look out for that I'm gonna keep smoking this [ __ ] probably go out skate a little bit but definitely guys check out Judy extracts if you can I believe it's jetty extracts calm

specific in the whole spectrum or whatever and it's just you know straight oh it's real tastes real good again that was the blue dream 500 milligram full-spectrum concentrate on the vaporizer also

reason it's like kinda hard to find Izzie I mean you could find it out here because like we're so close to California and is easy California brand it's like really hard like it took me a minute and actually this dizzy that I got I didn't get it in Arizona I couldn't find it in here I took a trip to Las Vegas I got off my home he's like shop there and actually made a video while I was there I have like a walkthrough video of it if you haven't seen that she go check it out it's like the cultivate a walkthrough video but yeah like I said I'm gonna be doing a video soon comparing this dizzy cottage to the facts so I'm just gonna give my pros and cons which one I think is better what I like about each one what I don't like about each one so if want to see that video stay tuned but right now these facts era batteries like just this alone right here this is going for [ __ ] home $30 so there's a whole pricey out here right now so I hope they live up to the expectation I don't really know much about it I just like heard a lot of hype behind it I'll get more into like more in-depth in the past and later and they had their own look like so the difference between them and it's dizzy I don't want to get too in-depth in this video because I'm gonna make a separate video on this like I said but uh Stacy they make their own brand of pods like you know what I mean like you can gets dizzy pods but they're like oh they work with like local producers and growers and stuff I mean like they're not making the pods himself they have people that are like helping them [ __ ] um bacteria they actually um they licensed out there like different processors and um just like you know I mean there's different processors and distributors and all that [ __ ] so um you can get like whatever the [ __ ] they have in your state you know I mean so my state they have almond drip so I guess they uh Bailey at the brand rib [ __ ] make some back theropods and the brand drip is [ __ ] fire I pick up the concentrates all the time like they're actual like shadow it's [ __ ] fire I've never tried their [ __ ] a wax pen I've always wanted to but I guess so much either uh back there but first and uh one thing about the mention is this is 89 or you guys probably seen it it's gelato because the strain gelato that it's tested at well 89 some eighty nine point seven percent THC pretty much 90% and 0% CBD so super potent will hop into this later let's open the battery first if you guys didn't see my us dizzy review we'll go check it out because I really [ __ ] with these like I really hope I can find these pods more in Arizona they're a little pricey like 45 bucks for the half gram at least that's what they were trying out there but they're far [ __ ] a school and it looks sick I don't still but we're doing facts here in this video so it stopping this yes I get the facts there first thing first box is pretty dope like I don't know I just like a little bit designed they want for you and I mean like the the blue smoke yeah you know I mean like it's kind of like a gradient smoke that's kind of dope I don't know and then it says facts and premium vaporizer extra the Bacchus has a powerful yet discreet that sounds pretty dope no math simple click leak resistant bats pod easily beat easily beat leaky not that means I chat generic cartridges complete control fine-tuned temperature vapor and session oh so they have a mobile app that's pretty cool I guess you can connect it to your phone I don't know what you can really do maybe I'll try that and see what happens alright so I guess they use in like top-shelf we curate the best blend for you so they I get security lock your pen you can lock your pens that's pretty dope so like you want like we do pan out your how I said I mean and that you don't want someone walking in your room in your pan you can just put it on locks an organ hit it any stands like a password that's what I'm getting out of it so included in this box is a factor device and a micro USB charger oh it also has a one year warranty I think this is he goes to yeah it has an app so that still so here's the back if you guys want to be I'm not gonna hold it too long so pause it three two one alright so let's open it up take a little slide out then you slide it out let's take a little look a little smoke bags I'm not too sick Oh blip stop why do I have it I'll have it the right way I flips up and then it says welcome to the back slide insert extract pod pulses one connected enjoy era so that's pretty sick playing it's focusing hopefully did let me see the bottle right there oh all right so there's more sugar than I expected I so and it's just like a black jewel yeah I mean I don't know if they have different colors this is the one that gave me and it has this little thing right here a little cardboard core this is insert the cart there and then you open this up I guess it's the stick you know how like the iPhone boxes have that thing you pick up that's what I reminds me of I don't know why and then you got the charger there and all the stickers instructions nobody reads that [ __ ] alright so hopefully this thing is charged maybe I should read the instructions a little bit so I want to make sure I get this [ __ ] good alright so I'm not gonna connect the app in this video when I do that umm dizzy versus um facts video I'll have the app connected by then and I'll do the comparison then is it's gonna take me a little bit to connect it up and all that you know what I mean if you guys stay tuned you'll see what happened in this if you guys I mean it looks pretty simple we'll just insert the arrow and a device the light will pose meaning device is ready for use draw from the mouthpiece booth table when finished alright it's simple enough just like that figure imaging the series instruct so I don't know the packaging is pretty dope I think it's pretty cool since already guys told you I think it's really cool how they um like a license out to other like processors in this like other people that like make oil you don't mean so you can get like different quality oreal like crisps like gums I'm sure likes dizzy is like using like what I don't know what you want to call it like um one recipe I don't I don't know what they call it like when they make carts this [ __ ] one like recipe or whatever you're not I mean like they're just doing one I don't know I don't know I don't want to like hypothetically I don't know hypothetically I'm saying this I don't really know what they're doing on award for them but they might just be doing like one thing where as facts is like letting all these different companies do whatever the [ __ ] they want as long as they know they're good you know there has to be some top-shelf [ __ ] so that's dope you can get some like down fire or you could get some fire under me cuz they're not gonna this just I don't what I don't think they would distribute or license to people oh yeah let's hop into this um yeah so this is um I think I told you I got gelato it's almost ninety percent THC 0% CVD that's all you guys see it real quick real quick yeah I mean the package and it's pretty sick I'm welcome about it I middle down below in the comments with you guys think of the packaging and I like that like ohm 3m or what I even call it that little shiny font that use that [ __ ] is pretty cool on the back of it they covered it with the sticker which kinda sucks woman it just says the Arizona Department of Health warning there's nothing where we're gonna hate that and that just says compatible with only our backs their devices does it stink you go honey I mean that's how I'm just kinda quiet you know a seal I don't know I mean anybody [Music] I'm so getting this open though I said I already said it multiple times a lot or 90% let's open it up what's going on is just like shuffle how do you open these so after a long struggle finally got it open um off the bat I mean I'm gonna say this pod looks I don't want to say too much I'm saving it for that video so yeah here's the part that gelato 90% and like I said all pods I'm oh I guess I could say what this pod looks like Wow cuz like I said all pod so you're different because it's made from different that company you know what I mean we're still Ike more controlled like quality control like everything what I'm saying so I don't know but so gelato just like 90 percent I'll give you guys like a little look at it it's kind of heart disease I had that white [ __ ] walk in it this one is like a little brown not brown okay darker than the other ones you wanna mean I've ever seen I mean like the clarity of it like color of it it could be a bunch it I mean you could have some bump or that could be the color of it but like you could have some like darker or like this and it could still be stupid fire it all really depends on the strain and just like a bunch of other things you know they mean so so I don't think there's a button on it believe me just hit it I always sure to read the instructions so I've been so much hype around this I believe so that there's a and I guess besides for that if guys are smoking along I hope you're smoking some good [ __ ] and skated Cheers I don't I was tripping I didn't really think I was getting a hit at first I was really smooth hated fired gelato that tastes as good as [ __ ] like I said it was smooth and hit good as [ __ ] but let's go on for another hit Cheers and I like this this reminds me of like a straight-up jewel like and especially I further show you guys what this looks like on the pen like that [ __ ] is discreet as [ __ ] I mean if you want no one to know what the [ __ ] you're doing this [ __ ] literally looks like you didn't like it I don't even know it looks like a USB stick you know I'm saying but you just getting high off your USB stick yeah I'm saying and stays late why do you hate it a little bit that's kind of cool what yes put your logo now this is a Firewise flavor eyestrain whatever you want to call it because they mix the terpenes in it but um I wrote I don't think there was a preheat side and then you just hit it like I'm doing I don't know if you guys heard that [ __ ] I don't know what the [ __ ] that was um I don't know this [ __ ] is fire is [ __ ] um overall reading the battery I'm gonna give it a four point five out of five it depends that that's my personal preference I mean it really depends on how you're looking at it because if you're looking at a business like you don't feel like a businessman you know I mean if you smoke weed and like want to go to your office and you get on it you don't want to bring up a wax pen that's like super noticeable there you have wax in the pen I mean bring this nobody's are gonna [ __ ] know so it kind of depends on how you look at it this is like perfect for somebody like that really like somebody that doesn't want their family they smoke or some [ __ ] like that but in the pot you definitely get lettuce [ __ ] off it it smokes good flavor hi everything about it I know it is my [ __ ] dog guys really bad anxiety in this fireworks going off so I gotta go comfort her so much but now this pot is fires [ __ ] I'm gonna give you like a room just like a four I have really weird score like a four point nine out of five like I mean like super close to a five just the battery um it's not my personal like I've had better in the past but it's might be somebody out there is favorite you know I'm saying but me / I mean I don't know it's like it's really cool though maybe I might change my mind oh no like I said that video will be out soon come I like you guys knowing that when that video comes out which one I like better and which I like my final thoughts and this is so when that video comes out make sure you check that video out but the pod it's a five out of five the pod if you can't tell I'm gonna smoke before I made this video and right before I made this video I made this dizzy cart review so I smoked when I made that video so I'm not been pretty late and plus I've been smoking all day which is everyday all day every year I'm pretty late that was the point you guys couldn't tell but uh now this is some fire pretty close so far I might change my mind like I said but if you guys like this video and you have any other video ideas suggestions recommendations constructive criticism anything you want to tell me at all you in the comments I read every single comment I love all the support from you guys I really do I appreciated and I don't know I guess besides for that you guys like this video big that himself comment like subscribe to all the good [ __ ] strong baby so", "2nRVWTUPKoA": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in live respect my region.com here with another west coast we tour review jazzy's back again as a special guest because we are reviewing a pax pod uh she's a big fan of pax so how to bring her back she loved the other two reviews we got a third one here coming we got one of her favorite brands the pax era bloom farms collaboration sour diesel you guys you all ready y'all ready here why don't you show them to show them the pod thing show them show them the packages right there right there a little bit oh there we go super cool it's got a craft look on the box uh this light brown tan colored thing um i'm a fan of blue farms on their brand they donate back to i'm not sure if it's the homeless community or homelessness or kids or uh i think it's one for one i think that's what it says so they're donating meals yeah that's dope i know that they do some kind of campaign energy yep this packaging is the wind energy uh created packaging what are we looking at for thc thc 87 okay should be pretty potent cbd less than 2.0 milligrams um this was packaged june 29th of this year okay so earlier this summer not too shabby we definitely still want fresh oil but oil has a little bit longer of a shelf life than flour flour degrades really fast so um sour diesel it says sativa create half gram single origin strain all natural cannabis oil so um it just says premium cannabis vapor oil i'm not sure if this is it does say full spectrum all natural oh and then on the back it says at bloom farms our mission is to help millions of people find relief relaxation creativity and fun all of our cannabis is california grown by responsible farmers who like us care about the community the environment the plant and you you our products are meticulously lab tested and exceed state standards exceed estate standards yeah there we go full spectrum all natural ingredients 100 cannabis oil so they are saying that there are no mechanical terpenes in his this is sour diesel single origin strain all natural from the cannabis santa barbara super dope made by bloom farms open california check that out you just pull the tab oh another top the tab little pull weak you pull it out you guys can see the oil color right there not too crazy on that one i did i did expect it to be lighter a little lighter than that that looks like it might be some live resin almost huh right i don't know yeah yeah all right well we're going to use the pax era pro pax's newest device their smart vaporizer you plug it in turns on it's on the lowest heat setting so we shake it three times to check on the battery life we've got 75 battery ladies first on the hit we'll talk about it one time kind of describe the flavor and the taste and all that hit it twice score out of 10. do you think um that one was like burnt popcorn first one let me try it on the lowest temp it's on the lowest 10. it tasted awful i didn't get burnt popcorn i got citrusy slightly gassy not like gassy as in like pungent super nosy gassy like the diesel gassiness and so i actually got sour diesel maybe it was just that and it very it very much could have been i definitely have seen that happen um not necessarily with bloom farms products before but on vape products before mine definitely tasted like some sour diesel um energetic kind of euphoric and the in the high already i can feel it and go kind of flow throughout the body okay now it tastes different and it can be like this is why we do two hits it's very important um to get a balanced like perspective of the terpene profile i love the flavors um i'm gonna wait to head it again yeah it's in you know third hit sometimes you need it we're doing five second rips yeah again i tasted a little bit of super lightly citrus a little bit of that earthiness and again a little bit of that kind of sour sour chemical gassiness that the diesel is kind of known for um we'll give you a third one when it comes to me i'm getting a score out of 10. uh i'll wait for you to get to to kind of hit it before i give you a bias a bias number um sativa create on the box i can kind of feel that energy making my heart race slightly um date of manufacturing june 5th data packaging june 29th 87 thc it is pretty potent um bloom farms talented on this i think for me this is probably closer to an 8.25 um the reason is i'm not sure if it's live resident i'm not sure if it's distillated just says full spectrum and all natural on the back and then 100 cannabis oil so those questions beat me wondering um i want to see the terpene profile we saw on that willamette valley review that terpene profile listed with the three main terps and just this particular one which is i usually smoke sour diesel but this one's not doing it for me the taste you're not liking the taste no so i would give an eight i'm gonna gonna give it an eight well i mean even still like you know some flavors aren't for everyone in the world of cannabis i think an eight's still a solid score the thc is pretty high do you feel high do you feel kind of like pitter patter do you feel any any like raciness [Music] just relax interesting interesting um well 8.25 for me eight from jazzy yeah appreciate you guys for all the love man bloom farms make sure you guys go check them out go visit the pharmacy in santa barbara definitely go support bloom farms make sure you guys buy some products from them and they will give back some meals so one for one program appreciate you guys like follow subscribe respect my region jazzasaurus instagram youtube you name it more reviews coming this is the west coast we tour man i'll see you all down the road peace", "ddnbfyhlods": "[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "AECuhNQ-6-s": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good day to be like yo what's up guys back in for another video um nobody needs your boys having a better day today guys thanks for your comments in my last video posted a video yesterday and you know I was telling you guys I was feeling down but today I'm feeling kind of good so your boy decided to pick up a new pax pod because one of my subscribers in the comments said he wanted to see that you're part see his comment on the screen but he said he wanted to see me try different packs pods so I decided to buy a new one today because I had nothing to smoke like nothing to smoke with so your boy guys it's called loud packets by loud pack but you know that's the good thing about packs there's so many different companies you can get different pots from different companies so you can try something new so this is loud pack it's a hybrid it's mimosa the strain name is mimosa and then it says on it that is supposed to be citrus sweet and tropical and I'm not gonna lie guys I open it up before I did not try it but I opened it up just to smell it so from now on because usually wet so you don't smell the wax through the pot too much but this one I could smell it so like it smells so good and it smells so good I wanted to try but I was like I gotta make sure it's full for you guys so you guys can see it's full so I'm saving you guys for you so man it's always the test the tests for the carts so basically the test for the carts there's always going to be smell test taste test and how does the - feel I'm sober right now I haven't smoked all day voice you just have a smoke to the song grip I don't have any tree guys got the loud pack let's open it up guys let's open it up and let's see if it holds true alright guys this is what the wax looks like guys as you can see loud pack mimosa this wax is a little bit darker than your normal raw Gardens a little bit darker but it's like an emerald cover color kind of like you know some Jurassic Park it's kind of like a amber color so that's what it looks like guys I had to get it closed up because my friend Amy told me man I get some close-ups so I'm trying to get some close-ups but it's kind of hard to focus that's the part but let's take the first freaking rip guys first have used my battery all week cuz I haven't had a pot I ran out of uh ran out of the raw garden so let's take the first hit Oh [Music] okay let's do the taste one first guys so off the bag [Music] damn okay so off the back it has an orangish orange citrusy taste like it actually tastes like orange is almost like on the exhale and inhale it tastes so good I don't know what they do it the terpenes they use because it says it's cannabis oil and terpenes so they have to use some kind of terpenes to get that flavor but it definitely has that citrusy flavor before you got it man like taste wise this is so like one of the best tasting waxes I've ever tasted I'm not even captain this is probably one of the best tasting wax I have ever tasted besides raw garden like this might have more flavor than your your raw garden I'm being honest you guys try this [ __ ] out like loud pack mimosa make sure you guys try this out tell me what you guys think compared to raw garden but to me the taste it could [ __ ] match raw garden man like it probably beats raw garden sweet so let me do the smell check one more time [Music] yeah when you smell it it has like a a fruit smell like it smells fruity you get a fruity I smell to it guys like I honestly recommend this strain already it's already passed into my test man taste and smell all right but we got to see how the high is though [Music] but um I just been chillin today guys just I went to Livermore and I was just chillin and walking around town just seeing what's up I honestly wanted to do the video out there but I forgot my camera and also my camera's been tweaking out because of the micro SD adapter but it's just been the show last day I just wish it wasn't [ __ ] 90 in the 90s but I've been outside all day because of work so I'm kind of used to it now [Music] I'm trying to smoke a lot so you so I can see how the high feels right now but you know guys just another good day I'm thinking about I wrote a little like song I'm not honestly finished with it but I decided that I might start posting on one of my other instagrams I have two instagrams I might start posting like little snippets of me like you know not freestyle but giving y'all snippets of stuff that I've been writing that I write on the daily so I might give you guys that Instagram I don't know I haven't decided completely yet man shit's good oh yeah and this is 78% THC I don't know if you can see it but it's only 78 not too bad good percentage I mean honestly percentages of THC in your we turn your your wax doesn't necessarily mean it's potent that's like a myth so I actually been doing a lot of research on that and honestly you shouldn't buy it just because of the THC percentage because a lot of meds and even lower have had better potency you feel me because like a lot of the times they just make the flower just look good more and have a high THC percentage but what else what other cannabinoids are in and you know to make it actually potent that you're getting because you're getting a mixture of all the high when you're smoking you feel me unless you're just smoking straight digital card which i think is mainly just THC or something but THC content necessarily for flower doesn't mean anything so I don't really go off of the TAC percentage because I can go like guys I'm feeling a little it Dockett I already feel it you know that first high you get guys you feel me but it's more of like a I got more of a head high because it's a hybrid I'll have much of a body I could fill it in my head I would say it's a good [ __ ] yeah I mean but I think all highs are [ __ ] good except for sometimes at edible eyes because edible highs can buy [ __ ] crazy guys make me [ __ ] crazy [Music] so honestly this freaking company has passed my test guys smell test taste test and high test weight this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire so I'm gonna be buying a lot more packs pods not because this is hella good but mainly because someone took my battery or I lost it I don't know but I lost a battery with a raw garden cart on it so I think someone stole it I'm just gonna say it was lost take it loss just take the loss as it is and I'm gonna probably be buying a lot more packs because I don't have a normal 510 thread or actually I do have a normal 510 thread never mind I'll still be making getting 510 threads but I definitely will be doing more these hacks shout out to that subscriber like I said you probably already saw who it was but shout out to you for making me freakin buy more man these are [ __ ] fire bro I wonder if you tried these if you guys have tried these packs pause let me know in the comments but um we're gonna end this short because it's [ __ ] hot I'm tired I've been out all day but let's kind of take a shot you know anything got to relax cuz your boy got to go back to work at 4 a.m. y'all know how it is the word grind [Music] but I hope everyone has a good weekend I'm off this weekend guys so maybe you'll see more vlogs I'm gonna try and do a vlog every day of the weekend so we have something out there for you guys and just stay lifted don't stress guys don't stress smoke weed and don't stress this is a rip for you guys and I hope you all have a [ __ ] good night [Music] you", "DrttwWvLgSI": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana review show it's time for a [ __ ] smackdown oh [ __ ] it's time for a [ __ ] smackdown on own that kami PTSD uh hello everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are doing as I you know hurt myself there earlier a head-to-head one man enters one woman leaves the throwdown of the century plug and play vast easy by just mean fee of course that's right and I'm already a little high because I was just testing earlier to make sure both of these worked before I started this video and took a nice drag from each of these and I'm already quite high would you tell you something about how good both of these products are so that's right guys we're taking a look at these two bad boys fresh one gram carts in each of them but first well just take a look at the little batteries themselves we put them right next to each other steezy feels a little inadequate and next to plug-and-play but it's not the size of the wave it's the motion of the ocean which I don't think actually applies here um steezy yes the battery is a way smaller than the plug-in plate not necessarily that much lighter but a little bit lighter for sure but it is you know a little bit more than half its size so if you're trying to keep something as you know as discreet as possible with pocket ability if portability is high on your criteria list knew that the plug and play is about the same size as a standard like 510 battery so it's big it's big but there's a reason for that guys and that's because the plug and play has a battery it's almost twice the size of the cz I believe this TZ is 210 and a H and the plug and play is 500 milliamps which is you know twice as big doesn't necessarily mean that the plug in play will last twice as long in real world application but could that battery extra power could be used for bigger hits so whatever the case may be this has much more juice in it than the steezy and just anecdotally from different sources the play lasts about 350 puffs whatever that sort of averages out to be and the steezy comes in lower at maybe you know 250 ish somewhere in there those are rough numbers that I've sort of averaged together um so you know take those both things into account in terms of price both these batteries are about the same either gonna pay you know twenty to twenty-five dollars for each of these they're they're pretty much identical in price the cartridges however do diverge in price first and foremost plug and play only comes in one gram carts at least right now whereas steezy has both half gram and full gram carts um so if you're looking for something smaller steezy offers that option the plug and play are also a little bit more expensive than the steezy just generally speaking I would say I see the steezy average $60.00 for a gram up pre-tax whereas I can see the plug in play averaging like 7075 for pre-tax costs so a substantial difference in cost for the two but that is also due to the fact that plug and play are the most potent pods cartridges that I know of just a two at random here as Steve gelato and a plug-and-play what was this I can't even remember which one this Oh fire oh gee I'm sorry the steezy if I can get this camera focus the cz has 803 milligrams of THC to the Wow I was very bad at that to the plug in place 914 milligrams of THC in the one gram cart meaning it's what eighty eighty one percent versus ninety one percent so the plug and play is ten percent stronger and that's just you know one strain but on the whole the the plug and play are more potent than the steezy so that covers sort of the basics oh one other thing I want to mention is the availability steezy seems to be pretty much everywhere whereas plug and play is way more select sort of more focused on the Southern California especially LA area you know they seem to be growing people love them but yes for in terms of availability you're gonna find steezy more easily ooh that sounded good let's take a quick look at the oil I mean these are you know strain dependent but they're both very very high quality oil and then the the cartridges or the pods themselves have the single sort of C cell going up through them a very efficient method but if we look at the bottom the sort of connectors there steezy has to wear the plug-and-play has one much larger and with that we will now you know we'll try them out here but guys we're gonna do the we're gonna do this wheat style so what that means is I'm gonna go through all of both of these cartridges over the next you know week and a half two weeks I'm gonna plug and play one day I'm gonna steezy the next plug and play the next day this steezy the day after that until they are both finished and then we'll you know I'll give you all the data the thoughts all that good stuff I'll talk about that in just a moment but for now let's just give them a little test here first oh let's start with the steezy the cz has no button you just inhale a nice nice hit right there pretty enjoyable quite potent and very easy on the lungs so that you know great steezy effortless intake and then that gelato flavor um not my favorite strain in the world uh the the steezy seems to be a little bit more earthy than the fruitier gelato that i like but it's great still in terms of you know mazaev very subtle taste it's not gonna be overpowering and it's you know natural terpenes nothing artificial in there no no problems on that front just not my favorite you know strain taste but again very easy to draw let's do another just three second draw and and given another test oh wow quite high already see it in my eyes that is wonderful steezy you're doing great man keep it up plug and play I gotta say you have your work cut out for you but we'll test you and your big badass itself so here we go again this one does have the button instead of this easy natural draw we'll do a three second draw here oops missed the button holy good dear Christ wow that is amazing um you press that button and you are getting a blast man as you can see just in the difference those three seconds how much more vapor came out from the plug and play than this cz I mean I assume that means you know of course that you're getting bigger pits and you the oil is gonna deplete faster but my god that is great and it is so potent I am more than high enough right now to be entirely honest with you higher than I've really ever been with karts or you know normally can get with carts without trying very hard just sort of effortlessly here this thing kicks like a mule but tastes great dude I actually enjoy that taste a little bit better than the cz it's very subtle as well a little bit earthy as well but more cinnamony more more of a spice quite good a fire OG never I've had the stream before didn't remind me of this let's go ahead and give it another one here just to make sure that first one wasn't a fluke Oh No Wow that tastes it tastes like Christmas tastes like Christmas Happy Holidays and boy this feels all warm and you know lovey-dovey like Christmas does this this is this is Christmas morning on us for a seven-year-old when they know they're getting their switch light for the Christmas this year this is fantastic steezy wonderful to steezy incredible but plug-and-play [ __ ] hail to the king um now this is early this is early game the early days you know I did two hits here on both of these and then one hit earlier to test them but I'm gonna go through these whole things one gram each and you know as I said alternate every day and then we're gonna see how long one lasts how much higher I am on one what the value proposition is you know how much more the plug and play suck to carry around anesthesia or the cz was so much easier to lose in the plug and play who knows we're gonna get into all the data we're gonna talk about the battery how much see if the plug and play lasts you know substantially longer than this TZ I'll be taking notes we'll make it somewhat scientific I got to say I'm real excited about this one guys these are two things that I love wholeheartedly and I hope to come back to you in a week and a half with good results but on initial impression the plug and play wins it [ __ ] Wow see you guys that's right guys ten days have passed in the great steezy v plug-and-play experience and I have two empty cartridges pods I guess rather to show you guys there is a totally empty plug-and-play and a totally empty steezy and boy oh boy do I have feelings let's not hedge let's not beat around the bush let's just get this right out the way plug and play is the winner no doubt about it hands down by every metric plug and play is the winner I did not expect it to be this much of a blowout but it is let me back up real quick and say that that is not to disparage steezy I still love steezy I would still you know gladly purchased easy and be happy with it and as long as I knew that plug and play wasn't an alternative steezy still a great product but by every metric plug and play knocks it out of the park the battery so I never had to charge this for this whole gram cartridge never had to charge this once though the first charge was enough to get through the whole gram whereas this easy I had to do two full charges to get through the grand cartridge so I charged it up at least twice during the process whereas what the plug and play did not need to in terms of the hits I have never ever ever experienced anything like plug and play it's it is on a different playing field of any other really really pretty much any weed that I know of um this this is the closest to edibles that any kind of vapor or combustible has ever got me um I loved loved loved this both of them took about me about five days to get through so almost exactly even in that regard um however I definitely took less drags of the plug-and-play for two reasons one I didn't need to because it was incredibly potent stuff it will get you very very high even somebody with a tolerance as high as mine and the the other reason being you get much bigger hits from the plug and play then you do this easy the plug and play produces produces much much bigger hits for the same amount of draw then then this cz um you do pay a bit of a premium for the plug and play if you remember the first part I think it was $10 more than the cz for the gram cartridge I do not mind that is a fair upgrade to make both in terms of the higher potency oil that was in this one and just the better experience I like the bigger hits I like the not having to charge it more yeah it I was expecting it to be close but it it wasn't um you guys were totally right plug and play is is a gift from God steezy is still great if this is all you can get you're not gonna feel bad but but this is the new king so plug and play love you cz still love you but not as much well guys that is gonna do it then for this head-to-head stevie plug and play again plug and play mops the floor with steezy a very very good product it's just that this is that great what a fun experiment I would wish to do that every day for the rest of my life who doesn't love just getting to get really high for 10 days to review some [ __ ] well that was a blast plug and play is gonna be my new go-to daily driver and that guys is gonna do for this review here on wheats or not review but you know head-to-head mashup maybe we'll do some more of these in the future I know pax era ponds are out there as well also the nude art systems but I'm getting ahead of myself alright guys that's gonna do it thank you so much for watching wheats and I'll see you right back here for the next review bye bye", "PXP64j29ueM": "what's going on baby family it's your boy fated Markie and today I'm gonna be comparing two things you guys I got a pod actually this is a cartridge I got a cartridge and I got a pod so you know right now I'm in the car I got I'm probably gonna end up driving so I'm not gonna do the review right now I'm gonna take you guys with me I'm gonna go over to my parents house today's the Super Bowl you guys is the Chiefs versus the 49ers but since it's like I'm not too big of a fan of football to be honest and I'm not too big either team I'm gonna be doing a review for you guys and I'm gonna just do a wholeheartedly like light you guys know well I personally think about pods and when I personally think about cartridges I think they're similar but they're different you know I'm saying so I'll check in with you guys soon all right shot so we just did a car swap and I'm driving my grandparents so you know all the same that's why didn't smoke but when I get there I'm doing the review it's gonna be dope as so stay tuned go 49ers just can't go what are you having the Super Bowl who do you thinks gonna win yeah who do you thinks gonna win I'm Francisco all the 49ers yeah alright that's a good call good call [Music] that's cool all right camera woman where are we going what kind of background do you guys want yeah I want to see the house are you guys gonna see this isn't bad this channel is strictly for viewers ages 18 plus I do not use or promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws Prop 64 alright Josh so this seems like a pretty good spot we're gonna my mom's backyard right now and it's cold as right now alright so let's get to it let's start with the cartridge so right here guys we got a cartridge nothing special right if you guys are watching this channel you guys should already be familiar with kind of like what cartridges it's a cannabis vape that uses oil and yeah it's pretty simple I wanna say when they cannabis base we first became a thing this is pretty much what everybody had or what everybody was going for it when they were trying to create their own product they were all creating cartridges so you were seeing like thousands of new cartridge brands hit the market and they're all kind of doing the same thing by throwing the oil in a tank which has an atomizer that allows you to burn the oil pretty simple and back in the day everybody's the thing these were bait partridges so this used to be low-key I would say nowadays this is far from it when people see a little cartridge or anything like this they automatically assume or think you're smoking some type of wheat or some type of cannabis so I would say that's the negative which used to be a pro for this but now that this is a negative I would say you're probably gonna see less people smoking this out in public or just you know more plainly like just taking random hits out in the open they're probably gonna start covering this up a little bit more originally cops didn't even really know what this was I feel like every cop every security guard if you go to a club if you go anywhere they automatically know where this is they're gonna either try to take it away from you you can't take this into Disneyland anymore so these are a lot of negativity to having cartridges I would say over pods nowadays just because everybody knows what it is but if you don't go  and the place that you're at really doesn't give a then is the same thing as smoking apart [Applause] alright y'all and this right here this is a plug play and what these are these are cannabis pods and pretty much it's the same thing the same exact oil that goes inside a cartridge you guys is the same world that goes inside of a pod it pretty much just takes a different shape so he now made it so that the cartridge doesn't look like an oil cartridge anymore or a standard small vape they made it look like more of a jewel so now I pods the only difference between the two our pods look like jewels and they're more low-key they have a custom device where they're not Universal and they don't all use the 510 connection where this this cartridge could go almost go on any date device that has the standard 510 threading and so it's very Universal where it pods this isn't gonna go and sit inside of a jewel it's not gonna fit inside of a steezy they all have their own unique device and that's okay oh yeah I would say they both have if they both have good oil they're both gonna have the same potency if they both have really good a good cartridge and they're both a good pot they're gonna have the same type of hit except nowadays when you take this places you can probably take this into the club you would take it almost into Disneyland museum parts because it looks more like a jewel it's more in the norm and it's more like people don't assume when you're hitting this that you're getting high off cannabis they think you're hitting that jewel and so it were trying to be more incognito and more low-profile more low-key I would say the way to go is pods nowadays for me personally since I have family members you know especially younger ones I'd really been thinking I'm hitting that jewel rather than me ingesting cannabis or hitting my cannabis vape all day long but if you guys enjoyed this video and you guys enjoyed hearing about the differences and kind of like my personal preferences between the two please drop a like drop a comment down below subscribe to your boy and I'll see you guys soon", "_H1k6bcUJPA": "i'm done i'm done all right yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another banger by your boy savvy g guys man i'm gonna try to knock this video out very very quick because my mic is gonna die and also i got the landscapers outside that are trying to mow the lawn so it's just so much things going on that are just gonna make this video trash but we're gonna try to make this work all right boys so without further ado man let's get straight into this so today guys we got the uncirculated kush half gram pax pod by raw garden and they're brand new ones that they just dropped which is indica and we got the pax itself the brand new battery so far let's let's just talk about the raw garden so far okay so they switch they didn't switch they actually still have the 510 thread cards but they want to switch into the pot industry i don't know so much like raw garden is trying so hard to get into the pod industry they had collaborated with g pen to make something it was completely trash they stopped selling those and now they switched over to pax trying to see if they could possibly make it work i'm gonna go ahead and review that for you guys to see if it's even worth the extra battery you know all those different variables that might not want you might not make you want to buy this all right so so far guys all right let's go ahead and open up this first that way you guys have an inside look of how it looks this one was packaged on 420 820 it is a indica like i was saying and it is sitting at 86.52 percent thc the opening right here boom open you got the california weed sticker right there got the pax pod go ahead and pull this out for you guys so so far when i'm shining this up at the light okay from what i see the oil is actually a whole lot darker a whole lot more yellow than what i'm used to out of the 510 thread cartridges i don't know if that really matters or not maybe it's just the pod but let's go ahead and pull out the brand new battery right here boom boom and then stick this out get the battery out that's all you really need all that all that packaging just for a freaking battery okay so from what i remember from what i've been told is pack you packs used to have an app they used to have an app that you could just go download it and you could switch the temperatures but they took that off of the apple store or the google play store because it was obviously cannabis related you can't have those on there because kids can possibly potentially download and blah blah blah you know so i don't know really how to switch up like the colors on this i'm not 100 sure how to switch up the colors on this but we're just gonna go with the flowmen to get it rocking so go ahead and stick this in there boom got the half gram uncirculated kush by raw guard and let's let's see if it's if it's worth the height man if it's worth extra battery all these things man because the 510 thread cartridges from raw garden you guys know those things are phenomenal all right so going in on the first hit of the uncirculated kush boys let me know in the comments below if you guys have ever tried a raw garden pax pod and if you did let me know what flavor cheers boys what color is this one blue setting how do you switch this bro i need to figure out how to switch this it doesn't matter though so uh for the first hit i you all right i don't know if it's just the pod maybe i have to get it wicked up but off of the first hit you have to dead ass pull like drag it really really hard to even get it to to hit man because i don't know what it is about this device but it just seems like there is not enough airflow in between this so let's go ahead and try to hit it one more time cheers so far i'm not really getting any clouds i'm not really getting any flavor as of that i have to pull really really hard i don't think it's clogged because if it was clogged it wouldn't pull at all but so far man i'm not i'm not really digging this setup so far man i'm gonna go ahead and try to figure out how to switch up the bat i mean the temperature settings on this and see if we can get it at a hotter temp because so far it's not it's not really doing its job alright so we ended up figuring it out guys i think this one is the red setting okay so let's go in on the red setting i'm assuming it might be the middle temperature so cheers guys yeah dude i'm not getting any clouds so far i've noticed what i've noticed okay this is going to be really really really hard for you guys to see hopefully it focuses in but look at that side right there it has like a little hole right a very very very minuscule probably like less than a centimeter hole and um it has two on each side and that's your airflow that is your airflow like i'm not even joking right now that is your airflow so so far me personally man i think this is a trash device so far just because of the whole build quality it seems like the build on this pax device is just trash like why would you only give somebody two small holes for air flow bro why you need the whole thing to be open now we can just circulate all the way through so go ahead and shake this one more time take it out it's going to cycle through or something like that all right oh wait all right hold on hold on man this is too this is too difficult you see and it's too it's too hard to use bro all right that's two that's three let's go ahead and hit on number three i don't know if i don't know these settings are just very very weird this device overall is just very very hard to use in my opinion very very unconvenient is what i'm trying to say man so going on in on hit number three yeah i'm not digging this like i was saying i just am not digging anything about this man this was on the medium high temperature still not getting barely any clouds the flavor i'm not getting any flavor it's like barely anything there it's like if i took a little little little piece of nibble of a chocolate bar you know how you get those little very small taste of it it's not like oh coating your mouth and stuff like that it's exactly what this is it's garbage it doesn't get me high it doesn't give me like i'm vaping anything it's just i dead ass feel like i wasted my money okay so let's go ahead and try to hit this on the hottest setting man see if it could do anything and then boom wait for it to plug in all right so this is the highest one you got you see all four of them started up and you drink some water my mouth is dry so all four highest setting let's go in boys number four cheers yeah that that that is very very unacceptable bro you could see the air bubbles coming out that definitely means that it's getting wicked up but this is horrible this is horrible i've never in my life this is this is almost as bad as the time that i bought the g pen raw garden dude and the g pen didn't even work like at first i got two hits off of it tasted burnt and it stopped working after that this is almost there bro all it has to do is just stop working and it's gonna be up there with the list of the worst pods slash cartridges that i've ever had raw garden if you guys are hearing me out man i don't know what the flip you guys are doing bro what are you guys doing you guys need to start watching my videos again because this is unacceptable you guys are definitely from what i see man raw garden they they really hyped up their brand they hyped up everything a lot of people hopped on the train when it first came out was like two three years ago it was really really good that they got to a point where they were leading industry like you know company and now in 2020 bro where what is august they're decaying and slowly turning into trash in my opinion bro all of their all of their cartridges taste the same they all there's nothing new about them they try coming out with stuff like new pods to you know bring bring something good to the community but they can't even do that they need to do more r d testing because at the end of the day men you know this is this is money that we spend you know us as patients out there we go out and look for this stuff because we're so used to getting good quality you know products and then boom we we get this thing we're gonna get something good and it's trash you know money wasted so let's go in on hit number five six man it's still not wicked up it's hard to pull no flavor no high i don't know cheers yeah look i'm getting dead as the same clouds i got on the medium-high temp the medium temp all right i'm i'm done i'm done this to me guys i don't know how people could even have recommended me this bro i don't even know why people told me to go out and buy this like this is what you guys are cheaping on like bro i would rather go out and buy their half gram cartridge than to go out and buy this like never again bro never again i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure it has to do with the pax device itself because it's trash i was reading reddit post on it people say it's trash it doesn't it doesn't work for crap yeah raw garden is just going out there throwing their money away try well not really throwing out their money because their main purpose is to try to get customers in with this new pax device but when you're doing stuff like this man you're losing customers like me personally i don't know after this i might not even f with raw garden anymore to be honest like they just done too much i feel like they got their money and they got their and they're out you know they're done they're done they're lowering their quality and and their concentrates and stuff like that it's very very disappointing so um with that being said man i'm going on another hit let's see if we could freaking you know get a decent head maybe we have to switch the pot around i don't freaking know bro but cheers guys no clouds all right my freaking my microphone actually just died so we're just going to go ahead and have to end this here i have nothing else to say other than you know raw guardian i don't know what you guys were thinking when you made this switch to the packs but it's not helping us at all i'm never buying this again i do not recommend this to anybody it's trash so that being said guys if you enjoyed today's video even though we didn't really get to chief on

another review and this time you get already know what it is it's time for that heavy hitter cherry lime kind of ripped it out of the thing but yeah sure lime guys haha all right so this is buddy and eighty-seven percent total cannabinoids so 410 Sabo I think can't do the math right now item yeah so here they're so foreign and ten milligrams of THC and point fifteen milligrams of CBD guys so what's out further ado tops pinky open cherry lime is only exclusive on ease guys um that's what I said on the little description I thought it was pretty cool you know so I dunno cold I was easy oh a specific strain but yeah guys cherry lime it's a hybrid guys yeah excuse me so here's my part have the sauce pod I'm happy snakes really go kind of really good pop guys check that [ __ ] up but pop this baby open right here so my temperature still has 620 but I bumped it up to 650 for this dish to it damn kind of loose a little bit but alright guys so that's a quick review on heavy hitters cherry lying so here's my first Wow Oh damn you could definitely taste that cherry take the line kind of kind of like in the background but how that cherry who and like your smooth too like it's really smooth the vapor on this is pretty good use me guys sorry about the coffee damn it is a hybrid song Co I'm feeling chill right now guys so far you know I'm not couch hire or like anything just chill you know I mean and yeah but I love that taste I love that cherry personally I'm not a big fan of cherries you know the ones they put in your drink mmm not for me but this tastes kind of like more of a candy cherry you know chariot it's not like scoot like you know I'm gonna say natural interpreting but more like more of a natural cherry taste and it it tastes really good you know personally [ __ ] personally um and good job heavy hitters you know it's exclusively on ease not bad not bad oh hey guys and just call it a quick review so overall give this a 5 you know I pay like 47 you know it's really with the 30% off a bit too high but you know it's understandable is heavy hitters you know these guys been around for a while these guys even though there are some face out there but when they're legit just [ __ ] fire you know but yeah overall on the taste I give it a five you know it's a pretty unique taste I love it a candy cherry and a little hint of lime in the back I really love it the policy is there guys probably saw me coughing like a [ __ ] but yeah so man yeah if you have a chance if you have credit on either I say cop this at least once if you got money in Spanish man what you doing cop this [ __ ] but other than that I mean it's totally up to you I'll give it a good five across the board it's really good distillate love it bomb two thumbs up special okay all right guys let's do it quick review on heavy hitters trader life so Peace Love be safe out there guys be positive", "CBcF1mLLEJA": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in live respect my region.com special guest today jazzasaurus we are going to be reviewing the pax era pro and raw gardens mendo clouds refined live resin packs pod have you ever had refined live resin from from raw garden no i'm pretty excited you've heard a lot of good things a lot of good things you've recently heard some crazy things about them let's refine my resin we don't know what it is so we're going to find out what it tastes like today mendo clouds here we go uh smart pax airpod we're going to plug it in here with this bad boy check this out look at that color right there a little bit lighter than the other ones we've seen check this out you guys yeah you guys can kind of see it's a little bit lighter than we've seen in the other live resins um but they do call that refined so let's see what the taste is like all right so you plug in the packs pod it immediately tells you how many charges you have again i shook it to show you but it showed three first hit the lady we will talk about it after the first hit let you guys know what we think we'll do a second hit give you guys a score out of ten so tap in here we go what do you think juicy juicy only one hand oh okay you got a marinade on it you got a marinade on it so again earthy herby spicy piney but like not like weed piney like tree pine like like tree like pine trees pine cones like if you touched it they were sticky like that tiny right yeah kind of fun like again not weed pine tree pie trees so second hit greater than coming soon read the full review respect my region.com we have the pax era raw garden refined my resin mendo clouds indica hybrid 83.77 thc less than two percent cbd manufactured packaging on 6 24 2020 so not much of that information on it no terpene profile [Music] nope it does say 100 fresh frozen whole flour terpenes and cannabis oil so i'm not that awkward combination of words 100 fresh frozen whole flower terpenes and cannabis oil no trim no additives ever clean green certified i do like that that's as close to organic as you can get in cannabis one pod compatible with all air devices the pax era pro is different from the regular device it's sleeker slightly more round and smarter session controls are different and more effective and it's honestly an easier hit so i usually don't like indica strains but i actually like this one it tastes pretty good i mean you do i feel like it's it's lighter it's mellow yeah it's it's not like necessarily like less harsh i i still feel like i'm getting somewhat of a discipline experience but it's also um terpene wise i feel like i'm getting a mendo earthy strain and then i'm getting the pine as well that lightly tree that light tree pot and i feel like it makes the flavor on this particular product pretty good score wise i'm in between an eight and a nine what are you thinking i'm thinking 3.5 8.5 only because of the terpenes there's just not enough information on here and it's good and the color on it to me is a little off but at the same time it is refined so it's like it's like to me is this what is a sugar-free gatorade so it's lighter in color you know what i mean um i don't know i buy lots of different kinds of products i think there's definitely someone that there's obviously lots of people in california who love raw garden and i can see why it tastes like the flower i know they've got a massive strain and genetics library where everything is single source and so and they're the source of that um so shout out to them my final score is going to be also 8.5 um i think that since they're not a hundred percent true like just this live resin like category uh they're refined live resin um i don't feel like they can be compared to the rest i think they're kind of in a category of their own distillate refined eyebrows and my resin they're probably more in that sauce category i think right yeah but you know the color is obviously different than from the other live resin products we've seen so for me 8.5 rod garden does nice work so check them out tap in with their instagram make sure you guys give them a follow uh please drop a comment subscribe like uh do all the things please

christmas folks for those that do celebrate some of you may not but for those that do happy holidays and merry christmas so today i'm bringing you guys a video um it's going to be two things here we got the pax era viola it's a ghost domina 5050 and it's a hybrid testing at 54.1 percent thc oh it's uh like 50 50 like 1 1 ratio kind of with the thca and thc oh no thca i'm tripping i was going to say like the cbd [ __ ] like a 1-1 cbd but there's no cbd in it so but there's thca and everyone says that you want thca and like carts and [ __ ] that's what they look for because i guess i forget what exactly about that but if you know comment down below and let us know i'm saying keep everybody as i was saying before i'm sorry that this [ __ ] cutoff i literally need to i got a phone call and i'm still uploading and editing and making videos off my phone so for christmas i should have asked for a camera but i didn't so that was okay dumb of me a high move anyways if you know you know i'm saying why people prefer thca in their cartridges and pens let us know and they're distillate i guess or whatever i should say but yeah so we're doing a video on that one pod compatible with all era devices and it's a half a gram i got this from where did i get this from i want to get i say that i got this for uh golden meds yes sir yes sir golden match that's when i went and i got the the uh veritas eighth back that they were supposed to reimburse me for so uh we're gonna smoke that because i'm gonna i got my pax pen charging here shout out to the homie jesse he gifted me this because he has one that he got i think like he won or something and he's got his like all custom down shits engraved with like cool stuff and whatnot so big thank you to him for giving me that i'll be able to test out this and then let you guys know what's good with this i'm excited to try this out i've never had really any pax pods or anything before so i got the veritas though as you can see here and we got that from buddy bully brands and we got that from new york locations the chem 4 that i got and was empty so now i'll be able to try that for you guys that is testing that 28. 48 there and yeah looking pretty gas and then i also have some mac some mac from kind love here and that's going to be testing at 21.24 now this one's testing higher than this one so i'm kind of curious because i'm not gonna lie to you guys i also have some wedding cake and this i've been smoking on low key so just because i already made a video where i included that primo came through i'll try to include a little quick clip of that i did like a quick minute video off of that but i'm probably not going to upload that i'll just insert the clip so you guys can see he came and he blessed me my cousin with a nice new rig for christmas so i was looking for a new rig and low-key he kind of helped me with that but i have this bud that i've been smoking on and let me see if we can align this so this is some wedding cake from 14 so see if we can go ahead and line these up you've got seen the other review on the other 14er bud that i've done um what was it the truth and i got to tell you that stuff is amazing i'm trying to line this up here we go okay because you gotta what you gotta do is you gotta line up those two and that's the wedding cake one fat big nice nug left of an eighth that i have so i'm curious which of these two i want to smoke smoke because i'm not gonna lie to you this one i've already opened it's not like pre-packed or anything i'm gonna open it up so you guys can go ahead and check that out and see and look at that that [ __ ] looks crazy son this [ __ ] just looks crystally and crazy as [ __ ] and i got this at golden meds as well so i thought this was a pretty good look at that crazy so i thought it was fire but i'll probably honestly since i've already showed you guys this and opened this and i want to keep the other veritas sealed for the next vid and content i'll probably uh smoke on this one look at that that's insane christ almighty ever gonna smoke this i'm gonna roll this up in a nice blunt i should actually roll a joint so i can taste it and then let y'all know it is good so i'm gonna smoke that what we're gonna do here is we're going to push this to the side and then i want to open this up so i'm open this up and then i'll come back to you guys and let you know okay so i figured it out so too because i was like pulling this up and it's basically leaf locker certified so to open it you push your finger through the circle then you and you hold the inner tab firmly and then you pull that so like what happened was when in here what i did was there's this you push this obviously in and then there's this other tab here inside that you can see kind of let me see you see it that one so you have to push this down and then you pull this up this other one up here and then that comes out and that's that so then you just take that out and boom got a nice little half gram packs pod 5050 blend and i'm going to say that these are probably not approved by the fd hey because these are like packs pod not like they're pods made from like the uh jewel pod type things you know so it's its own concoction thing but that's kind of cool i like these these are dope everyone knows that these are actually really good i'm pretty fire so i'm going to try this out they're all blown up on some mac let y'all know what's good and yeah so again thank you for watching stay tuned subscribe comment like turn on post notifications you know let me know what uh you guys want to see next", "g3YJjYCgXAQ": "today guys I'm pretty pumped up for this video man this has been a long requested video from you guys like and not even this particular video but just like plug and play and still you know those two pods have obviously dominated the market for so long dude and you know what I was like man these two puzzles are pretty good I'm not gonna lie I've had my fair share with both of them I started off with dizzy obviously because I think they were one of the first and after that my cousin's introduced me to plug and play and I was I do this this company is pretty dank you know I liked him from the time that they introduced me to the time after and then Stacey came back up they started releasing more flavors more batteries more you know all that stuff and they just dominated the market and you know that's where everyone's like you know that's why steezy is better than plug and play plug and plays better than steezy and today guys I'm here to settle it all and once and for all I watched it once and for all so if you guys haven't checked out my Instagram first go follow me at backward a.d and i'm posted this last night and the pictures at least for them for these cartridges so right here we got plug and play I mean steezy and then right here we got the plug and play both verified products from a licensed shop let me get it let me get into today oh by the way guys I'm gonna be doing the bakes the big battery comparing it to the regular plug and play battery because this one you know you have to pay an extra ten bucks to get this battery compared to the regular battery this is 20 and then the regular dizzy battery is 20 and then the the big battery which is this one is 30 to 35 dollars and I'm gonna see if it's even worth the extra money you know if they can compare it to the plug and play so BIG's dizzy versus plug and play so we're gonna get into these we're gonna open them on camera quick so the plug and play already opened it because I wanted to try it so yeah those are the lab test results right there verified that just manufactured on for 119 packages on for 10 and then this one was actually packaged on a manufactured on for 12 and packaged on five six so this one's a month newer and then I mean does shouldn't really make too much of a difference this one's a wrong one gram I don't think plug-and-play sells 1/2 grams and then um yeah Strawberry Cough 1/2 gram I just I didn't want to do a full gram because I already tried that one so pulling this one out the box real quick for you guys we're gonna be doing the Girl Scout cookies I know it's I know I shouldn't review an indica versus sativa but you know it's whatever it doesn't really matter in my opinion so right here got the Strawberry Cough and then BOOM damn this one was already falling out so boom dizzy got this dizzy okay let's do the bubble check real quick no movement whatsoever dude this one is a little bit darker than the ones I'm usually used to so hopefully it's a lot more potent though and then yeah like I said the THC on this one is going to be four hundred and four milligrams or eighty percent THC 0.6 tea CBD and then for the plug-in play right here it is gonna be nine hundred fifty seven milligrams and then 3.56 of CBD it has more CBD compared to this dizzy so so we're sitting down right now we've got this dizzy got the plug and play and so I'm gonna take this off toss that over there throw it in the these are both fully charged by the way I made sure to fully charge both of them so yeah the bakes dizzy with the regular half gram pod and then I should just cut this open sarios so you got the plug and play right here Girl Scout cookies full gram they do not sell half-grams as far as I'm concerned so if you're sayin you gotta have for him chances are you got a fake bro and boom well let's check out the oil real quick we did not check out the oil on the plug-and-play so the oil on the plug-and-play it's not bad looks kind of the same as it is II kind of dark there is no movement on the air book was whatsoever dude Girl Scout cookies very nice so alright so the plug-in plate I believe is a 500 milliamp battery and then this dizzy big is 650ml amps I believe it's it's 150 milliamps more than the plugin blade but you get then again you're paying $15 more so I mean yeah there there is where you're getting your power from those 15 dollars are going to extra extra battery sources so plug and play steezy man so far the visual appeal to me I don't know which one to which one would I choose I think I would just choose this dizzy just because it's smaller you know more more discreet with the plug and play you can just hold it in your palm compared to this to this dizzy you know I could hold this in my palm rip it and no one will even know what's in my hand with this one it's gonna be sticky now I mean it's not it's not too noticeable though like if you're if you're just an average person and going down and you see someone hitting this you're gonna think he's hitting a vaper something definitely not the no THC so overall look I would have to go with dizzy just because discreteness and it's just nicer you know it's just a little small nice very very small nice that's it nothing else they're both they're both black and they both have their logo on it is you know same thing with every other company so next though oh man this is this is the moment we're gonna get into this boys so we're gonna get into the draw test so which one has the bigger draw so that bakes dizzy or the plugging player I'm not gonna do which one gets you more high because at the end of the day you know it each each pot that you get is gonna give you a different high it all depends on where like you're setting it it just depends on who you are and what you're doing you so I'm not gonna compare the highs or anything that's not really that's not really something people should be doing in the first place so first we're gonna rip this dizzy though cuz it's a sativa strawberry cough and it is one of their highest rated THC cartridges so yeah let's go in on this one boys cheers if you guys are a teen number 21 over and over here make sure you have smoking along with me and you eat oh man five seconds I got the water on dick ice-cold water you gotta stay hydrated at all times and whoo man that first hit all right this summer he gonna be sweating already got his own thing don't think it's the pins so Strawberry Cough got me coughing dude so right off the bat did the hint that I got from that was so amazing it was smooth I didn't taste any burnt ones like I said one issue that people were having with the big battery was the fact that it was burning their paws and I just felt like it was the old pods that weren't compatible with the battery but it looks like now that they changed to the new packaging a new pods and stuff it looks like this battery can keep up so you guys don't have to worry about burning it or anything like that so the hit on this is very very smooth too so yeah the big battery definitely coming in hard right now so next we're gonna do the plug and play The Girl Scout cookies all right boys clear the real quick whoo all right here we go boys plug and play five-second hit same as this dizzy see what how hard it hits compared to this dizzy man no I don't choose boys oh just about the same plugin please be creeping up yeah the plugin plays definitely creep creep up on you dude it's been a while since I had one and the last one I had was the tangi bang and that one was whatever you know I wasn't too much of a fan of it you should Eric's op usually they're exotic lineup sir whatever their DNA lineups which is the man I'm very faded the plug-and-play that mean the Girl Scout cookies it's a DNA which means for this one I think the Girl Scout cookies is a hybrid if I'm not too mistaken so yeah you're getting a little bit about both sativa and indica whoo but that hit the hit that I got was definitely a little bit more denser it feels like a more um harder pulled and then compared to this dizzy where it's like just a very very like clean pool but the smoke that you get it's definitely very very comparable you like the amount of smoke you feel in your chest and your mouth when you're filling it up you feel the lung expansion and they're both pretty much the same this was not more than this one this was not more than this one so yes for pools we're gonna do it we're gonna do another two pools see if maybe I'm getting more more airflow better air flow or whatever the case is now that I've kind of Wick them up a little bit so back to this dizzy big clouds a dude that was like three seconds right there whoo yeah that one that one's I got a little heart harder pull right there now that I waked up and that's for the plug and play let's go again man had to go hard to go home whoo same thing as dizzy broke the pool we're so similar I'd say with the plug-and-play though it's a little bit it's a little bit different airflo compared to this dizzy but definitely the pools are very very the same they're pretty much the same so would I pay $15 more like if I'm new to the market dude and then I'm like all right I want a pod system you know and I'm not looking to spend too much what gives me that a good pool that's kind of similar to like a blunt or J you know things like that and because I just want a good time with the punch system so you asked the bud tender the bud tenders like well you got the big stiffy which is 35 and you got the plug and play which is 20 like which one are you gonna go for and they pull pretty much the same so in my opinion just is he could have I mean the the higher battery could maybe the difference you know it lasts longer but then again like there's never been a time where I've used plug and play and it's died on me halfway through a cartridge you know or halfway through a pod ever or even 75% in there's all like every single time you fully charge one of these things it lasts you a full freakin pond so no the extra battery life doesn't really make sense to me and yeah I would definitely when it comes to the the pools dizzy if you guys are just over overcharging dude plug and play when the when the price when it comes to price which is number three comparison the price I guess on batteries like I said you got the small battery right here which is 50 you could probably find it for 15 nowadays I'm sure to twenty dollars and then you got the big battery which is thirty to thirty five dollars depending where you get it from and then you have the plug-and-play which is twenty dollars compared to the old Suzy and it hits like a venue Suzy so that's that's the batteries though so just take a hit of real quick though double here for the boys we're so amazing flavors Oh woo so prices on pods so to be fair plug-in plays like I said earlier they don't have half grams so when you pay for a pod you're gonna have to pay the full price which is 52 I think the highest I've seen them go to is 60 I would never pay more than $60 to be honest for a pot at least and yeah that's the price for that pot and then for this dizzy you could find the half grams anywhere from 25 to the highest 35 s and then the full grams I've seen them go up to $60 also same as plug and play so the price is pretty much the same except for the plug and play you're gonna have to go with the full gram instead of having the choice of a half gram for in case you know you're short on funds it happens it happens it happens to people you know oh they can only get 30 bucks for a half gram which is and which is fine you know like you know I'm not matching but you said so prices are very very similar and then what else alright next comparison man I'm just too stuck right now I'm trying to I wish I could enjoy these instead of making comparison but actually we're going to enjoy a rocker I'm talking about baby killer though I can feel the cops creeping out there you go man so alright so we did prices we did polls we did the quality of the battery what else can we compare it to man so how do you know I'm gonna have to do the comparison on the oils comparison on the oils so far alright hate to talk [ __ ] man I don't like to talk [ __ ] on any companies especially companies that I've used in the past so Girl Scout cookies so far it's not bad at all it tastes like Girl Scout cookies but you guys have to remember plug and play it's desolate and I don't know I don't know what it is about plugging plate but they're all just seems a little like really really heavy you know if it's not like if it could go through another process of distillation you know like just to get that extra cleanliness taste so we're gonna take another hit and just get to the full the full little review on this one yeah it's like it tastes a little bit like you know dirtier not like it's not I don't know how do I sound express it dude beer or just even take a bed but yeah it tastes a little bit more harsher in a sense when it hits your lungs it just feels a little bit harsher like it feels more like a dab like when I reviewed this before I always always compare it to a dab all the time it's very very harsh like a DAB so plugging blood I mean it's dizzy its I like Susie when it comes to their to their flavors to their pods you know like they create some of the best quality [ __ ] out there in my opinion so smooth dude it's like you're freaking taking a hit off your freaking babe you know super super smooth and the thing weighs like like what's dizzy one thing I know for sure is that I'm getting really really good quality when I'm buying their cards like I don't think I've ever buying a pot from them and it's been like yeah I don't want to smoke this you know I like that alright it's whatever it's a man like they could have done better I like every single pot that I bought from all the way from indica to freakin sativas and hybrids like they've all been at least a seven and a half or above you know and as for plug-and-play you know with them it's kind of like you're gambling you're gambling for sure at least for me you know that's my thoughts before before I would buy one of their pods is like oh man is it gonna be good you know because I've had a like for example that tangi bang when they came out I was like hell yes dude the Tengen gate bang and the Girl Scout cookies Girl Scout cookie sold out and I was like all right I'm gonna get the tangi bang and it's gonna be good no matter what I got it tasted like crap I'm not gonna lie it tasted like orange soda it didn't really get me faded it didn't anything much but you know the overall quality of plug and play is just it's good it's just not up to par it with dizzy man so man I'm gonna have to give that like overall conclusion assimilating everything putting all the freaking details and facts and [ __ ] together let's just go ahead and take a couple more hits and then before I get to the final conclusion for you guys are Cheerios oh but killer rapes right there's a story sometimes I forget that these RTC pens memo you're ripping look if there's a freaking me pod so overall conclusion dizzy wins a battle and let me tell you why so even though you have to pay thirty five you're getting quality I'm pastry I could drop this a couple times it won't get too scratched up it won't like at all like that much it's very very nice its small fits in your palm it's so sleek duty they just have it down like steezy dudes like steezy I know it's that's pronounced dizzy but it's so steezy it's like you know one of those words that people use now it is to refer to like something that's fresh so sticky steezy as [ __ ] plug-and-play you could use a little work man I've seen these are just if I'm not mistaken they are just a they just slapped their logo onto already made battery so they're just being lazy at that point you know and that's one thing that's dizzy there they're innovators do they they come out with the best product they do something different compared to other everything else and that's why they're winning that's why they are at the top of the food chain right now so and not to bash on plug-and-play men much love to plug-and-play like you guys were some of my finest smokes coming up in this [ __ ] cartridge game you know but ya have to give this one to stay overall I I wouldn't mind paying the 35 bucks again for this battery and that's why I keep buying their pod to see if you guys don't notice of my videos that like they've been only the only company where I consistently buy their pods even though I've had them several times so yeah I'm sorry plugging but I don't mean to talk [ __ ] but Susie wins dude it's nice so we're gonna take another hit off this and then we're in the video if you guys enjoyed the video go ahead and leave a like comment and sub and cheers boys", "rNsGGdFLwDg": "hey everyone stoner broad here and I'm really excited to do an unboxing quick review for a new product that I just picked up today it's my birthday it's September 10th 2017 so I got the newest thing on the market right now which is made by pax and it is the era it is this guy right here so it's tiny little device it's going to pair with my phone because there's no readout or change or anything on the actual device it has to pair with your phone and then in it bluetooth capable so that's different and new and I'm excited to try that I am in Nevada and the company right now that has pods out for the PAX air because there's a little pot that goes like cartridge thing that goes inside the device is major OOP dropped it oh goodness holy geez okay so it's made by matrix and I picked up the Sour Diesel og it's a hybrid strain and here it is inside here so I and I'm excited to put this together and check it out so the camera is gonna pan down and we're gonna open it up together and check it out I'm gonna plug my phone into the computer so you can see me downloading the app and putting it all on my phone and pairing it and getting it all sorted together and then I'm gonna test it out for you and then in 90 days I will do a full review on my scoring system you know the deal one through ten ten categories so out of 100 we'll see how it holds really excited because I've used a number of packs items and I know that they put out quality products so I'm excited to see about this cartridge thing I've been using like 5-10 thread thread cartridges for years now and they break or you go up in altitude and they leak you set it sideways in a leak so they've been overall a pain and I'm excited to see what pax has put out for this cartridge oil situation so without further ado let open it up and check it out okay so I picked up this Sour Diesel OG made by matrix like I said earlier I am in the state of Nevada so it seems like what's going on is that PACs is giving their cartridges to different companies in different states and their who are allowed to manufacture for the pods I'm not really sure but in Nevada its matrix California has one company that's doing it Colorado I believe Oregon and I believe either Washington has it where they're right you know like getting in line to go next so what I have heard through the grapevine and I'm not sure about this but the PAC's era right now is 20 bucks in Nevada and I heard that the price is going to go up on September 16th and it's gonna be like $60 which sounds actually more in the price range for a pax product they're definitely more on the higher end of things so I got mine for 20 bucks today is September 10th 2017 like I said earlier it is my birthday so I got this and today I purchased this so that I could actually do a unboxing real quick set it up a pair with my phone like I said and take a couple hits to see what's going on and then I'll do my 90-day full review so I'm gonna open this up here this pops out just interesting so this has the child safety proof cap on the back and then it is see-through here so you can see the pot on the inside there's a little insert here that says that there's a recommended pax error temperature setting for matrix oil is manual setting medium to high third heat setting pax era app setting is seven hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit high setting will equal more vapor a low setting will equal more flavor it says download the pax vapor app free on your iOS or Android device device now search for pax vapor in the app store so that's what this little card says so like I said I'm gonna have to do a screen share so I can show you pairing it with my phone and everything and then it comes with a little sticker Kihei packs the sticker is in here cuz I did open the box already just to check it out and see what it looked like and I threw the sticker on my laptop so now I have another one which is cool it's cool with that it came with the pod too so then the box alright so here it is and it says it's compatible with a pod number to insert pod number three pulse white when connected and then number four enjoy era so this guy is really small like really really small and the pod goes right in here and this little thing will light up and there's like this I don't know if it's a button there's this little thing back here I got to get to know this like I said I don't know anything about it and then it charges down here all I know is that I've had friends in Colorado tell me that they have it and they really like it so I decided to get one especially if the price is only 20 bucks right now and the prices supposedly supposed to be going up I felt like 20 bucks is a great deal I paid $60 for my cartridge I've read online that they're ranging anywhere between like 50 to 70 dollars depending on what state you're in and also depending on medical or recreational because I guess there's different prices too in different states so there's a charger looks like there is Quick Start Guide safety guidelines and limited warranty so this thing is pretty little so it looks like it should be pretty easy so I'm gonna read that as we go through this unlock the packs life register your device and verify your warranty so right away you know that one the subcategories under my electronics tab for the scoring system is the warranty so I'm gonna have to check this out and make sure that I register for my warranty when you purchase one make sure you register your warranty otherwise you won't have a warranty to cover you so then the last piece in here is the app so obviously this thing has no readout no buttons no anything so all of it is gonna be done from my phone which is really interesting to me so I'm gonna just read over this real quick it says packs air a Quick Start Guide step one insert era compatible pod purchased separately into the air device and the indicator light will pulse white mean the device is ready to use and then you draw with the mouthpiece to initiate your session remove the pot and your finish the indicator light will pulse blue meaning the device is disconnected so that's just the basic of I guess how we're gonna hit it once it's on and it has like battery levels charging temperature controls that kind of stuff so I am going to plug in my phone so that I can screen share this and we are going to pair this bad boy with my iPhone so I will be downloading the PAX vapor app in the App Store on the app market for Apple so I'm gonna go set that up real quick okay so I downloaded the PAX app just like the Box told me to so I'm gonna click the app it says welcome to pax vapor half is the best way to enhance up that one faster than I could read it to you guys so it's just going over some information I guess for customization setting to each session tailored to you safe and secure your privacy will never be compromised so we're gonna hit get started and it's asking me if I have a pax era or a pax 3 and I a pax era the PAX 3 is I believe it's an herbal driver vaporizer so apparently that connects with your phone - so I have a pax era so shake your pax until blue light appears we'll take care of the rest so I am going to shake so I am shaking it there's the blue lights alright so as you can see on the app here it says we found your new friend named your pax era so I had already downloaded app and already decided what I was naming my pax so it is a lot easier so that's mine and then this is asking me if I can anonymously share app usage to them so that they can troubleshoot and create the best possible experience for me so I'm gonna say yes to that and my pax is ready to go tap your device tap the device you just paired to get started so I'm tapping it and it's showing the temperature is set at 611 so earlier I read a little card in the box that said the best temperature is 710 so I am going to increase it to 710 and when I did that the lights on the era flashed to an orange color so it looks like as you move it down it'll change color so it just went green or like a yellow color and now is bright green so like I read earlier the lower the color or the lower at the temperature the more flavor you're gonna get and the higher the temperature the more vapor you're gonna get so I'm gonna go with their 7/10 suggestion so here we go okay so I have my phone set at 7:10 I think that you can see that look there okay cool so 7:10 when you pick this up or you move it it lights up green so I guess there might be like a wait and it's something that's identifying that it's omen or I don't know I read online that it does crazy stuff and you can like put it in your pocket and it'll just stop like it only initiates when you take your hit so here we go okay so on the back here it is child safety proof so I'm gonna push and turn I'm gonna pull it out here it is here's the top of the mouthpiece it says matrix Nevada and V on the back and then Sour Diesel Oh G hybrid so I'm going to pop this guy in interesting there we go okay so let's take a rip and see how it works lights up blue indicating that you are inhaling so that's pretty cool I like how lightweight it is it's pretty discreet I feel like you could just I don't know kind of like walk around anywhere and hit it which is definitely convenient for being in places that it might work nicely like a hike or concert or some kind of thing like that it's definitely small it doesn't blow out like a huge thick cloud which is really nice it has really nice flavor I like that too so thumbs up to the Sour Diesel og from matrix here in Nevada I'm gonna do a full 90-day testing on this I actually have some travel plans coming up where I will be going to California and probably Oregon and possibly even Washington so if I can get pods in different states I will test them out as well that way during my 90 days I've tried some other ones from different growers because it looks like like I said that it's gonna be different growers in each state that are getting the pods from packs and then filling them with thier strains so I have the Sour Diesel OG right now I know at the dispensaries here in Nevada there's a couple different ones you can pick up like there's a dosey doe which is an indica and that's actually a really great strain I love that strain from matrix it's a good one they have a gorilla glue number for a gorilla dog which is guerrilla glue number four mix with chem dog then a couple other ones so definitely check it out and if you liked what you saw today go ahead and hit that subscribe button down here and the like button and check out some of the other videos and I'll see you soon", "faMjXNIJKpE": "hey guys welcome back to my Channel today I'm going to be doing a full comprehensive review and comparison of both the pax era battery and the Jupiter tomcee cell battery so why these two batteries you may ask in Arizona the PAX battery is monopolized by one concentrate company that currently fells its cartridges in California I know there are a whole bunch of different growers that have packs cartridges available but here in the state of Arizona we only have direct concentrates if you've seen my previous video on the pax era and drip concentrates I absolutely love this pen this vaporizer it is so amazing I swear by it i raved about it whatever drip also offers a csail cartridge basically seaso makes the pod the cartridge that drip puts the oil into and they also make jupiter and cecil also make the battery same thing with the pack system pax makes the pod and the battery and drip just puts the oil in the pot which i actually think it's kind of smart because then these oil companies don't have to like learn how to make these things it's already available to them it kind of just like speeds up the process the PAX courage comes in only 500 milligrams the C cell cartridge comes in 500 milligrams and a thousand milligrams so you have two different options there's also a lot more deals in the valley on the C cell cartridges so I decided one day to try these one there was a deal going on at one of my local dispensaries I think it was true mad that I got this at but I'm not 100% positive that's the dispensary that distributes for drip so yeah I decided because that pax video did so well I would put it up against a competitor or its competitor in the state which is the palm battery both of these cartridges that I have by the way are starburst you can see it says it um yeah um this one has a good decent amount left and I didn't even realize this pod had anything left it's kind of just been like sitting around for good week this may be a quarter full and then I have my drip cartridge which is also pink starburst but there's really not that much left and I'm gonna get into that later cuz it has to do with my opinions on both of these vaporizers on how long the cartridge lasts does it burn what does it taste like whatever so to get started I'm just gonna do a quick refresher on the PAX era which if you haven't seen my video if you want to see like a whole review where I teach you how to use the app that it comes with all that stuff you can that you can check out the video that I did that will be linked in the description box below so the PAX era according to pax papers website is an effortless pen and pod system for cannabis oil control temperature flavor and potency and achieve session predictability experience the new era of cannabis enjoyment this is offered in one color of black and it is $29.99 on Cox's website when you open the box you get this obviously mine is engraved because I got it done one of their promotional events but so yours won't look like this it'll just be plain black I got the sticker out and you get a sticker I just like when companies give you a sticker like the drip packs pods in every single box pretty much every single box there's a sticker and it's like a crackerjack prize I don't know maybe I'm just like a child but I love that so the pack Sarah is fully controllable from an app on my phone I usually like to keep my I hope this is charged my battery this is daddy on we have the poem seesaw battery this comes in a whole bunch of different colors it comes in black pink gray green and blue I think HS black gray blue and pink so I obviously got pink seen this retail from anywhere from like $20 to $30 so it's gonna be about the same price as the packs battery maybe even a little bit cheaper if you can find it and the palm battery according to the box has aluminum alloy housing inhale activated stealthy breathing LED indicator quality circuit board with multiple protection battery capacity 550 m a magnetic adapter included micro USB rechargeable I reminded me of something super different about the palm battery this is what comes in the package it is your clear battery that fits in the palm of your hand obviously I put that sticker here comes with a charger alright well this one says C cell and the PAX one says PAX 2 so like I couldn't tell the difference even though they're the same microUSB and what's different about the palm is it comes with these two little rings that you actually need in order to use any cartridge with the battery in order for it to be compatible it's a magnetic system so these are magnetic adapters that you screw on to the end of your cartridge there's two one four I'm assuming a 500 milligram cartridge and one for a thousand so I just screwed the 500 milligram adapter onto the bottom of my cartridge like so and it's magnetic into the battery Oh before I try that for you on camera I'm just gonna read you a little bit about this battery the C cell cartridge in general and whatever from Jupiter researchers website an ordinary atomizer the coil resides on the surface of the wick causing inconsistent heating additionally ordinary with designs cause reduce flow to the heating coil unrivaled vapor performance for premium extracts embedding the heating coil 360 degrees within the ceramic core ensures the atomizer is uniformly heated they being reinvented for extracts baking has evolved significantly since the first east cigarette hit the US market in 2007 Jupiter knew from the start that plant extracts require hardware designed specifically for their high viscosity to address this need Jupiter started with the knowledge gaining produce the best available e cigarette technology on the planet and turn to C cell technology we are proud to sell the best performance driven hardware on the market and stand behind our liquid performance of products now other technology comes close to matching C sales performance discover the exclusive seats a difference with Jupiter research so clearly this product is marketed to be a discreet kind of mimic of a cigarette and it produces a big vape cloud similar to that of an e-cigarette witch or a vape which is really great if you're looking for that if you're looking for that effect and also I read somewhere I don't remember where but the temperature adjusts itself accordingly based on the cartridges needs so I'm assuming when it's at the bottom and it needs to burn at a higher temperature the battery will adjust itself but that being said I have no control over how hot this cartridge burns and I tend to use these pods a 500 milligram cartridge a lot quicker than I would a normal PAX 1 because with that device I have control the cartridge burns slower at a lower heat obviously and with this system I have no control so typically the drip cartridge the C cell cartridge would last me about two days where I could make the tax era pod last five or six if I try hard enough and if I like set the teeth the heat at the correct setting it'll last me like anywhere from five days to a week so that's a really big that's a really big difference between the system and the other system so at Tru med the dispensary that distributes for drip concentrates a drip cartridge for a C cell batteries for 1,000 milligrams it is $65 and for 500 milligrams it is $40 and the pax era pod will run you $45 for the 500 milligram they should really make a thousand but maybe there's a reason they don't I don't know oh we're just gonna wait for the packs to charge so I can do a comparison of like how much vapor you get with this with that so now that this is charged I'm gonna just compare at the level of vapor that I get from both of these it's the same strain I don't know what this heat setting is so I'm actually gonna pause really quick and go check because it's on my phone and I'm going to need to use that but I'm gonna let you know what temperature this pen is set at I don't know what this is up but it's self adjusts so I guess we'll see the comparison to the heat setting that I usually like to use and then what this pen gives out my pack Sarah is currently set up five hundred and sixty degrees will see the difference between the vapor and this is not really like a good judge because like there's not much left in this cartridge but it's cuz I used it so quick okay so consensus they give a really similar hit this is designed to give you a bigger hit like a vape but I honestly think that these are really really similar in the hit this cartridge started to taste really bad kind of like marshmallow II like battery when I got to the bottom and this still tastes amazing even though the liquid is like really dark and usually gonna liquid Stark it means like the it's gone bad and it tastes really bad but that actually tasted so good for being really old and disgusting and maybe that's because I've been having this marshmallow cartridge here but I do have a pom battery I would definitely say that it's worth it because you can use a whole bunch of different concentrate companies a whole bunch of different growers offer see sell cartridges in Arizona but I actually really like drip concentrates so I think I might be sticking to this cartridge it's a little bit more expensive or 500 milligrams like five dollars more but I think it's worth it I think the pax cartridge lasts way longer and the jupiter-c sell cartridge did so thank you guys so much for watching if you like this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment below if you've ever tried either one of these what's your

that you also get a charger with the USB cable attached you will not get to see the charging of this but it did take about 15 minutes to charge which is pretty good so we're going to get into it I'm gonna put that down and get into Packaging right here and this is what the cartridges got and make sure you see that okay I'm a little destructive sorry guys but I'm so excited to get into this pack

get into this right here you ready for this just bad drip full-spectrum pax error let's get into this people talk about this like it's the truth I'm gonna get in unbox this for you right here you can get the battery pressed so when I got this I read about it it says online well it says on the back of this that you can hook this up to your iPhone or Samsung Android device cool you can't hook it up to your iPhone iPhone has banned any vaping device apps being hooked up to this service so you can't actually hook this up personally I don't need all that extra and I don't want it I want to see what

moment on the ground or whatever she just on the ground off what do you end up with there is that's the tax arrow pot I didn't look these attentive possibly they are because it doesn't like a red

week or two I haven't uploaded a car video yet so I'm back I'm back at it again you know I'm saying back to chief and the reason for that was basically because I just wanted you know just it's good to take our tolerance a break every now and then like you know Express she was like wax and [ __ ] like that you know um your tolerance goes up very quick so you know you you know taking a week or two office you know that can be pretty good for you cuz then when you go back to it you know you don't need as much to get to where you want to be you know a couple couple blinkers and you're set for a couple hours so yeah well that's that and today I'm back at it again with one of these a supreme this is my first time ever trying this um I've heard that there's a lot of I've heard a lot of hyper on these um I don't know if they're real or not to be honest with y'all y'all let me know you know I'm just I just do these reviews you know I'm not saying that this is good I'm just doing a review this is honest you know I've never tried this before you know I've just heard a lot of hype around it and I don't know if it's good or not so y'all let me know so sativa picked up pineapple Express ninety-two percent THC CBD point zero 85% see that it actually has a batch number which I don't even know if that's legit I don't I don't know if there's an actual batch number I don't even know where I enter that in to see in pod 282 XY so yeah it's a full ground oh it's not in the box cuz I already took it out it came in like a tube it came in like a plastic tube you had to open the tube oven and the card had um the car was inside the tube but I already do the - boy I already have the card on my battery cuz I've already tried it out um I just got it today so I mean I've only taken like a probably about like ten posts out of it cause I wanted to read that CHC distillate or Pete medical use only you know all that stuff take it off the sake show a little ooh alright so here it is not gonna lie with you know it was really clean it's nice it's a nice gold it's a C so you can see to see so it has the holes um I like I like the white tip because I never I've never gone one with the white tip the ones that I usually get are the ones you know the metal ones like the gold one the silver one or the black plastic tip yeah those are usually the ones that I see not gonna lie with y'all this oil is very very very runny like that doesn't even look good I'll be honest with y'all it's it's it's way too runny it's clean it's not dark it's not like yeah it's not like shitty wax you know it's it's it's clear I'll tell you all that but it's look at that like that's way too [ __ ] running supreme or whoever's making these you gotta stop this [ __ ] up man you should is way too runny just way too runny yeah um well obviously I'm gonna try this out still I've already tried it um I'm gonna put on my battery and I'll be back with y'all ready to puff on alright got it back on the battery um I mean a lot of people this is obviously not made by supreme I know a supreme is the clothing brand I mean clearly this isn't made by supreme like supreme would not allow that like they would never I doubt they would ever make their actual own card so I mean this is clearly made by either people or like a company but I don't know why a company would still a supreme my quality take supreme user name I don't know why they just wouldn't make their own but I'm pretty sure this is made by somebody so um the batteries on and take a couple puffs for y'all um tell you about the taste and tell you about the high let's get it okay okay right off the bat you can taste the UM you could taste a pineapple a little bit Wow that's already hitting me already that wax is ready as [ __ ] man you take a good hit off of it you're gonna fill it you're gonna fill it it's just a TV so I'm already filling it in my head but um what was I gonna say um it the taste it has liked it has a little bit of hint of pineapple towards the end but honestly in the beginning it kind of just tastes like straight bud um terpenes barely mmm barely yeah there's not really tart beans in there I'll be honest barely there is a little bit but yeah there's not really a lot uh I like I like Turkey you know I like my flavors you know Mike hearts to be Turkey so if you really like Turks probably not the thing for you like I said very runny kind of like the Dinks tanks are super runny the exotics I know those are all fake I'm pretty sure this is fake to you I'm telling you I'm being honest I'm pretty sure this is fake and if you already know if I'm probably get a lot of comments saying fake fake fake trust me if it is fake I was right then I just do these reviews for y'all because at the end of the day it's just entertainment and I'm kind of letting y'all know like cuz somebody might see this and somebody might want to buy it that doesn't know that this is fate that doesn't know that this is extremely freaking runny that doesn't know that so now they can know so they can have second thoughts no honestly this was $35 for a full gram I would say just save you know spend the extra 20 and get you like a rope or something steep odd a plug-and-play pod you know something nice you know this you know there's so much better than this right here you know but I understand some people aren't in legal states and this is kind of like the best that they can get you know they can't get all the stickies plug in plays yeah so that's why they resort to stuff like this as for the hi I'm gonna be wrote you the height is nice it does have a nice high I would give it probably like an 8 out of 10 on the high it's real nice the Teva it's already I feel I feel good right now so uplifted I'm to go and take another hit then again my tolerance is kind of low right now so some people might have to take more than just one hit for me I wasn't like here anything another one I'm really a big fan of taking blinkers to be honest I just got kind of take it casual you're gonna take like three four second heads but yeah this is um yeah at the end you can taste the pineapple on dragon line I really like pineapple so you know I can taste that I can taste it so there is a little bit of Terps but I mean I've tried two other cards that are pineapple expressing yeah like it's just so flavorful like right off the bat this one it's like towards the end you don't really taste it right off the bat like the other ones the ones that like you know are really chirpy so on taste I would give it a 5 out of 10 turn five out of ten um the oil was nice it's clear just it's runny so it's really not that good I guess you would say um card is nice I like it cuz it's a t-cell so you're gonna get everything in here so I do like the card I like the white tip so it's nice and the coil is nice um cuz I did take a couple blinkers off this and I noticed that it doesn't taste burnt so the overall cart is pretty good so the person that did get this you know they actually actually you know got a good car because somebody would just give cars that are trash so yeah young y'all let me know if y'all want like a particular brand I can I can probably get it um I had just picked this up cuz I've like I've seen a bunch of videos on this and I've heard like the hyper on it so I saw this today and I was like you know what let me go ahead and buy that cuz you know I just wanted to try it will I buy this again no I will not I will not buy this again I'm gonna stick with my other stuff um you know like just like the West Coast cars I never tried those will I buy those again probably not I really just [ __ ] with likes Dizzy's brass knuckles heavy hitters the real ones so yeah but I will I will do a review on like exotics or Dinks but I'll only do one review I will never buy it again like I've never bought into danger before and every bond and exotic but I will buy one just for a video to do for y'all to educate y'all but will I buy it again just for my own pleasure no same thing with this I probably won't so I appreciate y'all like this video subscribe if you want some more common telling which I wanted and um yeah peace let me know what y'all smoking on to you man", "0968BB4i1b4": "hey guys I'm Holly weed welcome to my channel I am a huge pot smoker and my channel is going to be about marijuana everything relating to cannabis I am going to review marijuana products found them different types of edible strains glass technology and just talk about the impact marijuana is handling me had on others how it pertains to our society as its becoming legalized in more and more States I'm fortunate enough to live in one of the states where it is now recreationally legal California I'm located in Los Angeles and I moved here about a year and a half ago specifically for weed weed has had such a huge impact on my life I started smoking when I was in high school I've been smoking for over six years almost every single day and I just didn't really have a great quality of life before marijuana because I couldn't sleep and I was having trouble eating because I would get sick after almost every meal I was very thin and it's helped my life in so many ways as if I am an expert on anything it is definitely marijuana because it has been such a huge part of my life every day for the past six years so I just wanted to share some of that expertise with the internet so um I'm gonna be doing a review today my very first one this is one of my favorite products it comes from a brand called pax they produce premium portable vaporizers and they started with a pax one it only burned flower and was one time and he let me head it and it was amazing and so they came out with the packs - I got it this was also a vaporizer that only allowed flower but it was amazing it made my weed last so much longer it was burning like 80% plus of all the THC that I put in and I was getting way higher off of it the smell was reduced because the amount of smoke from the vaporizer is very little I mean it's not smoke it's the vapor and it was just a really good product I really was happy with that brand um but one thing that I always wanted was one that did wax so when I heard about the PAX 3 its their vaporizer that there's flour and wax I was so excited I immediately went to their website and that's actually where I found the product I'm going to talk about today which is the pax era so this is my favorite favorite vape pen it is so portable and tiny it's like the size of a USB stick they had it on sale on their website for $20 when I got it I'm not sure if that's still what it is but that is what it was then and they come with these cartridges they I mean they don't come with it bit you use these cartridges and each one has 500 milligrams of THC they just slide in the top and there's no screwing on or anything like that it just simply pops in and stays in pretty solidly and then there's no buttons or anything to press you simply just hit it and yeah you can hit as hard as you want for as long as you want and never limit you the battery now doesn't ever cut off or anything like that like it does on some of the other vape pens um and then it just has one hole at the bottom to plug the charger in it's a micro USB so it's very convenient very easy to use and it lights up when you're using it as you can see on the front the legs will start to glow blue and you can actually change the color of the lights so that is another thing that I really really love about this pen is the fact that it has an app so they made an app to control the PAX 3 and the pax era and you can use this app to do things like change the temperature change the color of the lights you can lock it if you don't want someone to hit it you can name your device you can check the battery life that's left on it you can even play some games and so it's a really extensive app and that is something that's unique to the PAX brand is like the first vaporizer to have an app to give you that full control or exactly what temperature what color really make it your own and that's one of my favorite things about this device so you can get these pens on their websites these by themselves without the cartridges or they sell them at dispensaries and states but a lot of marijuana usage so I just wanted to talk a little bit about the cartridges so they come look into this there are little squares they have two metal pieces on the bottom and a mouthpiece and each one has 500 milligrams of THC in it they come in indica sativa hybrid different strain specifics and the only thing that I don't really like about it is that they're not always available in every dispensary but they really should be because it's a great product and they just go over so well they're so convenient you always get a great hit they taste amazing and yeah I think they should just be available to everyone in every dispensary and they're not yet so sometimes you have to call ahead or check on weed maps but I recommend if you're going specifically to get a pack theropod you definitely check because not every dispensary does sell them but if the ones that do I've seen them range in California at least anywhere from forty to sixty dollars you know depending on the strain and the story you're buying from them they get to set their own prices and everything so it really just depends but you definitely should do a little research before you buy one um that yeah sorry smoke break these are really really convenient and so when you pin them all the lights line up you can change the color of the lights in the app which is so fun if you shake it you can see how much battery life is left on the pen for meetings 100% 3 means 75% so on and you can do that in the app as well it's really fun when you're passing it around to like play a prank on your friends and like lock it so they can't hit it and they might get really confused or like is it broken so that's always really funny but yeah everyone I've ever shared it with honestly loves them I've never heard about a review they're really easy to travel with and share and just bring anywhere most people after they've hit it once they're like oh what is that or if they know what it packs is I like shoving the app and all the features that you can you know use and they're always very impressed because it's not often that you see such high user friendly technology for marijuana which is really cool I'm glad that we're advancing it's really changing the way the world works so it's a revolutionary product anyone who I let try it wants one they're always asking me where they can get one how much are they I even gave them as gifts sometimes they make a really good gift I'm giving them to my friends even my family and everyone loves them um so yeah this is the sativa pod in mine I'm gonna hit it one more time as hard as I can because I want you guys to see how big of a hit you can actually get so just keep in mind I don't have that big of a lung capacity I smoke dabs almost every single day a whole day and it kind of kills my lungs but I'm gonna try to blow all my air out so as you can see you can get huge clouds out of the pax era which is awesome a lot of vape pens cut you off the battery times out and you won't be able to hit it as hard as you want to but this does not do that at all which is a really great feature and you can change the temperature on your app so if it ever is too hot on your lungs and you're coughing or you can't get a big enough hit you can just turn it up you turn it down if it's too hot and it really gives you a lot of control which is awesome because a lot of we product you don't have that much control so it's really awesome yeah another thing I'd like to do is they get people who don't usually smoke to try it because they're always really surprised by how smooth it is how great it tastes how easy the hits are like you don't feel automatically high you aren't choking on it it's just like a very smooth clean hey and you can take as much as you like and it's great this really is one of my favorite smoking devices and I just want to be able to answer any questions you may have about it please leave comments if you think of anything that you want to know I'll be sure to answer it I hope I covered a lot of information and you understand how great the product this is no I'm not like sponsored by them I'm not trying to sell you anything I just really wanted the world to know how awesome the PAX era is how it can change your life it has really made vaping a convenient thing you can do anywhere and definitely recommend the tax era so if you have any other questions comments any other topics that you'd like to see me speak about just leave them in the comments below I'm gonna be making videos answering any questions relating to weave", "MqThOVxC1kg": "I'm filming this video for the second time now because I wasn't recording the first time hey guys what's up it's Sarah welcome back to my channel so I am so excited for today's video I'm just lighting some chakra candles you know I've gotta get it a good vibe going for this awesome video also I feel like my windbreaker is making like noise every time I move so if it is I apologize but it is freezing so anyways I'm so excited for today's video I am going to be reviewing two products from tax packs paper but I'm also going to be reviewing a concentrate from Liberty Health Science so if you're interested in that keep watching if you're not keep watching cuz you place on it okay so this is what the bag looks like so currently packs paper they're a company who makes vaporizers and then empty pots and then companies can buy them and put their own concentrates in them currently the only dispensaries out I know in the state of Florida that is retailing packaged products is Liberty health science sorry Angela so I was looking in the viewfinder not good but yeah I had Liberty drop off a little order at my house yesterday this is what it came in and let's just get into it so there's two things like I said the first one [ __ ] I dropped it the first one is just the actual pot itself this is what it comes in hopefully my camera will focus it's just a Hawaiian sativa it's 400 milligrams total the ratio is THC 78.9 and CBD 0.3 so that's awesome um yeah I believe this retails for about $55 I'm hope I'm correct so yeah this is when it comes and she's gonna try to open it I believe you pull it off yes okay so this is what it looks like when you open it it's just total 400 mils and oh that's so cute okay so that's what it so it just has a little I don't even think it's focusing but it just has the little rift logo on that side and then on this side oh I really hope it focuses but it just says Hawaiian sativa obviously I had to purchase a vaporizer to put it in so so this is what this vaporizer looks like it's just the pax era I'm pretty sure this is like the most basic packed vaporizer but you know gotta start somewhere yeah no it's just the Pax era extract and you just slide it oh I don't really think we're focused right now when are we ever though oh I really like the packaging it's just like super simple and clean it just has the pax logo and then you flip this down ah oh there's the vaporizer right there and then this is what it looks like in the inside I'm gonna go ahead and take it out it looks just like a tiny jewel no yo okay so I don't know if you guys are lame enough like me to actually have a jewel but if you are no offense look okay so pretty much if you guys don't have a jewel this is what jewels do oh my god okay that's like a note so I'm gonna go ahead and we're not gonna waste any time we're just gonna snap that in there so far though I want to say ten out of ten on packaging the aesthetic is so clean and simple which I really like I'm like I'm like a fan of companies when they have really nice so that's awesome but let's go ahead and try her [Music] [Music] honestly this tastes so good first off I really like the Hawaiian sativa so first I'll have 10 on it and recommend and I can automatically like as I start to like inhale I can almost taste the sativa right then if you know what I mean but I really like that strain so if you guys have a chance to place an order at Liberty or go to one definitely recommend I have something in my eye as for the PAX era I really really really like it so I don't know if you guys have hit some wax pens and right when you do as you like toke it when you take it to the back of your glugs it burns and it's so annoying it's so and I have all this like this is all clean it's no it's not Wow okay but it burned so much and this doesn't and I feel like I took a pretty large hit off of this and it didn't burn I really feel it in my throat so that's awesome I'm gonna go ahead and take another hit there's a literally something in my eye right now and I don't know what it is we're gonna get a little wild it's Saturday night you know [Music] but anyways so first off I want to go it through everything I feel like we should review it on so first off rice hella good this is why in sativa for 400 milligrams only 55 dollars and I honestly think that's really good I've paid way more money for pods or cartridges or anything that were the same amount same amount of milligrams or less milligrams and they weren't in here it's good the flavor of this is amazing and I I don't know I could go on about the flavor but I feel like for what you get for what you pay for it's definitely worth it so next up the PAX vaporizer is actually only $30 so that's not about it all you guys I really really really like it next quality I mean first off with the Hawaiians of Teva I'm feeling very energetic honestly I can't wait to go out of this video after that I don't feel like it couch locked or anything which if you guys if you guys know what it's like to be way to couch lock it's just I mean you just don't want to do anything you just like don't want to get up because you're you're just you're stuck so I don't feel that way at all right now and as of quality and function for this other stuff I love the color it like changing it's just like like the party mode on Jules so that's fun but um I really like the shape of it it's more like a thicker around it I don't know if you guys can tell but I love the shape of it the size of it it's like perfect it just fits in your hand throw in your like bag or you could honestly even fit it in your pocket so that's freaking cool and I'm gonna be really entertained by the colors so yeah and then it comes in this frickin cute packaging you can just put the pot in there if you want to change out your pods now we're just gonna I guess we're just going to chill we're just gonna have a good time [Music] in conclusion in conclusion Who am I Who am I so yeah I hope you guys liked this video I think I already said that I don't really know what's going on I really don't if you guys let me hit the red subscribe button

experience use the wire brush for heavier cleaning or the pipe cleaners for lighter cleaning remove the mouthpiece and the oven lid insert the wire brush into the vapor path to pop out the oven screen your oven screen should easily pop out but if you're having trouble use a cotton swab moistened with isopropyl alcohol to remove any buildup that may be holding your screen in place dip a pipe cleaner in isopropyl alcohol be sure to squeeze off any excess then floss the pipe cleaner back and forth through the vapor path to remove any residue or buildup clean the inside of the oven and the top of the device using a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol you can soak the silicone mouthpiece and oven screen in isopropyl alcohol but never submerge the oven lid in alcohol or water make sure the

Liberty man I've been wanting to try one of these hell yeah bro Barry White super thick liquid and yeah this pack squad thing I never seen I didn't know they look like this just a nice little stick it's pretty sweet change the temperature pull water shake it put the plug back in it's weird wasn't you get a change the tumblers are yeah huh no let's hit this baby up shout out little Barry White I just did - so my nose is running heads a little sweaty but you got a pack spawn what a good taste it's that like little it's got the extra tart flavor in it but not over who I [ __ ] is pretty good though um I feel it even after Deb is that like and then all the different things at different temperatures Iron Man edition oh man I love Liberty keep doing what you're doing this far and I'm like father just like shutting but ready to go [ __ ] right that was a good one kinda reminds me of this miss dizzy stick really got a hit an order but you guys rock it does hit that like and nobody told

collaboration and the pax era both of these we're honestly on this week for fantastic deals on ease and very to their websites and I got this one the pax era for 15 bucks so let's unbox it see what we get you get the pod right here the little cardboard covers as insert arrow pod we got that split up right there as you might be able to see - said something about shaking so that's it yeah so it lights up it has something a battery charge get a two-foot-long USB cable welcome to the app and the smallest instruction manual I've ever seen in my entire life good to know a register device page and a sticker I'm nifty with their logo on it also appears on the website don't my my cat he's just he's a co-star and this arrow pod came with a lazy OG pod and we're gonna unlock that and it tastes like mmm and then we're gonna do a head-to-head comparison with the gran cosines Jeep NGO and the gelato which I've heard fantastic things about we'll be the judge of that one today alright so we got the arrow set up right here now we're gonna dive into the Jeep NGO see what we get so from what I can tell both these devices are pretty much the main way to smoke vapor whatever you want to call it hash like box comes with pretty much the same thing as the era two-foot-long USB cable and the era cookies collab so you can't tell them apart that's on purpose they're very identical in size weight and cartridge size I think they're both half gram cartridges here and you know about 2 or 3 years ago people were all doing the 510 screw ons those I think are outdated at this point these are kind of the next step in the in the vape lineage of marijuana this is my gelato comes with a very nifty glue mouthpiece that matches the corresponding blue cookies colors I don't really know if it's much of a difference but it's $15 more than the regular cheap odds so it must be better right this is not my first cheap n2 by the way this is my not even my second it's my third the first one I had I [ __ ] out of no idea what happened in a kind of stopped working one day so I brought it to the place where I got it from I kept exchanging cartridges and like telling them it doesn't work it doesn't work and they're like dude just take my regular one and like leave because my box is gonna get really bad with me giving out cartridges over and over and over again especially when these are like 50 bucks apiece that's not cheap but they gave me a free one which is the regular one we're using right here and it's been working fine the main difference between the two as far as I can tell besides the little see that's just kind of embossed right here at the bottom the blue that the light on this one is white and the white the light on this one is blue so if it is it like $10 more for if you want to be seen smoking these then yeah but other than that I don't really notice a difference between the two the cookies g-pen is for not exclusively exclusively for cookies but that's the brand that they kind of built it around so you'd be foolish not to smoke it with that I guess something like that anyways we're gonna do a head-to-head comparison now of hip quality on the g-pen which is you know sufficient it does the job you plug it in and these are set to the right temperatures all time and they promise I think it says something like a half gram turns into like a hundred hits which is a lot B if you consider that they're like half their weight a tenth of a half gram is about an average dose MacNab these are a hundred doses in the size of ten dabs so a hundred doses is more depending on how long you take the draw for because longer you hit it obviously the heart of the coils are gonna get things like that are just kind of circumstances of vape pens and what you're prone to dealing with right now we're gonna compare them side by side give you hit analysis on which one is which the PAX is very sleek it's very similar to the jewel I had a duel for a little bit I hated it because kind of sucks having to rebuy pods which is a lot of the same thing in with the PAX you have to rebuy these pods there's no way as far as I know to get him to go again the jewel came and went I don't I don't smoke them anymore they're not do anything for me but we're gonna take a draw from the deep end see what it tastes like and with one of the packs the packs is a little more complicated than that plug and go deep in you just slide the cartridge in and out and it works it goes tells you when it's hitting and when it's not rich flavor he's like natural Terps which is you know what some things we want obviously and I noticed the second that exhale ellipses I'd give that a solid eight half out of ten maybe and nine I don't know now packs in the other hand is a little more different and difficult to understand then the G pen because I don't know why they want this to be like really tech savvy and they are but at the what point do me just kind of say like I suppose we can get high and not have to dick around on my phone to smoke so they have I really app that comes with it and it kind of controls pretty much everything from top to bottom all he needs to do is shake it and it's it's there right on my phone it tells me it's Matt's era it has a sliding scale temperature gauge they go from 442 790 so that's a pretty wide range of temperatures you can use it at I'm not sure what the G pens stock number is I think it's like 650 so we're gonna go 650 on this one a lot of the advice is take the pot out put it back in so I'm just going to do that a few times these devices are charged yeah this one has full battery so I guess they ship them with a charge and now the cost tax once again fantastic flavor it's really similar to what I would say is like faked herbs I'm not saying that these guys use fake Terps but it seems like it's almost too good to be true like there's no weed that I've ever tasted that tasted like that tastes like grape kool-aid I like that stuff it's good but it's not like what I want to taste why I'm smoking the g-pen I've also heard a lot of things about our mind with refilling them which I think adds a lot of aftermarket support that you can find people that have syringes full of cash oil I don't know if you'll be able to do that but we rent a trip of both of them right now video include both of these are great products made by great companies and we're just kind of having to pick which one you want to go with as your main hash oil supplier thanks a lot guys have a good one", "UUrEmhHjY-c": "hey everyone you're here with me mr dabber on another before you vape today we're going to be taking a look at the steezy live resin pod now i haven't tried these this is the orange float by the way so i'm really excited to see how much different is it than a regular one i went on their website website's pretty awesome has a lot of information on all the different products not so much on the strains but the merch and whatnot yeah you'll find that so let's go ahead let's open this up and let's see if their live resin pods are worth the vape on the front you'll find the authenticator type of strain their brand type of pod and the stream on the bottom turning it to the right we find the government warning the back has where i purchased it some words ingredients instructions a warning and where to find them turning it again is where and how to open it looking at the top you'll find the branding underneath we find the strain information this one coming in at 79.46 percent thc and 0.87 milligrams cbd to open it just push the tab in and pull from the top the nectar looks extra amber and much darker than the distillate pod let's compare the two with the big and regular steezy i had no problems this one has a very sweet orange turpey taste to it all the way through i really enjoyed creating with this one and it kept the good energy going the pod had me feeling more medicated with less and lasted me about five days with heavy use is it worth the vape look if you've never tried the live resin steezy and find them on sale [ __ ] yeah try it out let me know what you think but at full price you might be able to snag a battery and cart combo from a different brand for about the same overall i am impressed with the live resin steezy pod so much that i went to pick up another while the cell was active the taste and effect are a tier above what you get from the distillate carts but at the regular price point it's hard to recommend i want to know how the live resin steezy pods have left you feeling tell me in

"rIFOf4R1oyA": "you know what is going on YouTube welcome back to a quick little banger by your boy semi g-men so a question that I've been getting ass lately a lot men so you guys know that I've always upload a cartridge videos pata videos anything that has to do with a portable you know dabbing device then I'm pretty much using it because I'm always on the go I can never find a convenience to just roll down I mean sit down and roll one up you know or sit down and just heat up my mic to my banger or you know all that stuff so I always feel like I carry a cartridge or a pod with me at all times just because it's that convenient so but the question that I get asked a lot right is which one do you like better semi which one do you like better man you're always chief in this chief in that do you like cartridges better or do you like pods better and I was just like when when I saw that question I was just like wait hold on man I had to think about it I was like I don't know I don't know if I like cartridges or pods better you know I don't know which one I would choose on because I have had some really really amazing cartridges and then I've had some really really amazing pods you know and I feel like each one has their own you know up side to it so I think for today's video man we're gonna get down to the bottom of what I like out of a pod system and what I like out of a cartridge system and I guess so today though we are gonna be chiefing representing the 510 thread cartridge side we got imperial extracts this one right here is a lemoncello sativa and the main reason I wanted to put this one in is because lemoncello is one of those strains that is super freakin fire right now so I wanted you to give this one a shot shout out to imperial extracts mint for it you should handing this out to me and on the pot system side we got the big boy right here that's dizzy sitting on the nice big battery all right men shout out to Steve and I thought you know these two brands right here man they they make some really really good light resin so I chose some of the best ones that I could find and I just really want to see what what what makes it stand out more than the other all right guys so to start off I feel like let's start off with imperial extracts sitting that I think we're gonna put this out a three point five right lemoncello that's going what do I like about a 5-10 thread cartridge let's find out oh dude that is so smooth oh that libraries and hits though oh okay so off of that first initial hit I'm obviously not gonna base it off of the oil itself it's gonna be more about the cartridge and what I like about it so I think as the first thing the most obvious reason that I like a 5-10 thread cartridge over a pod would probably have to be you see this thing right here the battery man the fact that I could switch up my variable wattage is on a you know when I'm smoking if I tend that cartridge is something that is very very underestimated a lot of people do not know you know I preached this a lot when I'm doing cartridges and things like that but you have to if you feel like you're not getting the right amount of turps the right amount of flavor smoke whatever the cases the chances are you had to switch up the voltage side there go a little bit higher a little bit lower you know you go you have to find the sweet spot on a cartridge just so you can get that overall well you know smoke experience man when you're sitting there you're gonna get the the right flavor profile you're gonna get the Terps up smacking you get the smoke and I feel like when using a battery like this like this battery that has variable wattage right here on the down on the bottom I feel like that's a big upside to the 510 thread cartridges because men I I want it if I feel like it's not hitting enough I can easily turn it up and boom I'm getting smack because it feels like I just took a dab all right so that would be the first thing that I like about a 5-10 thread over a pot and next up on the list we got the stage right here like I said competing for the pod side and let's go ahead and take a little rip about this see what I like about the pod see what I like it but I don't like about it right choose or what I like over the 510 thread smackers dude I don't know it's dizzy so good but the imperial extracts man I think that lemoncello that they made Veneto bro finito so what I like about a pot I feel like what the thing that stands out to me the most about ippolit system it's just about the convenience and the sleek design that they give you I feel like that is the first thing that stands out to me right then no hands you don't have to push a button to draw this like you can do whatever you want with your hands while you're hitting it so I feel like that is the most upside about the about a pod system itself is the fact that you know you don't need to use press a button to hit it you just need to pull men in the designs at that you know they'd be coming out with with the paws system it's just the fact that you have a proprietary battery so you can really match it up and make it look very very appealing so that would be the first thing that I like about the pause systems is just the convenience and the visual appeal so back onto the cartridge side man I'm getting smack Manny I need to do some water boys don't forget summer is coming up man getting hot you guys need to stay hydrated all the time right so what's going on a 3-point boo it wasn't at three point eight holy shoot damn dude I think the first hit that I did was a three point eight so let's go ahead and now hit it a three point five and tell you what else I like about cardizem whoo that is fire dude it's so freakin smooth that I forget how much smoke is actually in my longings in their eyes like choking up so whoo yeah lemoncello definitely is I feel like the next thing that I would want to speak on about the 5/10 third cartridges are itself is I don't know what it is but I feel like I get a lot more flavor from cartridges of themselves because I've had I I can't remember what company it was exactly I don't even think they're around anymore but they went from putting it in a 5-10 thread cartridge and I remember tasting it it was so freakin good and they made the switch over to a pause system because they wanted you know hop on the wave up on the Uni style that was coming out and it just did not taste the same it did not taste the same I do not know if it has anything to do with like you know the build that 510 thread cartridges have as opposed to this one I mean at the other day they feel like they're both pretty similar you know they both have wicks in there ceramic whatever blah blah blah but I always feel like whenever I'm hitting a cartridge it's just a whole different type of like hi than I'm getting a whole type of different experience and then when I hit a pod system it's just it's satisfying for a short amount of time and then I feel like it's just I just get tired of it so that's why I'd rather choose a 5-10 thread over a frickin pod system goes one thing that I think both you know both the pod system and a 5-10 thread cartridge have their you know their negatives also so I don't know if you guys know but when you get to the bottom of a cartridge I there's always a little bit of oil up and in the pods it's significantly less as opposed to 5 10 third cards you can either way you're still losing oil it gets stuck up up at the top and I feel yeah that's maybe something that both a pod system and a cartridge system you know can both fix because with the with the holes right there it's the same thing as a pod it has a small hole right there and there are times where you just get stuck in the little crevice in between the cartridge and the hole so that's kind of a downside of both of matches [Music] dude I don't know they nailed this flavor like I keep talking about this imperial extracts cartridge but it's actually so satisfying it's my first time ever trying this limoncello it's like this is gonna be my daily driver from now on for sure screech this guy's discreteness is something that a lot of people have to deal with now it is because they don't want people knowing what they're doing and I don't know I guess nowadays everybody knows because it's 2020 you know you can't really if they see it they are gonna know automatically what it is it's been all over the news you know the cartridges have been blasted literally all over the news so people know exactly what it is so there really is no keeping it discrete but if you if you somehow find a way I feel like the most one to keep discrete would probably have to be this one because you could kind of pass off if you put it on a little on the slimmer batter you can maybe pass it off as a jewel you know take the little California weed sticker on and then boom there you go it looks kind of like a jewel and there's something they actually do have paws that are actually very very clear so you know it kind of pulls you a little bit closer to the Julian type of [ __ ] so you can pass away with very very you know look at being very very discreet is what I'm saying at the end of the day it's actually really really hard to choose which one I like better you know paws versus cartridges but if I really really had to choose I think I would just have to go with a cartridge itself like I was saying because you can endlessly switch variable wattages on this one man the hits the hits on a cartridge just hit way different as opposed to a pod man my experience is you know I'm a big long time cartridge user so it speaks for itself man it speaks for itself cartridges are you know my go-to I know that's really crazy to say and people always talk [ __ ] to me about like you know I do why do you smoke so many cartridges and like I mean now now in 2020 I've actually you know slimmed it down quite a bit I've actually been smoking a lot more deaths and I'm weed but before that I was cheating on a cartridge almost I was going through cartridges literally like two to three days but that's how crazy it was so yeah I guess 5-10 thread cartridges wins for me of us over pot systems don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the good old pot system you know they do their thing they come in clutch when when they need to so with that being said guys 510 thread being the winner let me know in the comments below what do you guys think which one do you guys like a better DEA's like 510 thread or do you guys like pods and yeah let me know if you guys have ever tried imperial extracts especially this lemoncello man is super freaking fire so I'm gonna go ahead and end out the

have the gelato live resin uh pax pod from avitas avitas is a kraft uh oil concentrate vape cart company based in washington and oregon gelato i picked this out it's one of my favorite strains of flour got this at the reef on capitol hill in seattle yeah so let's just get into it um i don't know how well you can see the oil color but it's a good it's it's a nice golden yellowish with a little orange tint to it looks a little more orange in the camera there but it looks more yellow uh in the light slap it on the pax pod first hit very great taste full full taste it's a little more fruity than gassy you know gelato's kind of a mix well it's a hybrid and so sometimes you know the gassier side sometimes you'll be on the fruity side this is um definitely it's a little gas it's smooth but it's it's it's a little bit more on the fruity side i guess i would say um no it's a great taste and great taste right out the gate gelato is one of my favorite flower strains again but oftentimes when i get in vape cartridges the first i don't even know 10 to 20 hits out of the cartridge it's like comes off as spicy often honestly gelato's one of my favorite strings to buy flower wise and i usually stay away from it in the vape cart game um even if i enjoy the cart it's like the first 10 to 20 hits i really don't enjoy i enjoyed both of these out the gate like on the first draw i could taste it in my nose before i even blew any vapor out of that that's great single origin hybrid live resin uh 72 percent cannabinoids 44 thc 23 thc a point one two percent cbd cbd a point zero four three percent um terpene profile thirteen percent they break down everything um yeah that's really all of the information that you could want flavor i didn't even taste it uh uh review it on the flavor and jumped right in the packaging um but on the flavor off top uh i'm gonna give this a nine out of ten um again for to be able to taste it a meat tastes good immediately on the first hit being a gelato strain where historically i haven't been a big fan of those you know that's a big winner to me um it is a little more like fruity than a little bit of the balance of like the gas which i know is a little bit harder to transfer into a vapor product than a flour but just a little bit more of that probably would have put it to a 10. it's still again a nine that's a great taste this is something i buy again where again i you know i said historically i kind of stray away from gelato vape cartridges so give it a 9 out of 10 on taste when it comes to the the overall score again i mean all information single source which which matters and to be labeled on there um you know packaging looks great uh you know live resin product i mean i'll probably i'd give this a nine out of ten 10 overall yeah again 9 out of 10 on on flavor 9 out of 10 overall it's a great product avitas does a good job packaging and sourcing good product i feel like they're they're they're someone you can trust when you're going to buy their vape products you can trust that they're putting quality material in", "2k_GrYX_3eg": "uh you know what is good YouTube it is your boy sub BG back in again with another fire ants review for you guys so for today's review guys man we got something this this brand right here has been dominating the game in my opinion for one of it for over the past two years man and it's been dominating the games in terms of super crazy-ass taste so super turkey things flavorful men and every single time I consumed this cartridge man I'm never let down ever so but they ended up releasing a new line that they wanted they have been they have been trying to push out to people but it hasn't really been working because you know most people are just stuck on their basic old batteries and things like that and people are just too scared to evolve man people are that's one thing people don't another reason why people don't try out new products man they're scared to evolve they're scared to get away from the need from the old from the things that they're used to you know things like that man and that's why I'm here today man I'm about to put you guys on game with one of the hottest devices on the market I'm assuming I'm assuming because what I was told about this device man it's supposed to be revolutionary right I personally have never tried this specific product and it's but in this specific format so you guys in myself are gonna be the first the first eyes to ever see how this is how it hits how it tastes if it's even worth buying the extra battery all that good stuff so but today's the video got is we got the [ __ ] champ in we got the Jeep in with the raw garden Jeep NGO and we're about it or about to be chiefin on this man so I got a hit up by a jeep in telling me because I guess I wanted me to review the battery just because you know raw garden and there's a bunch of other companies like cookies field extracts and a bunch of other ones that I can near the top of my head right now that have already been releasing Jeep in pods and you know and Jeep has just been labeled ooh what the hell why is no one behind this bro so you know your boy had to hook them up one time with the review see if it's even worth it so right off the bat we got a brand new battery right here this is the Black Edition one and this one came out to like 20 bucks not too bad right I'm pretty sure you could probably get it for cheaper maybe a little bit more expensive so rip the top off throw that to the side see it let's say you guys are seeing a full unboxing right here right so you slide out the case boom nothing else in the box just comes this little case right here you got the Jeep in itself it's actually right off the bat dude it's actually pretty heavy actually pretty freakin heavy for a pen knocking a lot so she penned you it looks really really sleek though it kind of reminds me of like like the big dizzy battery like at least the finish right it's going then back here you got your charging cable hopefully this thing is charged already man because I do not want to go through the hassle of having to charge of this so right here next next on the list we got the banana funk by raw garden this one right here sitting at 436 milligrams at EC that equivalent to a 7 point 33 percent so this thing's kind of high up there man I believe that the cross system is I actually have it pulled up on my phone the crosses for this is um dosi punch banana og and triangle Cushman those three strings I've tried literally every single one of those strains specifically by itself so I can only imagine how this one's gonna taste so opening up the box and here you get a little little tube right here a little G tube and it's there's actually nothing else in here so let's go ahead and turn that off inside the packaging by the way is top notch not gonna lie so right here you get your G pen case thumb screw that I put this down I don't know how am I supposed to get this out but what the heck it's literally stuck in there how am I supposed to get this out it's Meghan Hank okay you literally have to shake that [ __ ] out so alright alright let me get it let me go ahead and give you guys a little close-up because this thing is actually pretty freaking dope so give me one second alright so this right here is the G pen G I know it's really really hard to see because it's very very small pond the bottom right there it says banana funk and it has a rock garden logo and it has a weed sticker on it and the oil on this one is a little bit darker than what I'm used to tell you guys the truth so we'll see how it tastes oh man alright guys so now that you saw that a little close so let me know what you guys think of the oil this isn't an old batch it was back in like what was it three officially three months ago it was packaged so it should not be this dark I don't know what it is but yeah hopefully it's not bad so on the bottom right here I seek I think this was supposed to be wickless I'm not two hundred percent sure if this is a wake or not but yeah I heard this was supposed to be wickless if anybody knows in the comments below let me know so pop this [ __ ] in here I'm not really too sure if it matters what way you pop it in imma go ahead actually think I might have this take out the sticker but I'm gonna go ahead and take off this stick because it was look he just get you stuck on there so alright here we got the Jeep end you got the raw garden right here connected and honestly looks pretty freakin sleek it looks very very sleek you can't you can't see the oil in there it looks more like a vape than anything so let's go ahead and take a hit and see how how it tastes compared to a regular garden cartridge if it's if it's even worth spending the extra twenty dollars on it on a Jeep and battery you know just to get these pods so let's go into if you guys are 18 number 21 and over let me know in the comments below what you guys are chiefing on man let me know if you guys have ever tried that the Jeep ngo's with the raw garden or the cookies so and let me know what you guys experience was so cheers guys yeah oh [ __ ] my Haim this wrong bro okay so it's supposed to go all the way dude I just had it connected barely any like literally bro my brain is gonna get fried all right guys I'm sorry so here we go Jeep NGO the second attack my second attempt actually I think this is the third attempt so let's go ahead and take a hit on this in the finally ooh so right off the bat it doesn't it doesn't give you that lung expansion it doesn't give you that like oh [ __ ] bro in like you know instant Philly took off and it's it the taste is a hundred percent different I maybe need a slight hint of banana funk or dozy punch your triangle cuz whatever the case is but I don't know I don't know how I feel about this off of that first hit man hopefully we can get some better flavor hopefully I just happened you know what does he call it the coat it and then get better flavor so cheers guys alright that was a better hit yeah that was a way better hit who so right off the bat like I was saying it oh jeez Louise man that thing hit so you obviously have to prime the coil or the wick whatever it is right here on the bottom because the first hit isn't going to be the most tasteful and honestly those cons were pretty decent for a couple hits i honestly how to have one like one complaint and it's possibly you know changing the variable wattage but then again that kind of you kind of have to put in perspective all right why would you have to change the variable wattage wouldn't they have their own pods so i'm assuming these pods have only a certain take only a certain amount of temperature and then you know that's why it's compatible with the with their own system so you're not going to be getting too burnt of a taste or no i'm not even a burnt taste button you're not gonna be a too high of a hit or too low to it so that that's kind of it like i like it but at the same time i don't you know I kind of wish I had that variable water so I could choose my heating my hits so banana funk let's go in for the third hit hmm I'm getting a little bit more hints of the banana now really getting too much of the dose you punch out on the exhale you get a lot of the triangle cush it's more of that og tapes that you get on the EXO and on the inhale you get more of the banana but honestly man I don't know what to say about this like my like I'm trying to I want to see positive things about but you guys know how it is man it's not good it's not good like so far the taste it doesn't compare I don't know if it's just this pod cyst this pot right here the banana funk one but it doesn't have that super tur penis you know that raw regular raw garden cartridges out and like I'm talking about that's the reason why I go to Ruger and that's the reason cuz it the taste is super Turkey you know you're gonna get Samantha once you try it and with this like I'm already three hit team and I just don't really I don't feel like I got my money's worth if that's what to say I tell you the truth but let's just keep chief your man see if I see if I mean maybe I just had to keep priming it you know maybe the first couple hits are weak but let's go ahead let's see how much oil has gone away right I'm kind of like this [ __ ] scares me bro this just scared me trying to do with this but honestly a decent amount of the top oil has already been used both and I just don't I don't know I don't know it kind of makes me mad cuz you know this was a total of 55 bucks so go ahead and take one more hit man it's going to take one more hit keep reviewing this thing maybe it gets better so cheers guys yeah man it's definitely this it's definitely the whole pin itself like RZ like I keep saying then people know raw garden for the potency for the for the high that it gives you for the flavours men and this thing right here this is supposed to supposedly like make it better you know make the experience better but I don't see it I'm not seeing him and I'm not getting that clouds that I would like I'm not getting the taste that I would like and you know and aside from that you have to spend 20 bucks on this [ __ ] pot on this Sun battery system so I'm kind of I'm nonetheless I am kind of disappointed you know because because of the overall the overall product itself it doesn't have variable wattage it doesn't taste as good as you know normal cartridges things like that so and it burns super freakin quick I know raw Gardens in general just very quick but yeah this is this is just very upsetting raw garden hopefully you guys stopped making these Jeep NGOs because they're definitely not work that worth of the extra money and GPM I don't know man he has got to do something better with this because honestly like your system is supposed to be revolutionary and it's definitely not revolutionary at all it's just another cartridge another pod system you know you fill me in people there's people already likes dizzy that are dominating that freaking that market so you guys it kind of makes sense why you guys aren't up there yet so Jeep NGO I would not spend the extra $20 I mean even though I already did I would not do that [ __ ] again I do not recommend anybody going out and doing that should you stick with the normal cartridges if you guys can so we're gonna take another hit off of this man and just go ahead and end this [ __ ] review up yeah you see but you have to drag that [ __ ] for too long to get a decent cloud bro and he still doesn't expand in the chest normally would like but it is what it is man not all cartridges can be good right so we're gonna go ahead and down this review here man she pinned you the battery itself zero come on Sarah ten I would just say maybe like a five out of ten and then it's a sleek design you know it's very very minimalistic but but I would not spend my [ __ ] extra twenty bucks on this one I already have a Z batter that probably hit two weight better than this and then um the cartridge itself raw garden I don't know what is up with you guys I don't know what thought process was going through his head when you guys found this [ __ ] but I do not recommend sticking with the G pen at all I just stick to your normal cartridges you guys are killing it like that and yeah that's my final review on this thing so the final cartridge review would probably be like five out of ten - so yeah if you guys have ever tried it like I said let me know in your comments in the comments below what your experience is with G pen if you guys like it if you guys hate it if you guys don't think it's worth the money let me know in the comments below I like interacting with you guys and if you guys enjoyed today's freaking video go ahead and leave a like comment and subscribe and we'll go ahead and catch you

actually the test reports for that batch fax is a hardware company that's been around in the cannabis space and we've been run for over ten years so we're not doing this we should millions and millions of other places around the world for the last three years or so we've been selling this device which is our era it's it uses pods that are prefilled by our brand partners with cannabis oil and today here we'll launch an era Pro there are Pro brings it to a whole new level it's a much more refined device we've you know added USBC charging and we've made the that control lights a lot bigger and things like that but the real big change here is that we've revised our plots so that they all have an NFC tag baked into the bottom of them our brand partners now essentially when they fill these with their cannabis oil they flash the pod with essentially what's in the pod with the lab report with the ideal temperature and a whole bunch of other information and so when you stick the pod into the device now it for example sets exactly to that within a degree of the exact right temperature that it should be consumed that so you really get the most out of the oil and when you use the mobile app I can show you some other cool stuff here as an example so I put that pot in and it immediately pulled up that this is a pod by our brand partner halo and it pulled up actually the test reports for that batch so this is literally a lab report for the oil that's in that pod all the terpenes all the cannabinoids and not just THC and CBD but actually all of the other cannabinoids that exist in there so users can start getting a sense of why is that they feel a certain way they can start looking for certain things it's hard to do with one hand but you'll notice come back out here I'll pull out this pod and to show you try to do this one-handed thanks and you'll see there you go different pot this is a pot by a company called abstract there you go and you can do their testing information so we have I think 500 lab reports or so in our system right now we're adding more every day and yeah it's a whole new system allows a lot of a lot of cool stuff I didn't even tell you about but that's the problem there isn't happen and even without the after you get that preset temperature you can actually override it if you like a different temperature you can kind of use this as a button and like change what temperature you want and then the pod remembers it so I left that on three petals if I take this back out and do whatever I want to put it back in it again it'll actually go back to that same three petals the pod remembers the temperature you like to experience it at it's pretty cool we're all about like transparency and control we want people to understand what they're consuming have a lot of control you can even lock it out so you hit the lock button and it locks it out so now it's like somebody picks us up and tries to vape it just flashes red and doesn't do anything you'd have to come back into the app in a locket so if a kid picks it up off your nightstand or whatever you're all good yep era Pro just launched today [Music] [Music]", "g_veY84iSJI":

[Music]", "FmzbyoqQi2Q": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another video if you've never seen me before my name is shaka uh shout out to all the people that have seen me and are subscribed make sure you subscribe make sure you subscribe but today you probably know from the title that i'm gonna be trying the pax era raw garden and then i got another raw garden that i'm gonna try too so we're gonna do a little bit of both but first i need to find a spot where i can hit the bong with real quick hella good man uh just got off of work guys sorry i say that a lot but i work every day pretty much monday through friday i'm off on the weekends and it's friday right now guys so i'm off now guys so got a little spot right here so let's take a [ __ ] rip [Music] that was a fat ass rip i couldn't get it the light right but um so i got the pax era the funny thing is the pax era is they're always a half gram and the half gram comes in a bigger box than the full gram regular foreground got the uh blue berry is that how you pronounce it b-e-a-r-y berry i don't know berry berry you guys got the name but um i had to just try it out because it's something new and i feel like you guys would love to see it and i've been sitting on a pax era battery for the longest and i haven't been using it shout out to my boy nick he gave me that [ __ ] way back back when game of thrones was still [ __ ] playing it was the last season and every sunday we was watching game of thrones smoking halloween drinking those were [ __ ] good times guys it was good [ __ ] times but um give me a minute and i'm going to put the packs and the other raw garden on there so we can compare see if they look different i'm not gonna say think they look different like you know the texture the color or anything of the actual oil because it is raw garden i don't think it's a raw garden pax era collab type thing but usually pax era their stuff is usually a darker consistency all right guys i just wanted to show you guys real quick the color of the wax show you what it looks like hopefully you guys can see it on the pax era you can barely see it because it was just a half gram but it looks pretty much like this because i mean it is raw garden guys so it's probably nothing different except the strain it's a dosy punch the pax area is dosy punch and the other one is blueberry blueberry so let's try it out guys so let me try this packs for oh okay damn taste it has that good raw garden taste guys it's very potent i like this i like the flavor on this it has a very fruity exhaled flavor bro that's just mad let's try the uh the blueberry so [Music] she got me she got me guys so i honestly think the blueberry tastes better flavor-wise [Music] but the pax era is very smooth and nice and like honestly if they make the only thing i would say is bad is they don't make full grams for pax era they don't make they only make half grams if they made full grams i would buy it more not saying i'm not going to buy more because i have a battery i'm probably going to buy more but i just like getting full grams not half grams but hopefully they come out with a full gram for this [ __ ] man we'll see what happens because it's actually pretty good but um with the pax era too also you can lower the temperature and it makes it taste way better i think so in my opinion what do you guys think do you guys like temperature temperature control or do you just like to be able to just pull in whatever the temperature is whatever usually super hot so you can get super thick smoke but um yeah guys i was just going to show you guys these two real quick because it's a [ __ ] game changer for the people that love packs you know they can finally get raw garden so shout out to the people that [ __ ] with pax i might do more pax reviews now too since i have the battery i can do them i just i don't know why i've never did them to begin with but now i can do them so i hope everyone's having a good day have a good friday have a good weekend guys um more videos coming sorry this is just me chilling at my house i might go out and do some other um go out and do a vlog you know outside of my house very soon so if you guys want to see that stay tuned subscribe like comment follow my backup page when i

mccready's biden's pick for drug czar is a bit out of the historical norm we're gonna tell you why uh jay speaking of history is gonna give us a little cannabis history lesson and uh jay you've also got a little bit of business news right for those who follow canna business um we've got all of that and so much more thanks a lot uh folks for coming and joining and sitting down or driving or whatever you're doing but listening most importantly to our humble podcast thank you and welcome to another episode of votepro podcast um we're gonna get started with um some inside the beltway news what about that sounds good but first let me just interrupt no please do can you see we we do this on zoom so he's looking at it see what i got today i just got this what it is i don't know i'm going to say it this i bought a cartridge a vape cartridge from my vape store in virginia which is not thc it's just this is right delta 8 thc have you heard about it that's the big craze now there's a little loophole in the law delta eight is very close to delta nine which of course is what we all used to using to get high phc delta nine delta eight is a molecule a compound rather that's in the plant in the flower on a much smaller quantity but what happened when they passed the uh the hemp bill the farm act the farm bill whatever the hell they called it farmville making hemp 2018. what they what there's a loophole where they go in and they can pull the delta eight out of the flower and concentrate it and sell it and what it does is it gets you high but it's different from delta nine it's a it's a sister to delta nine gets you high but it's how do i explain it it's like you feel you realize you're high but you don't have that lack of focus you know how you get you know you do a couple bonuses you're always done and you're standing at the kitchen sink or you have the refrigerator open for like 15 minutes why am i standing in the time thing you don't get that and you don't get the paranoia so anyway you can buy this now legally and it's pretty interesting pretty easy now so so you're enjoying the effects of the delta i took a couple hits before the show so let's see how that goes but no i've tried it and it's a uh it's hard to explain it's not like a stone thing like what you're used to smoking a joint or something but it you feel it do you feel a physical uh sensation you feel a little bit of that euphoric kind of i feel good thing and i feel relaxed wow yeah but i don't have that like what time is it man so anyway i just thought i'd throw it out there for those of you what did i come to the kitchen for again you know what i'd love if some people would write us write us you know podcast that's pod pod cast at votepropot.com let us know what you think of delta eight i'd be interested to see yeah let's get a little bit of i didn't mean to interrupt your very important up-to-date political news phil i just don't patronize me man okay go for it no i'm kidding we've got two separate bills that now these are both been introduced into the house and senate before but uh didn't go anywhere and as we know when the senate was controlled by the republicans senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is not in a rush to get any of these things done that's for sure so they've been reintroduced and there are two of them and i'm going to start with the secure and fair enforcement banking act it's called the safe banking act it was reintroduced this week by colorado representative ed perlmutter and this has got a lot of bipartisan support they're more than a hundred co-sponsors um and they're from both parties that's great and it's got a very strong chance of passing now what the legislation does uh would allow financial institutions to basically serve the cannabis industry without facing any federal penalties which many banks and credit unions they don't want to take on any cannabis clients because of these federal sanctions the fear of right um and what happens well they have to operate on a cash basis and crazy and it's it's a pain in the ass and dangerous i mean these guys are walking around millions of dollars right yeah they're vulnerable to all kinds of crime and it complicates you know they've got all this financial regulation compliance and it's just so complicated on a cash basis it's just it's not worth anybody's time in the financial world i don't know who on the republican side is sponsoring it but it might be uh kevin kramer do they have a fair amount of republican support yeah they've got strong republican support i think it will pass i i have a feeling it would have passed if if mcconnell had ever you know dated to to put on the floor um but that's hard to say but it's a good bet to pass now um promoter said uh quote it's time to enact safe banking to align federal and state laws and reduce the public safety risk in our communities and and that's true and uh we're just inching our way towards some sleep legalization this is inching our way this is this now this is in the house um and a similar bill is expected to be introduced in the senate next week i don't know who is going to sponsor it but um that's that's the scuttlebutt the other bill is um called the claim act and again this is how i don't know how they come up with these acronyms but it's the the clarifying law around insurance of marijuana act you know it is what it says now what what it would do is it it basically keeps the federal government out of the insurance uh uh out of the penalties for insurance companies covering cannabis industry firms um it just would prohibit it it would are they penalized now yeah you can be penalized simply for offering coverage oh my god to uh to a cannabis firm and and uh and and the same thing as the same lines as the banking yeah and the same line as the banking it's a sort of a financial industry and um it would also now there's a lot of provisions of this bill but it would also the other thing is it would require the gao uh the government accountability office to study and to report on any barriers that are being imposed barriers to the marketplace to financial services licensing any of that stuff the gao will be responsible to keep tabs on this and make sure that this all flows smoothly and and people are not being unduly burdened and the senator on the democratic side who is sponsoring this is bob menendez of new jersey and on the republican side is rand paul of kentucky well rand paul's a libertarian right so he's always going to be on the side of getting the government out of your face that's right and he said here's what he said the principles behind the claim act are simple respect the voices of the states and their people and stop shutting out legitimate businesses from obtaining basic protections ah how do you argue with that you know how do you argue with that right yeah exactly so why are they doing this doing this being federal legalization in such an incremental way why don't they just if they're gonna take the time to pass all these bills why don't they just pass a bill that says it's legal you know why all these little incremental baby steps yeah that's that's the way government works as well the the old saying is that politics is the art of the possible yeah so they're doing what they can what they can yeah well you know what the uh with the makeup of the congress and the white house being what it is they have an opportunity why are they doing this all piecemeal i really don't know because they can but they but they're doing what they can i guess send us your thoughts at votepropot.com contact or send us an email at podcast votepropot.com and please give us a 5 star rating on apple podcasts if you'd like to be part of the show call our message line at 240-257-2441 remember we had on um we had on a guy i don't know maybe a year ago or a little less than a year a fellow by the name of warren bobrow oh i remember warren well he had a great time with oren yeah a lot of fun he's a he's a big wig in the industry you see him on tv and you see him all over the place he uh he writes for forbes magazine he writes for forbes and a bunch of other magazines uh on cannabis and he's also known as the cocktail whisperer that's right and he was on the show uh to talk about a lot of things but one of which was promoting a new line of uh infused beverages he has which i believe are out now called claws k-l-a-u-s oh cool yeah so this is a story out of there i suppose with a k yeah the original version right um this is a story out of marijuana business daily by bart shannon and the title of the story is how are cannabis infused beverages doing in the market basically sales of the cannabis infused beverages are up 40 last year as companies sought to capitalize our new marijuana customers seeking a familiar form of consumption and those looking for an alternative to drinking alcohol okay according to data from seattle-based cannabis analytics firm headset sales of marijuana infused beverages increased 40 last year versus 2019 recreation and recreational markets such as california colorado nevada oregon and washington state cannabis infused beverages rose from 67.8 million to in 2019 to 95.2 million in 2020 wow so that sounds like a pretty significant growth does to me but what you have to realize is the overall industry grew 40 too so they grew kind of you mean the overall cannabis industry or the overall beverage industry cannabis okay all right but they didn't lag behind so that's good right they're at the same 40 growth despite the strong growth of infused beverage market um there's a small port there's still a small portion of the overall mix they're about one percent one percent of the entire cannabis sales are beverages now that kind of surprised me i thought it would be a little better than that but this year they're at 1.2 percent 2021 so far so david they're edging up a little it might seem obvious but kind of the marketing idea i think for most of these companies is that you've got a lot of people who are new to cannabis yeah either have never tried it or haven't in a long time and some of them are a little cautious about rolling a joint or doing a bong hit or buying a dab rig you know right but it's easy to buy a drink pop a top and drink it another thing is they say that um this is again how they're marketing it it's much more acceptable but let's say you get a cocktail party with a bunch of friends somebody lights up a joint right everybody turns around and looks what the hell is going on yeah right you know what i'm saying it's like but but if you go to the refrigerator and grab a can and crack it and pour it into this i'm just gonna give it a second thought nobody thinks about it so they're thinking that's kind of the uh the whole idea so so it's a kind of a social fit in type of a thing social acceptability now here's the question um you've had cannabis infused beverages before i don't recall that i ever have um i understand they don't taste so great well again that was warren's that was warren's deal that he was going to produce something that really was good he's written six books on making drinks yeah and he says that he has come up with a formula and a way to infuse drinks and market them that taste delicious we have not i have not seen his drinks i think they're in can uh california yeah i don't think they're available in maryland or virginia or virginia yeah no but i would like to try some clothes me too me too i have had a couple of different uh and and i've they're fine if you the kind i've had or you put a little cap full and you drink the capful like fruit punch or something so it's like a little five hour energy or something i have not tried like you know one of the seltzer drinks where you're going to drink 12 ounces right i don't know what that's like i wonder how much [Music] thc is in one of those salts or drinks it varies a lot of them are actually um making them fairly low like five to ten yeah yeah so that you know you can drink a couple socially and not get hammered you know right and uh i think that's kind of the intent i mean why would you buy a drink that's 40 or 40 milligrams or something you know they're five and you can drink two or three and and get a little buzz and it comes on slowly and that's one of the things they talk about in this article was some of the people are cautious about china because it takes a while for it to kick in yeah so there's a couple of uh manufacturers who claim to be coming out with products that kick in in between five and 15 minutes well that would be helpful i think yeah like you have a glass of wine or a drink you know and you feel it and yeah 10 minutes later you know how it's affected you right and the problem you you and i both know that edibles is sometimes you it's an hour an hour and a half and you don't think you've gotten any effect from it and you drink six of them so the drink the drink market is doing well but it's not blowing the doors off anybody so uh you know good luck to uh to warren and all the all the manufacturers anybody have any experiences with some of these cannabis infused beverages love to hear from you bye he's the president oh right the president um i've heard of him yeah been around a little while he has been busy you know setting up his administration and uh we've been sharing some of that with you in the last few segments or last few episodes this week um and this is an article from marijuana moment um which i love by the way there's all kinds of great stuff um about his top pick what a lot of people believe is his top pick for the director of the federal office of national drug control policy aka the drug czar and rahul gupta is the leading candidate for the position of drug czar he was the former chair of the west virginia medical cannabis advisory board um and he served on biden's transition team what makes gupta a little different is that he has actually publicly recognized the therapeutic benefits of cannabis whoa that's encouraging yes he has really and and he has and he worked in west virginia with the control board advisory board on a legal cannabis program so to authorize medical use of of marijuana so um that's a little bit different take on a drugstore you know drug czars are usually the enforcement czars saying no no but this uh rahul gupta may be if he's picked he may be ready to break that mode what an interesting what an interesting pick seriously what does that say well i i think the the what how do you read those tea leaves you know i don't know because the sum total of biden's picks um since really mixed messages right there was that's my point the other one uh uh oddly enough also named gupta of anita gupta um who was uh confirmed i believe as the assistant attorney general is not in favor of legalizing or decriminalizing drugs she just said flat out and we told you about that last week merrick garland who was confirmed as attorney general may be a little less strident about it we just don't know so i mean up and down the biden administration i i just i'm not getting any strong indication uh of a pro-cannabis bent from these folks although i'm not getting an anti-cannabis spent either so i mean that's something yeah it could be a couple things could be just that that's just not a priority for them and that's not one of the things that you're looking at on the resumes of these people or because drugs are you with things drugs are that's what i was going to say but drugs are a guy who's very pro that seems to that kind of i don't know well i think it's it's it's encouraging if if you're going to read anything into those leaves exactly whatever whatever kind of leaves that you want it's encouraging we but again wait and see the odd thing is that the the drugs are the director of the on dcp is required by federal law to oppose any legalization effort of any drug banned under the controlled substances act so i don't know where he's gonna fit or or what's gonna happen but instead of a dilemma he's in there but maybe it's time for that law to go as well so yeah um let's let's let's hope got a new segment we're gonna try this out all right on a regular basis we're going to do a little piece on history history is related to cannabis last week we did a little something on on the beatles yeah and uh cannabis remember i got a 100. thank you you did i got both questions right i think the idea is to we'll cover a lot of different topics you know events that occurred you're not going to quiz me again are you i might have a question for you yeah uh but you know just just it could be anything it could be 2 000 years ago the chinese and what they did with it it could be you know how marijuana became illegal in the united states in the 30s we'll cover all that but we're going to start out with something fun this week and that's cheech and chong all right so are you really mad all right well you know there's a lot more to cheech and chong i think than what people assume by the characters they played well the characters we grew up with the characters we grew up the stereotype stoner you know many people suggested that you know that they were detrimental to the cannabis movement because you know they they created this stereotype the stoner stereotype they they defined what the stoner is i disagree with that oh i heart will heartily disagree with that do you good because i would argue that chieftain strong did the exact opposite that they through their comedy kind of shined a spotlight on the culture of the 60s and 70s and part of that counterculture was cannabis now and as much as anything they made fun of it exactly but if you look at cannabis and the way that cannabis was perceived the use of cannabis before cheech and chong before the 60s right before the counterculture it was the reefer madness thing right our parents generation the 50s the 40s and before yeah they believed that people that used cannabis were you know mexicans black people yes and that they took it it was like heroin and it made them go crazy and rape women this is what people believed and i think they opened the eyes in some ways them and others right through their comedy and just regular dudes yeah and just to get a perspective of what they did cheech and chong the ones that you hear on the records in the movies and the stage were actually two really hard-working really intelligent comedy writers performers yeah they created these characters you know and there's not unlike what you know uh three stooges or you know the lord or something exactly you know it's a character to make fun of and laugh at right but the stoner characters that they portrayed was an artistic creation it was just something they did them that was funny and and it was a vehicle one one of many i mean he listened to their records they had all kinds of characters kinds of stuff that's right right cheech marin said in an interview that he never smoked pot while he worked ever not once not when they were on stage doing comedy not when they were making movies or records oh i believe it he wouldn't be able to this guy was really smart he went to i'm talking about cheech he went to uh cal state at northridge and he was an english literature major oh yeah and he only he dropped out eight credits short of graduating to run to vancouver canada to avoid the draft vietnam to avoid the vietnam draft and that's that's that's where he met uh tommy tommy who's the canadian right exactly not only that cheech was this cracked meal he was a member of the five sigma kappa fraternity sure why not if you ever listen to an interview he's a smart dude he went on the first uh jeopardy uh celebrity remember that celebrity oh he knocked it out he kicked the ass of no other than cnn's anderson cooper crushed him crushed him didn't just beat him and crushed him but he's a smart dude yeah um so anyways a little history the guys met the two of them met in 1968 in vancouver and marin was uh delivering carpets and he met tommy chong tommy was a musician and he was running an improv group in a strip bar that his family owned and so he talked marin into joining this and they after a while doing the the the stuff they became a stand-up duo right and they became quite popular in vancouver and they decided they've kind of done all they could do in vancouver they said let's go to la they went to la and they were discovered in clubs there by no other than lou adler now those of us who follow music know whoever is he was a huge producer he owned the roxy right he owned uh uh a couple of those clubs on the strip oh yeah couple clubs of strip he owned um dunlap dunlap dunhill records he started that record company huge record label he did he produced tapestry yeah one of the biggest selling albums of all time yeah he saw them in a club said hey let's make a record they're like a record yeah let's make a comedy record right so like in 1970 they made their first album which did really well it's just called uh chichen chong 71 and they followed up in 72 with an album called big bamboo that's right big bamboo and that began yeah well that was the biggest selling comedy album in history at the time yep and then their third album won a grammy so i had that one that's right after they had all that success with records they decided we need to make a movie right well so they put the script together they went around a bunch of a bunch of the studios in la nobody would do it nobody that that was too controversial a couple stoners it's not gonna be fun it was stupid you know um so what happened is paramount lou adler worked with paramount and they said paramount said hey what we'll let you use our studio and our facilities but we're not going to finance it so they financed themselves they were eating peanut butter and sandwiches by the time they finished that movie they spent every penny they had yep making that making up and smoke up and smoke which was huge yeah i think they spent a few hundred thousand which is nothing for me it grows like 50 million or 45 million uh so they did really well yeah so that's kind of their history and they actually split up at some point and i think they're mid 80s yeah a little bit of a falling out and they each went their own ways actually cheech had a very successful solo career in television oh yeah he was a regular on uh one of those cop shows well no cheech was on the cop show nash bridges nash bridges right tommy chong was on uh the one with tim allen what was that show uh home improvement home improvement yeah yeah that's right so they they they had a little bit of a falling out and uh and they did get back together eventually and and that they made an appearance on the late show as stephen colbert in 2018 in a response to john boehner remember boehner sure he was a republican uh speaker of the house and he left he left congress and he became he found himself on the board of a big marijuana a cannabis entrepreneur now yeah yeah so they went on to talk about that and they expressed their displeasure that uh marijuana was no longer rebellious and i i love this quote i'll finish up with this cheech said that um he could now buy weed from a store in a strip mall when we used to have to buy it from behind the store in the circle so anyway i think cheech and chong did a lot to kind of reverse the stigma and kind of make it fun yeah light-hearted make you realize that it doesn't make people who use it murderers and rapists and addicted like regular people just regular guys now you may remember this back in junior high school jay and i have known each other since then yeah that's right we had our junior high school had a very good basketball team and we would have pep rallies each start of each season and one year we had a pep rally do you remember michael alexander oh yeah tall skinny black skinny guy he did they did a version of basketball jones which was a big it was huge he he had a basketball with him and he wrote the words on the basketball in pen in case he forgot them and he played what was the character's name tyrone shoelaces that's right and i think a lot of the teachers had no idea right [Music] that was like early 70s man yeah yeah yeah 73 74 something like that here's the final final question all right let's see how let's see how your trivia is one question for you their first film as we said was up in smoke what year was that film released 76 77 78 or 79. 78 bam you're good man nailed it yep i just you know remember where i was when it came out that's great that's great all right so i'm three for three on one and the thing about tommy chong is you know when i when i wanted to learn how to do the a canadian accent or those kind of i i listened to tommy chong is that right oh yeah man you know he's got one of the best canadian accents out there you know i never even know what he's talking about but you know he's got a great one well it's funny because cheech marin does the best like hispanic southern california compton accent yeah but that's how he speaks at all but yeah well he doesn't normally speak but i guess that's how what he was brought up on but he was but the two of them man well what a great comedy team some of the best comedy ever guess that just about does it for us this week we are glad that

welcome to true buds TV for a vape comparison the pax era forced a toki 510 the first vape of its kind wireless charging shoutout to toki for bringing this video to you i'm gonna be comparing these two because you know I love the PAX and I recently got the Toki and I love the Toki I was honestly very anti 510 I'm like [ __ ] 510 their shitty they're annoying they're not durable but Toki has helped show me something else here so let's get into comparing them yeah you know the pact is cool it's versatile I love this thing I carry it everywhere and they both have their you know pros and cons I would say this thing has a lot of pros to hear the Toki 510 but let's start in with the pax era first so the pax era has its own pods this is cool and it's also kind of a bad thing I mean the pods are great but they are typically more expensive I'd say 5 to 10 even sometimes 15 $20 more expensive than your typical 510 carts which adds you know a little more money on with that they have this in here I've showed you in the other video there's two spots there that's a double wick which is kind of a primitive way if you will say so as technology progresses which is interesting for the PAX because they're so technologically driven but they're still using a wick system which is interesting to me I feel like they should have gone more for the ceramic vibe that toki has because they heated up via the ceramic elements but the wick is cool but I'm just questioning like I'm just thinking of this now during this video like I love this thing has an app that can go with it and you can turn the heat up and you can adjust it on there I never use it to be straight up with you but that's cool like that's I'm just surprised I didn't decide to do a better element in there now let's talk about the Toki 510 here got just like a little circles cartridge in here also has three temperature settings you you know one two three change the set instead of the wick element has a ceramic heating element which is what mosa is the best in the game you get the best flavor you get the best burn you get the best heat retention and that's why I'm loving to Toki I know there's other 510 threads out there that have the heat settings but I this is the first one I've had the Toki that has those settings I just like how sleek it is to I also just really like that go check out the other videos I've done for Toki like the unboxing and stuff because I got pretty amped up there so we're looking at these two and we're saying like you know what's the difference wick versed ceramic 510 verse cart so you're gonna be able to find more 510s in less of these packs cards especially if you live somewhere where it's more low-key you know it's cool - besides the fact that it's the ceramic elements has the different heat settings is that like I have never charged anything wirelessly I have tried I had an iPhone 7 I bought a wireless charging pad and I couldn't charge it and I was wondering why I didn't realize it didn't have that qi tech like the toki does so that's kind of my thoughts on these my overall what I'm how I'm personally gonna use them is this thing is gonna be my go-to especially when I'm at home if I want to run out and do something crazy maybe it'll work out and beat it up I'll bring the PAX with me with the wicks you know what I'm saying stay home get that good flavor is what the ceramic element also is doing as well they're also doing as well I said on a ceramic element it's interesting when you compare them because you could have the different cards and I'll actually that's a good idea I just had right now for a video is to compare different cartridges so have the same 510 in the same pax car the same g-pen car the same Stig cart if that is possible I know with the car game it's a little harder to get these because there are licensing deals in place to get that and that hence the extra dollar amount but I'm on a tangent I love them both I'm gonna enjoy the Toki 5 do you like to vape you", "-ZPhPI7Uq3k": "hi my name is vada I am vendor educator for item 9 labs today we're going to talk about the multiple award-winning and one of my personal favorites the Apollo 710 live resin pod system this system is unique and unlike anything else available in the market so far let's talk about it first of all what is life resin light resin is a concentrate extracted from fresh cannabis plants which were flash-frozen immediately after harvest and they were kept at freezing temperatures throughout the extraction these plants did not undergo the typical drying or curing process so by flash freezing freshly harvested plants the cannabinoids and turkeys of that plan don't get the chance to oxidize and agree we are freezing them to keep them intact kind of like those frozen vegetables that you see in the supermarket right they were frozen at their peak freshness to preserve their maximum nutrition in this case we are freezing these plants to preserve the phytochemicals of a living plant this is conducive to a couple of things one is that taste so living cannabis plants have a vibrant terpene profile but terpenes are finicky compounds and cannabis plants don't do a great job of preserving their own terpenes once they're harvested that natural degrading process begins but we froze the plant at that moment right at its peak freshness therefore preserving that vibrant original chirping profile and that festive aroma and scent and flavors of the plant right so when you take a puff of your Apolo pod you are tasting the original chirping profile of that specific strain now alongside preserving terpenes were also preserving cannabinoids right and what happens in our bodies when we consume a cannabis product that is rich in cannabinoids and turkeys the entourage effect right the idea that all parts of the cannabis plant work together to create that effect when we have multiple compounds of the plant working together to achieve common goals such as aiding with stress are helping with your pain they are working together at different angles in different ways in a different receptor sites right to achieve that goal it is the totality of the phytochemistry in that product that determines true potency right it's true potential of effects as opposed to when we consume an extract that has only one cannabinoid right a monomolecular extract such as for example a THC distillate when you have nothing but THC you're not gonna get many flavors because there aren't any terpenes and because there's only one can never know if that can happen it doesn't get to synergize or play with any other compounds right to work with any other compounds so we don't get that well-rounded effect that you can expect from full spectrum of products so that is life resin the Apollo pod is filled with 600 milligrams of our life breast and which we extracted in-house from our award-winning flowers the pod clicks into the Apollo 710 battery and it only works with that battery for a good reason the pod and battery system this technology was created specifically for life resin this extract is not the same as distillate right we have those finicky and fragile compounds in there and we want to preserve them so that you can continue to enjoy them so this battery has adjustable temperature settings that was created for this flavorful extract it was also built to minimize issues of clogging or inconsistent pulls so let's wrap it up with a bone okay so what's in the pot we have live resin which is extracted in-house from our flowers that is full spectrum so we'll invoke that entourage effect it is strain specific and it is 100% cannabis derive all in a pot system bag hits", "77nGxpeBzRQ": "PACS is the world's premium

connect the cradle and cord provided to your computer or adapter then place packs on the cradle to charge once pax is on the cradle watch for the pulsing white pedals the more pedals lit the more charge pax has pax is fully charged when all four pedals stop pulsing and turn solid now that pax is charged you're ready to get started remove the magnetic oven lid and pack with your loose leaf material the oven lid can be used to pack the oven it should be packed firmly for optimal flavor and vapor performance then place the oven lid back on the device pax comes fitted with a flat mouthpiece but also included is a raised option try both to find out which you prefer they're easy to switch out power on with a short press on the button located in the center of the mouthpiece your

same way never place the oven lid in alcohol if you'd like to clean the inside of the oven or the sides of the mouthpiece we suggest using a q-tip carefully reinsert the screen so it lies slightly bowed in the bottom of the oven and press down gently to secure before you replace the screen and mouthpiece make sure they're completely dry we recommend cleaning the device every few uses to optimise the experience there are times when you'll need to set packs down during use if you don't draw from or move packs for approximately 20 seconds the oven starts to slowly cool to preserve battery life and save your material once you pick up packs again or take a draw it automatically heats up back to your selected temperature setting keep in mind that if pax doesn't move or sense your lips for three minutes it will turn off completely so that your battery life is preserved when your device is on you can check the battery by giving pax a gentle shake the pedals light up to indicate

signs to look for when you're buying your own heavy hitters carts to see which ones are fake and which ones are real so let's go ahead and get into the video all right so there are five big signs to look for when it comes to identifying a fake over a real heavy hitters cart so I'm just gonna quickly go into each of those first up we have cold filtered at the top real heavy hitters carts that are sold as one gram cartridges do not say cold filtered at the top they just simply don't have that they just say all of this stuff so that's already a big red flag second red flag would be that California label on the inside of the box that I'm trying to show you guys that should not be there that should be blank and it should just have the hh4 heavy hitters on this silver foil type thing or the silver foil type paper on the inside of the packaging that California label that you see right there should actually be right here unauthentic heavy hitters packaging the third sign is right down here where you see the 2019 fluids manufacturing ink and all of that other [ __ ] that should not be there which should be there is this push to release embroidered into the Box where you have to tear it to open it you should not be able to open real cart boxes this easily because obviously that can make it easy for anyone to just put whatever they want into these boxes so the fourth sign would be right here where it says instructions that should actually say suggested use and then finally you have right here where it says Bubba cush that is not a strain that heavy-hitters offers in there one gram cartridges I'm gonna link the heavy-hitters website in the description but you can actually go there and see a list of every strain they offer so if your plug is trying to sell you one that's not on that list on their website then you know he's bullshitting you those are a few very quick signs that you can look at to see if you're gay faker a real heavy hitter skirt now I'm gonna go ahead and plug it into my battery take a few puffs on it to see how it tastes and see how it hits and I'll go ahead and come back tomorrow until you guys how the high is how it makes me feel and if these are even worth buying so yeah let's go ahead and get into that all right so the 710 carts that these heavy hitters are using are not DAB cap compatible unfortunately it's the same kind of tip that you can see in exotic carts it's sort of like a funnel but it's too small to actually clip on or not clip on but like attached itself to the dab cap so unfortunately I can't show you guys a rip through a rake but if these carts are actually decent I'll figure out how to do that for tomorrow so for now let's just go ahead and take a few puffs see how these cards taste and how they rip and I'll let you know my thoughts so cheers guys [Music] so off that rip I'm getting a bit of earthy taste it tastes kind of like dirt if I'm being honest it's not very pleasant but the smoke is really smooth and it doesn't really hurt my lungs while I'm hitting it so that's a good sign I'm gonna go ahead and take another rip and we'll see if I'm starting to feel the buzz off - so Cheers [Music] yeah I'm getting good cloud production on it I don't feel a buzz or anything but these are so it doesn't feel like a chore daf-2 puffs on this cart I'd actually definitely hit this thing all day so I'm gonna go ahead and do that I'll come back tomorrow and share my thoughts and we'll see if these cars are worth buying so I'll see you guys tomorrow all right guys so I'm going through so much [ __ ] to get this video done right now this is my third time recording this part of the video because the first time I recorded it I didn't press report the second time I recorded it I had a Miranda sings hairline so we cut that [ __ ] out I'm gonna leave the other half of this part in simply because like I don't want to re-record that I do not want to get that high again you'll see I was super fried during this F um and I look terrible but anyway so things I went over in the part where I had the bad hair line so I've used this hurt for two days now and I used it for two days because I didn't think one day was enough to get like a good read on the highs of the potency and all the other good stuff I like to review oh and what got cut out was when I was talking about the potency it's really good four to five hits gets you a nice buzz six to seven hits gets you high and then if you get to nine hits then you might be slow to order in space like this current really does hit heavy even if it's not like a legit heavy hitters cart um and yeah now I'll go back to myself in the past um to finish off the video so see you guys oh yeah and the camera angles suck right now because my tripod literally just broke while I was trying to finish this video so you know we're just having fun it's a it's a great time book ago or I'm right but uh yeah so I'm ordering new tripod so I can fix my ankles again we might have to go back to the old recording area yeah so channel updates yay next up we have how long these cards last I have been using this card for two days now and it's about 1/4 of the way done so that means I would probably last around eight days if you're lucky um I've also been sort of with this cart not gonna lie but it does get me high for a long time so like being sparing is also easy with it my next point is the flavour and wax quality I know in my initial review of it I said it just tasted like straight dirt but after hitting it a few more times I can start of I can sort of start to taste more earthy tones like when you taste coffee um it doesn't taste exactly like coffee but it does taste sweet and earthy like a coffee beverage would um I would highly recommend getting this cart honestly like the wax quality is decent it's very slow-moving which was it like a good sign for me and unlike what the TKO cart even though it's slow-moving this one actually does hit really [ __ ] hard um if you guys have these around you and they look around the same like quality as these ones I would highly recommend picking them up I would set these up like right there with tanks and dab woods um easily an 8 out of 10 um I already filmed this review and I'm really high right now so it's kind of hard to like keep a steady train of thought but I think all I have it done for the second half is take hits on camera so let's go ahead and take two rips out of the battery then we'll go and take two rips through violet and then we'll end the video so thank you guys so much for watching if you made it this far please leave in the comments what your favorite cart brand is right now because I'm trying to find new brands to try I already have dragon's breath on my list um and I really want to try ROH soon um but yeah and please in the comments stop telling me to try likes dizzy I can't try Suzy's even though I really want to so every time you all tell me to try as dizzy I just died a little bit more inside um where I live we don't have like studies all right so I cannot try though thanks for the suggestions though I really appreciate it and if I do ever find its dizzy the first thing I will do is record myself dry again so um yeah let's go ahead and get into these rips guys Cheers yeah it just tastes really good and the hits are actually starting to be pretty smooth off of it too um when I first recorded it I coughed like a [ __ ] after all of my hits but now that I'm already high all these sets just feel smooth and it tastes really good so let's go ahead and take another hit Cheers my throat bout dry as [ __ ] so let me go ahead and drink some water and then I'll take another hit I hope y'all can see how high I am right now cuz I believe is [ __ ] fried right anyway so Cheers [Music] I tried I tried to do a ghost I don't know if it showed but yeah but we tried all right anyway let's go ahead and take a few ribs through violet and then I'll end the video so the hard part is trying to figure out how to smooth these through a dab cap so I'm gonna get behind the camera and just show you real close-up like the easiest way to do it so that in case you guys have a dab cap in these kind of tips you can smoke them through rigs too so to get this with a dab cap this is so hard to hold with one hand you have to like put the dad cap upside down and then you just have to like hold the car on top of it see if it'll focus and then you just have to hold the car on top of it like that and that way it funnels into the piece anyway I'll go ahead and show you guys I hit yeah so just for the record real quick this will be my third hit through violet off off this cart since I've started my smoke sesh um and I've probably taken five hits of the cart like on just trying to do this review and I'm already like this fried so that should just speak for the like potency of this cart alright the pink incident I didn't realize all right I know this next hit is gonna send me so I'm gonna go ahead and say peace right now thank you so much for watching and I hope you guys stick around my next video is gonna be sort of a channel update I think and I'm gonna be talking about this giveaway that I want to do but yeah leave them in the comments some ideas of it keep it kind of like under a hundred bucks or around 100 bucks cuz I'm just having to pay for this out of pocket so thanks again for watching all of my content thank you guys for subscribing and commenting and like my videos all of it means a lot to me and I do my best to respond to as many comments as I can but if I ever miss your comment just like comment again or something or like if you want you can hit me up on Instagram and Twitter like y'all are chill and I like having a community

I have any like women watching me then welcome to the channel as well thanks cheers guys [Music]", "XYoyw0MjBBY": "[Music] welcome to true buds TV it's your buddy Jack telling you what my favorite vape is we have a couple here first place is tied between this dizzy and the packs next we have the G pen these are my three portable go twos but if I was gonna say you have to choose one I would say either this dizzy or the PAX little bloom Farms in there and then I have an old pal in here I guess they changed it to a green tip I hadn't seen it but it's been awhile since I bought any vapes to be real with you I just stocked up on some flour so put the vapes to the side but we got a couple here and a Jeep in is still solid don't get me wrong it's still durable it's the heaviest out of all these these other ones are just as durable if not more durable though and they have a little bit our airflow they got more room for the air so these are the top two and if I had to choose one it would probably be the packs if I had to just because it has adjustable temperatures so you know you'd be like this shake it and then you put it one second yep I shake it before it's been a while see BAM there we are let's put it on the third-highest give me a little trouble pulling but still hitting good which brings me to my last here these the 510 threads I just don't really mess with them anymore they break in your pocket easily I know there's ones like there's something called like a low key it flips out but in general I'm just really not a big fan of these anymore by whoa maybe it broke oh well so yeah there might be something left in this dizzy no that's out but I would say right now let me see this again definitely rip it just sometimes you know especially like you just get one you don't realize how far it's going in you're through some serious [ __ ] also I've done videos for all of these besides this dizzy like individual review videos of the G pen and the packs I also did the G pen flower portable flower vape a review STIs dope though these are all solid and I've had all these for a little while now and I carry them around and they're durable as [ __ ] so order at the end of the day is gonna be packs number one dizzy number two it's out thank you for tuning in to a little vape edition I hope you liked this video trying to bring you some good audio it's kind of loud around here so got the news reporter Mike tonight damn that's that strawberry-kiwi from old pal tastes good do you guys they I know a bunch of you do since we've talked before but like what are your thoughts if you've had these or some other ones out of these three which one would you pick and I'm also trying to save you money if this is your first time watching this you don't really need all three to be real with you the only reason I did it is for content and they kind of put the products to the test it's that cool to have an extra few around throw them to a buddy or something you're

enjoy", "LX6LJ2fXyJU": "hey there happy Tuesday so today I'm gonna do another product review and this one I'm so excited about this is a vape that I bought recently at our dispensary it's called a Cresco vape and the strain is by oh Jesus and so by oh Jesus I was immediately drawn to it because of the name obviously it's just a very funny mental picture that it brings up for me so I bought it also it sounded very eastery so I was like well let's go with that this is an indica strain which means it's a little more relaxing on the relaxing side of things which is what I'm always looking for so the first thing I noticed is that it says it's a liquid live resin pen and I was like huh liquid live resin pen I've never seen those words together like that if that sounds like gibberish to you I can tell you a little bit about it liquid live resin pen it essentially means that it's from a fresh plant so I used to work in a little backstory I used to work as a harvester at a cannabis cultivation Center harvester tremor that kind of thing and I do know about live resin because of that so live resin is essentially a fresh plant so you go in the room you cut the plant down it's fresh you flash-freeze it you throw it immediately in a freezer and it preserves all those nutrients all those flavors everything is just fresh and frozen right away so it's kind of like if you harvested a bunch of vegetables like peas or carrots and then immediately flash froze them they're gonna be very fresh tasting and it's the same way with cannabis so this is from a fresh plant that's been frozen quickly and then made into a vape pen so I know that could sound like a lot of garbled e [ __ ] but basically what that means is that it's a very fresh taste taste very much like a fresh plant when it grows that's the difference so instead of it being cured and you know taking you know weeks to dry out it's just fresh and flash frozen so that's quick backstory but let me first just show you the vape pen itself so this is the vape here it's Cresco is the brand red is there a little branding for indica meaning relaxing and it has a tip here that lights up so when you stuck on at the end lights up and there's no buttons to it so if you're somebody that's new to the vape scene this is great it's a disposable pen and it's great because it's preloaded with cannabis oil and when you're done with it the end will just blink like hey this is done it'll just blink and you won't get any vapor out and you just throw this away or recycle it I'm trying to recycle things more so I like it because there's nothing to think about you don't have to load it there's no buttons there's no temperature it's extremely simple so all you do is literally open up your little childproof packaging up top take it out and then fake so that's what I love about these they're so discreet I keep one of these with me literally 100% of the time in the event that I start to feel like a panicky or have a panic attack luckily I don't really have that trouble like I used to but that's how I got out of it is I carried one of these with me at all times so I kind of think of these like an inhaler I know that's kind of a weird way to think of a vape but for me it's almost like an inhaler because I just take two quick seconds two breaths really quick and I exhale I feel way different so if you're looking for something that's like quick relief a vape is awesome it's pretty strong let me see here this one is doo-doo-doo 87% THC so that's pretty strong to give you an idea when you grow weed like just regular weed that you smoke and you see in movies usually that's about 30% THC is a good strain like a pretty pretty high strain 20 to 30% this one's 87 so you don't need much of it like a little hit I took earlier is all someone should start off with if you're new to this but I like it because it does save me a lot of money this was let's see 35 dollars and it'll last me at least a couple weeks maybe three weeks if I'm you know not using it too much but for me I like it because it just kicks in right off the bat and have to think about it it also doesn't really smell like there's a little bit of a weed smell but it's not like permeating my hair and my clothes and everything it's just a very discreet kind of thing so if you're you know looking for something that's easy to use not smelly go with one of these vapes for me this is seriously one of the tastiest wants trains I've ever had the bio Jesus train so if you have access to it highly recommend it great Easter strain I feel like you can't go wrong for me the effects are just very relaxing I feel a little more calm like I can just chill I feel a little more grounded those are some things that I attribute to this babe all right well that's my product review hope you're having a good day take care", "V2uTxxzvJf0": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good day to be all right guys

guys but the black the black label is just more clear it honestly looks like a goddamn slushy it looks like they like melted down some slushy like it's a little bit still I stop and they just put it in there but dude this frickin cosmic punch smells so good what's my smells better [Music] I would say overall the cosmic punch has more of a smell to it in this one this one really doesn't smell like one she just smells like a normal concentrate but it caused me go do smelt all good must try out these [ __ ] strains guys because I haven't took a freakin dad and so long cuz it's been a minute because I try to get an order for flower call like last week or something but it wouldn't it couldn't come in because of all the other things that are going on right now the rides the protests all the

[Applause] shoutout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video that's over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state I don't wanna show you my personal information alright yo what's up guys Ronnie ray back at you so this video is actually a video idea I came up with myself if you guys have any other video ideas you have for me like videos you want to see me make or like you think would be interesting to watch just time we don't blow in the comments and I get them out um I know there's some other different types of like your see what I'm about to do so in this video we already know about the title obviously in this video I'm doing snoozy vs. facts I think I said that right I don't know so dizzy facts that basically like if you guys know if you guys know Jules are there like THC Jules so I'm gonna be doing like this dizzy versus facts you wanna main kind of comparing the two going over which one I think is better in my personal opinion the pros and cons I guess you could say if you don't get it like when they have a good deal going on they can be expensive cuz I think the battery alone is like 30 bucks and then and then on like on the pod you get for it I they could be like between 30 to 75 bucks for just the pot alone so dependent yeah that's a pro and a con right there I'll go over that a little bit later but so the battery is like 30 bucks but sometimes I have viewers where if you bought like a pod you can get a free battery or some [ __ ] like that so that's actually how I got mine um about a forty five dollar pod and I got a free battery with it so 45 bucks for a pot and a battery is not really a bad deal I mean actually I got my car - well actually not really um I believe they had this deal all the time no not the dispensary that I go to but its dispensary I got these at like I actually got these um this dizzy starter kit I got this when I was in Vegas because they kinda hard to find in Arizona at least I this dizzy starter kit it says the battery I think the battery was $25 you bought it separate and then I believe these were like 45 35 I don't know I'm sorry um go watch my review on it and alright if you want to see the correct price I've I forget exactly I know the starter kit I paid 50 bucks for the battery in the car and I've been about 24/7 I think like all the time so so you have 50 bucks for a battery and then a half gram I mean that's not bad so what am i smoking on though before we hop into this um out of the out of the facts area and smoking on some gelato biochip so yeah it's by group concentrates tested at like what 90% 0% see 90 percent THC 0% CBD a dizzy dizzy um hard that I'm spoken on this and straw Nana that's 500 milligrams I I don't I really love the way the [ __ ] home the box that was that all over print if you guys are familiar with FTP they're all over my TP hoodie I said it's dizzy made it like that all over hoodie like like a white hoodie like just like this how FTP is all over hoodie that should be fired but I don't believe um yeah I remember now um for some reason the test wasn't on the [ __ ] box they put it on like if you guys ever been to a dispensary so if you know when you buy an item they print out like a little label and they like stick it on the box I said stick it on the receipt the percentage that this was tested at was for some reason on the label instead of the package but I believe is a I think it was around like 90 percent to but if I'm wrong I'm sorry but like I said if you go watch my review on this dizzy I go over everything like in detail so um besides for that let's just hop into this um I just wanted to show you guys when I'm smoking on and everything before we got into this so the bags area the packaging on it like I said if you watch my review on it I said it reminds me of an iPhone like packaging just the way not the way it slides out let's not my phone like if you're familiar with the iPhone like an iPhone would have like a little slot like this the iPhone won't be in what I mean and you pick this up and then just stickers and all the accessories underneath so I just thought that was pretty like I don't know for lack of better words I'm gonna say cool unique I guess I don't [ __ ] know but that was like I don't know don't mind me like the iPhone packaging so the packaging is like pretty dope with like looks professional you know you know I mean like dome design they got on it McCloud it's like a gradient smoke they got it on the inside too they have like so many I'm gonna start going over the pros and cons of this because this pan is actually really dope besides from this like this being pretty sick this dizzy packaging is just pretty basic nothing too crazy about it if you read the box you see I got the red Susie and whatever you call it fat her young but yeah I got the better one umm I think this is a pretty [ __ ] dope actually um I figured what colors they had a head blue I know they had blue I don't know I forget or whatever but I'm kind of happy that I went with red because this is actually like really sick looking in my opinion and it has like a little branded [ __ ] on the bottom for you guys you can see and this is on this drawn out like I said so this is the so yeah this is the strong Nana like I said so this is far this is the fax area Oh actually I wasn't gonna say let me go over the sugar oil in this this is this is e oil you know so this [ __ ] is like stupid fire you know I mean it tastes amazing especially like this flavor of the sraw Nana it tastes so [ __ ] bomb it tastes like you're hidden like a like a you know I got nicotine baked mod blown like blowing out a rainbow that's the best way to describe but honestly Layton so I'm the facts era this is really [ __ ] dope - I mean it literally looks like a [ __ ] jewel to me I mean I never I never got into jewels I don't I never drew with my life but to me it looks like a [ __ ] jewel you guys drew we might not think it does but I don't know but yeah it's really this free and you can see the oil you know what I mean so if you're trying to like be discreet at work or wherever the [ __ ] you're going no matter where you are this is like you can't even see the oil it's like this is like pretty much as discrete as you can get you know what I mean like this is this this is pretty discreet but you can still see the oil if you're holding it right nobody will like really tell but I mean this is pretty this free tool you know what I mean but this is like you can still see the oil on this one this is just all like I'm blacked out literally looks like a jewel so that's tough I'm gonna take a hit of each real quick for you it's been like a long video already and I haven't [ __ ] smoked at all so I drew a little bit on that one so sorry if you seen that but that was a nice stage so let me start going over like the pros and cons of both of these now I'm myself with this dizzy um this dizzy um honestly there's not really too many like cons about these to be honest I mean there's like one or two maybe I'll get to tell you those at the end but let me go over the probe let me go over the pros real quick so myself it's dizzy um this dizzy this is a red one is drawn and like I said um the one thing that I'd like about them um not necessarily that I like about them but um so one thing about them is they make their own pods called dizzy obviously using the packaging but they don't make it himself they work with like local processes and growers and I don't know exactly who they work with but they don't make the pods himself like almost positive if they work with like somebody that helps them make them so that's pretty cool like that if they have like their own [Music] branded carts to unita me and I keep saying cards but I mean quads or whatever you want to call it and this goes along with that too so you could say this is the second Pro or I don't know it goes on I don't know whatever you want to say the quality control since they have their own like brand like almost like if you get to be like if you get to at least run antivirus the quality control is so [ __ ] like perfect they're gonna be almost exactly because they're manufactured pretty much exactly the same or not pretty much the same we are so um that's something really good about them personally I just like the way like it fits in your hand more like that the facts it's like a little bit fatter it's like kind of easier to grip like this I don't know it's honestly it's it's a little bit easier to grip but this is just like a little bit more slim and the shape of it I mean they're SEP they're similar shapes but it's a little bit different I don't know if you guys can tell it just I don't know if it's at least to me that's a personal personal opinion like I said this is also like another little personal preference um I like the way the [ __ ] you know dizzy it's like a lot more than the facts era and s mainly because like the airflow there's this is like so customizable you can change so much about this I don't think there's a way to change the airflow I might be wrong if there's a way I might need to update this video I don't think there is um but yeah this airflow and this dizzy pod it [ __ ] is like if you blow clouds like that first trip I hit like both at the same time I'll take a hit of each roof where to kinda see how they rip separately you not I mean but the thing with this is you can change the temperature I'll get into that little bit later but I forget what I have it on right now but I'm not gonna change you I'm gonna leave it up what's that so I start with this first the facts there so I mean if you seen a trip I blew a pretty fat hit it wasn't hoop that I'm the thing I like I do like about this though - at the same time I feel like this will last a lot longer than this world but I'm just kind of guessing that we know I mean I wasn't the fattest hit you know I mean I hit it for a decent amount of time too so I don't listen um but let's hit this busy you know see if there's any difference or something yeah that [ __ ] [ __ ] ripped I don't know if you could hear it but like the airflow on that is insane like I was saying like so yeah that's another pro that I really love God is like the air flow like I don't know I just ripped you know I'm not about this because I smoke a lot of concentrates that's mainly what I smoke guys smoke like a [ __ ] grandma wax a day so I hardly smoke tends to be honest so when I do smoke pens they got to be like fired so that's why I'm [ __ ] with this dizzy you know what I mean like this Disney is the fire at least that's that's what I'm getting so far it's my first time trying it but um like I said it it's my first time trying it for that that's like the bottom getting so far but I don't obviously but I'm pretty sure I said this already but I'm not sure if it's like just this [ __ ] pot I have right now or if it's like every study product I have out why I need definitely definitely to find some moist dizzy parts because these are [ __ ] fire hopefully I can find them for kind of cheap but this straw Nana one the taste is 10 out of 10 like in case I get blown out [ __ ] rainbows like I don't I don't know what else to say like this you can't catch the wax at all the potency is [ __ ] insane it's like 90% like two hits like three hits low key gets you [ __ ] bait Iowa highest tolerance and I'm saying that but I mean low-key and then one more Pro about that is that they're cheaper than the fax era I paid $50 and I got a battery and a half a gram cart with well I don't know if you want to go by the deals yeah okay so yes I paid $50 and I got half uh yeah so with this dizzy I paid $50 and I got a battery and a half a gram that's like this starter kit I think they call it the fax area the battery is like $30 in the carts they can range between like 30 they like $75 depending on the quality of it and the way you live and all that [ __ ] you not I mean so let's get in the fax area now this is some [ __ ] like I said like I just mentioned how good cards are keep saying cards but the the pods how the pods can range so much that's cuz um they don't actually make the own pots themself they uh they actually like license all the different like them processors and distributors and manufacturers or whatever you know I mean so they don't actually make the products himself they get like like me the one I'm smoking on live out a trip it's actually I think it's an arizona-based brand but I'm not a hundred percent sure on that don't quote me on that I'm almost positive is though so you can pretty much get to state to state as long as dizzy is like sold in your area I meant [ __ ] FAQ service I mean tastes dizzy I'm pretty sure he said it like in the beginning of this this video but the [ __ ] packaging on this like on this is like insane like the graphic on it is [ __ ] sick the way just slides out and you had that like stick ice graphic right here you open it up the packaging is just a one-day [ __ ] kill with that packaging even though it's just the packaging you know I mean small little details matter sometimes so that's just fire that's little pro on my book I'm with those some pictures and videos up right here real quick because um there's so many like features and different options and like different things you can do on this [ __ ] pen like you could um you can change the temperature on it like I told you guys they like update so like you dumb it has bluetooth on it the fact sarah has a bluetooth so it connects to your phone if you download the app if you see the picture right here like I was updating my facts there so like your phone can keep your [ __ ] facts area like updated to this like latest software so that's pretty dope you know and I mean they got [ __ ] and smoke the thing you're smoking on it keeps updating oh that's pretty sick I don't know yeah right you're gonna see it's been updated right here this is kind of weird you can kind of like control how much you smoke I mean it's a cool little feature but I'm just gonna smoke it till I want to stop smoking I'm not probably not gonna use that and then there's like other places where you might change the temperature and a whole bunch of other dope [ __ ] so that's [ __ ] like insane they added that it's like a smart a smart a smart not a pan a smart cool with the unknown okay you know that like a smart phone a stupid joke I don't know what the [ __ ] oh not even a joke I don't know what the [ __ ] that was but I don't know that's just [ __ ] dope I mean but um yeah all those little like little features they added all that little like customizable things [ __ ] you can change you can also um go in there and you can change the name of it so like I changed my name in my fax era it's named the Ronnie ray so [ __ ] it that's just it's just dope not I mean I don't just cool even though it doesn't really matter it's just cool it's super discreet you know what I mean like you walk around like hitting this no one's gonna [ __ ] know you're smoking some fire has [ __ ] this uh THC pistol it like no one's gonna know at all like this is like as as discrete as you can get so that's like another I thought there's a lot more pros to this and there are to this busy maybe if you have some more pros this dizzy I would dump on the comments if I missed any but I've made this list kind of fast but I hits decent it doesn't hit as good as this dizzy and it's really the street you don't get the full before dab effect you mean like the lung expansion and all that [ __ ] I could kind of do with this dizzy it's more of like a normal wax and it's a lot more expensive like I said like it's 30 bucks for the battery like 40 bucks plus for the cards or [ __ ] pods it's really all personal preference I guess kinda like you might not agree with me but there's like definitely things that like it's really all like personal preference you're not I mean is probably things you don't agree with me with and things not play well hope you would you agree with you guys with you know that I mean I definitely like some things about both of them like they're both [ __ ] dope and like unique and just sick in their own ways you know what I mean but it's like low-key kinda hard for me to choose like to be on 2% honest I'm gonna have to make a part 2 to this when I smoke them for like a little bit longer I really love all the customizable things you can do with that facts area that shit's [ __ ] amazing it's like some new new technology smoking type [ __ ] like that future smokin wife's actually that's just [ __ ] though I think a lot of people would like that that's why I said it's like personal preference like if you're more like the business classy type person and smoker you probably would prefer that I don't know I just let the air flow and the way this dizzy hits its [ __ ] fire it's so potent in that cart I mean that part I have this drawn Anna oh my god that [ __ ] is so tasteful that [ __ ] as far as [ __ ] my [ __ ] is stupid fire I definitely I need to try some more pots and get some more reviews up for you guys like for everyday purposes I would definitely use this probably best Izzy over the [ __ ] [ __ ] to be honest but the facts is definitely like dope to have like just whenever you need to be super disagree or just just to have you wanna move cuz that has all those customizable [ __ ] features and it's just [ __ ] dope and unique and it's definitely [ __ ] sick and they have some dope out like you can the dope thing about them too is you can like there's probably like they probably licensed some some brands that are making some stupid likes like I said $70 pots and those those $70 pods are probably way [ __ ] better than these [ __ ] these dizzy pots you know what I mean so that's the one thing better I mean not one thing better but you know you're not I'm saying like something that's better - about the facts error like I know there's other brands like Mark seen [ __ ] like that too so if you want to like want me to do some reviews to them or in it and I'm pretty sure there's like some other brands too but I forget the names of them if you guys know the names of them and you want to see me to review them and like maybe compare them to these drop the names of them down below in the comments and tell me you want to see that I don't definitely do that but yeah I think I like this Izzy more than the [ __ ] facts are like daily use talking but if you're talking like just if you're talking about like the capability and like everything you can do with it like everything that's capable of doing like if you're talking like everything that's capable of doing like in your money's worth and she like that etc back Sarah a hundred percent but just me personally because I have a high tolerance in the way I smoke dizzy I'm going stays the all the way but facts era that [ __ ] is [ __ ] next-gen - it's [ __ ] wild so either way I mean like they both get like a 5 out of 5 you can't really go wrong with either of them you gotta mean so definitely want to try out one of the Moxie ones so if you want to see that I'm gonna blow in the comments and if there's any other ones we don't blow in the comments but if there's any other videos you guys want to see comments and I really can't my grandma [ __ ] the medical marijuana cards so she can get it like do these [ __ ] videos with me but if you have any other videos for me or my grandmother do comments besides that if you guys ever tried either these tell me which one you guys like down below in the comments more or just tell me whatever you what you thought of whichever one you tried if you didn't read both but besides for that if you guys like the video thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] I love you guys like a part of my family I hope you guys love me besides for that peace so", "4TDFdILUcBk": "the orion pod system consists of a pod and a battery the orion pot is filled with 1000 milligrams of live resin blends extracted from item 9 labs award-winning flowers so what is life resin live resin is a cannabis concentrate extracted from fresh frozen cannabis flowers right at the moment that we harvest the flowers when those terpenes and cannabinoids are at peak freshness we freeze and preserve them and then we extract or separate those phytochemicals from the plant matter what we're left with is live resin which is a full spectrum extract full spectrum means that all of the phytochemicals present in the original strain are expressed in the final product this is a very good thing why well cannabis is made up of more than just one or two compounds cannabis is made up of hundreds of different compounds and the science shows that all of these compounds work collectively to create the overall experience the synergy of all compounds offers greater effects than any single compound working individually this is what's known as the entourage effect what this means is that full spectrum products such as life resin offer a wider range of effects compared to the typical vapes containing one compound that being usually thc okay so now we know what life resin is and why it is important next let's talk about these blends the blends are combinations of different item 9 lab strains intentionally grouped together to achieve specific effects we have grounded which is a blend of indica strengths brought together to promote calming and relaxation orbit a blend of most sought after hybrid strains promoting balance head and body effects and finally beyond a blend of sativa strains which are meant to be energizing and uplifting not only is the extract inside of the pot of the highest quality but the technology of the orion pod system is also worthy of mention the detachable pots and battery are magnetic so they just come together it's very easy to switch pots for desired effects so if you want to start your day with orbit and want to finish with grounded you can easily swap the pots out just pop pop pop the orion battery is inhalation activated fitted with the most advanced next core heating element available it heats up when you inhale warming up the extract in the pot and creating a smooth vapor and a very satisfying draw the battery will buzz after a 5 second inhale for accurate dosing the battery has a light a delta which glows green when the battery is fully charged until half point at 49 it will glow orange until you reach 20 percent at which point it will glow red the orion 710 pod system is the perfect vaporizer for those who prefer effect-based cannabis products in an easy-to-use portable and discreet system like all of our products orion is third-party tested make sure to check out our website where you can find the test results to all of our products education and more", "GM3yF_SA6vk": "yo what's up guys mr warren here i'm bringing you another review today we're going to review the pax era

also the best part about it it'll give you like the best temperature for you to you know hit whatever you're hitting whether it's you know this delay sauce or you know you know those two out of those two different things so what's cool about it on buddy they have it already is and they had a strain too so it told me like you know the lowest temperature they recommend is you know starting like five hundred or something like that and the highest I believe it's like five fifty so that's like the temperature they recommend for you to hit their soft spot their product so I think that's really really cool you know for especially for people who were II know beginners who want to take it you know like the slow by step of like you know from hitting it from the low temp to a higher temp I prefer the five fifty because that's my perfect amount of taste amount of you know vapor for me so that's pretty cool guys so that's a side note on the app guys and I'm gonna try to get like at least a freaking a piece of [ __ ] phone for me to have the app for you guys to just show you you know this you know just to show you on hand how it works and I think that's pretty cool so shout out to Paxton for doing that update and yeah guys so here it is I already have in my packs and this is way darker guys so that's just how sauce is guys look at that it's very very nice very so you can see how more of a darker arbor color you know but it's not you know don't be afraid that's not it's not fake or there's not nasty [ __ ] it's just how this how high terpene extract comes out of like this is the purest form of a plant so you know you won't get such a sweet tasty as this to it so so yeah guys and then gravy is pretty cool on it you know I can't really see it's too dark but yeah this berry bomb liquid diamonds ooh so alright guys so snow mean it man just smelling sauce guy just slice it's just such a beautiful smell man I love it and I do smell like a little ham berries in background no it's not

help you guys by showing you how to open up one of these dizzy pods now I've looked on other YouTube channels to find out how to open these things but the way they do it they the way that I've seen generally tends to damage them and that's not what I want to do because once you do and she's little hinges here little hooks this top cap gets wobbly and I could just slip off after you do it so many times but the way I'm going to show you guys today is virtually no damage this year and this one here I just refilled them right now and you can't even tell I used this full gram of king pan super Lemon Haze that I have back here I just open it and I refilled these two sticky parts this one was a mango CBD and this was a sativa Strawberry Cough and the only reason I did this was because would I prefer these little tiny pots or this bigger cylinder cartridge because I really like these batteries and they're so small sleek and they're pretty cool so but yeah for the oil so you could want to refill your pods with anything else whether it's another card drenched or your own stuff then this is for you see - and all you're gonna need today is duct tape and some pair of pliers like these we're gonna use these to pinch off the tops okay so now that we cleaned off there you you're gonna get your pod there you want to open that's the only one I have right now that I can use for the video you're gonna use a piece of tape about this big now what you want to do is roll it like this into itself and all you're really gonna do with this tape is help with the friction here so that the players can hold on to this piece of plastic and also not damage on them so it's like a cushion for the pod and a cushion for the suppliers so you gonna pinch it that way right about the players did you come in here and you got a white league pinch the top sorry about that and now that you have it you're gonna pull you can't even so it came off and that's how you take off the cap and here this part it's just it's a little rubber stopper you generally just peel that right off and there you go all right guys so that's pretty much how you open one of these dizzy pods we want to close and just push it back down and put the cap back on and that's it but thank you for watching this video please comment like subscribe share it and yeah thank you so much for supporting the channel", "2XhT4efJfhU": "hey guys his dad connection and we're gonna be filling the C cell dart or uno they're basically the same pod with different mouthpieces and here we go so I warm this up in hot water I know I sometimes just use the lighter method a lot of people don't like that but basically you don't really need a needle on this one and you just sit it in it's actually very similar to filling h2z pot so you know what that's soaked up and what I always do just to make sure pods are a hundred percent to make sure that the pods are hundred percent well it's you know it's I'm filling in there and then I'll let it sit for about 20 minutes once it hit that cotton so once it gets to that cotton hit I'm gonna let that set for 20 minutes and I'm gonna make sure that it all works fine for put the rest of oil in you know some people just put all the oil in right away I do like to kind of test it first but that cotton in the center you want that to be soaking see cell recommends about 20 minutes some people even do it overnight but let that soak and then all you have to do is once that soak for a while you're thinking to pop up this little piece and so this is gonna go plastic side down on here okay and then you're gonna pop on your really no cap or your dart cap and then you're ready to go you know once it's at I let it sit - before I pop this on just so I don't get on the wack stuck on top but there we go thanks for watching guys is how you feel a dart er you know there's dab connection and have a great week", "NwuI_vS2mAk": "[Music] hey what's up guys what's up youtube it's me ricardi and um today's video is pretty freaking cool watch the [ __ ] mailman oh my god oh my god man just give my damn man all right anyways so speaking of the mail dudes [ __ ] left goals extracts dude they sent me this through the mail dude holy crap so they gave me two uh half damn great babes um literally the day before new year's eve so i literally like walked in 2021 you know with brand new [ __ ] you know with some you know they hooked me up you know going 20 21 so thank you a lot of coast extracts big thank you so much for sponsoring this video and i'm saying so uh yeah dude so if you don't know what left coast extract is you're then you're probably living on their rock let's come on let's let's be real here um left coast extract if you can't tell her to you know this is like they have their own paw system kind of likes dizzy's you know they're up and coming they've been up and coming actually um i've known for quite a while now and i've always wanted to try their products out you know what i'm saying and you know i'm saying here we are today so that color out it's pretty light um yes so it's literally the same battery as like the [ __ ] it's dizzy but dance looks great so this works with the safety battery as well so but uh i gotta i mean i got a special left coast battery you know i'm saying uh that's all boxes i already opened it i'm see if you can't tell but yeah so go to the charger in there uh i have somewhere coming they have sativa indica hybrid on the yellow ones being you know indica and then um sativa being blue and then red being the hybrids if you see them in the shops but enough of that let's and here's what you guys wanted to see you know the [ __ ] pen you know how does this rip man this this this does hit someone to sizzy now i'm saying this is i mean it's a ponzi something you know the oil though oh my god let me tell you when i first smoked this pan it hit pretty hard by the way um okay let's try it um tokes up man oh yeah by the way this has a really good taste to it great vape cheers y'all thank you left coast for hooking me up man thank you thank y'all man all right cheers y'all i mean tokes we're not saying we're not saying cheers anymore we say tokes narrow we say tokes around here [Music] oh so yeah um this is a real company you know i'm saying this is a there's a cali logo on it and everything but yeah off the first hit dude that's it it's pretty hard you know it is disability just do a solvent list so do a supplementless distillation process now i'm saying uh but dan this is a really good taste dude like probably one of the best layers i've ever smoked for a great bait um this one's probably out there with plug and play for sure is if not better this pod does produce a lot of smoke i do think um me having the you know smoke in the left coast here and there i do notice that the this battery doesn't burn higher and uh you know that's that steady battery so i cannot find it man this is this is no joke man it's i'll just keep ripping this [ __ ] man um i think he's just wondering they are they're based in oceanside so that's you know what the flood that's crazy and these are only available in california you know what i'm saying just you know based off the name left coast extracts another another thing difference between uh this and city battery this one does not blink so for all you like crazy guys who you know thing believes aren't enough man this old actually i lied this does blink it only takes like 20 seconds though like it's like crazy amount of time for the league man but yeah it will blink but i can't i can't do that man i can't my friend did it though but i should have smacked it somebody just pulled up around my house yeah check it out the the cable that came with it um play the left coat extracts um this the great bait pawn that stays true this really does taste like literally grape it doesn't have weird taste at all i've actually you know wanted it you know give my full thoughts about it before you know go out and make a video um this is probably one of the best possible out there for your book you know um most definitely you know i'm saying like this is pretty good pretty good quality um especially if you're you know barely starting to smoke out this yeah barely starting to smoke this it will have you on your ass yeah um tokes another rip um see man i'm just gonna keep ripping this until i get faded faded [Music] the weed in this coil is pretty damn good left goes um like i said thank you guys for hooking me up you know um it's awesome this is a pretty good pen i love i do love um the design of this it's pretty unique compared to that [ __ ] you know stizzies i know they have the camos and all that but you know this stands out you know damn [Music] i dropped that [ __ ] but uh [ __ ] it i wanna show y'all yeah man i'm gonna find that battery um yeah this [ __ ] lifeguard had to be big um this is pretty good you know pretty good oil like i said like i showed you all this you know it's pretty you know it's pretty clear um it was clear than what i usually see for distillate but uh yeah man pretty fire i do notice though when you like tend to hit it for a long time it doesn't taste more burnt well that's just because you're eating longer [Music] dude i'm scared that that guy if i could look at that guy he didn't like try to shoot me or something you know he's in a bomb bam bam and it's like on my youtube video like that you know it's pretty scary out here nowadays like well you look at somebody in the eye and they're just like no like jay he's looking away in the eye like it's looking it's looking funny like like a psycho bad like they're gonna deharm and like what the [ __ ] bro like what's going on in there like they said i like to go and not look away but you know [ __ ] keep your card but anyways i'm going on a whole other thing man that dude is gone i'm i'm too late let thank you left coast this is [ __ ] bomb and you know i

"F20EmG4W9Vk": "oh it's not above to make me change like a castaway you know you pay that you bought the cooler today hey guys I just shot this entire video and I wasn't even recording man so I'm stoned as heck right now having to rerecord this for you guys but it's alright that's alright so without further ado guys my name is Teddy G welcome back to my channel for today's video guys we got something crazy we got a freaking comparison all right guys from two of the biggest brands out on the market right now we are going to be testing out this dizzy live resin and we're going to be comparing it to the raw garden refined live resin alright guys the only reason we're doing this is because I felt like you know these are two of the biggest brands on the market right now in terms of cartridges so it would be just fun to just see what's that what what is the difference between these cartridges you know what is the taste difference what's the why is raw garden refined light resin and why's dizzy luck regular light resin and we're gonna touch base on every single detail as to what each company brings to the table and just so you guys know man who is the best live resin out there right now before this video starts though I want you guys who are watching this video right now let me know in the comments below spam that [ __ ] let me know what do you guys think is better we got this dizzy live resin or we got the raw garden and refined by resin so hey let me know if you guys have tried any of these and let me know what's your favorite and why alright guys so without further ado man I think the only thing there is to do now is to test these out get an ice and stone and let you give you guys the full rundown as to what I think is better alright guys so we are going to be testing out this one right here which is the key lime pie it is an indica and we are going to be compared - the banana slim from raw garden which is also indica the raw garden is sitting at 85 point 95 percent of THC and though it is e itself is the seitan at a nice seventy nine point seventy one percent THC all right guys so the difference is already you know seven to seven percent differential in the THC percentages is it really going to make a difference I feel like it all depends on the product itself man it all depends on the strain it depends on you know yeah I think it just depends mostly on the strain and how much smoke consumption you can get because obviously if you're not getting enough smoke in your lungs then you're not getting hot so I don't know which one to test out first geyser so we got the key lime pie plus the sour gorilla which is a hybrid I'm just trying to compare both of the indicas though so not that we go with this dizzy first alright guys so we're gonna take a big fat blink of a note off of this dizzy and tell you guys the full flavor profile what kind of time it gets me get to be right off the bat because with the blinker man you have to feel something right guys so cheers boys if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 man that's all I'm saying choose the initial flavor flavor that I'm getting I am getting a little hint of like select a line like Elvis citrusy which is pretty freakin cool man none to say the least but I uh I'm also getting that natural like if you guys know if you have ever smoked live resin you guys know that it tastes kind of like it doesn't taste burnt but it does taste like like obviously something very very earthy that like you know it's something completely different than the within what you're used to if you smoke raw garden something completely different man this type of live resin you know is actual live residence how it's like you know the industry standard of live resin and that's what's tizzy puts in the pot so comparing it to the refine light resin though so pretty much what raw garden does what they're refined light resin is they take out any extra lipids and things like that carcinogen I mean I'm not really too sure if it has carcinogens but if they take out pretty much any extras that they really don't feel should be vain alright guys so compared to this one this one might have NEX some extra lipids just from the process of the you know squishing the plant itself as opposed to this that it's gonna take out all that extra stuff so that's why you also get it so clear right so it's just refining it that way you get a better end product it's basically what they're trying to do so without further ado guys I think we should just go in for a fat little toke and yeah choose [Music] oh my gosh dude the raw garden blinkers literally they kill me every time I like I used to when I first started smoking these I used to take blinker after blink after blinker but by now man I don't know what it is but they're just so like so much harsher now and then what they used to be it's out there so much harsher or it's just my lungs they're you know slowly decay ting but either way man it doesn't matter yeah take touch base on both of these though man off the first two initial hits like this one right here I got it was it wasn't as Turkey is what I'm used to to the to the raw Gardens but they that's what sucks about these is they always change man I mean the base flavor profile Oh is always the same you know it's always usually the similar taste but I'm talking about the Terps you'll get some that are really really really chirpy and gassy and they just like you know expand your lungs and destroy your lungs and then you'll get something like these that are kind of kind of subtle like you know the Terps are very very subtle in there but they these always have more Terps in my opinion compared to these live residents from ste I like the the ones from Suzie honestly they're just like very very smooth and they're not too harsh on your throat like I said like I could let you guys saw me take a blinker and just take it like a champ right okay as opposed to this when I was coughing like a little bit after like these are a lot smoother the live resin is they give you the full entourage effect so the highest completely completely different guys all right and that's what I'm gonna touch base next after after the flavor profile so yeah this is like a more plant-based you you're not really getting too much Terps it's more of just getting you the full entourage effect and what that does is basically give you a full spectrum hot alright guys as put to this this one it's just the flavor puffs on this is just turquoise tantrum and likey there's nothing else to say about it I mean not this specific regarde in general you know they're known for being gassy for being therapy and yeah man so flavor-wise I do like the raw garden a lot more so next up on the list though like I was saying we're gonna go based on the highest and I know I'm not I'm not basing the highs as a right now I'm just basing the overall highs that I've had in the my past experiences and I'm gonna just let you guys give you guys the full rundown all right so with with the Stacey live resident I do get the full entourage effect all right which is basically I do feel like very very soothing it's a very very soothing high man and it's not if you take a blinker you're not gonna really feel that high right away it's a high that progresses so every single time that you take a hit you're gonna get more and more high and it's not really a very very rapid high at least for my personal experience is it is a slow high but once you reach that peak level it's a very very enjoyable high as opposed to the raw garden where I feel like this one man you it's just in your face it's just very very in your face but the thing is it doesn't it's like quick it's a quick high you get me so you'll take a hit of this you'll take a blinker hit of this so you get a very very stone you'll feel like like oh my gosh dude like I'm stoned right and it'll last at least for me it'll last for like 20 minutes at most and you know I feel like I have to take another hit to get that high again and it's just not it's not it's not a soothing high as opposed to that how this dizzy is right this one is just like I said like I was saying it's very in-your-face and it's a very being rushed high so you just like you just like oh my gosh you're like I'm a high like I'm super babe and then um you don't really get a chance to just chill out in my opinion you know it's a very very like dude like I'm afraid and I have to get like you know experienced the highest opposed to this one you could just sit down and chill and enjoy the full effects of the plant and how it's supposed to be soothing you which is really really weird man it really goes to show you know the different types how different types of live resin waxes things like that affect your body affect your mind and things like that so take it from take it from my point of view guys you know give different things to try don't just be stuck on one product because you enjoy that hi you know there's you'll probably find something else that you might like a little bit more you know so I think the only thing we we talked a lot right now but I think it's tough to get nice and baked so Cheers [Music] like I'm super bagel I was saying in the beginning of the video I made I want to say it was at least that eight to ten minute video guys for you guys and it it was going so good in my opinion who is it was really really good but I'd like this one's probably gonna come out a lot better just because I picked out my flaws on the last one so this one was just kind of just donating rolling rolling rolling but yeah that kind of pissed me off a little bit but we're already started so really couldn't be too pissed off but I'm just enjoying it I'm enjoying doing these videos for you guys I love the support that you guys have been showing to me man if you haven't already what are you doing man go ahead and hit that subscribe button it supports me more than you think alright guys so let's go in on this raw garden hit next Cheers [Music] therapy super therapy we tell you guys like the flavor profile from the raw garden is just completely different from this dizzy man and I feel like that's what that's what's gonna really make this decision hard is the fact that I feel like these two even though they're both like resin I just feel like they're two completely different things you get me like right here we got a very chirpy pen that's just a very very completely different high right here is something that's very very subtle but it gets you it's a very very soothing high and yours you're getting the full flavor profile from the plant as opposed to this one I mean I don't know I don't know it's like you get me if I smoke the plant well it will it give me the same high is what I'm trying to say it's like I don't feel like I'm gonna get the same high but I like with if I smoke the plant from this but if I were to smoke the plant from this I feel like it would be around the same high you know and it's kind of something that that I don't know if that just kind of brought it to my attention is the fact that you know and why how much can the highs really change from the bud look at that bud state to the wax date you know and it's very very crazy man they're very very crazy guys so I'm gonna be honest with you guys I am NOT gonna be able to decide who's gonna be the winner because like I was saying there are two different completely products and I'm gonna need your help for this one guys all right so let me know in the comments below I want every single person watching this video to comment down below if you've tried these products which one do you think is better and would like tell me why tell me why do you think they're all arms are better tell me why you think this dizzy is better right I want to know your opinions I want to make this interactive video and hopefully you guys are down for it so because I can't really choose I'm gonna need your help on be 100% honest right so I'm gonna drop this video today and you guys are gonna we figure out which is better than what so without further ado I'm gonna end out the video go upload this and so you guys have something to watch alright guys hope you guys have a blessed day don't forget to leave a like comment and subscribe and we'll catch you

for watching um i'll [ __ ] with y'all have you bro mario", "tsNBZLoTsb8": "hello guys and welcome back again to tools and gadgets and today guys i'm going to show to you how to refill the pot of the jewel so that you can save uh pretty much big rather than changing the pods every time okay so as you can see i still have a little bit of juice left there but for the sake of this video i'm going to show you how to open it okay so there's two latches here on each side so you just need to do is you could use your if you have uh nails just slide it in it could take a while to master this okay so there you go so this is the tissue for to wipe this clean because there will be a moisture around this area right here yeah and you can just use your nails to pop this rubber open there you go do that you just need to [Music] pat this rubber to dry and set it aside and now it's time to refill the joe pods so this accommodates one milliliter of juice well it's best that you use salt mix for this pods because salt nicks are what you say uh it for pods because it produces i mean when using the pod uh you need there's little vapor that it produces so you need a higher nicotine content but in order to get that throat tip that you've been looking for at fill 50 milligrams of salt neck is the throat it will be compared to around 12 milligrams of free base nicotine okay so i'm going to show you a trick and how to place the rubber cap back one tip is that don't place it on top then just press directly because the juice here will get vacuumed inside of the chamber so what you need to do is stick one side first slowly slowly until you shut everything okay so that's that and the next one is every time you refill the pods you need to get out the or pull out the uh what they call this i forgot what's this called but all you need to do is just grab a screwdriver and you can just pop it open i mean slide it out it has a yeah okay so just place this one on a tissue so this acts as a sort of like a spit back protector because it absorbs the spit backs so i just pat it like that not too hard okay just soft okay then transfer again and do the same thing over again okay just soft don't press it really hard see now there's juice here so this would be more like brand new again when you place it back in so to place this back in i had to just just lay it on one side then just push it with a screwdriver see so again on the other side just place it on one side and slide it in okay so that's it so your pods smallest like brand new and in order to place this back again just snap it into place okay you'll hear the clicks on this latches okay that's it now have a full working dual pods so let's test it out okay so for the first few puffs they advise that you just take a small hit so that the juice will go to the heating coil so that produces paper so puff blade puff it a it produces more vapor now and so yeah usually i get spit backs when i refill the pods but the one that i thought the one that i taught you i'm sorry is when you slide the the absorber or something on the sides and pat it dry yeah so that it can now absorb the newly placed juice okay so once again guys thank you for watching i hope you like enjoyed this video and informative you find it informative so see you again on my next vlog and don't forget to hit the like and subscribe button below see you bye", "lOoDzNIbDYs": "you I ain't with the chitchat gun got a kick back talking about you about the life I don't really live that big bag full of runs you know I'm a hit they started from the bottom nine I don't be big big but it always be crunch time I don't got a six-pack oh you got a big mouth but he got a big shot run up in your [ __ ] face you ain't get your [ __ ] back always in a hurry so you know they could click first I smoked designer [ __ ] from that putting on my weeding and grinder I smuggled diamonds this is so loud I should come with some sirens they don't want problems I could send the boogie man to come find they hit voices behind them they know that we sliding I stack my paper like books on the Shelf I smoke this runs like it's good for my house I don't need no one just got it myself don't follow no one just got it myself you got a gun I keep mine in my belt I don't think they really know how I follow these was the cars that we was doused but look up as stars but some of them fell also known as the president I base of America Donald Blount also known as Abraham Lincoln also known as Willie the cool penguin also known as Ned sparks also known as board bomb tomorrow the main reason I wanted to drop this video today it was about the ever more dark now ever since they dropped it there's been a huge demand for it seemingly I see a lot of them on the Internet the good thing about the dart now the dart is made by C cell which as you know is the best [ __ ] court maker on the planet the ceramic cell that's what the C stands for so in the following video I just want to show you how simple it is how easy to use how discreet how effective it it so as you can see right here this is where we open the box now the box it's very simple you slide out the box within the box the inception box and crack it open once it's open you easily just pull the ever-more dart out the C cell dart with ever more branding for those who do not know and need them these are the instructions step one insert cartridge step two use okay great now that we have our ever more dark [ __ ] plugged in let's give this thing some use [Music] awesome as you can see it's got a nice bit of vapor the pull on it is got some good resistance so you definitely do pull hard I find that with most fake cartridges especially on the classic pen battery I ended up having to hold it until it blinks stop it press it again keep pulling let it go before it starts blinking press it again and let it keep going until I get a satisfactory sized hit and even though this is a distillate based pod that I have in here the grapefruit cherry-pie it's actually quite effective at the time of this video I've already used it a few times in and out and about I thought I lost it actually it's probably only downside for me is that it's small compact which means it's easy to lose fortunately the people over at Temescal my main man evan over there gave me hook up with the second battery we've got the nice tan color he knew that was the color I wanted good thing about the pod system it's got magnets [ __ ] magnets how do they work that's how they work about halfway down there you can see oh alright it's pretty simple I actually got all six flavors of the current cartridges and there's gonna be a video for each one so the grapefruit cherry pie pod has eighty two point four nine percent THC two and a half percent CBN 2.6 percent CBG 0.2 percent pi 9 0.7% mersin 2.3 percent limonene 0.3 percent Lena Lowell and 0.8% Carafa lean now the one thing I like about it having two and a half percent CBN is that it's probably gonna help with some anxiety relief all that lemon in which for those who don't know I'm a limonene fiend I've used it out on the go it works sufficiently for what cartridges do as far as cards go this has been one of the better ones I'm super excited to try the citrus cleaner one as it's got 20% sauce usually when I do smoke carts I prefer a good sauce card I'm actually looking super forward to trying the girl-scout CBD I've heard some mixed reviews and I know a lot of you're thinking girl scout CBD was even mean it's Girl Scout crossed with a penny wise cross high in CBD Girl Scout CBD it's delicious and if you haven't seen I've gotten the pre-rolls many times and I don't really like pre-rolls either this is gonna wrap it up for our video on the ever more darkman again to wrap it up it's a C cell pod system the first in Maryland to use the C cell some use disposables that may or may not lead sled ever more however is opting for the C cell if you've tried the ever more C cell dart pod system and you liked it shoot me a comment shoot me a message you can reach me at Lord Baltimore at gmail.com you can DM e at Lord more on Instagram at Baltimore on Twitter at Lord Baltimore on YouTube and any other place where fine medias are social including reddit which I know some of you may not know the Maryland cannabis community gets buck wild

here thank you for having us this is absolutely america capital capital yeah we we try to make it fun we we promise a couple things on this show we promise that we're going to bring trade ideas we promise that it's going to be very entertaining and that we're going to have gimmicks so we're hoping that you can help us with at least the first one which is the trade idea and if you you have gimmicks as well we will absolutely take that um but all right guys we we wanted to bring bruce onto the show he runs a very interesting etf um i'm gonna pull it up on the screen here and put up a one-year chart but bruce can can you tell us a little bit about it and get everyone antiquated okay sure and actually we thought about idea almost like two years ago back then couple friends you know now partners we were thinking what's the next thing to invest when the 40 cycle was almost over we are looking at the 5g cycle and the way we look at 5g is now the 5g itself we really look at it from the cycle perspective who might benefit from there it's it's a you know the deck in the long process that's a little bit different from other like 5g etfs out there well you know we made a conscious decision to do an etf rather than you know traditional hedge funds you know for the exact reason we got asked by many friends and friends like you know young friends like you guys and back then like what should we buy what's without boost and other like partners got the similar questions we were thinking why not just you know do an etf that's much easier and that put all your best ideas to capture the biggest things for the decades to come and you know i feel come if i feel comfortable to put my sister's money and my parents money into it i should feel very comfortable to you know recommend that to all my friends okay see i thought you were going to say if i feel comfortable put my own money in it would you just upped the ante right there you said you're putting your sister's money in it so if you're putting your sister's money into it that means you have a very very high degree of confidence because actually well my money is in there that's a given so i don't even want to talk about that so i i do manage my parents money my sister money a little bit and so actually most of their dollar assets i mentioned for them and i put very significant you know into wgi right now i have confidence it's not like you know for short-term trading vehicle this is actively managing the etf you know that's one thing i want to tell people that's not if you want to trade attack exposure qqq and slk and many other things you can use you know wgi to certain extent ark is for people who have a long-term view you where you park your money it's passing in this environment you know putting into you know a 60 40 portfolio may not be the optimal solution anymore when the rate is so low you are looking for the this is a growing pie story focus on the where the pie is growing faster bigger than anybody else everywhere else so i think that's the thesis that are driving this it's a buy and a whole kind of like things until the cycle terms and and so so like like when you're doing like actively managed etf uh how active is it and can you talk through some of the largest holdings of the etf okay sure uh first of all let's have actually very good question uh luke we are very actively looking at the portfolios i think about the new names what should they add what we in but if you look at our turnovers it's not that much probably much less than you know at least like compared to arc much less than arc last year i believe our number is around only like 26 below 30 percent that's relatively low why we don't trade a quarter c in quarters out like again back today we have a long-term view i want to say you know like think about in the 40 cycle and at the beginning of the 40 cycle if you have the faith in the guys benefited from this mobile internet you hold on to amazon's netflix google and and apple you know especially your portfolio has 10 years later your portfolio has been doing fantastic so that's what we are trying to achieve in the 5g cycle and we try to find the long-term you know winners well you know luke mentioned the world cup like right now the top holdings in our portfolio you got like you know first of all like who might benefit from this you know a 5g cycle the first thing coming into our mind is like a semiconductor industries and so you know 5g it's all about connecting everything together as much faster you know of speed and it has much higher capacity just 40 is about connecting people 5g is just extending that to connecting everything what the reason we call the digital economy because it's really a process of digitalizing everything so come to the basics when you try to digitalize everything you need a semiconductor chips to power that right so to generate to digital so like first of all we like semi names and well you know within semi names you get like you know exposure to the wireless communications you know exposure to the profile high performance computing which is like a data center slash ai also the traditional you know uh industrial and auto part we again back to our thesis we stay into the long term things we we have much more exposure to the first two wireless communications that's why you see qualcomm 12v in our portfolio and also but at this moment we actually like the data center high performance computing part of the same space especially giving this arm-based you know uh service you know coming up is that semi-space is not boring at all these days it's consolidating new things are coming up every year that's so exciting to support ai and hyperscalers and the smart ads computing so that's where we find a lot of like exciting things going on uh you you saw you saw a call you know uh qualcomm corvo i mentioned we also like nvidia we actually like a marvel i think we think marvel is a turnaround story also very well positioned for this you know arm-based uh uh that's interesting that's a stock that that i really have not heard talked about much recently at all it's an interesting one take a look and we like it they over the years used to turn rock around the story yeah here i'm gonna put a five-year chart of this one so so there it is yeah it's doing relatively well these days they got rid of those like short cycle consumer based you know like product lines really really focusing on the like a data center data center part especially on the arm part you know like the company now like amazon is doing their own armed cpus if other like hyper sailors they want to do something they if they couldn't like you know doing everything entirely entirely on their own arm is the perfect partner to have okay yeah um that's the same oh look i'm sorry i interrupted you please go ahead okay i was gonna say we got a couple people in the in the chat asking for for some deeper thoughts about amd any thoughts on that one well we love amd we love him this since lisa took over the the the ceo position and this is the it's you know we call amd is a boring execution if you go to our like you know linkedin or like instagram we are sharing what we saw from amd all the time we call it a boring execution it's now amd has been doing something magically they have been telling everybody what they are going to do since like five years back and they just executed so well their technology products your map every step they have been executing so well under the leadership like you know lisa zoo well you know so that's the first lag of their you know growth you know they really really like the risk that the company and having the better products and the you know growth earnings well you know that's uh you everybody remember last year like the finally you know the competitors you have to throw intel into this you know last year uh intel finally admitted they had troubles with their manufacturing process right that's the second quarter of the year and the stock tumbled and that also boosts the the stock performance amd that gives md the second story to tell and it's multiple expansion so it it enjoyed that multiple expansion after intel told everybody they kind of like it up well you know things has changed a little bit things has changed a little bit since pat came to rescue try to do something for intel to try to you know improve their manufacturing process and i think that's put a cap on amd at least the multiple expansion story is a little bit harder to tell at this moment we have to wait and see but fundamentally we just love the company love the execution love where they're going and the the the theme the you know uh this is it's a great this is what i mentioned earlier you want to focus on where the pi is growing bigger and faster definitely intel sorry md is on to it hey guys can you see me yeah yeah yep uh well one more question so so the nasdaq is still about five percent off of its all-time high uh the the the the etf again ww ugi that's the ticker there guys uh obviously came under some pressure when tech stocks corrected what what contributed to some of that downside in the etf like what were some of the the main stocks that got hit would love to explain that it's a very very good question you know uh well if you're on top of that you have to talk about like you know everybody knows like you know the the reits market 10-year treasury yield was under pressure still under the pressure and that actually it has basically nothing to do with the stock you know equity market itself it's all coming from the the reits market uh first of all this is uh you know hyper growth portfolio tourism exam we like you know growth in names you know no doubt about that well it comes with the cost a certain name at least on the surface it looks expensive if you look at the the traditional value matrix valuation matrix well although we disagree you know it looks expensive but if you know the business well they are not that expensive at all some of them are actually very cheap given the potential we might be able to achieve but you know since the the middle of february the middle of february the treasury of the market is putting a lot of pressure on the financial conditions the symptom is what the real yield sorry getting into a little bit like two technical here the real yield is rising really really fast it was around like negative 80 beeps to negative 100 beeps which was supporting devaluation and the growth stocks why you know when you have a lower real yield and you know market are waiting to give like you know companies like a higher valuation also you know that supports you know hyper growth names because they are all long-duration assets most of their values are like coming from the term value what they can deliver to five ten years down the road they are very sensitive to the change of the real yield well real yield is rising so fast that's put a lot of pressure on those stocks market were in the mode of you know shooting first ask the questions later i think that contributed to a lot of like names no matter your good names or bad names if you're in the growth camp if you are in the you know expensive stocks camp you get killed first and then you know i think we're getting to the the step uh market starts asking the questions well i think the the good ones the ones actually not that expensive can deliver the growth they promised to the market to the investors they have the better chance to come back well i do tell people you know i don't think the net the real yield is going to go back to the negative 100 beeps probably we're gonna find the equilibrium around the negative 50 pips which is supporting the devaluation of the whole market but just not as supportive as last year so a lot like a dream stocks you know the price by dreams and don't give your solid you know growth trajectory and not able to execute should be you know very careful with those names okay and bruce let me ask you one more question so so are are you the one who who's managing the the etf and doing the stock picking is are there other folks at the company who are doing that or or how does that process will work that's also another good question we have two risk teams one is in us the other one is batching in china you look at our portfolios we have actually pretty good like exposure to chinese asian you know like taiwan singapore so we want to be the the group you know it's a group of like five people now already we do it's just like a hedge fund we do the solid fundamental research we we want to have access to the management team and really just know the business well on both china and the us i think you know in the f in a 5g cycle that's where the growth in terms of regions that's where the girls are coming from well at this moment we see more opportunities with hard science hard technologies in us and the soft science application levels are more coming from china or asia but that dynamic might shift or change we won't be the one being able to call it and capture that so yeah so it's not only me or i have like a full you know working in both u.s and china there we go all right guys there you heard it bruce joining the power hour first time on the power hour i told him this

this um this very kind person who just made me this piece right here gave me a whole gram of this stizzy um watermelon cherry pie wax all right brand spanking new i did not it's not open at all right it's a full gram right here so i was thinking man i haven't i haven't the next hour to to just sesh to myself so i was like i want to get pretty freaking baked so this is what i'm going to do all right so i'm going to use my dip device um e-rig by vape dynamics and what i'm going to do is i'm going to try try all right i'm going to try to smoke this whole gram in one sitting i don't know how long it's gonna take me i don't know if i'm gonna be able to even do it man i like i got lungs i got lungs but a whole gram by yourself is like a lot all right so i'm gonna go ahead and smoke try to smoke this whole gram by myself out of this e-rig right here and just sesh it out with you guys man just have a nice little session with you guys talk with you guys all that good stuff all right but before we get into the actual video if you guys can do me one big favor smash that like button on this video and also if you haven't already man hit that subscribe button alright guys we're so freaking close to 50k and i know we're gonna be able to hit it by the end of this month there's there's still not a doubt in my mind bro so if you haven't already hit that subscribe button just join the fam and hit that button alright guys so let's get this thing started cheers all right ladies and gentlemen so now that i got the camera set up on the tripod man let's just get straight into this man i don't even want to talk so three clicks goes ahead and turns this on one two three all right there you go and then um i am using the stock piece i kind of want to switch it out i'm not even too sure but this is a custom piece that goes on the dip devices um usually i always i like the stock piece on this one honestly it's it does a phenomenal job it has a lot of water in there you get a nice chuggy you know feedback but this piece in particular you get to put even more water in my opinion i think it's actually kind of similar it's actually very very similar this one's a little bit more narrow but i like this piece i like this combination just the purple going on and then um yeah man the overall like look of this the visual appeal is very very nice so let me go ahead and go show you guys the function very very nice feedback right there like i'm telling you guys all right so we're gonna go ahead and set that to the side and then bust into the wax real quick like i said brand new this is a full indica and the funny thing is that this um watermelon cherry pie this is actually one of my favorite curated um one of my favorite curated strains from stizzy so shout out to um the person who made this i think their instagram handle is blaze blades by or i'll go ahead and put that up on the screen so you guys can go ahead and give it a follow if you guys would like all right so brandon you guys heard that seal cracker right go ahead and boom and you got that right there take that off and then give you guys a little bit of a close-up all right so yeah man this is a full untouched gram of wax so shout out to blades by aurora for blessing today's video and i got the nice little um what do you even call this a little picker dab or whatever the case is so we're gonna go ahead and get ourselves a nice chunk i'm gonna be loading it up i'm not gonna lie with a humongous dab every single time now this bowl it's actually pretty big now i do not recommend doing this every single time honestly this is just something that i'm doing for the purpose of this video just so i could get some fat nice um so i could finish the wax kind of quick all right so my plan is to put like three to four fat scoops in there and hopefully it'll be done but let's go ahead and my favorite setting you guys already know it's the purple slash violet color but um we're gonna start off with something a little bit light which is the green setting right so go ahead and hold that and that's already gonna start warming up for you guys and um man i need to prepare my lungs i need to prepare my lungs right so the e-rig if you guys haven't watched my videos on this um you could vape flour out of this and concentrate and it's super budget-friendly all right guys one of my favorite e-rigs out on the market personally for the cost it beats the puffco pro in my opinion if you guys haven't watched that video where i compare the two i'll put that down in the description but this one the function is out of this world like it kills you it kills you so i'm kind of scared because like you get really really fat ribs alright so we're starting off small though on the green setting and i hope you guys are doing good man i'm doing good i'm ready to get baked i'm scared though because i've never really smoked a full gram by myself in one sitting so nonetheless it vibrated so cheers dude this thing gives off super amazing flavor too oh yeah two hits right there now this is the first hit off of this device right now so that's why i'm not really getting too much vapor production you really have to like use it like the first dab in any e-rig that is you're not going to get the fattest clouds you kind of have to warm up the bowl and once it's warm you're gonna start getting fat clouds oh yeah that's super smooth honestly man this might this might be a breeze who knows fat clouds the water filtration on this is actually super super nice now you don't get the biggest chugs out of this but honestly you get a really really decent like you know feedback from the water because there's there's rigs out there let me give you guys a little bit of example right this right here is a really really cheap one and i don't really like the function of this i don't really i think it's like that the feedback of the airflow is just like too too much open airflow let me give you guys a little example like there's so much water in here yet still i'm not getting enough of that that super chugginess that i like right so that all depends on the type of glass that you use honestly and let me give you guys another example so this one right here is a leisure piece that i just copped recently and let me give you guys um example on this chug this is what i love to see that is chug central man this is one of the with um one of my most favorite rigs just because of how much it chugs so let me go ahead and hit this with another reheat real quick because we can't there's there is a little bit of a puddle in there but i don't want to waste anything just for the purpose of this video we're going to try to you know maximize the wax man we're not going to be taking weenie dabs but um yeah man like i said back to the chugs this one has a very very nice chug me personally that's what i call it like you know the little airflow that comes back i call it chugginess because i don't know it feels like a chugging water you feel me so look cheers for an e-rig that's actually really really freaking good right so man this thing is smacking bro so i'm not getting any more flavor off of this it's just straight up smoke so i'm gonna go ahead and clean this up and then we're gonna go ahead and load up another dab so far so good man i haven't i've coughed a little bit but not enough to the point where i'm like all right i'm not gonna be able to do this this is possible but remember guys remember to always keep your water at hand or gatorade or something that's gonna keep you hydrated because when you're coughing when you're smoking it actually really does deplete your body um i'm not really too sure in what way but i there's been every single time that i feel like i smoke i feel like i i lose a little bit of energy you know so keep your water handy man that way you're always hydrated so going in on dab number two all right guys and i'm doing this all on camera so you guys don't think like oh he's not really putting all the full graham so the next one's gonna be kind of a stinky binky big ass one dude look at this one right here right this one's actually pretty freaking huge um it is gonna fit in the bowl i believe yeah it's gonna fit in the bowl perfectly so the only thing though is if you put this much wax inside of the bowl you got to make sure that you keep it leveled because if not it's definitely going to spill and you do not want hot oil spilling over all right so next up i'm going to go ahead and keep it on the purple setting because um i don't know man actually no the green setting was actually perfect the purple one was for the reheat but the green one honestly i was getting a very very nice terpy flavor from that one so we're gonna go ahead and do green alright guys so while that heats up though i just want to know man how is your guys's day going my day is going actually pretty freaking good i hope you guys have been enjoying the content lately man because i i've actually been putting in uh effort like you know i feel like there's there was a slump and you guys and i feel like everybody noticed that i'm not gonna lie i feel like i noticed i feel like my like if people around me notice that i feel like you guys as fans as supporters notice that and it's okay you know it's okay to have slumps but i feel like what is most important is how you pick yourself back up how you come back from that slump and um because that's really what defines who you are man how strong you are right so this is not this vibrated so cheers one like this is my favorite stream because you get a lot of that cherry pie flavor i don't know what it is but that cherry pie flavor that they have in this is just phenomenal man massive clouds bro but nothing but terpenes now if or even the white setting i would have been getting a lot of clouds but i wouldn't be getting that terps now the like in my opinion is the terps are a lot more important than the actual you know vapor production because the terps in my opinion are what gets you faded now don't get me wrong you do need a decent cloud to get you faded but with this device you get the perfect cloud but it gives it really really brings out the terps right and the green setting at least so i'm getting a little reheat on this because it ended a little bit too early i was doing a little bit too much talking so i'm gonna go ahead and hit this man i'm starting to get bait i'm not gonna lie i'm starting to get that head change um but we were already like six dabs in i'm actually pretty faded man but either way cheers oh yeah it's starting to taste a little bit burnt for me now no more you know it's like you know when it doesn't have any more terpenes because it's just straight up smoke it doesn't really taste that good i'm not gonna lie dude it started to get hot boxed in here and i was like dude i started like choking up bro so i went to go turn on the ac made sure there was airflow in this damn freaking house because i was about to [ __ ] pass out bro so cleaned it out dude and i must say i all right so this is this is no no bs all right so i've had this rake for over a month used it multiple times and the bowl is freaking pearly freaking white i don't know if you guys can see that i'm pretty sure i don't know try to take a look in there but it's pearly white man this thing has lasted me so freaking long and i've taken at least 50 dabs out of it so it definitely definitely holds it has durability so i'm freaking faded though that's all i can say right now it's all i can think about is how my throat was just getting graped right now bro so that was technically only the second dab in and um we still have so much freaking more man uh i kind of want i really really want to beat this to challenge so this is what your boy's gonna do you see that i'm gonna just clear this [ __ ] out right now man i should i should honestly just title this video easiest way to waste your wax all right like this isn't even i mean it technically is a challenge though because i am getting super super big like i honestly am on another level right now um i'm baked dude like literally my head is on like in the next realm i i'm just freaking high as heck right now and all i want to do is just like listen to some music and just chill out but i gotta finish this video out i honestly don't even want to take this last dab i'm not even gonna cap but it is what it is um i'm gonna go ahead and take it on the blue setting just so i could get a lot of that freaking terpene profile and i don't really want to cough man my throat is killing me right now like the last two dabs that i put in here i literally reheated them to the point where the the oil was like burnt so that that says it all those first two dabs were killer so it's time to really just minimize it and taste the terps out of this because it's kicking my butt it's kicking my butt alright guys so i'm going to go ahead and actually we're supposed to be hitting it on the freaking blue setting and all you have to do is just hold it like i said and it's going to go ahead and start heating up and i need to go grab some water i'll be right back boy is back in time it still hasn't vibrated but dude this thing all right hold on i need to give you guys a little bit of a close-up i usually don't like pulling out my phone and doing close-ups but the bubbling of the freaking oil is just beautiful bro so i'm going to go ahead and give you guys a little bit of a close-up for that so you guys can really see how it looks it's just so eye appealing it's just so beautiful the oil just burning up in there it's just phenomenal all right it's a it's a beauty it's a beauty to see so this thing is ready and cheers guys oh yeah that's it the blue setting is just super freaking smooth all the way through nothing but terps oh yes oh yeah baby this might be my new favorite setting you're getting a really really nice cloud but nothing but terps bro this is fire alright that i'm not even going to reheat this dude that that was enjoyable as heck i'm not gonna lie now we did it we actually did it it was actually not that hard and all right think about it this way the first two i really really freaking burnt the crap out of the oil like it literally started tasting like it was on fire and then but this one it was just straight up terpene profiles and i must say like judging the the different temperature settings on the dip device i feel like it really does its job bro because when i was using it like i said on the green to purple setting i was getting really really fat clouds and it was like i was getting terps but it was in maximized terps right and as soon as you level it down to green temperature which is supposed to obviously like the lower the temperature the more terps you're gonna taste i started tasting the heck out of those terps like phenomenal so honestly this still to this day is my favorite e-rig i must say so we did it boys we did it we finished a whole stizzy gram go ahead and show you guys that right here in one sitting it was pretty fun i'm not gonna lie i did i did cough a little bit here and there but it is what it is that's the name of the game right so i'm baked really freaking big like honestly like i'm i'm happy like i'm there there's nothing that makes me happier than being baked as heck so with that being said i'm gonna go ahead and shut this video out here i hope you guys enjoyed it as much as i did all right guys if you did do me a favor hit that like hit those comments most importantly if you haven't already you yes you hit that subscribe button i know you're just hesitating i don't know why just hit that subscribe

and you don't know pliers they don't grab very well you can use a pick or a paper clip to pull the gasket out you grab the metal cap on the sides like this and rock it side to side pull then I'll come loose now sometimes the metal part will come out on its own like this and if that happens you just grab the top lip of this plastic cap and pull off and it will come off and that doesn't take a lot of force now the trick here to keep it from leaking is take this gasket out and you can refill it with juice you don't want to fill it up too much about maybe halfway up the clear plastic reservoir you don't want to get to the top of the tube and then put the gasket onto the cap before you reinstall it this will prevent it from leaking juice all over you making a mess inside your pocket we insert

legend but you\ndon't have the right equipment well let me tell you about two different units\nthat I personally like to vape cannabis hi I'm the busy budtender welcome back to\nmy channel and today as per the video title we're gonna be looking at two\npersonal to go portable vaporizers that I love which is the Arizer air 2 and the\nPAX 3 this video has been requested a decent amount a lot of you've been\nasking about which personal vaporizers I like and what I would recommend so I\nthought I would do a deep dive into what I think about both of these units if you\nwant to learn more about cannabis in general my own experiences my opinions\nand want to see my face make sure to subscribe to this channel and make sure\nyou hit that like button because youtube doesn't really like cannabis creators so\nthey're not that great with pushing us with the algorithm so anything that you\ncan do would help me so so much I really appreciate it let me preface this before\nwe start in the video by saying I'm by no means a tech expert but I am somewhat\nof a cannabis expert so hopefully I can explain this to you in ways that make\nsense to me and to you as well anyways the units so if you've been watching my\nchannel for a little bit you might know that I've been using the Arizer air 2\nin pretty much all of my videos this is my own personal baby I love it very very\nmuch and the PAX 3 it's actually my mom's so she's been lovely enough to\nlend this to me for the video and I've used it a bunch of time as my brother\nhas the exact same unit so I think that I can give a decent amount of clarity on\nwhich one I like better and their pros and cons I've actually have used this\nonce in a video that was my MedMen video when I was down in California so make\nsure to check that out if you're interested in learning more about\nCalifornia cannabis and with that I'm actually use that as a transition to\ntalk about this California vaporizer the PAX 3 is one of the many personal\nvaporizer units that the PAX organization makes out in California\ndesigned out over there likely made in China it is a really cute unit it's the third\none in their series of dry herb slash concentrate vaporizers and that is the\nfirst thing I want to address is the pax three does vaporize both dry\nflower and concentrates so dry flower being if you want to buy just a nug of\nweed you can grind it up and put it in this vaporizer and vape it but you can\nalso put in different types of concentrates which are hard to find in\nCanada but if you can find them you can definitely put that in here\nalso vaporize them as well the pax as you can tell it has a really really\nbeautiful simple design with just one little button up at the top which turns\non the unit it has a four temperature settings that are preset into the\nvaporizer itself but if you download their app you can do specific\ntemperature controls which I do want to talk about a little bit later in the\nvideo the other interesting thing that the PAX\ndoes it has a smart technology where it can tell when you're moving around and\nusing it versus when you put it down on a table and so when you're using it it\nsets it to the temperature that you've set it at but then when you put it down\nit goes into like a rest mode and so it actually brings down the temperature in\nthe vaporizer to make sure that your weed isn't vaped when it doesn't need to\nbe vaped and the exact opposite of California cannabis is Canadian cannabis\nand what better talk about than the Arizer air 2 the Arizer air 2 comes\nfrom the Arizer company which is based in waterloo love supporting Canadian\ncannabis companies of a Canadian tech so that's a huge huge plus for me the big\ndifference is with this bad boy is that as you can see let me turn on that was so long it has a really really\ncute little digital screen here so with that you can actually set the\ntemperature in a much easier way and you can get exact temperatures in both\nCelsius and Fahrenheit where as the Pax you have to have the app to do\nthat while the arizer air two does not have\na similar smart function to the PAX 3 it does turn off by itself after a duration\nof in in use not using not being used in use in use but let's get into the actual\nnitty-gritty details about both of these units so we can compare them on an\napples-to-apples basis the first and to me one of the most important things to\ntalk about when you are talking about vaporizers in general is how they\nactually vaporize the cannabis because there's 2/3 methods of how they do them\nand these are two very very different methods so talking about the pax first\nthis is a conduction type of oven so firstly in the pax itself beautiful\nsurface etc the oven is at the bottom so you just pop out this little guy right\nhere and you can see that is where you put your cannabis in the way that a\nconduction oven works for vaporizers it essentially means that the element which\nis the metal all around here is the unit that's getting heated up and on contact\nwith the cannabis is heating up the cannabis to a point where it gets\nvaporized this makes for a unit that's a lot easier to move around with it's it's\nmuch smaller piece of technology and it works pretty well obviously the only\nissues of the conduction type of vaporizer\nis that you have to pack in the weed really really tightly into this oven to\nmake sure that you get uniform heating throughout your entire brick of cannabis\nif you have like a little bit looser or don't pack it in this tightly you're\ngonna get around the edges a really like darker Brown type of already been vaped\nproduct but then in the middle you might get like a little bit of green so it's\nnot gonna be even and that's probably the biggest downfall that is the\nconduction type of vaporizer as for the Arizer air 2 I'm pretty sure\nfor almost all of the Arizer units if not all of them they actually have a\nhybrid technology oven so what that means is not only do they use the\nconduction type that the PAX uses you can see here\nin their chamber which is at the top you also have that little metal chamber\nwhere it can come in contact with the cannabis but they actually use another\nthing which is convection type so if you are familiar with ovens at all shout out to my women\nout there that was a joke please don't okay I'm a FEMINIST anyways\nif you're familiar with ovens at all you would know that they push through a hot\nair to heat up your food etc that is the same thing with a convection type of\noven for a vape essentially they push through that hot air through the\ncannabis to vaporize it and then you can inhale its it instead of having it have\nthat contact with the metal the reason that they use it for here is because it\ngives a more flavorful and uniform vape whereas if you just use a conduction\ntype of oven so in terms of the actual vapor quality I have to say that the\nArizer air two definitely takes the cake here that being said both of these are\nstill in the top of top in terms of personal portable vaporizers so if you\nhave a pax or if you're looking at the PAX the vaporizer quality it's not like\nit's not a differentiator to me at least in addition because it's gonna be a more\nof a uniform vape you actually can pack in like a little bit of a nug you\ndon't have to pack this in as tightly as you need for the PAX 3 to actually be\nable to enjoy the vaporizer essentially it's just gonna push through all that\nhot air throughout the entire little chamber and so you're gonna make sure\nthat most of your cannabis if not all of it gets used way better than in the PAX\nin talking about vaporizer quality I do also want to talk a little bit about\nease of use and how the actual vapor is brought in to you how you vape you\nbreathe it so with the pax 3 if you can see at the\ntop of the thing where you have a little button it was a tiny tiny tiny little\nslit here so that's actually where you breathe through it goes through the oven\nat the bottom it goes through the vaporizer and then you literally to go\nlike this and that's it SuperDuper simple whereas with the Arizer you have\nno mouthpiece you actually have to add in a separate thing so this little tube\nis really dirty I'm so sorry but this is the little mouthpiece where you actually\nadd your cannabis in here and you can see how much smaller that space is for\nthe cannabis than in the pax that just shows you how much less cannabis you\nneed to use this vaporizer than with the PAX but you essentially put in your weed\nup here pop it on like that and then now you can vaporize from this little tube\njust like that now the difference in these two different methods of using it\nmeans that on the one hand the PAX is gonna stay this small and stay this\ndiscreet and remain really really easy to use you can pack it in once and then\nthat's it you can take it around and that's all you need to do whereas but\nthe Arizer you need to add in this entire tube and maybe like have it on\nthe side that being said with this glass tube structure having the vapor go\nthrough it before you inhale actually makes the vape have time to cool down\nbefore entering your lungs making it a much more smooth and easier for the\nlungs experience then with the pax but the PAX are gonna get a little bit of a\nharsher warmer type of vape so it's kind of like which of the two evils would you\nrather have a little bit of a harsher vape or a little bit of an clunkier unit\nin addition with ease of use and it really really depends on who you ask\nwith which one is actually easier to use obviously I mean it's kind of a easy\ncomparison to say pax is almost like the mac of vaporizers versus arizer is\nalmost like a PC where it's just like a likely better unit in general but in\nterms of ease of use frankly for me I actually find the PAX is a little bit\neasier for a beginner because with the four temperature settings although you\ndon't get that pinpointed temperature control that you get with the Arizer\nit's really really simple you've started out on level one and you see the little\nlight turn into level one and you're like okay once that's done we want total\nto level three level four whereas for the Arizer even I sometime\nforget what the lowest temperature I like is I just find it a little bit\nclunky er to change the temperature setting and for me to remember every\nsingle time that oh I like 330 degrees Fahrenheit than it is to just have four\nbuilt-in temperature settings so in terms of ease of use\nfrankly I'd say the PAX is my favorite in that you don't have to add anything\nto this you just pack it in at the bottom and then you have the four\ntemperature control settings and that's all you really need\nwhereas with here you might need to have a little more finesse speaking of ease\nof use I think another really really important thing is portability\nconsidering both of these are portable vaporizers so which one is easier for\nthat I'm not even going to talk about the pax you can you can tell this can\nfit in your pocket it's cute she's chic in terms of the Arizer though not only\ndo you have the little clunky unit that you have to add in but I mean it comes\nwith this handy little unit here where you can put your your vaporizer\nhere you got your two chambers in the side for putting in tubes of cannabis if\nyou'd like and then it hooks onto your belt loop like this I hope you think\nthat's a joke because it is I think that this is I\ndon't like it I you well it's like this looks like I'm about to go on a hike I\ndon't know it's great if you want to have two different types of weed here if\nyou want to have like refills that you can take around with you but frankly I\nunless you're like a super intense person you need like a bunch of weed on\nyou like this you're probably fine with just using the PAX 3 and having that one\noven that's perfectly packed in with like a decent amount of weed so in terms\nof portability I got to say the pax also wins here for the size I mean you\ncan also really just tell like the pax is just it's a cute really really small\nunit whereas the Arizer again you have to add in this other little unit to it\nso for size pax wins also I know that the PAX is won in back-to-back\ncategories right now but like don't worry the Arizer it's gonna have\nredemption speaking of redemption this is where the pax loses every single time\nand that is on price while the PAX 3 is gonna take you down a\nsolid $320 if it's not on sale and you don't know someone who can get it for\nyou cheaper the arizer air 2 it actually used to be roughly around 320 like they\nwere roughly in the same ballpark but they've actually lowered its price to\ntwo hundred and fifteen dollars so you're essentially saving like a hundred\ndollars on a better vaporizer experience and relatively similar stats so frankly\nlike the price point yeah I know this is pretty but it's pricey essentially when\nyou're buying the packs you're paying for the convenience and you're paying\nfor its beauty and that's where the three hundred and twenty dollars comes\nin with the Arizer you're paying for really good manufacturing you're paying\nfor being able to change the temperature in an easier way and it's likely more of\nlike a connoisseur type unit where you really want to preserve the integrity of\nyour cannabis in terms of battery life while they're roughly batting around\nlike 1.5 hours off of a full charge the one issue that the PAX has which again\nlike Apple in general is that you can't take out the battery whereas for the\nArizer you can get another battery and you can pop this in that being said I've\nalso literally never done that I pretty much just recharge this normally I've\nnever had like a second battery for it so I can't really talk about how\nconvenient that would be but it's nice to have that if you want that type of\nbattery life if you need more the last thing I want to talk about which is\nprobably the most boring is their charging so with the PAX like an Apple computer\nthey have their own proprietary beautiful charging which is great\nbecause it looks really really cute with the pax but it's annoying because you\ncan't use it for literally anything else whereas for the Arizer like a PC it uses\na more Universal charging so it has the micro USB which goes in like this it's\nthe same one that I have for my GoPro the same one that I have for a lot of\nother different electronics and that's just really really handy all in all I think you might be able to\nsee what I'm kind of trying to say in this video but essentially if you are a\nperson who buys macs because you want it to look pretty and you don't care that\nyou don't have as much customization and you just want ease of use and you don't\nmind spending extra for it the pax is probably the unit for you it's easy I\ndefinitely recommend it to people if they're looking for something that is\ndiscrete and it's kind of like a little bit of a flex but if you're looking for\nsomething that's a little bit more of a normal price range something that you're\ngonna get a better vaporizer experience in general and has that customization\nability custom is custom nation but regardless I would definitely recommend\nany of the Arizer units but specifically the Arizer air 2 is just a perfect\nlittle unit for a personal or for a couple etc well let me know I mean I\nknow that a lot of people have very specific opinions about the pax so let\nme know what you guys think about both of these units if you have them if\nyou've tried them which one you covet more let me know in the comments down\nbelow let me know if this kind of video is something that you want to see in the\nfuture if you want more topics about different types of vaporizers or\ncannabis technology I'd love to do a series or something on like tabletop\nvaporizers I think that'd be super interesting so let me know if that's\nsomething that you're interested in anyways regardless of which vaporizer\nyou use or if you haven't even made the purchase yet I'm just happy that you\nmade it to this video so thank you so much for joining me\nI'm your busy budtender and I will see you in my next video oh my god the geese\nare outside they're really cute they're on the hill... vape god", "3muad8dNT44": "okay we're going to talk about today is how to reset your pax three to factory reset so basically what you got to do you got to turn the yeah the PAX 3 on okay once it's on and heat up to a green once you see it and it's coming up okay let her hear up a bit okay then what we're going to do is once it gets into green okay we're going to press and hold the button okay now it doesn't matter where what temperature it is and next what we want to do is you want to hold the PAX three the long ways often in the right hand and the mouthpiece and the left so left hand where the mouthpieces and where the oven is on the right hand and all you got to do right now is rotate it ten times one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten and it will blink white and you are good to go and it automatically will will shuts itself off and now you're good to go you're factory reset all you got to do now is press the one button on top leather here up and you're good to go thank you", "w_wRAsMRUiA": "I just wanted to do a quick video to explain the difference between the refillable pods and the pods and true clear the true clear syringes and what people are asking about on there here is the true leave true pod these are the ones that they saw us for $94 that are 600 no 800 milligrams they slide into the true stick we've ate them great $94 is a lot when I can buy this for 60 so if I can buy this for 60 I'd much rather have that this is the one I've already done I'm going to demonstrate the pods this untwists like so the syringe that we need to remove the entire housing of the syringe so unscrew that plastic piece if this isn't already loose give it a twist pop it off comes right off and remind you whether you've got an empty syringe or a full syringe even if you've pulled back a little bit there's going to be some stickiness now here's this and I guess I would like to show you how well that fits in there and it's made to go in there you insert you put it on that side and take it out you insert and it takes an entire it will hold an entire trooper syringe a full Dahlia this is the important part your true clear and this so if you need to run it under warm water beforehand you shouldn't mine's just sticky because it was used it's a little cumbersome but I can now see the tip of my syringe is up to the tip of this little Bell point this is the injection nozzle I am now 100% extremely comfortable sticking that in there if I need to run it under warm water to loosen it I will and then I'll dab it on a microfiber cloth or not literally dab smoke but put it in an insert and it really isn't as bad as it it seems to be wanting to show like it is any of any questions you can post and I will answer the best I can't thanks", "UKrzbdNqCqo": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to a new product review at Hail Mary Jane comm [Music] here we have the most popular vaporizer out there the PAX 3 we have to admit the PAX 3 has well earned its reputation it's small beautiful discreet and produces a good dense and tasty vapor in this video we'll go through all its specs and hidden bits so make sure not to miss it we have two packaging options available the device only and the complete kit the complete kit is the one to go for if you're looking for a dual vaporizer to use with both drier herbs and concentrates as you can see it comes in a simple and good-looking package it includes the packs vaporizer the charging dock and USB cable a cleaning kit the packs multi-tool two mouthpieces the half pack oven lid a concentrate insert a useful Quick Start Guide and a carrying pouch the device only as the name says includes the PAX vaporizer and the charging dock and USB cable it's worth to mention that when buying the complete kit you can find eight different color options with gloss or matte finish and three different engravings meanwhile when getting the basic kit you can only choose the matte finish colors first impressions are really good pax labs puts a lot of effort into design packaging build quality and that's something noticeable when the products are in our hands the PAX 3 is a really sleek and cool-looking device it makes you want to carry it around even if you don't babe with a total weight of only 93 grams making it one of the lightest vaporizers available on the market now also one thing we find important is how easy it is to use it only has one button and you don't really need anything else this being said you can also connect the PAX 3 to your smartphone via bluetooth to unlock all the different configurations available the oven is at the bottom of the device it's covered by a magnetic lid that closes perfectly and it's really easy to sit in place the oven as we can see is pretty big you can fit up to 0.4 grams of dry herbs or 0.2 grams using the half oven lid included in the complete kit the PAX 3 also comes with the addition of a concentrates unit the complete kit also comes with a raised mouthpiece but we prefer the small one as the PAX 3 is a conduction vaporizer in order to get the best result we should finally grind our herbs and pack them pretty tight to tighten the herbs inside the oven we can use the multi-tool included in the complete kit this will help us get a more even use of our buds as we've mentioned before the PAX 3 is really simple to use to turn it on you just have to press the upper button once and the vaporizer will vibrate and we'll turn the X lights purple which means it's heating it takes about 16 seconds to heat the PAX 3 will vibrate again and the lights will turn green to let us know it's ready if we're not using the app we can choose between four temperature presets by holding the power button for two seconds we have one green LED which means 360 degrees Fahrenheit two yellow LEDs which means two hundred and eighty degrees Fahrenheit three orange LEDs which means four hundred degrees Fahrenheit and four red LEDs which is 420 degrees Fahrenheit one great addition to the PAX 3 compared to the PAX 2 is the smartphone app available for both Android and iOS with it you can unlock the full features of the vaporizer you can change the temperature degree by degree in the whole spectrum between 360 and 420 degrees Fahrenheit you can modify the LED brightness and color update your vaporizer settings access the three different games and select four predefined heating profiles boost maintaining the vaporizer hotter for longer without activating the auto cooling efficiency increasing the vaping temperatures throughout the session in order to increase your vaping efficiency stealth cooling the vaporizer faster and setting the LED brightness lower in order to increase the discreteness and flavor increasing the flavor and battery life heating only when needed overall using the smartphone app is easy and intuitive letting us get the best out of your vaporizer getting back to the games they're quite fun and can produce good laps in group sessions to access the games we can either use the app or rotate the device three times the three games available are packed spin packs run and pack says we leave this to you to find them and discover them overall the vaping quality is as good as it gets with conduction vaporizers there isn't much room to improve here it produces a dense and tasty vapor letting us produce big clouds if we choose the highest temperature the PAX 3 comes with the non-replaceable built-in battery the battery life has also been improved in the new PAX 3 now we're able to get approximately 90 minutes of usage with one full charge and it takes about the same time to fully charge from dead which is quite good charging is pretty fancy with the magnetic charging dock but it's mean downside is that we can't use the PAX 3 while charging a cool feature of the PAX 3 is that if you want to know the battery level you just have to shake the device cleaning the PAX 3 is an easy task after every session we should empty the oven and quickly brush it with the cleaning brush and pipe cleaners included in the package don't forget to also clean the mouthpiece if we feel like the draw resistance is increasing we have to remove the mouthpiece and clean the vapor path using the pipe cleaner and some isopropyl alcohol pushing it until the oven screen pops out [Music] and that's it thank you very much for watching our review click on the links below if you'd like to read our full review or buy the packs three also if you liked our review don't forget to subscribe to our channel or watch these recommended videos we're working on many more product reviews that you will love", "ZH3KJxfR2lU": "yes so this is the pack story vaporizer it's a vaporizer that I was very excited about sold my PAX 2 instantly to fund buying one of these and I'm kind of glad I didn't so when you open the box I mean this is like aa Smashbox feels like a high-end electronic box how crisis thick is the original pax to packaging so when you open it up got your reminder to register as well as info for the app at the point that I'm making this video the application is not up and running it is in the App Store but it's not up and running which kind of sucks because I don't know what it can do and in the box you have the vaporizer [Music] lift this up you have the charger and the included USB cable that you plug into here and there's also a space to still charge it using the original pax one wall charger which does charge the device way faster than the USB cord will so you have the magnetic charger that you just dock this device onto and it will charge up they say charging time is reduced I've noticed charging time as a couple hours the vape will generally last nearly all day on a charge with heavy use are the way that I use it so I'm pretty impressed with that on the other side you have the accessories so you have the keychain you have the raised mouthpiece the half pack oven lid the oil cane and extra screens in here you have the warranty info as well also a maintenance kit which has some rubbing alcohol art has some isopropyl alcohol and some pipe cleaners so down to the device the finish is a lot different than the PAX 2 it's a really glossy smooth filling finish it is a fingerprint magnet it might be able to get scratched easy but I don't really mind I keep the pocket the packs in my pocket all day and yeah I mean I don't really care about the scratches too much and when you look at it the dimensions are exactly the same as the packs to the mouthpiece is exactly the same as you can see here if you use the PAX 2 that mouthpiece is exactly the same the raised mouthpiece they did switch up before it had 2 holes that would lead up to here so it looks like they just made one hole with the metal pin on the middle to make sure that it activates the button when you press it and as far as accessories the accessory that I was the most excited about was the oil can and I was super duper duper excited about this as you see on the box the PAX has always been a dry herb vaporizer but now they have extract at it and that's because of this oil can so actually does things in a great fashion when I saw that the oil can was coming I was like oh [ __ ] yeah the oil can so that's the real reason why I wanted to get the PAX 3 was the ability to use it with concentrates and I'm not that impressed so looking at this oil can it does slide off of the oven lid which is a good thing because it does allow you to I so soak this to get it all the way clean so you open it up there's two holes in here and as you can see I have some pulled up oil at the bottom and that's typically what the oil does you get a few wispy hits then it'll pull up at the bottom like that and just really become unusable so if you like wasting your stuff yeah then use this oil can but other than that I probably won't be using it too much more and when you place the oil can into the oven lid it does not sit flush so as you can see there is a slight gap there I believe that's to help with the airflow because that'll make it go in the sides then up through the here and it'll give you much better airflow with the oil and I guess that would make it work better than it normally would but yeah I mean I don't like this and as far as the heat up times it is advertised to have a heat up time of 15 seconds that is probably true the first pedal for the second pedal it's about 20 seconds for the third pedal it's 25 seconds for the fourth pedal it's about 30 seconds of heat of time needed to heat this up I also feel like that's kind of gimmicky it just feels like the light turns green faster but it still takes roughly the same time for it to start producing the kind of vapour that you would want to see it produce as far as air flow they did not do anything to increase the pax airflow which is something that I felt like they should have did at least maybe make a minor tweak to try to get better air flow out of it to generate bigger hits so go ahead and load this thing up real quick turn it on see what happens [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] very tasty but yeah like I said the performance is not noticeably different from the PAX 3 as far as vapor quality taste performance so if I had a PAX 2 I'd probably keep it way to the packs for came out since you still do have that 10 year warranty if you don't have a pax product I would suggest picking this one up because you do get all the latest and greatest goodies but for me it's not really much different it's kind of like the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6s this has minor tweaks and upgrades so minor and that's the key word here very minor it's not anything life-changing it's not anything that it didn't it didn't I don't feel like it may met my expectations as far as excitement like I pretty much at this point feel like I can take it or leave it yeah I pretty much feel like I could take it or leave it I'll probably be holding out for The DaVinci the IQ and make that my official purchase because it does seem leaps and bounds better than the ascent so yeah that's my thought on the pax 3 like I said I would do a session using the oil camp but I don't really want to waste the oil it's not really that good I mean it's seriously if it's not that good it's like when every single other dry herb vaporizer tries to make a elcan or concentrate insert and it doesn't work that well that's exactly what you're going to be getting from this so it's just something half-assed so I could really do without it yeah that's my thought on the PAX 3 thanks for watching", "9at3Iiw5VPs": "[Music] hello and welcome to the north coast journal preview where we take a look at the stories being followed in the upcoming edition of the north coast journal i'm your host dave frank and i'm joined by north coast journal's news editor thad greenson and arts and features editor jennifer from mikko cahill welcome guys david how are you doing right on doing well a little sunshine out there today and got some good news friends family news about more vaccines in the pipeline so i think people are starting to look towards that fourth of july weekend as a potentially uh you know fulfilling and rewarding date on the calendar where we might actually have some degree of normalcy so hopefully that's permeating your guys lives as well fingers crossed yeah stay optimistic right as best we can do um so that let's dive right in what's going on on the cover this week of the north coast journal well this week is our annual cannabis issue so um it is about all things uh all all things cannabis news um recently um but occupying the actual cover space of the paper is a story um following up on some reporting we did a couple years ago about the roanoke park public safety department to the police department at roener park and um some cannabis interdiction activities they'd been doing that became raised a lot of questions from the article it looks like there's been a federal indictment handed down on one of the local police departments in the 101 corridor can you tell us a little bit about the background on that and kind of what brought us to this point yeah so two two officers have been indicted in the case so far um and their indictments were unsealed friday um and so that's a lot of the documentation was was the actual charging document that we built the story on but the story takes root back in um in december of 2017 when a man by the name of zeke flatton actually a movie producer was looking to dabble in the cannabis industry visited humboldt county bought three pounds of cannabis and was transporting it south to a lab in the bay area for testing when he claimed that he was pulled over by an unmarked suv and by two officers who were wearing kind of tactical gear but no badges no name no name tags no patches kind of affiliating them with a specific agency they identified themselves as being with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and um asked if he was carrying cannabis he said he was asked to search the vehicle found the three pounds and basically said we're taking these you can expect to receive a letter from washington dc and we're going to go now um and zeke flatten is is a former cop himself um and um and a really sharp guy i mean just from interviewing him he's one of these people who has a pretty meticulous memory and an eye for detail and he said that it just didn't feel right um something felt really off about the stop he noticed that the officers never ran he gave them his license but they never ran his name um back to dispatch to see if you know there was any warrants or anything out for him didn't seem to run the license plate of his car um and didn't give him a receipt for the seizure of his cannabis um and so he said pretty quickly he came to feel that he was robbed he also noticed that while they said they were from a federal federal agency the car that they were driving had california exempt license plates which didn't line up again he's a pretty sharp guy who picks up on these details and so um he pretty quickly came to feel that he'd been robbed by what he figured were actual law enforcement officers but out acting outside the scope of their duties so he made a complaint to the fbi um and to the mendocino county sheriff's office because the traffic stop happened in mendocino um and that's kind of what got this ball rolling that now um you know two pl two and almost two and a half years later has resulted in these indictments almost three and a half years later so one of the things that he said was that um it wasn't the actual loss of value um that really triggered this it was his thoughts about something bigger must have been going on if this is how he was getting treated that maybe other people were getting treated the same way so you said he reached out to federal um law enforcement but there were he also reached out to local media is that right and kind of what element did local media play in bringing the story you know the momentum that built around this original complaint yeah it played a huge role and certainly zeke zeke flattened feels like it was it was crucial that it was really the tipping point um but i guess to your first point yeah he said that he really felt like um it wasn't the loss of three thousand dollars worth of weed it was the the violation and as somebody who'd been a police officer previously i mean he kind of understood that oath of office and he also just started wondering like if these guys are so brazen that they are going to impersonate federal officers outside of their jurisdiction and stop me in broad daylight and steal my weed like what else are they doing and who else are they doing this type of thing too um so worry you know he said that he made the complaint to the fbi and felt like it was initially kind of taken seriously or whatever but he was worried that it would just kind of die quietly that it would make it from kind of the the the main fbi office to the field office and then just kind of be quietly go away and so he decided um i think about a month after making the complaint to contact kim kemp a reporter based in southern humboldt and um to her credit she she took it very seriously um and um and started you know vetting his story and making calls and one of the last calls that she made before kind of going public with his allegations um was a call to the to atf just saying hey did you have officers in the field this day in this area and were you involved in this traffic stop and um while some of the other agencies had kind of been um i'd say a little bit evasive or a little bit squirrely or not really you know didn't seem terribly interested in her inquiries um atf did and atf i think seems like really kind of its ears perked up but the the idea that somebody might be out there impersonating its officers and so not only did they they give a statement to kim but they also um immediately kind of reached out to zeke and asked if they could contact zlatan and i think he said that they were on the phone with him within an hour of kim contacting them um and then come to find out they then exerted some pressure it sounds like on the fbi and on local agencies to kind of saying hey this is something that needs to be taken um seriously and and zeke really believes that that you know kim's inquiry and her subsequent reporting really got this ball rolling um and after she reported i think one or two stories on um on zeke's allegations um the um the lead roner park officer um who's been indicted uh or former officer uh jc tatum who headed the the roanoke park interdiction team um took a really kind of interesting step of issuing a press release kind of in response to kim's coverage trying to explain away zeke's allegations um and um the fbi the f the indictment certainly says that this was a fraudulent press release in a fraudulent police report designed to kind of cover his tracks um that's the allegation anyway um but there were some things that just didn't match up about the press release and from just a journalist who's seen gobs and gobs of law enforcement press release releases it just was strange it didn't have an exact date it didn't have an exact time it didn't identify the kind of car zeke was driving it didn't name him you know didn't have his name in the press release didn't identify a quantity of marijuana seized it was just it was atypical and i think a lot of people noticed that and then it brought a new attention to this case so the uh the charges are cons for two officers tatum and huffaker are conspiracy to commit extortion under the color of official rights and then officer tatum former officer tatum also faces additional charges of falsifying records in a federal investigation in order to cover up alleged theft right so what and then also a charge of tax evasion as well oh right exactly yeah like uh al capone the tax man will always get you um so you know what kind of transpired in this investigation um that that you know what are some of the elements of the story that kind of sent out to you like that you said he was the head of a of a interdiction task force yeah and so yeah what what are some of the details that kind of stand out in terms of the 101 court or interdiction team so i think there's three things i'd want to hit on there the first it was actually not in in the indictment but was uncovered by kqed in an investigation it did after kim kemp's initial reporting in this um and they requested gobs and gobs of records from from roanoke park and and they found two things that were kind of interesting one is that roanoke park was kind of nationally awarded for its interdiction efforts at the time um for just the amount of the quantities of cannabis it was seizing and the amounts of cash it was seizing this was from a law enforcement perspective an enormously effective interdiction team um headed by tatum and then um they found that um basically when when a law enforcement agency seizes say 50 pounds of cannabis it's kind of impractical to expect them that they're just going to hold all that as evidence until the case goes to trial and so what they do in these large drug seizure cases is they hold on to a sample of it but then they destroy the rest and there's a really meticulous process they have to follow to do this of getting a court um destruction order and then they're supposed to you know um transfer the the drugs to a specific officer who's then um uh kind of ordered to destroy them in a very specific way and then document it with a destruction um with destruction documentation and so what kqed found is that for at least 800 pounds of cannabis over like a two-year period rohnert park was unable to actually show documentation that it was destroyed they had court orders telling um the department to destroy it and they had documentation that it had been handed off to jc tatum the sergeant in control of such things but there was no actual you know proof that it had been destroyed so that raised a lot of questions um then in the um in the indictment itself um federal agents um reviewed lots of body camera footage from the roanoke park police department and they were able to document numerous cases i think they identified five or six of them in the actual indictment itself but where officers seized cannabis or cash from drivers i think tatum was involved in all these traffic stops and did not provide them with any documentation did not provide for them with a seizure receipt and then also um for which the agents were unable to find any other documentation of this traffic stop so within roanoke park police records it was as if the stop had never happened it never existed there's no police report attached to it or anything like that um but they have this footage of them actually taking custody of cannabis from people um so that raised a lot of questions and then the last aspect is just the irs investigation um the irs did what seems like a pretty exhaustive investigation over several years of um officer sergeant tatum's um financial records and what they claim to have found is um hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash deposits um into his bank his and his wife's bank accounts and family members bank accounts um all of them in sums less than ten thousand dollars which and if you over if you deposit over ten thousand dollars in cash the bank is required to report that to the irs and so the they're alleging that this is very much a pattern of somebody trying to conceal illicit profits um and so all of these three things together i think really raised questions about the scope of what was happening in roanoke park um over this time period and um while the indictment is really related to two specific traffic stops in december um and um and then for um you know for sergeant tatum the um you know the tax evasion and the attempt to cover up as well i think the um other information indictment really kind of leads one to believe there might be other shoes to drop and there might be other actions coming gotcha well there's so much more in the article um hopefully people check it out thank you for sharing uh your insights on this with us um i know these officers are facing a lot of time and and it you know we'll see how it plays out and we'll see how you know i'm sure you guys will follow it down its uh path um yeah so what one other thing i wanted to ask you about um there today actually breaking news uh happy st patrick's day there's breaking news in the sacramento bee about the eureka police department a few officers communications can you tell us real briefly a little bit about that breaking story yeah real briefly um a reporter for the sacramento bee um obtained from from an unnamed source um screenshots of group text chats with six epd officers that include um just lots of very vile things uh misogynistic and um really dehumanizing language um directed at uh people that um that these officers were in charge of protecting and serving so it really raises a lot of pretty alarming questions absolutely something that we at the journal are following up on as we speak and we'll continue to do so and hopefully uh bring more of that to light well fantastic thank you yeah that's available online like like north coast journal sacramento b's also online check it out um how about you jennifer what's going on this week on the arts and features beat with you you know so for our cannabis issue um i you know i had wanted to include something about you know people infusing foods with cannabis for a while but i'm not sure if you're familiar with jessica ashley silva if you um she's written for us before she covered the guy fieri barbecue contest at the fair the sweaty meat fest i believe she called it and um i i saw that she had posted a while ago a fail and you know i love a food fail but this was an infusion fail and so i asked her to jump in and write about it and also i want to say that i feel partly responsible for this fail um i asked jessica to write about a cannabis pairing dinner which was a virtual event usually you know cannabis dinners you go and you get a whole infused multi-course meal that i don't know how you get home from but um you know when people do these really fancy-schmancy meals infused with cannabis but this was a virtual one given our times and so she cooked at home along with a chef who was you know using fancy oils and swirling things on dishes and it was you know very very fancy and it it gave her a sense of maybe hubris and so she and some friends dove into some cannabis cooking and everything was going great and then she had this very cheesy burger that was so great on this some sort of infused burger thing and then she was like why don't i just make some infused cheese and she made this attempt and to her credit she made a really beautifully formed three fresh mozzarella balls and um you know they look great if you look at it in black and white if you look at it in color and she wrote about the you know the the hubris the fall the tragic outcome of trying to infuse it because it came out sort of the color of silly putty sort of a brown gray unpleasant and um when she described trying it she was like you don't taste brown please don't taste brown please and it tasted so brown it tasted as she she describes it as tasting like dirt hay and dead plants yeah and then of course you know like a good you know growth raised in the right family she tried not to throw out food and she tried to apply it to a pizza with a lot of garlicky pesto and hope no no nothing nothing could cover the taste of of swamp from that mozzarella but um you know she talks about sort of the basics of of how you infuse food and um it was a learning experience for me to read about um but also i really like her attitude um uh if you're if you're in humble foodies you know her it was one of the admins and um she's very funny and even honestly i always enjoy when she you know blocks someone or kicks them off of the side it's always great fun but she talks about the value of food fails and most of the time on something like humble foodies we're sharing you know our successes look at this amazing rack of lamb i made look at this fantastic fettuccine i made and people don't really share like oh jesus what did i do to this poor piece of meat but here she is and she was saying that she learned something which is that okay mistakes were made and here's what she could do instead next time like maybe a flavorless uh instead of working directly from flour maybe she could use you know a flavorless extract would be better next time or you know maybe mozzarella is meant to just be a mozzarella right it has that cure maybe we infuse other things um but she you know she took it as a learning experience and she also was like well you know what i did figure out how to make some cheese so hopefully she'll be back to do that again but um yeah if you've if you've ever tried failed or tried to smile through someone else's failed infusion meal i strongly recommend it i mean the only thing that i forgot to ask her is if it's i mean i would imagine that the thc quality was still there but despite that i think um despite the effects of cannabis it didn't make her enjoy it anymore which is too bad that's yeah which you know i i get the boost of um the boost of enjoyment that people get from you know having cannabis infused foods i i totally get the draw if it's a tenth of what i experienced when i was pregnant then i don't know why everyone's not eating cannabis infused food all the time but other than having to drive um but yeah it's a fun read and you should definitely check it out and definitely not do what she did that is amazing yeah so it sounds like mozzarella should be left as mozzarella you don't need to infuse it it's kind of i mean isn't there already a high to cheese isn't cheese its own drug so it takes more and more yeah speaking of uh own drug um you did a satirical piece maybe not so satirical uh cannabis strains we need in 2021 and wish were real tell us a little bit about that because that is hysterical i'm gonna say it's only barely satirical because um so i've done this for a few years in a row and i have had a couple of people who were like so i don't understand where can you buy these yes actually there isn't one that makes you feel like a disney princess that's not real i made it up um what i what i like to do is go through and look at real strains and look at their descriptions and how they describe the crosses and whatnot and look at some of the really hilarious names that they have and i must say that one of the challenges is coming up with names that aren't already strains so you know when i was looking up like there's a there's a strain that um a fake string that is for people who are really upset about dr seuss you know if you're like really upset about it which relax relax what happened on mulberries or what was it i can't what i saw on mulberry street i have a copy it's not great it's no cat in the hat but people are so upset about not making more of them you know the ones that are out there are out there but people are so upset about and i thought well i should have a strain that helps people cope with that stress and i looked up and i could not believe there isn't already a strain called who hash [Music] but evidently an opportunity missed um and there are a few other ones that are some of them that are meant to help you through the stress of the pandemic like darth vaxxer which is sort you know sort of my little tribute to thaad who is a very big star wars fan as you can see from his background um and uh legion of zoom which is meant to help you feel more more like you're really in the room with people when you're even on screen um which i personally don't want [Laughter] but some people might you know it can be very draining having all your interactions remotely she says as she's having a skype conversation with someone that she used to sit in a studio with truth but it's fun to do so there's one um q-tips which i think was really funny about q and on and there's some other contemporary uh references but others are just more like um you know broadly uh appealing i suppose like tell us about sofa cushion uh sofa cushion is for when you just need to ride out the rest of the pandemic just keeping it mellow you know a lot of people have tried to be really productive during this and personally i feel that's a mistake it's been you know it's been so emotionally and mentally taxing for us to go through the ups and downs and the sort of national grief and personal grief and all those things and yet we have all these things telling us you need to hustle you need to be working on your side gig you need to be and some of that is survival financially but some of it is just the social pressure of always be productive always be doing something and so this particular strain allows you to just uh what do i have that it's it's um a couple of indica strains inertia and lazy boy to help you sink deeper and deeper into your couch until you become one with it which you know let me help you with that tap into your inner fauchy one kenobi yes somebody feel free if people want to make these strains um you know just send me a small fee and we'll be good yeah you got to trademark that stuff well right on there's a lot more in that article definitely folks check it out that's just about going to do it for us this week it flies by unfortunately uh north coast journal is available on newsstands now available online uh pick one up stay informed stay safe jennifer thank you both so much and we'll see you guys again next week see you next week [Applause] do [Applause] you", "WLD7kW_uVEY": "- I don't know how any\nof this works at all. So, where do you put the fluid, why do you need power? I know nothing about this. - Yup, that's exactly what I thought. What the heck is a Juul? - What is a Juul? A Juul is a closed-loop vape system. It consists of a battery\nand a pre-filled pod. Pre-filled pod is filled with e-liquid with a high nicotine volume. A Juul is very easy to use, all you do is put the\npod in and vape away. - Lots of high school kids\nwould never think of smoking. They've grown up with anti-tobacco ads. - [Girl] With this contract, I relinquish part of my freedom, to you. - [Kavitha] The scary thing\nis they don't think of vaping as smoking a cigarette or as smoking. - [Boy] Vaping can deliver\nnicotine to your brain. - It is true that Juuls don't have a lot of the toxic chemicals\nthat say a cigarette has, but a tiny Juul pod has the\nequivalent amount of nicotine that's contained in an\nentire pack of cigarettes. So, why would kids Juul? - They love the flavors. - I've heard a lot of kids say like, just gives them a quick buzz. They feel good after they do it. - You see the younger celebrities, they're holding a Juul in their hand and everyone on Snapchat\nwill like post videos of them juuling. They just find it as a way to be cool. - If you have money, you\ncan get it super easy. Just ask anyone. - One of the things that makes\nit really hard for educators is that Juuls are really easy to hide. - So, if I'm a student\nand not dressed like this, but if I have a pocket or if I, I put it right here. - Juuls look so similar to\nsay thumb drives, right? It's really easy to get confused and of course, kids\ntake advantage of this. So, a lot of students told me about a game they play in class, where a student can go up to a teacher, who has no idea what a Juul is, and say hey, I've got my\npresentation on this thumb drive, can I charge it on your computer, please? Because, I really need to have it. And then, they go ahead\nand charge their Juul on the teacher's computer\nand teachers have no idea. - It's very tricky, it's\nmade to be very tricky, to trick us, so it's therefore\ndifficult as teachers to know if they're actually vaping. - So, what's a teacher to do? Here is some of the things you can look for in your classroom. - So, your typical high\nschool bathroom, right? - Frequent or long bathroom breaks. A lot of kids go to the bathroom and then they hang out juuling. In fact, it's become so common, that schools across\nthe country have either cut down on the number of\nbathrooms that are open, teachers may monitor the bathroom, sometimes even principals. - You might have five or six kids hanging out in here with\nthe door closed and vaping. - Watch out for kids who cover\ntheir face with their hands, who sometimes have sleeves\nnext to their nose, who put their head down often, and maybe they just hide,\nthey're teenagers, right? But it could be that\nthey're vaping in class. A principal I spoke to said one of the most\neffective methods he used was really involving parents. So, for example, he didn't just talk to\nkids about the problem, he had after school seminars\nwhere he would invite parents and then it grew even bigger, it wasn't just parents, he actually invited the entire community, so that there were lots of\nsets of eyes on his students. And parents are still really influential in their teen's life, I mean just listen to what this one kid, Zane, said to me. - My momma don't play that. (kids laughing) It's that simple. - [Kavitha] Your mom is a very smart one. - Yeah, my mom would kill me too.", "mKrqfPOIWSU": "yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's let's change that welcome everybody this is anthony with boveda joined today by cody ziering with pac case how the hell are you buddy i'm good i'm good i'm coming off vacation so i'm still uh still a little bit of vacation mode um which is always a fun little area to be in no doubt uh best part about vacation is on the way their worst part of vacation is coming back to the office and seeing 18 000 emails waiting for you it happens all the time i know yeah so it's just been pitchforking out of that but um things are good yeah there's a lot going on here a lot of things to talk about today absolutely industry's booming boveda is booming pack cases booming let's get to it where do you want to start i mean you want to start with i guess how we kind of ran into each other years ago yeah absolutely this has been a long time coming no doubt um where was that i think mj biz vegas 2017 maybe yeah okay um yeah you guys what launched in 2016. just about yeah we uh we we came up with the idea very very early on like january 2nd 2016 we were still working for a vertically integrated cannabis company right near aspen colorado great experience gave us great insight into the industry and really what the cannabis market kind of demands uh and everything has come from there it was like it was one of my first very first trade shows i think when i walked over and saw you guys um it was a funny story we we bumped into you uh quite literally um saw your shirt and were like oh we know bobito we love that and we just started talking with you brett and i actually got invited brett's my business partner everybody in case uh nobody nobody knew that uh brettgelfan shout out to you buddy um brett and i actually went to that convention for free the cannabis company had purchased tickets for us and we had left before the show happened so we got to go on their dime and you know that's kind of when our world turned around and how did you how did you guys get into the space again um what was your background before pack case funny funny story uh i was working tech i was uh working for apple at the time i was an engineer um doing some annoying stuff on the phones with in between customers and engineering kind of realized that uh corporate life wasn't for me i needed a change and i was helping brett work on some website for some cannabis company uh two weeks later he said hey we need a director of marketing are you interested i jumped on the opportunities like all right we'll pack your stuff and get to colorado next month uh time to start so went out there a little bit of nepotism uh brett's uh brett's dad my dad and the guy that hired us have all been friends for 30 35 years i guess he wanted some smart cheap labor at the time and that's uh kind of how we got our invitation but a few months later unfortunately he got sick and it put brett and i in a position where we were running the show uh in our young 20s which is absurd to put 20 year olds in charge of a 15 million cannabis company but hey you know you got to do what you got to do in business it sure is yeah we have a similar story too um you know i want to hear it how did you get started please yeah no i was i was in tech as well like straight out of college um under the fluorescent lights in a cube sea of cubes and i was like oh yes i'm getting out of school i'm gonna you know work and sell stuff and pay off my loans and you know it's a big fortune 500 company and uh after about a year and a half you know i was going through started out as like uh you know basically a quote guy you know early on learning the sales process and then moved through quickly but i know i wanted to to sell and to really own accounts and quarterback stuff and i talked to my boss and he's like well that's probably eight to ten years away for you and so i'm like oh i can be patient but uh not that patient [Laughter] and uh yeah luckily family friends um one of my family friends lived down the street from my cousin again nepotism here lucky right place right time but um kate holstein who's in charge of our international business she's been uh she actually got me to sidetrack even more she got me my first job um working like as a banquet server at weddings and so i've just i've known her since i was a kid basically and she's like hey i worked this company boveda and um now we make these humidity control packs we're in the cannabis space we're in the tobacco market and we're in the music industry and i heard those three things i said cool i mean yeah i'm in so i interviewed with them long story short um you know as employee number 12 and i think we're over 65 now and that was just four and a half years ago so um really fun fun place to work similar stories here we're basically um very similar in what we do our products and our services are very complementary to the things we're trying to address here to the cannabis industry 100 peanut butter and jelly uh especially for for pre-rolls we make something that's uh great for protecting them and you guys make sure that they stay fresh and tasty for as long as absolutely possible longer than most thought would be possible exactly so anthony i mean we've been talking we've known each other for a long time but really i don't know the the story behind boveda how how did that come about what is it like tell everybody what bovita is yeah so um it's a really simple product and that's that's what uh that's what we like most about it but it's very effective and it works pretty well um it started 25 years ago a couple of guys in the tobacco business they were cigar smokers saw a problem with uh humidification one-way humidification for regulators for cigar humidors um they said there's got to be a better way to do this so they worked um with a couple of engineers from general mills here in minnesota on coming up with a product that's able to basically self-control it's not you you don't have to add anything to it um and it's a two-way controller so in a deficit environment it'll add humidity and then when there's not enough it'll or when there's too much it'll it'll absorb some too so it's it's really getting rid of those peaks and hills and valleys of humidity um and so that that technology started for the like i said for the the cigars and tobacco business and then over time and we i'm sure this has been talked about on many of our other podcasts but um you know we started seeing these tobacco stores uh selling a lot of products in northern california um to the traditional market and um there's like wow there's there's a demand for this on the cannabis space too and that was probably 10 12 years ago now um and so we came up with our our 62 formula and um you know from there the the technology has really stayed the same but we've been finding out more about how this technology can um you know not just protect weight and help you know manage the moisture content or water activity but to also preserve terpenes and trichome integrity so it's been fun to to watch how it's how it's grown and what we've learned um that's that's really fun there's a huge feast of thought culture here feast of learning love of learning um that's that's something that's at our very core um and we have a lab down in um the basement of our hq here where a lot of these tests are being ran we have a lot of partners um different labs across the states and even internationally that help run tests and it's it's really cool uh so yeah that's you know it's a bit of a ramble there but that's uh no it it it sounds super cool i mean we did we've we've been doing r d on our products for four years you know always trying to come up with new stuff but we just have to make a really interesting design and make sure it's structurally integral you guys you have to do some chemical engineering which i can only imagine just ups the level of difficulty by you know to the umpteenth degree so good for you guys it's great that you guys can do everything downstairs and run humidity tests and i know that's a great segue into what we'll we'll talk about next because you can't really run a humidity test without measuring what you're trying to contain the humidity within uh which kind of leads me on to what we do over a pack case and we make these really amazing joint cases this is one of our awesome hemp clients father obsidian but check this out we call this product a jpeg it's our flagship so you'll notice inside this is what's amazing to bovida and everyone who uses it there's a gasket seal that lines the actual case to hold five payrolls um so when you close it you can actually hear the click that's how you know it's sealed and then our favorite part not so boveda is central but we have a extra little place that you can store roaches so you can't finish a joint you don't want to stink up the rest of uh the fresh ones inside the pack that was a really cool idea um so as we were developing this the whole reason we put a gasket in there was to make sure that pre-rolls stayed fresh unfortunately in this industry the pre-roll has been an underutilized product skew for so long such an easy product to produce it's something that from a beginner to an intermediate to a super heady everyone loves smoking joints everyone loves smoking bloods and when we first got in the industry back in 2016 everyone was just taking trim that shitty extra leftover whatever stuffing in a pre-roll and saying okay good enough today now it's totally different story people use only flower premium everything sometimes they're even caviar which means that they may have a core with some hash or are wrapped with some keef and some extra little bits on the outside and can exceed retail values of over 50 bucks in fact last time i was in vegas at the show we went to a dispensary planet 13 and they were selling a can of cigar for a thousand dollars uh so the pre-roll game has totally evolved now think about this anthony what would what would you do if you went out you bought a blood that was a thousand dollars and it was dry i would immediately want to return it right and can you probably not probably not so products like that have to be in something that's airtight and gasket sealed and if you're doing it the right way you have a bill vita pack in there as well yeah no doubt um you you brought up some really interesting stuff cody um do you mind expanding a little bit on how you've seen um you know we're we're more on the you know we certainly work with a lot of companies that manufacture pre-rolls um but also you know people that are just packaging grams or eighths or quarters or ounces or pounds um but it seems you know i mean you guys have a focus on pre-rolls do you want to elaborate on how that's changed throughout like the last four or five years um you know going into this more premium stuff versus just the consumable hey you know the dispensary is running a deal and you get a free pre-roll and it's kind of just like everyone expects oh it's it's probably gonna be dry it's probably not gonna taste very good but i mean how is it where is it changed and where is it changing where is it going yeah absolutely like i had said before when we first got into it no one really cared they just took a pre-roll they were sometimes even making them in the dispensary with leftover whatever after bagging out you know an eighth for a customer there's maybe another gram or two in the jar so the manager said screw it let's grind it up throw it in some pre-rolls and now we can sell it today the pre-roll is a main sku in the industry i think it accounts for maybe 10 15 20 somewhere in there depending on the month of total cannabis sales in the entire country so clearly they're here to stay and it's a product that people love so very quickly back in 2016 and 17 when we were starting pack case we realized that the pre-roll was super underutilized it wasn't really given the appreciation that it should have i mean it's a top level sku it's a real money maker and it doesn't take a lot of money to actually start producing them so we created our product because there wasn't any premium offerings like i said everyone was just throwing [ __ ] in a tube and or a bag and that was it there really wasn't like a uh a big demand for people asking for quality pre-rolls and we didn't understand that because as pre-roll enthusiasts someone who we smoke joints all the time especially when we went skiing or out for hikes or whatever joints are the way to go um no one really had anything that was nice or worth talking about bringing home so instead we just buy flour and roll our own but it left a huge amount of market opportunity for all these cannabis companies who weren't doing something to make a premium sku that addresses a huge market need so there was an incredible amount of demand and no supply whatsoever and that's where pac case came in to fill the gap and give opportunities to companies like this to be able to sell a premium pre-roll so was pac case kind of born on the mountain per se it's funny uh we quickly came up with the idea late at night uh the second night that brett and i had ever met um just because we were talking about going skiing and taking joints before we ever had a prototype uh i had actually uh three or four joints like in my chest pocket um took a little kicker while i was skiing and totally yard sale ate [ __ ] skis went flying worst part though uh i was kind of hurt and the joints were all broken so not only was i like in pain i couldn't smoke so it was it was rough so brett and i very quickly jumped on finding someone to help us out with the design and we quite literally used our prototype our very first one which i have right here super basic shitty design but uh this i used for an entire winter to hold pre-rolls and make sure that they wouldn't break so connor was uh was born out of uh two things a we needed a person we had a personal need we needed to be able to carry joints on the mountain or going for hikes or wherever uh and at the same time we knew that the cannabis market needed it too so it was a little bit of a selfish uh build it was kind of doing it for us and then realized there was a business behind it too that's that's exactly it though i mean that's how great products and ideas are born what's what's uh what's a problem i'm facing in my world today like some broken pre-rolls and then you know there's gonna be thousands of other people that have the same problem so cool stuff i've always loved your guys products um and you guys um you have your your five pack obviously what's what's more of your consumer facing um your duo right do you have you don't have a single though because who's gonna smoke a single joint i mean you're always gonna have one for a buddy so you would think that we uh we do have a we may or may not i cannot confirm or deny that we have a single in the works um but it won't be ready for a while if in fact we're working on something uh really though like one is never enough right like two is always better than one three is better than two and [ __ ] if you can have five will have five um so it's it's what's most amazing and what i find most interesting about our product and why it it works so well on both sides of the aisle um it's a packaging product it was always developed to be a packaging product and whole allow cannabis companies to sell pre-rolls but over the course of a year or two as we were our social media was growing and people were starting to find out about what we were doing people started asking for these just like hey i don't live in a cannabis state how do i get one um so we put them up on amazon and let it ride and uh two years later we've sold you know more than 50 000 units and are absolutely crushing a thousand reviews which blows my mind and we have over four and a half stars which on a product intended for packaging that gets sold as an accessory yeah blows my mind every time 100 and um one thing that i've always loved about your guys product is that um you know you can you can customize it um you know the the business can go put their branding on it and customize it however they want um that's a huge thing especially up in canada and some other markets that um you know they can't necessarily advertise or brand do you have any experience there um helping companies really market their brand with your guys packaging technology i'm glad that you asked that anthony pack case technically is a packaging company right that's the product that we sell but really when you get down to things we consider ourselves a marketing company we give our clients an ability to brand and promote products in ways that they wouldn't be able to before our packaging may be slightly more expensive than everyone else on the market but that's obviously because it's a premium feel what other packaging can go out and say hey i sell for 20 on amazon but instead you can come to my dispensary take five of my best highest quality joints with delicious flour have my brand on it and then now go and walk around with it so we give these companies not just an opportunity to create beautiful packaging that's going to create an amazing customer experience but we also allow their customers to then become a walking advertisement for their company think about it you buy a jpack from somebody that means you have five joints so you take one joint out to smoke with a friend well you're obviously gonna close the pack put it back in your pocket again you still have four left so you're gonna hold on to the packaging for a long time which means anytime you smoke with somebody and you take that out your brand as a company gets exposed to their friend who's now likely to become a customer their self themselves yeah well and let's let's back up to a second so let's talk about um the premium aspect so and what that value can can mean not only to a business but to the consumer so your guys you go i mean let's and we can even back up to that leap down study that we helped you guys do so that by let's explain this to the the people so yeah boba can take uh packaging and put it into a um a dry chamber put above the pack in there and then we can basically estimate the shelf life or stability how long the boba packs can last how long the product is going to stay fresh um versus no active humidity control versus having a boat pack in there and then we can compare that um against the control and give you hey this is going gonna you know add an extra week two weeks a month some cases um let's should we chat about uh how that went and what that kind of means for brands and consumers as far as you know brands are gonna be able to go into more inventory and that's something that we've seen on on the boveda side is um you know a big concern or a big problem facing a lot of these operators was hey we're just trying to get product on the shelf because the supply and demand chart is totally kitty wampus and you know we've had cultivators operators say we're we're trying to like they're torn especially these commercial ones because they want to have a longer cure on their their flower and they wanna couldn't really control that quality um but then they have um people in the supply chain saying hey this dispensary's been out of said strain this amount of flour for x amount of days and like we just we need to get on the shelf it's just flying off the shelf that we have seen as i have seen personally that's kind of slowing down and people are able to go into more inventory and carry more um but our products together can help assure that that shelf life is there and so product isn't sitting for two three months and then it's sold dry that's one of the benefits of being able to use pack case and boveda together um these operators who you know think about it if you have a production team of 10 well you don't necessarily want to have two people doing pre-rolls and two people doing edibles and spread out your labor force a lot of the times it's more efficient and our clients have told us this that you know i want to put my entire production team have them do an entire run start to finish bang it out and then move on to the next project now when you do that with flour with pre-roll with something that's not necessarily super shelf stable like a concentrate or an edible you have to have velocity so not only do you have to package it up quickly you have to get it out the door you have to get it to the dispensary they have to shelve it and then they have to get it out to the consumer now that process can take a lot longer than it would take a cannabis to dehumidify and then dry out lose terpenes lose flavor lose potency and mess with um with effects right like if uh some thc converts into cbd that flower that you smoke once it's converted is gonna make you feel totally different than if it didn't exactly so with boveda and pack case because they're such a tremendous seal these producers have the ability to make an entire run of pre-rolls leave them in their factory if they have to and as long as it's properly sealed and the boveda pack is fresh these pre-rolls are going to last a lot longer which means that their production problems that come along with having to do massive runs and then making it like sit on it as opposed to doing smaller runs and moving them quicker and making a regular process makes life a lot easier for them they can sit down bang out all of their pre-rolls that they need for a month and two days and then not have to worry about the quality at all because of the protection that pacquiao boveda provides yeah and a term that comes to mind that i hear a lot is consistency um and that's that's what a lot these brands want to deliver because they know in a lot of these markets especially on the east coast where i've been working predominantly it's medicine so uh you know it's if you can the cannabis plant in the flower is not a it's not a pill and it's very volatile and so like you said um you start getting that trichome degradation and you're gonna lose medicinal benefits um and it's like you know going to get your prescription and your short your short two pills and there's an extra one magical pill tossed in there you know it's like you you want to make sure that the product is consistent and delivered same same smell same taste same flavor same effect every time and uh yeah i think i think our our two products definitely can help um in that in that regard absolutely cannabis obviously is a product that affects headspace and if you find something that works for you and you find something that you like you want to make sure that if you buy it again it's going to have the same exact effect uh there's only one way to do that in terms of flour and pre-rolls and that's control the humidity making sure that the product stays the same on day one as it is on day 30 and potentially even out to day 60s so it's important i know that a lot of people that consume cannabis for medical reasons um which there are many that's how this whole industry really started right um they need that they need consistency of dose they need consistency of effect and you can only do that by controlling terpene and humidity content right yup yup there's no doubt about that and then um you know let's another thing that i've been seeing um and sorry this is so salesy just because that's the world that i live in every day is just sales but um you know competition between brands um i i like to think of the cannabis industry as a more friendly um competition uh than any than any other industry that i've been in or or seen where it's you know really we're we're all in this together with one common goal and that's to bring uh relief to a lot of people and liberty to a lot of people um to do what they want with their lives consume what they want and um just not step on anyone else's toes but competition on shelf space um is the pack case boveda combo is that something that people can use to set their their brands apart from others is that can you take these these two common value adds and educate the consumer to say hey i'm gonna my pre-rolls are gonna probably be better in here by the time i get them depending on when they were packaged and you know i'm gonna have an extra two three weeks to go through these um with the boveda pack and then you know i have the pack case forever um these are these are things that consumers care about and are gonna want is that messaging from the consumer is that getting driven to these brands that are making these decisions on packaging yet it's a good question some of the brands who really have a premium focus and a premium attention absolutely they understand that their customers keep coming back to them because their products are so good some of the there's a lot of a lot unfortunate but there's a lot of cannabis companies out there that really don't cater to a premium market um and don't really care about the quality of their products um you know like i said a lot of them are still back in the model of 2016. let's take any leftover [ __ ] that we have let's toss it in a pre-roll put it in the doob tube and just send it whatever happens happens i don't know about you but whenever i consume something that affects headspace uh alcohol cannabis whatever else it may be i always want to make sure that i'm getting something that's quality and consistent um price isn't so much uh a concern of mine right i would much rather pay an extra 20 or 30 bucks to know that uh the quality that i'm getting is there versus having to deal with some [ __ ] for a much cheaper cost i believe that if you're gonna intake something it should only be the the best quality you know it's affecting you like you as yourself not a car not a house you and your health so for me as a consumer i always want to make sure i'm getting high quality and i think that there's a lot of companies that value my sentiment and cater towards a client like me when you have a customer that doesn't you end up with shitty product and that creates a negative loop sure you're going to get the sale once or twice because it's a cheap product but i doubt that person's coming back to you there's no consistency there's no flavor it's all dry harsh smoke it's no good no one likes that yeah and that's i think that's changing too i think as more people get introduced to cannabis i mean we talk about all these people taking baby steps i mean i was down in in florida i had a dispensary doing a visit and i i witnessed what i always knew was going on down there but never had witness for myself which was a woman that looked just like my grandma going into a dispensary for the first time and she has all of her paperwork and she looks at the the person at the front desk and she's kind of you know pretty coy and her her husband's behind her um you know they're just kind of looking around and she goes i'm here to um purchase some marijuana it's so cool to see that but there's so many people that need to be become educated on you know multiple different aspects of cannabis um but it's there's so many new people coming into it and uh that's that's a that's a big piece of the education piece and you know knowing what you're consuming how it's gonna make you feel um you know what you like essentially there are a lot of people figuring out what they like and um you know here in minnesota it's tough for me uh because we don't have um you know like we don't have adult use here so i can't just go in and say hey you know i'm wanting this today and that's uh that's something that a lot of new states are having which is is great um and uh sorry i kind of lost my train of thought here it's all good those are those were always my fate when when i was back at the cannabis company those are always my favorite people you know there were times and days where you know as just a higher level employee at the company uh the dispensary was short-handed so i'd have to go in there and maybe put a quick shift in and just talk to cool people about wheat all day it was honestly not a bad way to uh spend a couple hours outside of my normal role my favorite customers were always the older folks who really had never id any idea they'd walk in they'd always be like hey can i like can i buy some weed yeah and it's like you don't have to whisper it's legal welcome to the cannabis store let me show you what what are you what are you interested in what would you like to try are you interested in smoking something would you like to vape something would you like to try an edible it's always great introducing those people to the entire world something that as an enthusiast we've been living for decades right but i don't want to date myself but [ __ ] it's been a long time um yeah it's it's it's remarkable the clearly the direction of the country the world is totally changing our neighbors up to the north were a lot smarter than we were legalized a lot quicker and look what happened now they have five or six companies in cannabis worth over a billion dollars you ever think that there'd be a unicorn in cannabis now there's five it's insane yep ellen what do you think is i mean comparing the canada to the u.s right now um especially these last couple weeks um just these these larger operators and what what is that what does this mean for cannabis in 2021 um as far as these these bigger companies you know that and you know four or five years ago in the grassroots cannabis movement semi grassroots cannabis movement um you know a lot of it was the the buzz around trade shows in the industry was all these you know these big companies are gonna come in and they're gonna start getting swooped up and the commercialization does cannabis in your opinion cody does it kind of model what happened uh recently this last decade with beer craft beer and you know your big domestic beer is there gonna be a commercial side of cannabis and then also room for the craft cultivator um that's really focused on small quality good stuff um that's gonna be competing against you know price and volume from some of these giants that's a great question the beer model is one that is perfect to use as an analogy um i think myself a lot of these major cannabis companies are swooping up a lot of the smaller ones there's a lot of conglomeration that's going on in the industry obviously when you kind of grow as a company or you want to expand you either need additional growth space which requires additional licensing so a lot of the small guys or the guys that were in quickly did some decent growing started as a startup and made it to mid-sized company those are ideal acquisition targets for the big boys so i think what's going to happen at least the next three four years is that all the big boys are going to start to swoop up a lot of the smaller guys that's where you emerge the budweiser the coors light all the the general high volume lower quality lower price type products from that will come the grassroots movement again so i think everything is going to kind of go underground for a little while and all these craft companies in maybe three four years will start to emerge when people really care about quality and it's not so much about bottom dollar anymore yeah we have a huge canadian client that we love working with when we first started with them they had a huge huge initiative and focus on innovation it was 2018 they had an opportunity to really try and control the market with an innovative awesome product uh cost was no object they said [ __ ] it we want the coolest best highest quality product that we can provide and it worked out great for them they quickly jumped into one of the leaders positions in the industry in canada and everything was was great it towards the end of 2019 and then with uh early covid uh early 2020 uh their share price fell dramatically they were you know their balance sheets showed that they were just outlaying cash left and right for the innovation without necessarily realizing that when you spend so much on innovation it takes a long time for it to come back right roi on innovation is a year year and a half process minimum for us for example you know we started designing jpeg trio in 2018 it didn't get launched until you know mid 2019 it took 12 16 months 18 months to get the product out there so with this cannabis company even though they were so amazingly focused on innovation for the first part once legalization happened now they realize that it's all about bottom dollar and how do we reduce cost of goods so now instead of trying to produce flowers that may be tastier but take an extra two weeks now they're producing lower quality genetics that harvest faster that they can just turn around and sell and cheaper packaging and i think that's now the start of where you see the the budweiser and the the coors lights versus like uh you know a small batch brewing company really focused on delivering a delicious tasty product i mean one has consistency one has flavor yup but you know which would you prefer to drink budweiser or the the local craft beer pretty easy decision in my opinion yeah well for me too it's a time and place thing sometimes uh you know being from minnesota and uh going up to the cabin a busch light just kind of brings you back you know i love those you mean can't hate on that i'm a big coors guy i went to school in colorado spent a few years in co i love course especially like any tailgate absolutely but then you know you're trying to drink 16 18 beers potentially and really have yourself an afternoon that's not so much the case when you're drinking something that's a little bit tastier and perhaps next to a steak and maybe you're gonna have one or two very different days though the pairing is everything bingo and the season two i'm a big seasoned guy when it comes to those things absolutely you brought up uh i don't know how much time we have here ramsay um but you brought up uh kovid um how do you think that's been um impacting i guess pros and cons um your guys customers people you've been working with um you know if i can touch briefly i can just say what i've noticed is um i think a lot of these quality things sops standard practices best practices a lot of these procedural things are starting to really get drilled into um on paper and people are starting to like really figure their their [ __ ] out um and that's i think making a little bit extra room for products and services that focus on true value-add and um you know roi that you know we can bovada specifically too can can really tell you hey your flower your inventory your entire inventory weighs this today um and here's the percent moisture content um if you added two percent moisture content to that entire inventory here's the literal change in fair market value of your inventory i think those things now it's not it's not everything's not moving so fast where it's hey package it get it you know it doesn't matter if it cures on the shelf whatever we just we got to get it in stores because we don't have any and people are buying it anyway um i think covid kind of or the lockdown specifically um kind of help people really look at their what they're doing their day-to-day operations and where they can make changes have you guys noticed that too absolutely it gave you know business operators a chance to sit back and not be surrounded by the buzz of a hopping office and they actually had a few moments to think about like hey what can we do better what can we do to improve like our everything our process is top to bottom from growing the production of packaging to sales yeah um what's interesting is that you know this is what makes me happy is that a lot of the country deemed cannabis in a central industry um okay would you ever have been able to imagine that 10 years ago probably not i mean even back in 2014 but government said hey people need cannabis especially in california and all the cannabis companies stayed open so i think having those cannabis restrictions that got imposed on everybody required all these business operators to really sit back and understand how can we do things more efficiently because [ __ ] i used to run my growing operation with 40 people well now i can only have 15 in the building so how are we still going to manage the same output but with less than half of the labor staff forces you to sit back and really think about what you're doing and if you guys are cutting short you know corners trying to take a shortcut when that's not necessarily the best thing to do or neces or even necessary you know small little changes in process like adding a movita pack into your curing box can potentially generate an extra 300 000 a year for a mid-sized cannabis company it's substantial and that tiny little you know how much could that really end up costing you a couple thousand dollars over the course of a year when you can end up you know that can let you back a couple hundred thousand so a lot of these guys with cannabis you just you've been running and like you you ever try and get on a treadmill when it's set at 10 you there's no warm-up time you just have to get down and start sprinting yeah college a couple times yeah i'm not sure if those ended well but that's that's what working in a cannabis company is like the moment that your product goes out the door for the first time it's off to the races you have now an endless uh endless demand for your product and you have to continuously handle that that with good supply um and they don't haven't had a lot of time to think about it as soon as they got on that treadmill it's just off to the races full sprint covent gave them a chance to sit back take a second step off the treadmill and try and figure out what they should actually be doing yeah i completely agree um definitely notice that as well on our end um all right cody uh what's next for paccase great question we have a couple cool new packaging products coming out but that's not really what what tickles me i get very excited about the consumer market i love bringing products to people that will actually use it so we have a really awesome new case that should be launching the next five six months uh think jpac an iphone had a baby that's about all i can touch on it yeah well that's uh that's intriguing um because i think i think i know where that's going um don't wanna don't want to speculate too much but um and where can you pick these up so i know you said amazon um i know you guys have uh point of purchase displays too so i'm assuming that it's this is getting into more mass retail absolutely yeah we uh we sell in a couple different places you can go out and check uh jpac products out on amazon number one uh our shopping website packcase.com i'm sorry packcase.shop you can get there from packcase.com as well um and now they're we're starting to be available in retailers so there's a whole bunch of distributors starting to pick these up so you should start seeing them in retail stores over the next few months and if you're a retailer and interested in picking up our products we have a wonderful wholesale section on paccase.shop so make sure to stop there put in a little vendor request and we'll make sure to get to you so you guys can start selling pack cases yourself cool cool yeah same thing for boveda um we're on amazon we're in the retail stores uh we have a direct site businesses we have a wholesale site too um yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's change that [Music] you", "Loa7ttdktmQ": "[Music] what's up mortals it's your favorite florist coming through with another review for you today we're talking about galactic gas by alien labs not only that i want to do things a little bit differently and start things off with an interview in fact the first interview on the show i'm very excited to have such a big name in the youtube universe as my first interview today i brought on an alien specialist for my alien labs review street fighter patriot scott mckay mr scott mckay how are you doing today i'm doing fantastic zero good to finally get a chance to meet you great to meet you also so we brought you in as an alien labs expert please give us a little background regarding your expertise there are influences on this planet that are not of this planet you know when you go down the secret space program rabbit holes and i actually did get some information from this group that showed me proof of what i'm referring to you know the off-planet influence that's happened to mankind since for a very very long time that that that that so when you start to learn these realities and you learn in these programs there is an off planet human sex trafficking operation off planet human slave trade operation that are outside the races of just human beings how could people possibly come to grips with this scott what the f are you talking about because look the simple fact is the way the world works and the way the minds of people are programmed everything is a sound stage literally everything that everybody has ever learned about the world comes from a sound stage what does that even mean that's what this do they program us computer program tv program program program program program program so that's how the whole thing works i was happy that i wasn't them i was happy that i had the capabilities to think farther at a higher level than even they do and my thinking wasn't driven by an intelligence or an academic from an academic perspective yeah that's pretty obvious it was from an awareness perspective but i wanted that awareness i chose that awareness i wanted to know the greater depths of all of creation and god's creation and the question of why am i here scott i can answer why you were here at least on this show it was to talk about alien labs thanks for joining us moving on let's start the intro [Music] much what's up world hope you're doing well today like i said we're getting into galactic gas by alien labs alien labs was started in 2014 in northern california with the intent to create a lifestyle brand focused on quality i reviewed them a few times in the past but it was long before i figured out how to use a camera so i'm really happy to revisit them now when we start talking about the genetics of galactic gas it's going to be a cross of gelato 45 and gelato 41. um you know when we start talking about the appearance to be frank i was a little disappointed um i got a lot of tiny buds there was a lot of stems it kind of felt like i bought a little eighth you know and not only that it felt half smoked where um you know a lot of budges had stems that were just sticking out it's just you know what i'm gonna have you take a look let's roll the tape let's go 36 holes leave you bleeding words and i'm 36 0's in a kilogram blunt tip orange like caviar now fish tail and subaru rally card [Music] and did i mention guns from red dead redemption 9 mills 50 clip extensions coke is like the mattress in the hood i'm flipping on it and the money's like a chair i'm sitting on it i think i'm big meech larry hoover [Music] regretfully though i found the aroma incredibly subdued when digging in deep you could discover a fantastic italian ice-like nose but i wanted it at least 10 times stronger also noticeably absent were any and all gas notes i would describe this nose as a faint tropical citrus complemented by some delicate sweetened berry notes [Music] you know what let me uh get my heat wand ready here and we'll get into the inhale and exhale cheers [Music] went in a little too hot with that one there wow thankfully the inhale had a little more representation than the aroma but was still slightly muted relative to where i would like to see it i found the inhale to be a mix of sweet gassy tropical citrus notes that evolve into some creamy earthiness flavor during that exhale man through that smoking experience though you can see these are quality flowers grown the right way they burn very clean with a very clean high i just need that aroma to be much more forward and the flavor profile too i would have liked that flavor profile to be just a little bit stronger you know i'm going to roll a joint and tell you how that translates in the meantime once you take a look at some of my more recent crypto work [Music] so all that crypto art is available on wearable as well as open seas let's get down with this joint cheers again using a plasma lighter i've broken free of my butane chains thanks to the fire scale [Music] [Music] ever since i switched to a plasma lighter i'm getting such a better flavor profile on every join i smoke even all the way up into the end of the joint i'm finding it's tasting so much better i recommend plasmaliners for all your joints and bloods [Music] so i am continuing to see that sweet gassy tropical citrus notes and that inhale as well as those sweet creamy berry notes on the exhale delicious and like i was saying this is a very clean burning eye it almost reminds me of a dab that's so clean really an indicator of quality flowers i just wish the flavor profile came through a little bit stronger [Music] so what's the verdict am i a fan would i buy them again if they had a stronger flavor profile and i didn't get so many small buds and stems i would definitely consider it but based on my experience right now probably not so where can you buy well alien labs is found all over both northern california and southern california these days a bunch of high-end dispensaries you are going to pay a pretty penny for it it's probably going to be anywhere from 65 to 85 [Music] and that's before tax so um ask the budget you know check the date make sure it's fresh buds i'll make sure it's a good batch and hopefully you can have a better experience than me either way thanks for joining me today stay stoned [Music] you", "sQF8-dl5fls": "[Music] yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing some of my orange cookies wax so hopefully that does look good on the camera i don't know how the lighting is but yeah hopefully you guys do see that so it's more of like a sauce and we're gonna be hitting it off of my blender so i'm really excited to be going over this sauce because it does taste and smell really good so i'm gonna go ahead and heat up my banger and i'll be back once it's all hot so i'm just waiting for my trip timer to go off but here's the the wax or sauce so it's really saucy and once this timer goes off i'm gonna go ahead and put this on top and we're gonna go ahead and take a rip i'm gonna pick up the rig so you guys can hopefully see the smoke more but yeah i'm just waiting for this timer to go off so i know how hot it is should be any second now like five more seconds and it should be good all right so let's go ahead and give it a hit put on the top now let's go probably have about one more hit okay so that was a really good hit i'm going to take one more and i'm going to end off the video there so i'm going to do again i'm going to heat it up and

so this is what the cartridge looks like um let me try to have it focus a little bit better but the oil does look good and i have tasted already and it is a pretty good car as you can see it may be a little bit high already but this cartridge does i can't even talk right now that's how good this cartridge is so it does smack let me hit it again i said let me hit it again and this was my first hit

recently this cartridge is amazing so yeah it's a good car um thank you rise for giving me this cartridge to review and i'm not being like biased because they gave me the cartridge if it was ass i would say it's ass so this this is a good card [Music] this is the battery that comes with it so i don't know what voltage it's at but i'm just using the one that came with it because i didn't want to [ __ ] around the batteries and get one that was too hot for this and mess up the cartridge but yeah this is a really good battery and a nice cartridge as well i like how on this battery you don't need to hit anything so you just charge it and then whenever you want to use it put the cartridge on and you just inhale and it turns on by itself so so i want to let you guys know like i've been seeing a lot of people saying like oh i don't have the right equipment to start the youtube channel i don't have this i don't have that i want to show you guys that i'm recording this one like this

have the information down below in the comments because i think if i put in the description they're gonna remove it but i'll i'll see if i can put it in the description i'm not gonna be 100 sure and

hand and ring the bell to stay up to date with all my weekly videos because i do post every week if not every other week welcome to my world of cannabis knowledge and insight into the canadian legal market yikes hit the spliff if it ain't too tight yikes take a rip got you feeling right yikes bubba kush got me taking flight we be like trippy night today's video is sponsored by toki toki is a canadian cannabis brand located in toronto my friend demini over at toki has sent me a 510 battery along with a 510 wax cartridge kind of like i'll show you i'll show you what it is so not only is toki award-winning they really take pride in providing premium cannabis vape products and for those of you who are getting into cannabis vaping or maybe don't really know a lot about cannabis vaping i'll put a link up here somewhere click that link it'll take you to a video um just telling you everything that you need to know about vaping just the basics it's important to know that stuff because i'm sure there's a lot of misinformation around vapes online and i just wanted to help clarify what some of that meant this is a live resin 510 cartridge and it is amazing because distillate is really bad personally i'm not a fan of dyslex because it's basically the purest form of thc so there's no terpenes or other cannabinoids to contribute to the entourage effect of your experience and there's no flavor so there's not really much character to your high compared to live resin which has all of the cannabidoids and terpenes and amazing flavor and it just better experience and then i'm going to be trying the premium five diamonds for the first time this vape can use 510 cartridges and you could smoke your own concentrate consistencies in there too typically when i smoke distillate i'll be puff puff puffing away and i'm like really really really like intoxicated for a good five minutes and then it goes away with this live resin cartridge it lasts just as long as it would compared to smoking a joint or taking a bomb wretch [Music] make sure it's snug on there and then there's a little button right here that you would press five times [Music] uh the flavor on this is unreal honestly if you're spending like 50 to 80 bucks on a cartridge you might as well want a battery that's gonna you know match that in terms of quality the charging port you can charge your phone on it as well as the vape you don't have to worry about you know making sure you remember to bring your charger well you gotta remember to bring the bank but you know what i'm saying you don't have to rely on a cord you just have the bank and you need the vape and as long as you have the two you can charge your battery and support black owned businesses i only share premium cannabis products and this these are premium af so get your wallets ready from the design to how it smokes to the technology i would rate toki 10 out of 10 and i'm really looking forward to seeing future products of toki and i would recommend everyone try these out because these are gonna last you a long time and it's great quality if you made it to the end of this video thank you so much for watching the entire video if

some outer space is the strain LLR cartridge outer space this is coming in at like 85 almost 86 percent THC it is a strong one that's why I grabbed it very strong stuff yep fresco LLR cartridge outer space is the strain I had had this in the sugar before I did have this and the sugar before it was really good so I figured it's got to be good in the car our cartridge wastes no time let's get it open without further adue Cresco outer space ll our cartridge this opens got the soy cheese will move nice outer space ll our cartridge filled up to the top nice nice and filled [Music] Jesco red cuz it's a sativa so it's got the red ring around it I like how they filled it up to the top some of the currents they do some don't seem filled very nice let's get this little rubber piece off the bottom here throw it on my pen settings sativa I like my sativas like I said I had this in the in a sauce before and it was man it was really really good so and I bought this just because it was a really high potency I said the potencies of eighty five point zero four three plus another like 100 zero point nine seven eight so most eighty six and this was packaged on ten seven twenty nineteen so really just a couple weeks ago not even at a week ago the seventh October seventh this was packaged and expires of course October seventh of 2020 most marijuana products they give it one year expiration date let's give it a hit so the Cresco outerspace LLR cartridge bath gram paid fifty five for the half gram mmm nice nice sweet almost like a candy taste with a little I don't know kind of like citrusy maybe kick to it at the end really nice dog that says a nice flavour Cresco has the best lor cartridges right now I haven't tried a prime yet I don't think but yeah matter of fact I don't think I've tried any other lor cartridges other than Cresco so I really can't make that claim I apologize I haven't gonna try to get a prime one maybe a Liberty they also have no other cartridges that rise I guess because Cresco is so good did I just keep hiding them I bought this one and I also bought kosher tangi which I'll be doing a review on that one too kosher tangents of hybrid LLR cartridge yeah bought two of them yeah I spent the hundred bucks I use $10 credit once again I had a $10 credit built up and dropped a hundred bucks for a gram to half gram cartridges stuff is expensive but it's quality and uh so you get what you pay for mm-hm Cheers outer space LLR [Music] nice sweet candy tastes kind of a sweetheart you know that type of candy a little bit tart but sweet this is exactly what this tastes like very good though well I think I'm gonna wrap this video up I don't want to make it too long you take a lot of time to upload to YouTube if you make them really wrong and nobody really wants to watch a long ass video about it about a review so LLR cartridge outer space pretty good I'll let you know more about what I thought down south in the comments let me know what you guys are smoking on PA medical marijuana peace I'm out", "osKgH8Ur7-Y": "how are we going to smoke weed in the future consumers have spoken they've picked two different ways we're going to take a look at a report about the future of smoking cannabis already being determined and the cannabis consumers have spoken welcome back to the talking hedge i'm josh mccabe capital markets analyst and host of your cannabis business podcast today we're looking at uh some pre-rolls here i guess some joints well cones specifically that's pretty much what's all available uh in the market until companies like this one is able to have those medical joints that is a role pros washington based company that has cylindrical joints finally better draw than a cone shape in my opinion so really excited to see them come on the market in the meantime looking at pre-rolls generating 20 year-over-year sales looking like that's the way to go so we reported earlier that it's based about uh price and convenience that's kind of what purchasing decisions are whether it's cannabis or otherwise so taking a look at um you know this specific product with pre-rolls people don't want the trays the grinders the papers the fillers the rolling machine or even a bomb and that's not even talking about concentrates when you have a 300 dab rig that's that's even above and beyond what people want to do with even a little roller so people want grab and go they want convenience i think that's really kind of the avenue and where cannabis is going to be going and people are willing to spend a couple extra bucks that's something we're going to kind of get into in a minute is that premium people are willing to pay even though the quality isn't better that's going to be eviscerated that's going to change dramatically as people kind of go from floor clippings or party mulch to something that's a more high-end for a discerning customer that actually prefers you know a wider variety of uh cultivars or strains so this trend is coming from two different data points coming about as people kind of want to change their consumer preferences so they obviously don't want the hassle of rolling papers and they want to do as little amount of work as possible so this article from cannabis.net is saying that the recent trend is because people prefer that they have it done for them even if they have to pay a little bit more or they want to do as little work as possible i think that's probably pretty accurate for most other things and it reports uh points to an mj business article um that relies on headset data about pre-roll sales being up 50 in 2020 we covered that on a previous podcast as well which basically goes into showing that you can add two to three dollars to a gram uh and sell that for even higher so grab and go is ready um in washington state at least the average demographic for pre-rolls white women 50 and older soccer moms grab and go they don't want to carry anything dab rigs bongs they don't want to roll anything they just want to light it and go with no um nothing left behind no evidence if you will um i think that's going to change dramatically i think with the proliferation of automation whether you like that or not i agree that hand rolled is a premium for a reason it's generally better however for the masses machines that are coming on board are rolling pretty good options that provide for really good experience in my opinion uh much better than a cone shape which is a novelty which is why tobacco hasn't taken on that shape the draw is a better shape so it looks like the other trend there's dry herb vaporizers also trending looking like some added benefits it's discreet um still not accepted everywhere cal um arizona rather doesn't sell a lot of pre-rolls they sell a lot of vape pens they're just a lot more conservative in arizona and don't want to look like a stoner apparently but there's health benefits obviously as well that come with dry herbalizers and so um joints and herbalizers are trending so a lot of people kind of cut back on smoking from the pandemic they were afraid that they were going to catch the rona a little bit easier maybe that's the trend towards uh not combusting there was already a trend towards vaping before accurate dosing vaping all of those hardwares have become really popular with investors and entrepreneurs alike i see a lot more states come online there's me a lot more products i think edibles are obviously popular with stay at home because it's powerful and potent so fridays are going to see a ton of edibles probably a third of all edibles being sold between the hours of three and five on a friday afternoon versus pre-rolls are going to be incredibly cheap as they're able to be mass manufactured with these machines literally just pumping these things out so look for a better product to be put in there and then all of that shake and party mulch being thrown into edibles or concentrates instead not going to smoke that garbage anymore now that you're able to mass manufacture high quality pre-rolls so looking forward to that come back to the talking edge to find out more

go this way i can't go this way um anyway hi guys so it is 10 24 a.m on a wednesday i went to starbucks this morning i got my coffee i got a venti soy latte with five blonde shots it is beautiful beautiful guys i might have like a [ __ ] stroke just trying to say a [ __ ] sentence but y'all so i have so much to catch you up on so i've not been doing well recently i like i guess i just kind of feel like i'm less than everybody and i guess everybody feels like that sometimes um it's really been weighing really heavily on me recently especially because like i don't know i just like i want to be able to love myself it's just like i feel like i'm incapable of being loved and i want to get past that [ __ ] i'm not wearing any green i forgot that was a thing that you had to work green on same patch and say i feel like my energy right now is very susceptible to whatever i think about so let's do some cool manifestation you know what i mean so like i am manifesting that next year is just amazing for me like everything just ends up being so good like i can get my medical marijuana card because y'all like severe pain and severe nausea count as like one of the things on the medical marijuana qualifications for colorado do have terrible stomach pains if i don't smoke and i literally can't eat unless i smoke because i'll get so nauseous and like in pain yeah so i'm very excited for next year and i love how early it is because i can just sit here for so long but i also hate it because the day can be so hard to get through do you know what i'm saying like the day can be so hard to get through i'm so excited for my future it's gonna be so good and like i'm gonna decorate my room the way i want i've been like i have a um pinterest board obviously like i have pinterest and i have been saving like room ideas like my new life aesthetic like guys i'm so excited hey everybody so i just went to the dispensary and i picked up these and each little piece candy has 25 milligrams and i also got two of these there's 200 milligrams of delta eight in the whole thing and then there's one of these which seems more like a cbd thing like under 25 milligrams cbd and then it has a little bit of delta and even less of delta 9. um so this looks good but i do think that it's more of a cbd type thing which is cool too so i'm probably gonna i'm probably gonna eat these today and then save the rest for later hey vlog so i just came out to my car because i don't really know why i just don't really want to be inside um i just took a lot of edibles like an hour ago so yeah i'm a little high right now um they were delta eight they're the ones i showed you from today i look so ugly oh my god i i saw the sign guys this like right here is like a picture like holy [ __ ] hip hop i need to take my car into the shop [Music] you know what i mean i want to lay in the grass but i also don't want to lay in the grass because it's just not fun here i don't feel free does that make sense this mountain thing i need to take you guys on to on a hike onto like onto a hike there my arm is warm i'm so sad guys i just thought like i'm just sad hey everybody so i just got out of my first class i woke up this morning and like still very high from the delta a edible i had yesterday like y'all also i am going to the dispenser today um to get more of the chocolate bars because i want to start taking edibles just for a little bit like the delta eight edibles so when my when i go back to like smoking like blood like i feel like it'll be different i'll also like i'm most out of like wrapping papers so you know um yeah and i'm almost out of bed too so i'm gonna get some edibles um so i'm very excited for that also yeah i lost my little stud in my nose yesterday so i had to put a little ring in there and like it looks fine like i'm not mad about it but like i'd rather have my stud now that i'm going to get my coffee like i'll i'll be fine yeah i mean also you dumb idiot um but yes that's about it i think my eyeliner looks really good today like i'm pretty happy about that i don't know what i did with my eyebrows i did like little like i don't know like drawn on eyebrow rings i don't know and guys in class i felt so bad but like i was just like i'm suited in class i was not expecting that let's just say that y'all i like really like my hair like this oh okay so i'll catch up with you guys later um i'll probably take another edible tonight so i'll let y'all all all update you on that too um i liked what i did yesterday i like smudged a joint after i took the edible and when it kicked in it was like perfect hi vlog so it is the next day i guess i don't i don't know i have no track of like no concept of time right now i am going to get gas right now and yeah i'm excited to pick up some cbd that'll be fun i have class and an hour of spanish and then i'm going to go to the cbd dispensary on my lunch break and then afterwards i have ap lit whatever whatever did you all see that oops hey everybody so right now i'll be on my way to pick up some cbd from cbd dispensary i love there are a lot of dispensaries around me like a lot and i'm so grateful for that guys i feel like i don't talk about how like grateful i am just like to myself or on this channel like i feel like i don't express my gratitude very much i just kind of take things very like not even i don't it's not even i take things for granted i just don't express how grateful i am for something we are stopped this is surreal like this feels surreal to me i hate this [ __ ] i'm just glad you guys are here i'm just very glad you all are here because if y'all weren't here i'd be bored out of my [ __ ] lines and also if y'all weren't here i would feel so alone y'all make me feel safe what the [ __ ] is going on but y'all oh life hack if you ever have like a starbucks cup you should always empty it out and like um i mean like after you drink it like clean it out and [ __ ] like that and then if you're ever worried about the cops like pulling you over and thinking that your cbd is actually weed you can always put in a starbucks cup that is empty and like all cleaned out obviously and [ __ ] like that you know what i mean but yo what the [ __ ] is going on like i'm so upset right now if we don't move soon i'm going to cry but y'all it's okay because this will end soon and i will be at the dispensary and i'll take a different way home because i know better hey everybody so i'm driving in the rain and y'all i wanna i'm i think i'm going to starbucks i don't really know if i'm gonna get anything or if i'm just gonna like turn around and go home after this because i don't know why but that's just not the point of why i'm filming right now because i just got out of philosophy class today they were like so anyone who would consider themselves consequential as like a consequentialist with the knowledge you have already like obviously we don't know everything about it so we can't really say like i'm a consequentialist but like with the knowledge you have like everybody who would consider themselves that go over here and consequentialism is like basically judging the morality of your actions based on the outcome it's more like like they take intention into consideration as well but there's another one that a lot of people might classically agree with which i was really surprised about but also it kind of fits their personality like um like there's a rule and like you don't break it and if you break it you're automatically doing something immoral and like obviously it's like like let's say like you're smoking weed and then the cop walks up to your house and it's like [ __ ] what you doing and then you say well i'm smoking weed and then they say well i'm taking you to jail because that's illegal in consequentialism you'd probably be able to be like oh well i have terrible anxiety and this helps so like is it actually bad like am i hurting anybody is there any bad outcomes from this the cop would be like like if we lived in a consequentialist society the cop would be like i guess you're not hurting anybody and there are no bad outcomes okay you're good keep smoking your weed like in the cup would just walk away but the other theology which a lot of people actually agreed with it was like you make a rule it's like the cup gets your house i smell weed oh yeah i'm smoking weed okay you're coming to jail um oh actually i have really bad anxiety and like i really need to do this too bad it's a law you're coming to jail with me that's what the other one was and it started with the d or something but i'm not sure what it was um but a lot of people agree with that and i was like really and like i guess our government does do like like we have federal laws or like whatever and we have like just laws of like um not just federal like i'm some really smart guys hi could i have a um could i have a ham and swiss panini not heated up okay cool uh that's all i don't know if they were done i was just like okay that's all and they just did not say anything i literally work here though it's like fine but like so weird also when you go through the [ __ ] drive-through turn off your [ __ ] windshield wipers if it's [ __ ] raining stupid [ __ ] idiot not you not you that was not directed at you it's just directed at one customer who literally saw us like getting splashed every two seconds and just like left it on hi vlog so it is so wet outside like it's raining or it was raining and my like i'm soaked like look like i do kind of want to change up my hair a bit um i mean like honestly i could just cut it all off like honestly i could", "6V1gPRAQ_IE": "oh that's good joe i am hot sweaty already ain't nothing i could do but i've been forgetting i'll do all of my cannabis products and uh why not do the timeless battery attached to it is you know say most people know the brand pacific stone but here they are uh pretty sure i'm smoking on pretty sure it's 805 sour it could be forbidden fruit it's funny that something so distinct i guess i'm not a hundred percent sure on because they do taste very differently hey maybe if this battery rips clean and uh allows me to enjoy some terpenes then maybe i can actually know the strain and then i just let y'all know hey this battery is great for like distinguishing like for a person that has multiple cards you know i want to come a little bit to the shade so you can see that it lights up a little bit and so i could maybe stop sweating so much um oh this absolutely rips higher than 3.5 volts if you're looking for like a low uh low temp part this this as well as most automatics in my knowledge aren't actually great for that you'll want like a variable voltage or just maybe like a lower voltage button press battery for that type of experience but yeah i'm pretty sure that's forbidden fruit the my issue now with it is actually the heart not even the battery so i can even maybe try to change the cart so i can review this battery for a little longer have more content and have more feedback for you because i don't really feel like if i don't get enough you know like a satisfactory hit i can't really review it that well and that cart was just uh the oil wasn't lining up with the wick it was tasting burns but i know that has nothing to do with the battery so i'm gonna go back to this shady spot it also helps me to see good this thing i actually can't see the recording at all it's too bright but yeah we're back here okay yeah it's a little puff rock garden usually clog so i guess i kind of have to for a video like this show you what a blinker would be like am i ready though i believe that was a standard 10 seconds oh yeah it's ripping this raw garden beautifully oh oh wow show y'all the view or whatever so you don't need to see my face when i'm suffering i might need some water but i'm i'm crawling it's just it's just a blinker actually i took back-to-back blinkers very very nice i'd raise some pictures right there probably going to use that for the thumbnail if i can wow i'm now i'm just sloppy um i'm i will check just for the [ __ ] sake of this video or should i just think excuse my head right quick yeah yeah all right i got it okay and i hope oh no no it won't work it won't work never mind okay i thought i had a different type of cart so i could show y'all maybe three three different types but that one it actually requires you to be a below like three volts and a taste burn when i use it with this battery well i think none of these damn um battery reviews ends up being one of my longer videos because i'm just out here vibing oh and i guess it's rare that i have this much runtime i'm always low on storage now a little more nature oh i guess my flash is on too i don't think that's really done much but yeah i really like this battery it's held small definitely should have showed y'all what it like came with honestly i think i have in a different video oh my god my hand but yeah my hands have all this like you know just sidewalk concrete take a nice deep breath in okay oh my god well yeah realizing that taylor these blinkers contributing to me sweating too i love this [ __ ] battery um it is a small battery doesn't last the longest but i don't feel like it dies hella quick either so he won like a nice auto draw with some swag it did come with a carrying case that i might actually just add on to the video or not and um you really just like can't go wrong with him like this unless you have specific cartridge that says you cannot exceed like three volts or you know you gotta be on it you gotta rip this live resident cartridge at a lower temperature otherwise this is crazy",

the shirt is tight as [ __ ] but what is the deal with this vaporizer band you know this is like serious like serious is serious there's some kind of petition puffco emailed me if you could sign a petition this and that i signed it but like this is crazy i mean i'm not the only one who thinks that like we live in pa they only let us vaporize bud and now they want us you know i mean to take away flower vaporizing [ __ ] like that just makes sense but what up guys i had a big ass fire in my house last night um go to sleep everything's good wake up the next morning huge power ash what up what up what up not thinking anything i go and dump it in a garbage bag and it was like five minutes later i'm like man i hope that [ __ ] ain't on fire you know still 10 minutes later i smell burning plastic as i'm hooking my hose up but the water wasn't i didn't turn the water on the inside to the outside yet it's smoldering to my yard and take away what what so anyways the whole yard burns down whatever whatever ever but they are bannon vape browsers from us uh ups fedex they're not going to be shipping at them anymore like this is ridiculously crazy uh i dropped an agricon video uh earlier i have some agricon wax here right now it's actually a picture um i took on um yeah whatever all the waxes what up what up what up but to give you a look what do you guys want to see what do you guys want to burn down spin this around my boy was asking about the this is the pretty wicked that [ __ ] was banned and yeah they're banning everywhere they're you're not you're gonna have to go to like your local probably vape store and and for real for real it it's it's getting hard to you can't even that sucks bro you stay working that casino job sucks man suck suck sucks but you're still my dude uh like i said my ex used to work hair i know the deal you got a weight widow by ak hell yeah i didn't have that one but we got this one here it's a good old uh pretty wicked this real i did one dab of this today it was good throughout the whole day this is the dream we had for real bruh for no doubt this one three or one of these we got the dream queen my dude t-rex was asking me about and this one was weird it came well guys what's going on with the laws yeah there's a vaporizer band they're abandoned vaporizers um from being sent so even from like china to here there they can't even get the product to them to even get it out here soon like it's really this is like serious as [ __ ] um the united states postal because i'm sure because all everyone's i mean it is what it is slanging [ __ ] through the mouth yeah it is but i i don't get it uh april 4th it either starts or they're dropping the real rules on uh what the real deal is but i think this is going to be serious whenever i got that message from puffcock uh asking to um even uh vape dynamics same thing with the dip they were like dude you got to sign this thing we got to fix this because this is serious so now you're going to get on to your local head shop and they're going to tax the [ __ ] out of you you know i mean instead of going straight to the supplier and getting it but like i said it might be crazy because no not yet april i think i want to say april sometime but it's i want to say april but yeah this is crazy i don't know what they're going to do i'm sure they're trying to figure something out but it just doesn't make sense man this is crazy crazy crazy why would they do this i don't know back to let's do a dab real quick trying to get lit we got the dip the puffco i sent it away i don't even know 10 days ago i ain't heard nothing how to hear from him i better get one quick i mean i yeah you better but i'm yeah i'm pretty sure that's gonna be that's how it's gonna be from what i heard this is like very gonna be very serious on the uh well yeah it's in april it might be april first they give the what's going to be allowed and i think it goes in fact april 4th maybe i'm not sure what's wrong with the blog wow really see i mean yeah you got confiscated and that's why they want to i think i don't know why but i think it's more with the cartridges in and out of the mail even empty ones because people know they're probably filming this and that i really don't know the hide or reason but there you go look at that dude got confiscated from dh gay go or dh gay you didn't get no trouble or nothing right they just took them just because april first this falls day and 420 is [ __ ] every day for me hey for real but yeah this [ __ ] is insane yeah they're saying it's drugs paraphernalia you know when all this whenever the cartridges started all coming around like it was like i pictured it as like drugs like real i mean just because it was crazy how much money it's 420 somewhere exactly but i think it has a lot to do with the cartridges is why because that's vaping and that's ain't even kill nobody that shit's over don't buy street carts i mean if you have to just know who you're buying from cause they someone yesterday my boy they're trying to change towards you now do you have a medcor to live in any legal state yeah i got a med card and live in a in a i live in a medical legal state it's not wreck i'm good bro good what's up my dude how you doing bro doing really good man a pretty chill day just that's crazy bro i hope you don't get in trouble for that i doubt you will i mean how's that paraphernalia unless it's going well no i think it's the pause i think i think that's what they want to crack down most on is the empty cartridges and [ __ ] like that like all i smoke is e-rigs this is all i [ __ ] with i don't like torches i don't like none of that [ __ ] i just rip the dip all day we're actually gonna load it sorry clean drop for you guys here a

you on this stand here me a little better shot yeah this is really you know i mean and we are only allowed to vape here and that's exactly what it is a little bit dude said we're take take people's taking the business away from the big guys and that that's just you know i mean we shouldn't be liking that should be about chilling having fun meeting new people it's such i mean it's a recreational drug like just i don't know man people don't go nuts over weed or rob house over weed and [ __ ] like that that's some nice [ __ ] right dar this camera lens sucks on this but yeah this is gonna be a

just got done shopping at the new Terrapin station the grand open on Mississippi here in Denver and as we were walking out we ended up seeing the little table for sphere X okay they have a they set up distillate cartridges one of the good things about it is that he were about this that he was shown is it's got five separate holes down at the bottom which allow you to it actually gives you a bigger hit show you right now it's very smooth to hit there's no button to turn it on you just charge it and you just go so the distillates we got today we got a mango Kush vape this is what it looks like the 500 milligram and what it says or what he was saying is that they reintroduced terpenes into it so you get most of the you know a bigger bang for your buck stuff like this the mango cush is a hybrid and as you can tell I'll show you what a big root looks like so this think it's pretty strong it's smooth if you get a chance to check it out it's spheric s-- no button batteries cartridges are easy there's no refill so alright see boy hey man y'all have a good one", "WowGr7e9ECc": "hello guys welcome back to my youtube channel subscribers thank you very much professor marine apart from 7

working on the ingredient side yeah we took the responsibility pretty seriously because you know we have hundreds of products that rely on us to be compliant with the fda and so as we march forward you know it's like we're doing as much as we can to kind of like get into that realm of of what the fda is willing to talk about right because there have been uh hemp cbd extractors that have gone through the process of getting self-affirmed grass certified or generally regarded as safe but getting that to the next step where you're getting evaluated by the fda no one's like really kind of broached that yet right so it's like there's this there's this wall that everyone's getting up to so for us is like an ingredient manufacturer proving out the safety and doing the the clinical studies to really show it's like hey we're doing as much as we can we want to see it at the table like we want to we want to make sure that we're being responsible right and i think that's the most important thing and we've seen this evolution in a lot of products over or over even just the last year right it's like there are products on the shelves that are not testing to have the the ingredients that they say they do on the label and that's something that we as an industry have to fight against because we're trying to build trust uh with the regulators with the consumers and through efficacious products that's what will lead us to like truly finding you know going back to what i say before that that product market fit for the category because you have to have products that actually work first um and so you know that comes down to doing the the blood work and the toxicology studies and all that kind of stuff and it's expensive and i think uh i don't know ben ben can probably speak to this a little bit better but that's the hard fact that a lot of capitalists have to face when when investing in this industry is like there's things that you need to invest in that don't typically make sense like in a you know i don't know when i was investing in the in the tech world right it's like you never want to invest in r d because it's expensive and it's like you just want to invest in things that proven to work but in the cannabis industry you everyone has to invest in the supply chain and the efficacy step in but i i think uh you know product formulation is a huge part of just building a brand right you build that that trust in the consumer they know the experience they're going to get every time that's exceptionally difficult in uh in formulating uh canvas products right um so uh yeah i think folks have been uh trying to build those brands um and trying to build that product consistency and ben has surely helped help many of them um and at the same time uh dealing with uh with the sort of fda overhang and um you know and some uncertainty so you see groups uh you know extending uh into cbd uh with some risk right so i think the the funds and other groups have been a bit reluctant to you know overweight too much uh to uh straight cbd investment or go too heavily into hemp uh because you might get burnt because you're uncertain of what might happen down the line we see some companies one of our portfolio companies weller um extended into a one less product wellness product so they you know they they are the top cd cbd uh beverage in in the country um but now they're launching an elderberry uh wellness themed uh sparkling beverage that allows them to get into the you know into distribution because you can't do that yet with cbd right and then they maintain that option to extend their cbd product uh down the line so um yeah i think people are are sort of finding finding their way uh in the dark here until the fda gives some indication and investors are being very careful uh with how they proceed well you guys are being kind because the frustration overall is fda's you know waffling and more stutt more this more questions like they they approve and then all of a sudden chaos and like you think that things are moving in the right direction and and then all new regulations are coming up apart so like from our point of view we feel like you know more of collective voice and lobby you know lobbying and everyone's sort of on the same team to to make sure that what the fda does sort of sticks and doesn't continue to change and create new hurdles in this industry yeah just the psa and it wasn't all bad news for the cannabis space because in proteins oils hearts um for from from hemp seeds that there's no petition uh from uh the fda on fresh hemp foods grass statement so manufacturers can utilize hemp protein oil and hearts across all of their products without any fear of reprisal from any regulation so you know if you want to sprinkle a little hemp protein powder in your products there's there's you have no problem with that so we're seeing a lot of manufacturers who uh are from their nutritional labels want to put hemp on the front of the package and on the nutritional label on the back and buying our products and and formulating with those and not really sure whether the consumer is aware of it i experience that myself where consumers pick up a bottle of hemp seed oil and they say holy moly i can get eight ounces of hemp seed oil for or hemp oil for for for ten dollars wow and they probably think it's something else right but uh and so i'm sure there's some marketers and some manufacturers that are pulling that car but that's one of the the great things about um about being in the hemp food industry is uh there there really aren't any legal barriers uh or regulatory barriers for us to to expand our market into the market"}
