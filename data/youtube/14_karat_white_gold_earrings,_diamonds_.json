for the clarity because it's really difficult to see those imperfections in general but especially in that location it's hard for people to kind of get a close eye on them diamond studs come in all different shapes pretty much all of the stone shapes that you would find for an engagement ring you can also find for diamond studs there is a question of do I go certified or not certified and this is really up to the buyer I would say that the certification is not really necessary unless you're looking at a carat weight that's one carat each or over as long as the stone is cut well you're still gonna get the sparkle and brilliance for settings they're really only a couple of Styles to think about the most classic would be your 3 or 4 prong the 4 prong can make a round stone look a little bit more square because it does sort of square out the edge whereas three prong you can see a little bit more of the round edge of the stone and then other a settings you'll find or the bezel setting this is really nice if you're doing something in a colored metal where you want to see that color it's also nice if you want to give the stone a slightly bigger look to it because it does sort of fill out the size of the stone and then the last we'll talk about it the halo similar to an engagement ring it's a perimeter of diamonds that goes around your center stone it definitely adds size to the appearance so if you're wanting to be in a budget but have a bigger look the halos definitely good way to achieve back for the metal color white gold or platinum is going to be the most common what's nice about it is that it just disappears so all you really see is diamond and sparkle yellow gold or rose gold you're going to see that metal a little bit more so it's going to stand out and a lot of people are concerned if they wear mostly yellow gold or rose gold jewelry that a white gold stud won't match but I really think that the prongs on studs are generally so minimal that especially in white gold they sort of just disappear so you won't even notice that there's metal there figuring out what size is best for you is sort of the tricky part of it and you really do need to try them on studs are actually an amazing gift because it's sort of a life long piece that a woman can have so if you're a guy out there trying to buy for your wife or your girlfriend your fiance you should try to keep in mind that this is something she's going to have forever so you want the size to be substantial enough that you won't need to upgrade it in just a couple of years think about this as like a long-term gift diamond studs are definitely not an inexpensive gift so things to think about as alternatives would be potentially doing a colored stone set with maybe diamonds around it as a halo that's something really easy to wear everyday if it's a color that she loves something like this flower which is a cluster of smaller diamonds but sort of from far away looks like one big stone is a really good option and then really anything with pave will keep you in a really friendly price point so there are fun ways to do you know an everyday stud that feels important without it breaking things diamond studs are a classic gift they're timeless and ageless and every woman should have a pair at some point in her lifetime you", "kq6BSo34jCs": "diamond studs of one carat each VVS quality you can see these we have made in six prong setting set in 18 karat yellow gold with the tip of the prong being white in color so the specialty of this is the difference of this pair compared to a retail store is that you know around 95% of this earring goes behind the diamond so what I have done is I have inspected you know diamonds several diamonds and found one pair which is exactly in the same parameters when I say parameters it means the diameter are similar that the table that percentages are very close to each other and then set it into a design which is absolutely as per customers requirement now these design can range from you know one lakh rupee up till 20 lakh rupees or $1,500 to $20,000 everything depends on what quality and size you are looking for but all in all I am trying to say is you know with my expert guidance I have managed to save a great amount of deal and managed to find a much better pair because I am based in the biggest wholesale market of diamonds in Mumbai where all the wholesale manufactures are supplying the diamonds and for sourcing from here helps you not pay for any kind of branding or any kind of high and expenses of a retail store so by better quality at the right price is what we offer customers across the world so that interests you then get in touch with me thank you", "w79bjEBvaFI": "DIAMOND TENNIS.

prior and as well as two pairs of earrings both of those earrings are wedding gifts for my husband on our wedding day and I actually wore one of those earrings for my wedding day fucking-a photographed really well and I highly recommend that piece every diamond PC buy from Costco includes an article of description the clarity of Costco diamonds are always be s2 or greater and the color it's always I or greater so at least you're going to get that standard of quality from Costco so here we have a 14-karat white gold and diamond cluster earrings each earring set was one round brilliant cut diamond weighing approximately 0.14 it's surrounded by six smaller round brilliant cut diamonds the total diamond weight of the earrings is 1.25 carats so I'm currently wearing the larger earrings right here so these earrings retail for 1800 which is not too bad considering that you'd get a total carat count of 1.25 carats next we have the 14-karat white gold and diamond floral earring each earring set with 11 round brilliant cut diamonds the total diamond weight of the earrings is 0.45 carats or greater so I actually wear these earrings on a daily basis because they're nice and small and I don't feel them and I also like the fact that they are kind of flat so they don't stick out on your ear so when you're sleeping at night you don't have like this big diamond stud kind of poking into you so I really like that about these earrings these earrings retail for 650 and purchase them in store I'm not sure if we still have them online I'll try to find them online but yeah definitely check out your local Costco if you're interested it got these somewhat recently within the past year or so so they may still have it next we have 14-karat white gold and diamond ring the ring is set with two round brilliant cut diamonds each weighing approximately 0.48 carats and 54 smaller round brilliant cut diamond the total diamond weight is 1.5 carats or greater so this ring retails for $3,400 and you can reference my previous video on this ring as well if you want more information on that but my husband actually picked it up from me in Portland Oregon where they don't have sales tax so he was able to save even more so this is actually my second wedding ring my first wedding rings are actually a Tiffany ring which I also have a video on that as well if you're interested so here's a size comparison between these two now your Costco earring or ring purchase will come in one of these boxes so this is the protective outer layer and inside as your standard mahogany Brown tone wooden jewelry box so I actually have three of these boxes because both my ring animal pairs of earrings in one of these boxes and yeah it looks just like this and of course also and not yellow box would be the article of description as I showed you previously now that Costco jewelry boxes differ quite a bit in comparison to the Tiffany jewelry box as you can see the Tiffany one it's a nice suede material it's much smaller in fact and the hinge is a lot smoother right here so yeah all the others the Tiffany box is much more compact and easy to hold there's no jagged edges as of recently the past year Tiffany has rebranded their jewelry boxes to become this iconic Tiffany blue color and right now we just have a push closure that will open up your box like such and here's the Costco box in comparison honestly I think the packaging is kind of cheap for Costco I know it's Costco and you are trying to save a buck however I mean this situation is just not that classy if you're trying to give someone a gift because my box is already broken right here as you can see and yeah it's very cheaply made and this box if you look on the bottom and occu says Made in China not surprisingly so yeah I would say got in one drawback to purchasing jewelry from Costco and that the presentation is not the greatest", "B16DIvwpjZQ": "fine diamonds jewelry from the diamond

"zQdu1qSXUt0": "every second there are so many choices in this the key to all of them is gold gold and gold all of these rings are set in gold celebrating 30 years which is how we did it originally with Dominique set in precious metal world's finest simulated diamond so it's yellow gold or white gold mm-hmm you have your choice of carat size or carat weight and then your choice of cut right okay those three things yellow white carat weight or size and then the cut of the individual stone set that up so here the one carat two carats or three carats I'm gonna start big or go home I'll just don't like it right here I'm really good at it cuts Meg you help me out I'll go like this I'll hold these up and then you go for it all right we're gonna go side to side here so that's the oh okay that's the pear shape that we're looking at right there right there are three care in the pear shape then there's a fancy heart that is a specialty cut and boy boy is it difficult to do then the oval oh I'm having a moment with ovals right now I think it's classic like the round but it'll long gates on the finger you're gonna love the oval look at the color that gold it's beautiful all of these are under 160 crazy crazy crazy even if you're getting the large three carat here's the second row alright so in the second row we have that beautiful emerald cut for you you have a step cutting where you can peer right into that stone it's crisp it's clean it's gorgeous here comes the middle there's the middle one with our cushion cut so think about a princess cut but it's a little bit more rounded of a pillow shape it's very very soft in its look but it's a durable stone also cuz it's diamonique six prongs on the Marquise mm Wow or keys back in a big way is it it is it's making a big big comeback okay and we're not finished yet one carrot - carrot three carat size and all of these Chuck choices Wow go big or go home okay that's a three carat round look at that baby that sure is again six prongs no one is going to second-guess if that is a diamond or a diamond eek because they see the six prongs they may say hey is that real you say it sure is real gold it is indeed real gold and next to that is the ash machine now there if you ever want to see what an asscher-cut looks like it's a step cut so it's on like a princess cut you see the corners are angled and it's a step cut so it's extraordinarily unique shape and cut of a stone that's your Asher and next to that is the princess and they see the difference dramatic princess is a square shape or that square silhouette but then it's faceted Aaron like a round stone right so you get that sparkle if you love brilliance to your stones then you look for cuts that are like the round brilliant the princess cut even the oval cut in the Marquise the pear shape and the heart will have that for you oh if you love step cuts though your choice is here you want to be thinking about the Asher the emerald yeah and then did you have one more Asher I think those are probably are too sexy that's in there yeah okay now I want to do kind of the same thing if I could in the white gold to Karen again so it's one carrot - carrot three carrot I can do white or yellow in any of these choices and then simply get the cut that you want all of it on six easy payments so the one carrot starts at six easy payments of 23 2004 24 and then your stepping up when it comes to the three carat if you'd like to do it to the six easy payments of $26 you can't go wrong and look at the difference in white true actual white gold not plaid but white gold so this is giving you more of that white-hot feeling right it's it's crisp and it's clean if you just like that sparkle to sort of feel uninterrupted that's what you're going to love from this white gold look look at simple that bandit I mean that in the best possible sense like no fooling around it looks like a platinum band but it's a it's a white gold band so so the so if you want to size this you could take this to a half size it's real gold it's honest to goodness real beautiful gold those are the three choices up top next one done in white gold here we go there's the Emerald again for you this is a two-carat we're looking at now that is your cushion in the center and after that you will have the Marquis so maybe this is your chance to get that replacement ring so when you're traveling you can wear a ring with confidence but maybe you're looking for that upgrade ring too at the bottom you'll see the round you're loving this one by the way white gold round loving my producers letting me know white gold a sure so right up front don't wait five six seven eight nine and ten white gold big beautiful two carat princess cut what is it two carat princess cut cost not a one carat but a two carat I mean I remember back in the day out yeah carat and a quarter I know it well was $5,500 and that was almost 20 years ago depending on the quality of the stone the color of the stone right I mean this could be absolute fortune a fortune in the last minute here we go with the one care and a great way to start but most people go with the three there's the one in the last minute you know what let's come back to the three I do you know what I want to do here's what we should do Erin let me take these guys right here mm-hmm and show the difference between the

you showed earlier how these diamonds are set they're set so close together that you don't see any space between the diamonds this is what patrons talking I just took two of our diamonique stones and what we what they do is I mean this has to be so like microscopically done where you don't see they take them and they just put the two facets that come together right up against each other and that way you never ever see that are the problem the space that you see there it looks like looks like a facet of the larger diamond so it really is an incredible piece these are all white natural diamonds lots of 14-karat gold your choice of yellow white or Rose this is a classic and will never go out of style the six easy payments that you're getting today is only today because that goes away at the end of the day but there's no reorder on them okay Chandra that's they'll take a look at our earrings right now this is what this is the look we love we love this classic it looks like one large diamond in each year you know these are all full cut diamonds of finest 58 facets brilliant cut they have the most Sparkle and brilliance but the way that they're cut each one is precision cut and precision set under a microscope you know a lot of times a diamond person will just count out okay 50 diamonds he's going to set those diamonds not here you have to match each set in each ear because they're precision cut for that earring this looks so good with the naked eye I'm know I'm gonna tell you the next shot that you're going to see it's under HD camera and that is basically you're looking at it under my or scope that you see things on our HD cameras and your these these fandangled televisions that you don't see with the naked eye you don't see in real life right I always give the example of the little bit of hair on my knuckles can you see here on my knuckles oh no you can't in real life but on TV when I go like this I look like oh you know I should be on Planet of the Apes but I'm not gonna get rid of that cuz I don't wanna have to braid it when I'm 90 so but that's what I mean it's on TV you see things that you don't see with the naked eye so when you get these home honestly paint with the naked eye you see these look unbelievable unbelievably real I'm sorry what did you say Frank Oh yellow gold is now completely gone your choice of yellow gold white gold or rose gold the white now is last call in all sizes of carat weights and in the Rose two dozen left in each size that's it that's it by the way that's just the basket holding it the diamonds are set in white gold Wow okay so there's no reorder on those no reorder", "p7etZewiujo": "[Music] so [Music] you", "i8GPM4iPD40": "what's going on everyone it's Britton with Dakota fine jewelry your personal jeweler in this video we're gonna talk about white gold and white rhodium mainly the rhodium now with rhodium 99.9% okay that might be a little too high but most jewelry especially here in America in the state if it's white gold it has the rhodium finish why because it shines it up and makes it nice and shiny and protects it it's like the shiny car in the showroom will sell manufacturers that manufacture chain the shiny the more yellow it is the higher percentage it's going to jump out in that showcase and sell so that is the trick now the rhodium what is rhodium it's not a bad thing it's actually a really expensive alloy it's in the same family as platinum and it's used again to make a piece nice and shiny and it also is hard and protects those pieces resistance from scratches so it's a very good thing and I want to show you guys a few pieces for example so you can look at it and I'll showcase my five and a half flat curb just to kind of see the wear and tear of a white gold rhodium piece over years because I also get questions about that with that being said let's get started there are a few white gold pieces that I have laid out first one being a finish to code to Jesus piece and it has diamonds in the crown because I deserve it and that it has the rhodium finish you can see how nice and shiny it is here's another this is a custom shield medallion that I made for my client bar we work together on this masterpiece now the interesting thing with this one is it's two separate has a yellow gold plate on top soldered on to a white gold plate so it's not like we did a rhodium finish on all yellow gold it actually is casted white gold you could see there in the back solid and then for the top of the yellow gold we just lasered his crest design and then you could see like the two-tone different laser colors there it's really cool let me get closer there and this smaller piece about I'd say half dollar size is 14 grams so it is made with integrity it is made well it's a jacoti piece so you guys know and just look how completely clean that is really awesome job thanks barb for letting me borrow this an extra day to put it on this video and then here is a a raw casting of a 14k white gold diamond flat ring this is for Michael he ordered it on the Black Friday sale so if you notice here it has a like a gunmetal color to it that is the natural color of 14k white gold before the rhodium polish and the rhodium plating I should say and then the polish so it really shines it up so here you have more of a natural organic color and then here's my five and a half black curb and I wanted to include this because people ask me all the time what's gonna happen to my white gold over time this is eight years old I wear it 24/7 365 days out of the year and as you can see it's still holding up nice if you look in between these links there's a slight yellow where that where that yellow gold is showing through the rhodium wears off and these are white gold casted pieces but over time with that friction that yellow gold might show through especially be high friction with like the link chains they rub together so all you really need is just a rhodium plating but again eight years and I'm still not even thinking about rhodium this chain because it looks good if I put my Jesus piece next to it it looks the same so that is the benefit of the rhodium plating is it's almost like an armor over your white gold it keeps it shiny it resists the scratches it's a very good thing to have as you can see the proof is actually in the pudding here because it's all nice stuff so there you guys have it we looked at the the raw cast of 14k white gold we looked at rhodium finish pieces as well as my flat curb so you can kind of see the differences you know if you didn't really know better you might be wary of buying a white gold piece with rhodium because you would think well you know six months down the road I'm just gonna have like a terrible looking chain with a yellow gold showing underneath that's not the case and from my experience when I look at rhodium pieces they hold up for a while just just that's why I want to show the five and a half black herd that I have because I don't want to just tell you guys I want to show you and the best is from experience and that chain is old and it's been through everything and it still looks really good the rhodium is on there it shines it's very nice so if that's a good option a good route to have it's not a bad thing to have rhodium like I said it's really expensive and it's very useful as well when it comes to white gold jewelry they use it for silver if it for higher-end silver pieces you'll use rhodium so it's everywhere do some more research if you have more questions but again it's a safe thing to have and it really does make a difference on a piece of white gold jewelry that's it for today's video and we will see you on our next jewelry video", "SFiti7pT7O0": "[Music] so

frame which code you find jewelry so a personal jeweler in this video we're doing the most quickest basic way to clean your gold jeweler your jewelry this is very easy to do at home in case your chains your pieces get dull and you need a quick freshen up now this is a three part series this one is the easiest to do and a lot of you guys can try it most you guys probably already do this yourselves the next one we'll take it up and uh not and then the following will be more on a professional level too so you guys can really see how these pieces get cleaned and looking restored like brand new you buy your chains you buy your jewelry it's sparkly it's shining that's how it should be everything needs to be cleaned up if you think about it your dog needs washed your car needs to be cleaned I hope you guys are cleaning yourselves on a regular basis you guys get the point you buy something and eventually you wear it a lot it needs to be clean so we have to address that show you guys how it's done or at least how I do it and how I recommend it so what that means it let's get started when you spend all this money on jewelry you want to wear it that's what you're spending it for if you're just buying gold to invest it then put it in your safe buy pants buy bars it's a better Buy but when we're talking chains when we're talking the Rings you've got to keep it clean because you'd be shocked and I will show you guys what how it this gold collects dirt over time and how it just kind of keeps it in depends on the link depends on the piece some are easier to clean than others but the two pieces we're gonna use our bulk bracelets a two and a half millimeter Franco I will show you guys a side by side of a brand new one verse one that's been worn every single day for four months and then also a three-and-a-half millimeter rope bracelets side by side of a brand new rope laces you guys can see because when you get it it's nice it's shiny it's great you put it on sometimes you don't really notice how dirty it's getting until you see a brand new one so you've definitely got to keep up and keep these pieces clean freshen up this jewelry we're gonna use a method that is very easy and straightforward takes you no time at all that's why I recommend it to you guys and you'll see it does a great job we're gonna need a bowl of water I put in the microwave for 30 seconds be careful that water is hot when you take it out and then you squeeze a couple drops of Dawn dish so if you just need a mild detergent it's not gonna affect diamonds gold anything like that and you let those chains anything you're cleaning just sit in there for a little bit this is more of it's not a chore it's a spa day for your jewelry it works hard to make you look good to make you feel good easily these chains make me from a four to a 4.3 so you've got to put in the time of work to keep them shining because they work for you at the end of the day now after you let it sit you take them out and careful that water is hot and you just scrub them now the thing is you don't want an old toothbrush that's like really stiff and hard you're gonna scratch that gold you won't scratch diamonds but you'll scratch that gold because gold is soft so you've got to make sure that sponge is soft as well as if you're using a sponge I like sponge or toothbrush the toothbrush is better because it kind of gets into those crevices and really doesn't just like if you're brushing your teeth so but make sure that bristle is pretty soft when you're scrubbing and just take your time and work it now you don't have to like put your back into this scrubbing process if you scrub it like 10 times harder it's not really gonna make a difference so just take your time with it and not try to rush it and put a lot of pressure into scrubbing it and just work with it and go up and down that chain try to get inside those links and get that dirt out because that dirt like how we found the gold inside rocks inside crevices that's where that dirts gonna go it's gonna go to where the crevices are and just trap and hide in there which is the bad thing so you gotta do your best the best you can with this method to work all that dirt out but after a nice scrub-a-dub-dub you put it back in the tub all that's left to do really is just rinse it off with water just to get the soap up and then towel dry this process you really don't even need when I get out of the shower I don't even dry my chains it's gold it's good to go that's why I spend money for gold just so I could have at that convenience this is really just for the video and of course like after you clean something you want to just dry it really nice it's like the the cherry on top of that you did a good job it's so you sleep better at night okay and that's pretty much it guys it's a very simple process of I wasn't filming this it would take me like two minutes so if you're going out to dinner you just need a freshen up your change or jewelry it takes such a little time and really we're doing this method for is that surface area the top part that the oils and lotions it really does out diamonds doles out gold and you'll see the shine come back now as far as in between the links like a rope train that's gonna require the next step another video for me to show you guys in case you want to invest in some cleaning equipment to get a better clean this has its limitations of course it's not going to make it completely brand new but from time to time you could just use this because it does not take any time at all to do it and you just kind of get that luster back whether you're talking diamonds or gold so it works pretty well in my opinion let me know if you try it or if you've tried it what you think of it and if your jewelry goes back to looking nice and clean thank you guys for watching let me know if you have any questions that's it for today's video and we will see you on our next jewelry video",

about our 18 karat gold hoops and glanced over at Mary to see what earring she was wearing and she did the smart thing she was wearing diamonds mmm like let's just go ahead and get a look at that these are the half carat total weight diamond stud earrings by if any others so pretty on you well she's so pretty behemoth oh you are lovely when you see them up close and you see the cluster design of these diamonds you will understand now why that half carat really does radiate even more to the eye than a half carat affinity is our own signature brand of diamonds here at QVC if you've not heard of it before it doesn't mean that it is like diamonds these are genuine eye clean diamonds and what really blows my mind Mary these are customer top-rated diamond earrings top-rated like I know if you're making the investment on diamond earrings you're opening up that box and going alright QVC show me what you got right cuz I gave you that much money I want to see something that's gonna take my breath away it took your breath away and what I saw and your reviews over and over and over again was the word sparkle Sparkle Sparkle I can't believe the sparkle two color choices in the gold bed in which the diamonds lie hmm but isn't it funny why you're looking at them right now look like almost exact same earring because there's so much diamonds I'm sorry they kind of cover up the gold a little bit I'll pour us through your choice of white or yellow gold you know just go with your typical preference you love the white it's likely because it creates a much more unbroken clean look in the diamonds and then the yellow gold lovers because you love yellow gold right and that's what you typically wear not only did we take a hundred and fifty dollars off markdown on diamonds we then divided that into six easy payments so these diamond stud earrings can be yours for fifty eight dollars and 17 cents they will not be reordered they cannot be reordered and maintain this kind of a value Wow I just I know I looking at the light bounce off of those diamonds I mean there's just nothing like it and this is your everyday earring I mean I wear the same pair of earrings every single day because they have a great story and I love them dearly these could be your story you can pick these up taking advantage of those six easy payments and think of it you can wear them forever you can absolutely wear them forever if you have a fancy occasion great but if you don't wear them every day they're just subtle enough so that they're not so in-your-face but they are dressy enough because hi they're diamonds you can wear them to any fancy occasion when we come back I do want to kind of get a little bit tighter and show you that close-up of what's happening with the diamonds you see that right there it is that cluster design the halo design or a bouquet whatever you want to call it in these individual diamonds when we take diamonds down to these smaller carat weights individually and they still do this do you see that sunburst of light well that's because you're starting out with such great diamonds to begin with when you cluster them together hahaha that's on fire light bulbs what do they do right they absolutely radiate and regardless of if you're choosing the white or yellow gold those gold prongs of course hold the diamond securely but add to the radiance of these that's why I would argue stud earrings like this in many ways their properties are better than a solitaire because in a solitaire really the only way to get that kind of a breathtaking Sparkle is to have a flawless diamond and they're not cheap well here you still have such great quality and diamonds only because they're individually faceted and then cluster together the light just does that mmm which is why they look so great on Mary and Dianna and you and they come home for $58 and 17 cents that's just the icing on the cake as far as I'm concerned I mean you've got me I'm in I wanted to have everybody see the size just because I think that always is such a nice perspective sure especially when we talk about these carat weights like what does that mean you saw them on Mary and Diana but we're at about a quarter of an inch from top to bottom and I just love it every time the light just is off it like that and then you know what it's worth doing - I know about to wrap this up I was gonna yeah good you've got honey great just so you can see how much gold is in there as well and then that post in clutch that's all gold - now I need to give you an update on how many we have if you want the yellow gold one dozen remaining and how many fewer than a dozen in the white and great thank you for showing that because remember we got all those branches of gold 14-carat gold holding up those diamonds as well so in every way nothing's been scaled back well that's a lie the price has been scaled back yay great point by a hundred and fifty dollars get them home as beautiful as they look here on the screen under these lights you've got to get it in sunlight incandescent light your own night and if they don't make you think what all of those top rated customers think sparkle Sparkle Sparkle oh my gosh send them back right but you got to try it first to know J 3 2 4 5 8 7 so excited to see this Jim", "fFIA5nt6KGc": "diamonds all right the it's no secret these are some of our favorites it seems that a lot of people want to start here in the diamond couture collection this is that million-dollar look this is that princess feel this is that true highest of high straight out of the pages of a magazine look that is available and affordable for a hundred and fifty nine dollars if you use your HSN credit card I mean even less over the 12 months you can choose today to own solid 14 karat gold in the yellow or in the white if you can I would buy this in a heartbeat I would hasten to say that most people who are shopping in this hour we'll buy this collection so you have your earrings and we have it i just want to share with you right out of the gate dependent because the pendant which comes to the 18 inch necklace is that same price so if we were to look anywhere seamer from the biggest name stores boutiques galleries in the world we would see this type of design but we wouldn't see the lock does she have sheer magnificence of the size of these diamonds anywhere near this price you will not find this I can guarantee that personally and I say it over and over take it to your jeweler when you buy it take it to the person you trust the most I do have a jeweler also that I trust the most so you take it to them and you tell them what you paid for this and I want to hear back from you what they told you so this is over here is half a charachter where you have a look of a two-character I'm talking about the earring right now the earrings are a double halo look at the beauty about this now I'm gonna tell you many things about this you will never ever lose my earrings look at the pushback it's called French push back their special pushbacks that they hold the earring so tight so secure that you will never ever lose a pair of earring again because I lose earrings all the time and that word worries me so I design around what I love and what worries me and what I need to do to the piece for everybody else you also have to look at the devil halo that i'm talking about that it's in fashion right now everyone talks about halo now if you're wondering what we talked number when we say halo we're talking about a solitaire in the middle right with a circle around it that that circle is also with diamonds that's what halo is this is a double halo this has a show later in the middle with two rows of diamond going around you have hundred and fifteen diamonds your ladies hundred and fifteen diamonds handset under a microscope now I'm going to tell you a little bit about this patented technology that we're doing so we're taking all of these diamonds and four prongs holds these diamonds together there is no air there is nothing going in between those diamonds and magically these diamonds are being held together and giving you the look of a two character or three character that's what this collection is about so can I just reiterate what you just said how many diamonds did you say 116 on the earrings folks in these earrings there are 116 stones why don't I see them why don't I see all of those times why do I just see one beautiful big bold solitaire in the center well it's because of the setting that Cena said this is revolutionary people have never seen anything like this plot I never seen anything like until December this is an invisible setting so there's no space as no gap there's no air there's nothing in between single cut and full cut diamonds together that create an absolute spectacle these earrings yes they do look so much more than the half carat that they are because of that and it's no I mean I know see what mom is saying but the response has been through the roof but there's a lot of intrigue docena people want to see them themselves with their own eyes yes and that's why the reviews have been through the roof because you see it on TV and it looks incredible but when you see it yourself that's when you're really fall when you open that box when you look at that diamond earrings or pendant I want you to write to me I want you to tell me how you felt you feel a twinkle in your heart that's what you're gonna feel you feel that brightness the shine is coming out of that box the the patented is about my darling we just sold out the yellow gold so yellow gold has officially gone folks I now have the solid 14 karat white gold in the earrings and the pendant we will spend a few moments on the pendant of course you can buy them together or just x by itself I just want to reiterate that VIP financing if you have your HSN credit card $66 65 cents that's all you will pay today $66 and 65 cents if you apply to your HSN credit card right now you can also take twenty dollars off any single item purchase see me you were mid flow please I'm sorry continue that's okay so I want you to also i want to keep talking about the patented the idea of the Diamonds together I have here two large diamonds for us actually they're not diamonds but we made them look like a show absolutely and you can talk about them and you can explain as I as I explained you you can he gonna model it from you I will do my best for you seen him so look at that one of the stones is a full cart and one of the stones is a single card so you will bring in these two stones together in this patented technology and that's why the brilliancy comes like a fire you have 58 facets on the folk art you have maintained facets on the single card and once these two merge and come and get married that's the outlook that's the look of you you get that large look that no one no one until they take microscope can tell that this is many stones creating the cluster for us so you know naked I can tell this right right this is magic and a lot of you called me magician after you saw this yes I read I read every review i want you to know i read every review i pay attention to their reviews i love when you write whether it's good or bad both i love them most thank God most of it is good but I'll read them I take it to my heart and and I do this from heart I am very passionate about what I do I think on one of the few designers that when we sell out I actually feel bad because it's like my babies are leaving me and they're dead they're they're gone and she gets very emotional about it it's true I to know so if you're looking at it you told me to remind you if you don't mention their praise holes I liked it I liked it seemed escaping me a check all right this is the icing on the cake we have wowed you and romanced you with the amazing design the spectacle of this patented setting

bend it with your fingers my name is sarolta blessing and the goldsmith and designer for barrels jewelers all gold that comes from the earth is a really rich yellow color we then have to harden it to be strong enough to wear as jewelry 18 karat has got a 75 percent purity and 25 percent other alloys so if you wanted yellow gold then you you'll mix it with a bit of copper and a bit of brass and a bit of silver with white gold it is palladium that's added to create 75 percent purity we keep the metal separate so when you cost yellow you'll always use your yellow crucible when you cost white to always cost with your 18 karat white gold yellow will always leave a slight tinge in the metal and therefore all white gold jewellery will have a rhodium coating the properties are virtually the same the same malleability they've got the same hardeners they melt roughly at the same temperature [Music] just in the alleyway that's added to the white gold quite often the best alloy to use as palladium so when that's mixed together with the gold it does increase the melting they will be a difference in price due to the alloy of palladium that's added to the gold to make it white due to the fluctuating price of palladium that could have quite a big impact on the price of 18 karat white gold the copper or the brass that's added is quite low it doesn't really have much of an impact to the to the cost of 18 karat yellow gold I think lady M has always had an a higher value yellow gold all it needs is to be cleaned and polished every now and again that never gets any any plating or coatings added to it it's difficult to say how regularly you have to have your white gold radium plated we have people that want to have it done every six months which we don't really recommend we do also have a lot of people that actually quite like the warmer feel of a natural white gold [Music] so we have 18 karat white gold unpolished and 18 karat yellow gold unpublished I personally like the

millimeters is probably our my son regularly sold with so that is just about four and a half millimeters wide once you've decided on yellow gold jewelry or white gold jewelry you will you will normally stick to that that color the only time that we would use a little bit of both is when they are diamonds or other precious stones involved in the design most commonly stones are mounted in a

I'm Josh Fishman president and owner of a Fishman and some diamonds in New York welcome back to our ultimate diamond education series today I would like to discuss a question that I'm often asked and it has to do with what metal should your engagement ring be made out of it should be made out of white gold or should it be made out of platinum the option is also to have it made in yellow gold but there there's nothing to discuss because if it was yellow we would make it in yellow gold but if we gonna make it in white the color white which is a much more requested color today then the question comes up should it be made in white gold or platinum there are a number of differences which are not necessarily visual which I would like to describe to you as to why you should choose either white gold or platinum at the end I will give you my advice so let's start with what the differences are between white gold and platinum let's talk about the intrinsic color of platinum versus white gold and the process called rhodium plating both white gold and platinum are white in color however there are significant differences the intrinsic color of white gold is actually a little grayish and yellowish that's because of the alloys that go in to make white gold usable because you cannot work with 24 karat gold the finished process called rhodium plating enables a white gold ring to look equally as shiny and bright as platinum rhodium is a hard shiny tarnish proof metal which is used to coat through an electrolysis process the ring that is made in white gold it is also used to finish off a ring in platinum so from a visual perspective both a white gold ring and a platinum ring finished with a rhodium plating process will look the same however over time rhodium plating wears away in both white gold and platinum the duration depends on the where and the number of years etc but it can be replated to look exactly like it did before however when a white gold rings rhodium plating wears away you get to see the base color of the white gold which is going to be tinted grayish yellowish when a platinum ring which is rhodium plating wears off with the rhodium plating you will see still a white ring although it will not look as shiny as it did with rhodium plating so that is one aspect of the difference between platinum and white gold which should be considered and that is what is the intrinsic color of the metal but there are more important issues than that and let me turn to the second one now what is the difference in the weight of the two metals although rhodium-plated white gold and rhodium plated platinum jewelry are virtually indistinguishable to the casual observer there is a significant difference in the weight of the jewelry item due to the density of platinum versus white gold a platinum item of jewelry will weigh approximately two times what that item will weigh in white gold and there will be a significant difference in the feel of the ring that will factor in to the issues of cost and desirability as I go to the next difference which is cost what is the price difference between white gold and platinum let's see if I can describe the differences in the price of platinum versus gold rings without too much myth historically the price of platinum was more expensive than the price of gold in the intrinsic metal because platinum is rarer and also had industrial uses but today it's actually the reverse as of today September 14th 2018 an ounce of platinum is $800 and an ounce of gold is 50% more $1200 now that is not the only difference of course the metal used in jewelry for platinum is 95% pure while the purity of the white gold that is used in jewelry is fifty eight and a half percent pure about a third less if you take the fact that platinum is twice as heavy and you take the difference in the purity you end up today with an intrinsic cost of platinum at about twice the cost of white gold for the same piece of jewelry but that is not the only factor that goes into manufacturing a piece of jewelry you had the labor which is approximately the same well a little bit more expensive for platinum because it is a little less malleable and the cost of any diamonds that accent the ring so in the end if you have just a plain platinum ring versus a plain white gold ring you'll have a ring that costs about twice as much as it does in white gold versus platinum and if you have some diamonds on the accents on the ring the platinum ring will not cost as much as the difference without diamonds because you're adding other costs into it which level out a little bit of the difference between platinum and white gold next I'd like to discuss what it is that you should do in your choice and what my advice is so what should you do in your making your choice I strongly believe that your decision should be based on your overall budget if you have a more limited budget I would strongly recommend that you use 14 carat white gold here are the advantages one a lower cost to a beautiful ring which looks identical to a ring in platinum that will be finished with rhodium plating and three the ability to put more of your budget into the major diamond of your ring which is not an insignificant amount let's say for example you have a budget of three or four thousand dollars to spend $400 extra of that budget in the making a platinum ring will severely limit the quality or size of the diamond you can buy within your budget so I strongly recommend 14 white gold because I think in the end the long-term value of your purchase is in the diamond and that's what you should focus most on on the other hand if you have a more generous budget let's say eight or ten thousand dollars or more I would strongly recommend that you use platinum you have a heavier better feeling ring on your hand you have not a significant price difference in white gold versus platinum within your overall budget to the point that I would say that if you can't afford the extra $500 maybe you're in the world budget and you have ultimately a better value because you're able to stick with the larger better quality diamond that you've selected so in the end I really think it comes down to your personal budget if you select a 14-karat white gold ring because of your more limited budget you can always upgrade that to platinum for not that much more money in the future so that's it on this differences between platinum and white gold you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me either by phone or by email until next time this is Josh Fishman saying so long [Music] you", "mPVHG-qt1O4": "looks like via's beautifully done these are 30 points for the pair so each stone is 15 points a lot of sparkle and shine beautifully

"a lot of customers ask me what is the difference between platinum and white gold my name is sarolta Percy I'm a goldsmith he had barrels jewelers I have been working for the company for the last 16 years and I get to deal with all the respect designs and remodelings for the company and customers Platinum is a natural silver colored metal and will never change color where 18 karat white gold actually originates being a really rich yellow color we have to then add alloys to the yellow gold to be able to make it white platinum is actually 33% denser and heavier than white gold due to that reason due to the difference in densities platinum wears slower than 18 karat white gold I've got two pieces of metal here one is 18 karat white gold and the other one is platinum and when I hold it in my hand even they they are cut exactly the same size and length I can feel the difference between the two metals the platinum and my right is definitely lot heavier if you are making a pair of earrings we always advise that you go with white gold as it'll be lighter when you wear it in your ears rather than a heavy platinum earring if you weigh ring for example it is actually quite nice to have a little bit of an extra white in the ring because it feel you can feel the difference in the quality of the metals Platinum is 30 times more rare and less mind than gold so that's the first main reason for the price difference there's also a difference in the cost of manufacturing platinum due to the higher melting points of it will occur more manufacturing costs and therefore it's another reason of the higher price all white gold jewelry gets the coating on rhodium this coating is electroplated and they fall wears off over the years so if you go to our website and you look at all our white gold and platinum jewelry you will not be able to see the difference between platinum and white gold they look exactly the same due to the fact that white gold is rhodium plated so I hope this brief explanation between the difference between eighteen carat white gold and platinum has answered some of your questions about the two metals we will have some more videos that explain in more

remember the stars we had before so if you want start with a little bit of a flirt you I like to be different I am a girl that I don't like to be like the rest of the world so if you don't like that round stud and you want to be different this is your start this is the start that has an outlook of a two-carat that means that every ear is one carat every ear is one carat and this is matching to the pendant and again the sides have all diamonds the front has all diamonds you don't see any gold do you see the prompts do you see anything there you see nothing but diamonds girl's best friend that's all you see and like Adam said this is appraised at 2,300 witches are lowest that means i had an appraisal for 3,000 I had an appraisal for 2,500 but we brought you they're only allowed to show you the lowest one so we appraise this and if you want to buy it two carat H I how long I one hammer I to it's about ten thousand ten thousand dollars it's about and this is not something I'm making up this is something you can look up online you could say I want an H I look at that how gorgeous that is that's all my god I love that shot that's my passion that's when we said it look at how many pieces we setting look at the casting look at the cat the cat was my favorite because I the cat made sure there is no metal showing make sure that you see only the girl's best friend the diamonds only the shiny look at our beautiful model look at how it is shining through her earlobes he wears this she walks into the office I bet with you every girl over there is going to say how many thousands of dollars you spend on that I'm telling you this has a look of three four five seven eight nine ten thousand this is heirloom this is 14-karat gold this is not silver this is not fashion jewelry this is not CeCe's or even white oh man this is the real deal so if you're tuning in and you're looking at the price and you're saying hmm 830-9 90 wow what is that could it be these are diamonds these are high quality diamonds these are pure white diamonds these are diamonds that there I clean that means that no naked I can tell that is perfectly clean so you have the force easier again cut clarity carat color you have all four here and there staring at you and they're saying I want to come to your house talking to you SEMA then talk you through the TV screen if you'd like to have them at your house if you'd like to try them on cold us right now of course send them to you I think in this life you know we buy certain special things and diamonds are one of those special things maybe you always wanted diamond earrings maybe it's that wedding that you're going to your daughters getting married and you want to make sure you've got earrings that you feel a million dollars in folks is 167 dot ninety-eight cents I think there is such pride of being able to showcase jewelry that is so extraordinary and you know one of the things that often is the case and even when i'm sorry i'm watching TV it's you know it is gonna meet my expectations because if i get it home and he doesn't look as good as it does on the TV i'm gonna send it back i no see what will agree when I tell you this doesn't look as good as it looks on TV in real life it looks better and that is the reason why down the couch or even in just the initial two months two months that it's been here has quickly become", "HJLHsRvQUmk": "own our affinity expert and so I'm wearing this earring and I'm going to switch out so that you can see a few sizes here in a second but I want you to just look at the impact that you're getting here that looks like four and a half carats of diamonds in my ear in one ear that's the look you're getting here but the reality is in the size that I have on right now you're only paying for one carat look of nine total but you're only paying for one we also have the half carat available in this stud and then a choice of shapes so I have the round on we have it in cushion in 14 karat yellow gold or 14 karat white gold this is my pick because it doesn't get much better than stud but the reason that so many women who want them but don't get them is because it costs a lot to get a beautiful stud home but because of the way the diamonds are set here you get the look you want at a far better price so the half carat size whether you're choosing the round or the cushion is now at a clearance price of 399 96 on easy pay for just $66.66 those are a hundred and forty nine dollars off the QVC price making them the equivalent of a today's special value I'm glad that that popped up on the screen right now because that's the balance of perfectly aligned exactly okay and then the one carat size seven ninety nine ninety six and then on easy pay for 13333 those are two hundred and ninety nine dollars off the QVC price and if you want more than six months you'd rather have nine we do have special financing available on these stud earrings if you're using your cue card so Jose as I slip into I'm gonna find the half carat size here would you please explain what's happening with the look like what are we getting exactly but then what are we getting the look of when we're talking about the half carat here that we're going to show you and I'm gonna have Mary show you one and one and same with kinesia so I think khadija is gonna be wearing the cushion and Mary is gonna be wearing the half because we want you to see the scale of them this is a half carat that we're looking at here but that Center cluster is one the look of 1.2 and a total of 4 so this would be like looking at two carats in each year this would be thousands of dollars for you to get at home we've worked with the very best the largest manufacturer of diamonds in the world to give you a composite setting where all of those diamonds are so closely set together that it looks as one but when I was speaking with her route he also wanted it route is the designer who has worked with let's say I'm gonna say it this way on 57th Street and Fifth Avenue there are three of the largest most renowned jewelry houses in the world he has designed for two of them so we're not getting designer like diamonds we're getting designer diamonds babies I was just showing you like you didn't have to come in close to see these earrings know that it makes it it's a two-carat presence on the ear in the half carat size so you just saw the round on me let's take a look at the half carat on kinesia did you do the half and the one as well awesome so you'll see here the way they look and maybe that'll help you decide if you're on the fence and you're wondering or maybe you already know you know that that other look would be more wearable for you or you want the most impressive statement possible correct then you'll go with the one carat size well I love that we're looking at we're looking at Khadijah and value hello some of the but you're looking at Canisius a guys can we go back to Kadena for one second I'm sorry we got all distracted by the gum mazing price look at all of the hair on Khadijah but that is where the half carat is so that is the fire that is the presence that you're getting on that diamond that's the half carat and then the other ear where the hair is swept away is the one carat that looks like four and a half carats on that one ear so this is your upgrade this is and you know what I do believe in recycling so you perhaps take that earring that you've been wearing and you give it to your daughter or your granddaughter and you do a little upgrade the the rel I'm not thinking about anybody but myself one for them one for you honest and hard I you know what I would do and this is this is crazy me with my the round half is the most popular right now yes and it always has been in the past I would crazytown me would get that round half pay that off right away get the one carat and put that on easy pay because you are completing your entire stud selection for your wardrobe forever this is the round in the half carat I know it seems huge no it's that's a half carat total but it does it looks like two carats in each ear in each ear that's what the look is but yet you're not spending thousands of dollars remember this size whether you want the white gold or the yellow gold whether you're choosing the round or the cushion the half carat size is on easy pay for $64.99 and then if we could look at the one carat choice and what did you say the sort of the earlobe impact is on that one on the one carat yes would be for also for the half and nine for the one carat weight okay so if you're getting the one karat earring it looks like a total of nine all right so it's four and a half carat per year and I can show you remember same choice is still available at a clearance price is so exciting that we still have all of these options for you at a clearance price because often that's not the case so if you want to be able to see the the larger size that one carat size I have it in this ear she's going to close up so she can do because I think scale is really a member so close up that she's uncomfortable so that's the one carat that looks like four and a half per ear and we're gonna switch you could look towards me and that's the half carat that looks like two carats per ear so you get a better sense of scale it's hard I know it's hard to see it on the boat for I'm gonna do EasyPay $64.99 or 131 66 that is crazytown in the round but remember we've got the same carat weight in cushion I'm wearing the white gold we have yellow gold available across the board as well it's just so many options a beautiful classic piece and so if you are investing in diamonds we have these exciting fashionable pieces playful pieces that we can bring to you through affinity and Jose but sometimes you just want a classic you want something that you know you can wear every day anywhere and not feel like you're restricted in the least like white diamond studs I can't think of any occasion where these would not be appropriate whether it be a party a job interview work I mean Church these are these are that piece that you go to all the time and they're so impressive you'll be proud to wear them and that's one of the reasons why I love affinity you know sometimes when you find diamonds on sale you're like I mean I I kind of like it but I don't love it I don't know that if my girlfriend's grabbed it that I would want them to look really close at those diamonds please you want everybody to see them you're gonna be so proud and you'll own them for many years I'm sure on six easy payments in the half carat size at 66 66 the one carat size 13333 but with nine months special financing it gets even better in white and yellow gold in the round or the cushion and those are your options in my pick of a show J three five five zero three seven is a good pick Thanks", "ZlqWoYy3cv8": "welcome to certify jewelry Justin from our

options to consider when choosing an engagement ring metal and their pros and their cons meanwhile we will have price comparisons on the right side of the screen for both Kay jewelers and my favorite online retailer which is linked to below this video let's start with the most common engagement ring metal white gold and we'll start also at 18 karat white gold pure 24 karat gold is soft and yellow so to make white gold they make an alloy of gold which is 75% gold and 25% alloy which would include nickel zinc and other metals these other alloy metals specifically nickel make the metal white and durable and hard most white gold jewelry comes with a rhodium plating around the outside it's a shiny metal that is a member of the Platinum family and now this is done to give it a wider appearance and protect it from color loss over time because also over time this plating wears away and the gold gets this yellowish tinge as it oxidizes but don't worry rhe polishing and replating with this rhodium on the white gold will restore its original appearance just like the day you got it now that means it's important to choose a jeweler that offers a lifetime of free rhodium plating as my favorite jeweler does in the link below this video it's one of the many reasons why I like them white gold is significantly less expensive than platinum which is the other common white metal we will get to in just a bit for engagement rings if your engagement ring is gonna have white gold or any white metal I wouldn't go with less than I colored diamond because lower than that and the yellow in the diamond starts to stand out when compared to the ring metal you can watch my video on color comparisons if you want to know more on the color of diamonds but now let's go to white 14 karat gold 14 karat white gold contains 58.5% gold which is almost 20% less than 18 karat gold now because it's less gold it means it contains more alloy metals which come with some disadvantages and some advantages for example 14 karat is harder and more resistant to wear tear and scratches than 18 karat gold because that alloy makes it stronger so if you're an athlete or a manual laborer and you're gonna be wearing your ring during these activities you might want to go with 14 karat gold over 18 karat gold the problem with white gold 14 karat is that they usually have more nickel for the wider appearance which also means it's more susceptible to causing allergic reactions and just so you know women tend to be a little more allergic to metals than men do 18 karat gold has more rich yellow in it so 14 karat has less chance of it turning that Tingy yellow over time the great thing is that 14 karat is even less expensive than 18 karat white gold because of its smaller gold content 18 karat is already less expensive than platinum which we will see but the thing is 18 karat is actually a little more valuable if you are into that 18 karat yellow gold yellow gold was the most common metal early on for centuries with engagement rings pure gold graded at 24 carats is naturally yellow so it only makes sense that 18 karat yellow gold over time will retain its more yellow gold color 18 karat yellow gold like white gold is composed of 75% gold alloyed with 25% other metals the advantages of yellow gold are that it doesn't corrode and tarnish and rust so you can count on it for it to provide lasting beauty also some skin tones are more favorable to yellow gold over white gold there are different thoughts on how yellow gold complements different color graded diamonds some people claim that yellow gold can make a diamond look wider because of its heavy contrary with the Whitestone then the other thought is that the diamond will reflect more yellow light if it's surrounded by a yellow gold band I will put two different comparisons up on the screen and let you decide if you think yellow makes the diamond look more white or more yellow but there are two different thoughts on this and don't worry I will explain later how you can get the best of both worlds if you want contrast but yet the diamond not to reflect as much yellow but first let's move on to 14 carat gold 14 karat yellow gold like white gold is composed of 58.5% gold which enhances its durability because of the extra alloys in it and its resistance to wear however unlike white gold it uses less nickel in it which decreases the chances of you being allergic to the metal and once again because it is 14 karat is less expensive than 18 karat because it has less gold which will make it less valuable but also less expensive 14 karat yellow gold also has a less yellow look than 18 karat thus 18 carat gold has a more rich yellow color than 14 karat athletes and manual labourers once again that are going to wear their ring during their activities may still want to go with 14 karat gold as it will have more resistance to their activities 14 karat rose gold unlike yellow and white gold rose gold is normally just sold in the 14-karat because there is no real advantage to the 18 karat rose gold rose gold is now very popular in trendy and it's achieved by mixing gold and copper amongst other alloy metals the higher the amount of copper in the gold the more pronounced the red color a common alloy content for rose gold is composed of once again 58.5% gold and 42% copper and silver it doesn't really need an 18k because most prefer the color of the 14k and it is harder without the increase in allergenicity like the white gold we talk earlier over time it will get slightly more red and darker due to its oxidation if you like vintage looks this could be actually beneficial - the good news is the 14-karat white gold the yellow 14 karat and the 14 karat rose gold are always almost all similar in price which is less expensive platinum is usually 95 percent platinum which is a dense metal it can make it feel about two to four times more heavy so it might weigh a little on your hand an added bonus of Platinum's 90 to 95 percent purity is that it is rarely going to cause allergic reaction and is therefore an ideal metal of choice for people with contact allergies now platinum is a rare and valuable metal and because of supply and demand that makes it more expensive due to its limited quantities this is why platinum is more expensive than the other precious metals we've looked at today it's price per weight is about the same as gold but because it's so dense it makes it more expensive platinum is malleable at very high temperatures but has a higher tensile strength what may seem counterintuitive is that it can get scratched more easily than 14-karat and obviously 18 carat gold though the prongs holding in the diamond are stronger with platinum it's just tends to get scratched more often than of even in 14-karat gold a patent of finish is also an issue with platinum if patent a finish is when platinum loses its luster from wear and tear it can make the ring look a little darker over time and some people think this gives the diamond a more vintage look and other people just don't like the look of it re polishing is possible so you need once again a jeweler that will do this for free to return it to its original luster if you're working with harsh chemicals once again the ability for root polishing is good with platinum so it might be a metal that works for you and because of the different ways white gold and platinum oxidize over time and show wear and tear stacking rings with a wedding ring should always be the same metal because they will look the same at first but over time that identical look will change as wear and tear happens because they don't wear at the same rate now aside from being hypoallergenic platinum is incredibly durable and it can last for generations making it a perfect heirloom piece in the United States every piece of platinum jewelry sold must carry a purity stamp the 950 plat on it indicates a 95% purity and 900 plat indicates a 90% period and in the US anything less than 90 percent pure platinum cannot be sold as platinum jewelry black gold is most commonly achieved by rhodium plating white gold rings in black rhodium with this color normally you're fully going for contrast with the diamond so the more colorless the diamond the better but even yellow diamonds will look very white in contrast if you get a black engagement it's not my cup of tea for both the original appearance but also it quickly looks really worn as any scratch will remove the plating layer to reveal the white gold below it two-toned rings are simply just combining two types of metal in your ring there are two main reasons for having a two-toned ring first you may just simply like the design and the appearance of a two-tone ring but second and most commonly is you may like the positive features of two different metal types or colors and you want to use the different properties of both to your benefit you may have actually thought of this already during my video you wish that you can have one property of one and one property of another the most common example of combining the benefits for a two-tone ring is if you like a yellow or rose gold ring but you go the prongs that go over the diamond to be colored because it takes away from the diamonds of white and bright appearance in this case you can add a white metal for the diamond setting or crown head and a colored metal for the band and you get that color contrast without it reflecting too much of the color from the band and the prongs through the diamond because those prongs are going to be a white metal instead of the colored metal that is in the rest of the engagement this is so desirable that the website I have linked to below uses this technique on a lot of their colored diamond rings now make sure you watch my video about different ring styles and my video on how to not get ripped off when looking for diamonds also you can watch my video on the tips to give you the best marriage proposal I would not miss that one either now special thanks to James Allen comm an online jewelry retailer who lent us a lot of the diamonds that were used in this video don't forget that link below will help you save a lot of money so like subscribe it and I will see you in the next one", "mWhfBAC6YkY": "what's going on everyone in spring which coach fine jewelry short personal jeweler in this video I want to compare 14 karat white gold verse 18 karat gold do a nice side-by-side and show you guys the difference I get a lot of questions on white gold so I think visually you want to kind of see the difference if there is a difference and with that being said a lot of questions come in about white gold so I'm gonna do my best to put those questions to rest with that being said let's get started now everyone has a different reason as to why they might go 14 karat gold over 10 karat gold 18 karat over 14 karat you guys get the point going up in purity the most common that I hear about and we should all know this the higher the gold purity the more gold that is in that piece of jewelry which equals the richer the gold color that is really directly applies with yellow gold with rose and white it gets a little bit different because white gold has rhodium over it so is it really worth to spend and go 18 karat on a heavier chain with more gold if you're going to get the same look as the 14 karat version with white gold and I want to show you guys the side-by-side and explain that and if we take a look at the side-by-sides between the 5 millimeter diamond-cut franco's the 5 millimeter 14 is on the left and the 5 millimeter 18 is on the right both from the same manufacturer both with the same rhodium process I try to get the variables as close as possible to show this review in person you definitely see the difference it parallels really to the yellow gold version the lighter or less purity that a train is like if you look at a 10 karat chain compared to a 14 karat gold chain the 10 karat chain is lighter in yellow color because there's less gold gold is yellow I get people all the time this is kind of a different talk for another video like hey if I buy a white gold chain is it going to be yellow my answer is hopefully over time it does kind of thing into yellow that means your chain Israel if it doesn't you need to get it tested because gold is yellow we don't mind white gold out of the ground it's all yellow so the more gold it is and tuned if you really look closely at an 18 karat white gold chain you kind of see that yellow starting to pierce through of course the road is a top layer over and it's nice it looks good but if you're going for that kind of disco ball that flashy look the 18 karat white gold is not really gonna do it as much it doesn't have a stronger white gold color it has more of a dull gray color compared to the last period of the 14 karat gold because it has more white alloys in there to really shine so it really depends on what you're looking for when you're going yellow it's like yeah you do want to go 18 karat yellow because it's more of a flex you get kind of a deeper richer gold color and you could really tell it's 18 karat gold but with the white gold not necessarily it's kind of opposite but it ain't the same at the same time now you might be thinking well why would I go 18 karat white gold a few reasons come out to me number one the most important for me when we're talking why do people go up in purity I simply like more gold around the neck for that speck oh that was a nice one but you guys get the point I think 18 karat gold you're gonna have it all show it on the scale here's a 14 same length on the scale the 14 karat version and then the 18 karat burn is sorry I'm still thinking about that bar just dropped the 18 karat do you guys see the difference there's more gold an 18 karat I hope we all know that by now by the end of this video so a lot of people just want more gold around their chain for that side they don't want to go up and with they'd rather just have that style chain but more gold more value around the neck I think that's great that's a very mature gold train thought right there also in my opinion I know a lot of people are weird about white gold because they think people think it looks like silver the white 18 karat doesn't look as like sterling silver ish it's more dull and has kind of its own unique look so you don't when I see sterling silver it's like bleached white like just silver I mean a lot of people say I can't really tell the difference between white and silver I can it's very like white looking so and that's kind of the same with a 14 karat or 10 karat white gold has that bright look to me you still see the difference between a 14-karat white gold chain and a sterling silver chain but it just looks less like that more dull just kind of has a little more of a masculine classy look if you ask me so those are the other difference mainly the gram weight difference between the 18 karat and teen carry all in all guys it is all preference on what you want to do I showed the side-by-sides I gave my little review now it is up to you to go to WWE comm and pick yourself up a chain and thank you guys for watching that's it for today's video and we will see you on our next julie video",
