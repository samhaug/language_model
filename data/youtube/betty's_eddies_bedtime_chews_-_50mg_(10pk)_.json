{"yTANu5Hcl1A": "hey everybody welcome back as you can see just some natural lighting today and that is because I feel like I'm often talking about my cycle but it is because I have endometriosis so the pain excuse me for my voice but the pain can be just really bad so I didn't even feel like setting up my lighting today so I just set it up like this so welcome back but I am currently in a lot of pain so I'm gonna talk a little bit about edibles the first thing you should know is that if you've never done adipose before you need to find something that's very low dose okay your liver transforms TCA into 11 hydroxy THC which is a much more potent format of THC and it is very intoxicating so that's why oftentimes people will have like really bad trips on edibles because they think that they're taking like these small doses that dosages they think like Oh 10 milligrams whatever and then it hits like 30 so you have to be very careful if you've never done edibles before if your tolerance for edibles is really low outside of that apples are incredible for pain and that's why I'm choosing to go with them today because like I said I'm in a lot of pain and I like to be really honest with you guys so that's what I'm working with today I have some babies Eddie these are medicated shoes there are five choose each one of one flavor and each Jew has 20 milligrams of THC I'm not going to lie that's pretty strong even for me like I don't have a very high tolerance for edibles but I chose Betty studies because as you saw on the package it's vegan it's gluten-free it's dairy feet free and it's made with real fruits and veggies so like I thought that that was pretty cool that they were still taking in so many people's like dietary restrictions I do like that it's childproof I think that's important to do you have children in the home I know of course you want your stash to be somewhere secluded but it's also nice to know that it has that childproof lock on it as well so looks like I did get one of each flavor okay oh my god this smells so good I believe that this is the flavor very good thing very good things that's right cute so the papers kind of stick into it you know that's okay had a lot of practice with now and laters so it don't bother you too much I think that they need to get better paper because it's sort of like stuff to it you know I think that they could do a little bit of treatment to the paper or more treatment to the paper get just like a higher quality wax paper that is really delicious oh my god okay y'all need to sell that in popsicle form that one's really good it's a little hard to chew it definitely does have a tacky texture to it it's kind of getting stuck to my teeth for me that's a little inconvenient it's just only a little bit it's not yeah I'll only dog like half a point lemon tastes like any other lemon candy you know sourness and her bitterness which doesn't really bother me that much it is not as good as the berry very good team River so this one's called my little lemon heaven that's cute what's next next up is orange beautiful aren't you beautiful maybe a little bit a little bit the orange one does not mask the taste of the teach the at all I definitely taste cannabis it's not nasty it just has that like earthiness that you don't really expect when when you have a really well-made edible so the last one that I'll be testing is lime a good person I'm a good person are you that's disgusting okay it's this good it is disgusting and it's really sour I don't know II love lime flavor like I like limes ooh that's nasty who does next I'm not gonna spit it out because I need my medication but oh that's nasty it tastes like expired spray was consumed by a STONER pissed out and then repackaged as some new health to drink I don't like it at all it's nasty would s gross I thought the women was gonna be the worst flavor the line is hate it hate it so what I'm gonna do is take about just half more of the very good things because it was very very delicious I really really liked the flavor on this one like I said only thing that I don't really care for is the texture I do think that yes it's taffy I think it's supposed to be a little bit more fun cute recreational but it's really hard to get off the roof or your mother or your teeth Cheers oh right now my pain level is right now my pain level is actually not that bad it's maybe had a 5 out of 10 a 5 out of 10 so it's manageable earlier it was much higher like around 7 or 8 and that's why I decided let me just go ahead and try and get dress into this video but right now it's kind of cool down I think because I was moving around I keeping my mind off of it I think this will be really really helpful so yeah I'm gonna watch some Doctor Who and report that then maybe like our so that [ __ ] hey if they're dead late I still feel my cramps but there may be like like a 2 or a 3 they're still manageable the high for me it's a little bit more heady it's also like kind of sitting in my chest I noticed like the first sign that it was starting to hit with that my heartbeat started going a little bit faster for whatever reason it's odd it didn't cause anxiety or anything but that's just the first effect that I noticed and oh and then after that I just started to feel like scattered I went from not wanting to do anything today at all to feeling like ok I can manage the pain I might do a little bit of yoga so I mean I think that's dope like I could see a change already especially also a change in mood it's not necessarily that I feel productive it's just that I am in a place where it's like oh I can finally kind of take care of myself because yoga does help it wasn't heavy yoga or anything nothing fast or sweaty just kind of moving my body in a way that felt natural and in a way it I guess it was intuitive type of movement so so far I'm really appreciating it like I said I think my pain level is more like at a 3 now I think it's only about like 3540 minutes later my metabolism is really fast so edibles to hit me pretty fast I am gonna eat some food real quick as well I have the munchies so bad like edibles always do that to me like I get crazy munchies with edibles so I have the munchies really really bad so I'm gonna eat some food and watch more TV and if there's an update I'll check in later I'll see you guys soon continues to lesson because I can't function I'm trying I'm Jack I'm here present okay so I just forced myself to get up so I could check in with y'all I'm very smacked I'm very much enjoying it probably still gonna do with some more because it does feel really really good I don't want to go over the edge I am still gonna wait a little bit longer it's been about 20 minutes since my last check-in so I think that's almost an hour and almost up there it feels really good I feel like I'm gonna take a nap and I really I need to eat and I'm probably gonna go to sleep but I'm gonna say that my final score for Betty's daddy's is gonna be um I think a 4 out of 5 4 out of 5 and I am really happy with the end result again and result being I'm pain-free which was the main reason why I was using today you know so anyways thanks guys for tuning in I appreciate you supporting me if you want to support support oh if you would like to support me further you can follow me on instagram

I'm Betty White, and I think we're going to have a good time today! At least I know I am. I'm going to be reading you a book, okay. I love animals, all animals, but maybe dogs in particular. So today, I'm going to be reading you a story about Harry the Dirty Dog. It's by Gene Zion, pictures by Margaret Bloy Graham. Harry was a white dog with black spots who liked everything, except getting a bath. So, one day, when he heard the \nwater running in the tub, he took the scrubbing brush... and buried it in the backyard. Then he ran away from home. He played where they were fixing the street and got very dirty. He played at the railroad and got even dirtier. He played tag with other dogs and became dirtier still. He slid down a coal chute and got the dirtiest of all. In fact, he changed from a white dog with black spots to a black dog with white spots. Although there were many other things to do, Harry began to wonder if his family thought that he had really run away. He felt tired and hungry too, so without stopping on the way, he ran back home. When Harry got to his house, he crawled through the fence \nand sat looking at the back door. One of the family looked out and said, \"There's a strange dog in the backyard... By the way, has anyone seen Harry?\" When Harry heard this, he tried very hard to show them he was Harry. He started to do all his old, clever tricks. He flip-flopped and he flop-flipped. He rolled over and played dead. He danced and he sang. He did these tricks over and over again, but everyone shook their heads and said, \"Oh no, it couldn't be Harry.\" Harry gave up and walked slowly toward the gate, but suddenly he stopped. He ran to a corner of the garden and started to dig furiously. Soon he jumped away from the hole barking short, happy barks. He'd found the scrubbing brush! And carrying it in his mouth, he ran into the house. Up the stairs he dashed, \nwith the family following close behind. He jumped into the bathtub and sat up begging, with the scrubbing brush in his mouth, a trick he certainly had never done before. \"This little doggy wants a bath!\" cried the little girl, and her father said, \"Why don't you and your brother give him one?\" Harry's bath was the soapiest one he'd ever had. It worked like magic. As soon as the children started to scrub, they began shouting, \"Mummy! Daddy! Look, look! Come quick! It's Harry! It's Harry! It's Harry!\" they cried. Harry wagged his tail and was very, very happy. His family combed and brushed him lovingly, and he became once again a white dog with black spots. It was wonderful to be home. After dinner, Harry fell asleep in his favorite place, happily dreaming of how much fun it had been getting dirty. He slept so soundly, he didn't even feel the scrubbing brush he'd hidden under his pillow. Did you like that? \nWell you're going to like this even better. This is my friend Ringo. I just met him, but he's a shelter puppy who found a wonderful forever home, so he has a happy ending just as Harry the Dirty Dog had a happy ending.

emily osterberg founder of baking betty's here at the mall of america in bloomington minnesota and we use premier's new edible ink printer eddie for printing all our logo cookies baking buddies i started it in california i love to bake growing up and i just i would bring cookies to work and i thought hey what a great idea i should start a business doing cookies even though i've never worked in food before so i started doing wholesale and stuff like that and i started out with one cookie flavor now we have 26 different flavors and i moved back to minnesota a year ago and opened at the mall of america where we are today so we were getting a ton of requests to do custom logo cookies custom images on cookies prior to using the eddie we used these edible frosting sheets where you had to print individually and you had to peel them off one by one i was trying to you know research different products and try different products to you know find the the best solution for us with the eddie it just is a better quality product it saves us a ton of time because you're actually printing right to the cookie the turnaround time to package is just it's huge for us it definitely helps that it's nsf certified because we're supposed to only use nsf certified products with food it's very important that it's a stainless steel a food grade printer just it's very easy to use so you can just pop the cookies right onto the eddy take them off it's easy to clean it's just a very seamless process it just prints i mean it looks like literally it just printed off of a printer you would never be able to tell that this is you know printed on an edible you know with edible ink on a cookie like it just the quality of it is just so amazing recently we did a project for 800 of the logo cookies and we used eddie for the first time with that large of a project and it went super smooth such an amazing process every single cookie all 800 looked exactly the same the images were crisp and perfect the eddie has been amazing for us with these large orders i feel like anybody could learn how to use the eddie printer in a matter of like a day so it was very very easy seamless process i think the biggest thing was just adjusting like the cookie size and making sure you have the icing right and once you got that down i think it's pretty quick and easy so it just creates an all-around better product for the customer and saves us a lot of time", "T1tj62nRWf4": "waters up everybody and welcome back to another product review for today so check it out okay guys for this product review video I'm going to be trying some edibles and I know this is crazy because we don't really review edibles much on this channel now really quick before we get into this let me kind of explain why I don't really do a whole lot of edibles and it's not because I don't like edibles I love edibles okay the reason that you guys don't see a whole lot of edibles on this channel is mainly for the fact that here in the state of Oregon edibles is limited to 50 milligrams for recreational so anybody 21 and up you are limited here in the state of Oregon to only 50 milligrams now you can buy multiple you can buy multiple but that can get rather expensive okay that can get rather expensive especially when some of these edibles are like 15 20 25 bucks okay so 50 milligrams that's weak sauce I agree with you I know what anybody's gonna say in the comments section on this video they're gonna be like 50 milligrams that's [ __ ] that's weak sauce blah blah blah blah blah blah don't take it out on me please that is just what the state limits us and I can't really help that okay medical gets a hundred milligrams so if you're a medical marijuana patient you got your medical card you can get access to a hundred milligrams but that's still not much better okay because a few years ago before 2015 you could get like thousand milligram if not more you know like I had a 16 a hundred milligram edible lollipop once and it was phenomenal okay so before that before the legalization happened we used to be able to get all different kinds of stuff and they were very well priced so without further ado let's get into this edible review alright so for this review I have here this awesome rice krispie treats all right they are bite-size as you guys can see I rice krispie treats now I'm multiple because they're 50 milligrams each I have three here they were about six dollars for wreck or a recreational a little bit cheaper for medical of course so I bought three of them that's about a hundred and fifty milligrams total I still know that that's not a whole lot okay I know there's tons of us out there that'd be like like $500,000 but but I mean like he's not bad right not bad I could have just got one and been like hey guys here's my 50 milligrams it's gonna be great all right no but I got all three so I can at least feel something another reason why you don't see me do a lot of edible refuses because 50 milligrams 100 milligrams for me stuff like that it's not I'm not gonna feel it okay I have a high extremely high tolerance okay so I need those like four or five six hundred milligram edibles in order to really really feel it that's um I believe there was a person who wants to comment in my last edible video I did a long time ago and they said something like oh he got so high he forgot to come back and tell us how it was which is not true because the truth is is I kind of felt it a tiny bit a little bit so you know what I mean like for somebody who has a low tolerance for somebody who doesn't smoke a lot or doesn't take a lot of edibles stuff like that 50 milligrams is gonna is going to be right where you need okay 50 milligrams is gonna do the job if you're like a beginner or if you're somebody who has extremely low tolerance 50 milligrams is all you need but for us like me who dab all day long and smoke and all that kind of [ __ ] I have a high tolerance I have to at least get three of these even to feel like the slightest bit of a buzz okay so here we go we're gonna go ahead and get into these now these are the can of Krispies cannabis treats bite size 50 milligrams they take it says it takes about 60 minutes for activation that kind of ranges depending on the person depending on your body size stuff like that that could range that could be 30 minutes all the way up to an hour and a half of edibles to kick in anywhere in between there right I love that these are bite-size because I'm not one of those people that like to eat a whole [ __ ] [ __ ] ton of sweets just to get especially a small little milligram as 50 milligrams okay so I like that their bike size I really do if they would have not been bite size if it would have been like a big-ass chunk for only 50 milligrams I would have complained I would already instantly be downing this this review but the fact that their bite size is even better oh you can chase the canvas not much it's not like a strong taste but you can faintly taste it you can faintly taste it mmm all right let's get the rest these [Music] [Music] oh all right so I've eaten all three all right it's gonna take a little bit to kind of feel them if if I feel it because again it's only 150 milligrams which I should feel something right like you should feel something even if you do have a high tolerance should feel a little bit of something you know what I mean yeah that's just my opinion in my thoughts these were good they tasted great they're Bitesize I love it the fact that they're only six dollars to me they could be a little less than that that's the only kind of complaint that I have here with this product is the fact that six dollars for bite size little edible fifty milligrams it's alright it's alright it's a little push in it but it's alright it's still affordable okay Joe only because I remember back in the day you used to be able to get fifty milligrams for five dollars or less okay you know you know 100 milligrams ten bucks or less you know and so on so forth you know but not bad a taste great tastes like a good rice krispies it's got a little bit of an aftertaste to it you could definitely kind of taste the lead on the aftertaste like right now I can still kind of taste it a little bit like I could tell that it wasn't all just rice krispies hi if I was somebody who never had cannabis before I'd be like did you use something different in this recipe kind of tastes a little odd you know little little tinge maybe yeah you know that would be my reaction to because like I said the aftertaste you can taste a little bit however it's not a super strong pungent weed taste it's not one of those edibles that you'll eat and go oh you know what I mean it faintly tasted it's very mild okay overall it's a good edible it's definitely something I'll give a thumbs up for I will if it affects me if if I can feel a good high off of it if I can feel any kind of a high off of it really I will come back and do kind of like a follow-up for this if not then just know that I pretty much just did this review for the taste and you know the overall just checking it out you know what I mean it's not so much of the high alright because I like I said like I explained early in the video I need a little bit more than that for me personally and again this is just for me personally okay others it might not need that much and then other people might need a lot more so it depends on you depends on your tolerance and it depends on you know where you're at with your cannabis usage all right so much love guys I hope this video is somewhat entertaining and informational if you guys like this channel if you guys like this video if you like me hey remember to give it a big thumbs up smash that like button support this channel and please guys please please please consider subscribing to my channel right here at the Andrew lamb the one and only and much love guys I hope you guys all have a very blessed very positive day or night wherever you're viewing this video from and until next time alright so it's been about an hour and 45 minutes and I'm feeling a little Spacey feeling it very mildly it's kind of a little relaxing it's a little creeping up if you will but I thought hey hey what's up the stakes a little bit all right shall we shall we up the milligrams now really quick let me just apologize for this being kind of an extra long video I'm sorry about that I will try my best to fast-forward through the parts of me eating so we'll kind of shorten the length now but anyway I got three more here now these are the cocoa ones okay so they have the regular ones these are the cocoa ones Cocoa Krispies and I got another three so it's another 150 for a grand total of 300 milligrams which some people might be like I am that's nothing that's that's weak sauce ba ba ba ba ba which yeah you know it is but whatever what we're gonna do it hmm so alright first one up here we go now again the same company this is the same company these are just the cocoa ones 50 milligrams each bite-sized edibles all right and you got to make sure that you get like all of them I'm sure all the little chunks and pieces don't let anything little pieces go [Music] you [Music] all right so there it is 300 milligrams I'm gonna come back in another hour hour and a half or so and I'll let you guys know how the effects are which should be a lot greater shouldn't be like super high it's not gonna be like uh like a Drunken level of high you know where I must like oh I'm so uh you know it's not gonna be like that however it should be you know I should be able to feel it pretty good should get a good you know nice feel from it so we will be back with you guys here at about an hour yeah about an hour hour and a half and we will see how this works all right so it's been about another hour and a half and feeling all right feeling all right a little a little more Spacey a lot more relaxed to feel nice and relaxed I could definitely fall asleep right now I could tell you that right now edibles are great for that in my opinion if you ever need something to help you fall asleep just load up on some edibles don't don't take too much okay don't take too much know your limits okay know what works best for you but I do love edibles I do love hi milligram edibles I should say and they're all all right there all right it sucks see if it takes so many just to get you know the milligrams that I took or more like that's crazy that you have to eat so much like if you're somebody who's just taking edibles you're not even smoking you're not even dabbing you're not even doing any of that other stuff and you're just taking edibles like this you're probably gonna be diabetic after the first like eight to 12 months okay I'm just saying just saying with how many you have to buy to get the correct milligrams that you need that's crazy okay anyway I hope you guys found this video

the other one for Dona she went to take Charlie for a walk I'm pretty sure she said she was going to what you call it drink one of those hot chocolates the 50 milligrams 50 milligrams of THC usually she only does I think 25 milligrams per night like over edibles at so 50 milligrams let's double what she's used to we'll see what happens Canada Post is working again they're finally [ __ ] moving so I decided today to order up that external piece for the GoPro and [ __ ] Donna found some little microphone on line for me there looks like it'll go nice so order that up too but Canada Post is pretty backed up I bet so I don't know how long it's going to take to get here so yeah yeah okay the water is boiled dollars gonna pour it into the cup which doesn't fly all over the floor do you want any milk or anything okay we'll let that cool down a little bit and then we'll come back to us tastes the weed you mean the THC you teach you can taste the THC in there in just a little bit don't know what else right now but yeah it's good well we'll come back in a little while when the when the effects start to uh why well there's a first time for everything isn't it hey we'll we'll come back when the wind starts to kick in [ __ ] you have for that house it asked you how you feel but I already know I think everybody watching those could you were laughing already I wonder what the [ __ ] you're laughing at that's how long you're laughing you were looking over here laughing and I was one yeah the whole time we'll even look at the tape later we're not the tape the video you know people just want to know how you feel after taking that I think they can tell it you're happy if somebody who's having aches and pains and it took that if you having a good maybe having a good old time what you can hurt yourself more sure if your wrist was broken and it wasn't a lot of pain and then you have like a lot and the people away so you start like using your wrist for that's probably not a good thing if you have a broken wrist and you just start using it I think if you had a sore wrist you would know that your wrist had problems [ __ ] you just [ __ ] insect [ __ ] you or something [ __ ] right in view there you wouldn't feel the pain because if it landed on you slapping it off and running it wouldn't get a chance to bite yeah I know how you are edibles make you want to sit and not move around too much the tuna ate I think the guys that smoked it either be going anywhere I think everybody get pretty lazy yeah sit by the [ __ ] tree what tree you're [ __ ] we'll be right back so Donna gets high and now I have to run around do her laundry for what the [ __ ] that all about I'll never make it down there I have a couple sacks well you can pick us up no deli meat sandwiches no apple fritters no Joe Louise no pizza no burgers yeah yeah hook us up with some Jamaican patties [Laughter] Donna put some drinking patties in the [ __ ] microwave and [ __ ] sakes I don't know if I need a knife to get in there or a [ __ ] hammer oh my [ __ ] oh [ __ ] and you find it funny where's the little end yeah it's a little softer over there there's nobody to get around over here's like like what the [ __ ] what maybe the person that put it in the microwave I think it depends on the voltage and wattage or whatever of your microwave I don't think it's two minutes for every microwave obviously not our microwave so probably didn't need the whole two minutes hope we don't break a [ __ ] - is chewy chewy alright whoa that little soft end is chewy I don't know about the rest of it those luck they're gonna be pretty country I can't even [ __ ] cut that it's like eating a baseball you horses like that - you [ __ ] up twice you know learn from the first one oh my what a mess he's having a good time over there a anyway I noticed we've got like another four subscribers or something cigarette holder - is [ __ ] I got this jumbo cookie to eat later okay [ __ ] got that yesterday at the Hollinger house bakery I didn't need it though because I hate that [ __ ] apple fritter instead he's walking that was a good [ __ ] apple fritter now I'm gonna [ __ ] off over here and go watch some YouTube videos and smoke some more weed and drink some beer and smoke some more weed and eat this [ __ ] thing and smoke some more weed and just keep on [ __ ] smoking weed anyway until tomorrow like subscribe and [ __ ] off eh you", "F1_v78p9e_A": "hi everybody I'm will welcome back to my kitchen today we're gonna be making some weed milkshakes buckle up and we're gonna go on quite a ride etc so in order to start we've got to make some canna milk which is a pretty simple process you don't really need to deke are peer were you to click other recipes because it's gonna be simmering with the milk for like 3 hours the weed will activate over time by itself ok let's get started first we've gotta fill our pot up about halfway with water like so and then we have to put this bowl on top of the pot and this will create a sort of double boiler because we want to be really careful with our milk while it's being prepared so we're gonna need 4 cups of whole milk remember it has to be hold because the weed won't gone to a low-fat milk well it all really careful and just pour it in then we're gonna use about 2 cups of cream which is equivalent to this container and that's just gonna increase the fat level so the weed will bond even better [Music] awesome so we've got a quarter ounce of weed right here remember it doesn't really need to be carved you can just kind of pour it in there now we're going to leave our bowl here and we're gonna bring our pot over to the oven so we're just gonna leave our stove on high and wait for it to boil okay so now we're gonna play named the strain basically I'm gonna list a bunch of different strains and you're gonna have to figure out which one is real and which are fake and then at the end of that pisode we'll reveal our answers The Simpsons Bob saggin mile-high club the Philadelphia Experiment old mother now you've gotta stay tuned to find out what the real ones were that's how we trap you all right so now our water is finally boiling and we're gonna bring it down to a lower level to simmer and we're gonna go get our weed milk just place it on top to create our makeshift double boiler it'll be simmering for about three hours but you want to make sure to keep checking back on it and stirring it it's pretty viscous and just lots of weed chunks everywhere making a nice whirlpool so if you're waiting around for your chamomile to finish you might try a banana and get of potassium fix before your poison [Music] yellows my favorite color since it takes forever to make the can of milk we've got some already prepared and cooled down in our fridge so the milk still has a bunch of little wheat bits in it so we have to strain it through a cheesecloth [Music] we're done with our cheesecloth so we're just gonna put it in the sink so now we're gonna put some of our kena milk into the blender for a milkshake it's really strong though so you only really need like half a cup I don't believe I've ever actually had can of milk in the past but I could very well make some for myself in the future now we're just gonna get our ice cream from the freezer [Music] we're going to put about 3 cups of ice cream into our blender my favorite flavor is vanilla but I'll survive with this I guess it's a little stuck that's okay now we're gonna blend our can of milk and ice cream together it's you a milkshake consistency [Music] cool now it's time for a weed fact weed is actually in the same plant family as hops which is a key ingredient in beer hops actually has a mild sedative effect just like weed and so people used to put it in their pillows that night to help them sleep we're gonna just deck out our glass for aesthetic purposes we've got marshmallows chocolate chips Oreo strawberries pretzels Twizzlers leaves Kit Kats straws the blue is pretty divine I think we're gonna put our chocolate chips in the microwave for about like a minute and a half and until they're just like melted very finely [Music] okay okay so now our chocolate chips are almost melted now we're gonna stir our melted chocolate chips into a saucy consistency we're gonna give her a glass nice rim job and just there we go it's a little sloppy but I'm sure it'll taste pretty delicious anyway now we're just gonna chop up an Oreo to add to that we're just gonna sprinkle this into the chocolate bowl to just add another layer of deliciousness rim again this time with Oreos next we're gonna slice the strawberry up to put on the rim you just want to cut it like two-thirds through so it's split but not in half strawberries are definitely my favorite just because I'm an organic [ __ ] I guess so you just want to gently place them around the rim of the glass we're just gonna let that chill there I guess so now it's finally time to add our milkshake Wow now we're gonna get some whipped cream from the fridge get it in there I really like as much whipped cream as possible you could totally stop at this point but I like going the extra mile so we're gonna add some Twizzlers it's overflowing a bit but I like it now some KitKat bars and for health reasons just a little bit of mint and finally a pretzel on the head now we've got a crazy straw we're gonna stick a marshmallow through and tada it looks amazing but I might not live very long it's a lot of work to get to this point but I think it was worth it [Music] now it's time to reveal which traits are real and which are fake The Simpsons is real Bob Saget is real mile-high club is fake the Philadelphia Experiment is fake old mother is real Congrats I knew you guys could figure it out Wow it's a chocolate explosion I'm overwhelmed with flavor [Music] if you want my opinion I'd say this is totally worth the early grave well we're all done thank you for joining me in this amazing chocolate weed milkshake adventure until next time I'm will bye-bye", "KAycqbqNaes": "[Music] thanks for coming back to my channel my name is Karen a and you are my bluff I

dress party just like I was checking out comments comment coming up Concord comment gonna make comments comment ok CC b9 Clare [Music] [Music]", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from marijuana lay the topics in the description pink ominous video and we showed with an addiction to read if you like you're smoking too much or you feel like it's no longer serving you I will hold mini

this one", "w7rBWc_O5pw": "hey guys welcome back to cooking with cooper today we're going to be cooking some orange yeah we're going to cook today um an orange cream cake but we'll call it an orange dream cake and cooper i don't believe you've ever tried this before but this is one of my favorite cakes and i have a feeling it's gonna be probably one of your top two favorite cakes so i'm gonna i can't wait to see your opinion so i'm gonna teach you how to cook this because orange has always been your favorite right yeah all right so first we're going to start um with your um normal 9x13 baking dishes it's a little bit bigger but that's all we have so you want to spray it down cooper yep all right spray some nonstick spray yeah shake it a little bit that's good hold it a little bit further okay yeah not too bad hang on let me spread a little bit more oh and cooper is learning how to cook raccoon so here let me close that we're done with that so cooper tell them a little bit i mean what's the purpose of this uh the secrecy design to learn about how for me to cook uh and to like teach yeah i guess anyone have like cook easy recipes right right so are you excited about this yeah all right and all the recipes that we do are really good yeah so and i think like i said it's gonna be one of your favorite so this is a really easy recipe anyone can make it you're going to start by some orange cake mix the box cake mix and dump the whole thing in yeah you're going to put the whole thing in there let me grab some scissors and then you can dump it in there this one the reason the cooper hasn't tried this yet is in with it being one of my favorites is because it's very um for a while it's a bit hard to find the orange cake mix smell it cooper dump it in there and i finally found it and now it seems like over the years it's gotten a little bit easier to find it so we'll probably start making that regularly now all right cooper it calls for two eggs this is going to be the best part two eggs if you've watched any of our videos cooper's learning to crack eggs which has been his hardest thing so he finally got it down the last time yep with no shells in there without it going all over right cooper cooper's learning uh cooking for sure i think he's gonna be a great cook one day after uh we're done with this series all right great job and then we'll do one more all right good job coop do you want to wash your hands real fast and then we'll sorry i see no shells in there so he's definitely learning while you're there with the water so we're gonna put one and one half cups of water actually i'll just get a measuring cup and then all right cooper you want to do one and one half cups let's see here let's get some water out of the sink all there you right so how much water did i just say we were gonna do uh one and a half yeah one and a half so you're gonna dump that in there all right and then we're going to do a half a cup of oil so yeah there's the oil do you know how to do measuring cups cooper mm-hmm all right i'll set this up here one and a half no just a half just a half yep and the reason i said it flat is because you want to be you want to make it level when you're pouring um liquids all right stop stop stop stop stop that's i have do you see that do you see where it says a half right there yep all right you pour that in there okay all of it and then let's see here so we've got okay now the only other thing we're going to put into the cake itself orange challenge is the orange jello mix so cooper you want to dump that thing in there and then the rest of the ingredients are going to be for the um the topping and we'll do that and it's really really good we're going to do that later after the cake is baked and cooled it needs to cool for about i mean well it needs to cool completely before we put the topping on there and we'll show you how to make that here and when you're doing this cooper you want to hold it over this so because this powder will go everywhere all right there you go how does it smell sugary sugar it looks like sugar but like a little bit of oil or pink tint right all right dump the whole thing in there there you go good job looks like all sugar yep which means you'll probably like it right so now we've got all this orange goodness in there and it's time to mix it with our mixer use this one all right plug it in and then you're going to lift it up and then you're going to start on low so that it doesn't splat around tell them here your other side job there well um well uh so we got well we got a um coffee business and so we sell coffee for like a little sorry thing and it's called alps coffee so if you like there's a whole bunch of different flavors um a whole like there's 40 different

does it smell good orange juice like orange juice and i got some orange juice yep and all the rest of those ingredients are going to go where and i think in the icing so right now we're going to bake it and it smells like an orange popsicle look at that so if you like orange flavor stuff like so you are going to love this cake all right cooper i think it's mixed up it's time to dump it in the pan pan all right just pour it straight in there go ahead there we go let me scrape the rest out oh we forgot to preheat the oven it needs to preheat the 350 but i believe you remember how to do that right yep 350 all right all right so we're going to take a break and put this in the oven and let it bake and then cool and then we'll be on um we'll come right back as soon as it's baked and while it's cooling and then we'll make the icing and put it together and then cooper we'll do a little taste test yep can't wait to taste this salad that's right it will be yummy all righty bye until next time right now hey guys we're back and now the cake is cool and we're ready to start making the icing so all right so to make the icing cooper you're going to put four ounces of cream cheese so that's half of an eight ounce cream cheese bar so i already cut it in half cooker you want to put it in there in the bowl just like this yeah just take it out of the packet and put it in the bowl or do we want to eat the package smell it it smells good not to you you're not that cream cheese i don't like cream cheese a lot really okay well to me it smells like heaven yeah i don't really like cream cheese all right dump it in there here let me squeeze it out for you um and then uh you're gonna mix this uh the four ounces of cream cheese with three fourths of a cup of orange juice so cooper that would be get some orange juice here shake it up yep shake it shake it shake it and that's going to be three of these so i'll pull it over and you don't pour i don't know or they don't have three fourths uh no there's this one or you can do a little less than one cup okay here here you can feel it to the top you want to make it level all right okay stop stop stop okay one and then two stops all right stop stop stop okay you want to mix this up cooper okay blend it all together that cake looks delicious oh it will be delicious you haven't tried delicious until you've tried this paper have you tried it of course it's one of my favorites oh but hard to show on the camera yeah oh so it's after you let me get it yeah it's kind of hard to match you see here the cream cheese needs to be softened which ours is um i'm just trying to put the other cream cheese mush it together we don't need it let's just order it so we'll put it back in the fridge okay put it there yeah uh right now i'll just set it somewhere and i'll get it actually get my whisk out of there cooper if i'm gonna try whisking it okay hit the wish a little bit with this it looks like eggs yeah it kind of does doesn't it all right cooper now we're going to put one container one full container oh i want to do this um whipped cream all right put it in there clipper is there anyway you have to let me show you how to do it is it thick that way yeah with most things when you take it out you have to use a spoon yeah yeah dump it in there yeah you got to scoop it out cooper yeah there you go keep scooping okay you got everything yeah here let's get around yeah get around the edges remove this here all right cooper i'll take that can you see here whipped cream make sure we get all of that okay just throw that away keeper do you want to whisk it a little bit yep let's get up cooper i'm not really good at whisking but well i can help you out but you were just getting to try it oh yeah it's definitely harder today all right yeah you're getting it that looks like fluffy fluffy yeah i'm just whisking all that orange juice cream cheese together um you can do it in your mixer too but i don't want to have to get mine out for this so it uses kind of heavy all right now we're gonna done uh one box of instant vanilla pudding do you wanna dump it in here okay and then to that i'm going to add one tablespoon of sugar all right cooper here let me see it we want to actually is that yeah when you open you want to open the whole thing yeah i kind of got it through there yeah is that is that pudding or is that sugar no it's vanilla pudding it looks exactly like one package of vanilla pudding mix and we want to mix all that in there you got pineapple oh i think i remember look at that it's turning kind of uh white yellowish i we might have made something with it i remember making me making something with pineapple icing in it something but it wasn't this you've not tried this yet yeah it's icing with pineapple in it i don't think do you want to open it yep now we're not going to dump the whole can in there um we are going to put let me see exactly how much because you'll probably get mouth stores yeah they didn't have a smaller can um we are going to do that's a how many ounces that can cook for 20 ounces uh it says it is 20 that's 20 ounces so we're gonna do eight ounces yeah um i'm sure that's a splatter everywhere yeah but like i said this is the only size can they have yeah it doesn't open so eight ounces is going to be well we're just going to have to guess at it not quite um half let me see here a little bit over a quarter let me see what that looks like i'll put a little bit more in there yeah i like some good pineapple in there all right cooper so you're just going to mix all that up look at that now smell it now smell it yeah smells better it smells like orange stream right it's going to be amazing all right and then that's it uh let me double check though because i haven't made this in years yeah that's it and then after that we gotta keep it refrigerated yeah we got to uh put it on the cake and we are going to let it sit in the refrigerator before serving for one hour probably why you gotta do that uh because it should be cold to set up right yeah it's just what it calls for so that's just what we do coop but if you wanted it hot i mean yeah i mean this one really should be so cold though but all right cooper do you want to spread that out nice and neat and make it look good spread it out spread it out evenly i'm going to get a plate but since this video we already it's been dragged out a long time for it to cool off and stuff or i'll taste test it right now and then we'll let it cool after that but you're gonna do the pooper yeah never tried this before so this is probably i think the only one uh so far that this is the only one cake that or not cake this is only one recipe recipe that uh we made that i haven't tried yet right but i know you i don't know what you like i don't know there's a wine i like oranges yeah i'll be shocked since orange has always been your favorite if you don't like this if this is not in your top you know one or two for sure well i don't know if you can eat lemon cake to me this beats it but maybe not in your opinion maybe that's just in mine and when we climb up the lemon cake recipe and you make it you'll come addicted to it it is one of the best cakes you can make easy simple fast i'm going to cut you just a little piece cooper because i know you said you weren't very happy yeah i'm not very hungry right now you want to grab your fork yes all right so this is what it looks like some orange for pineapple cooper they'll taste touch one okay all right you know a little piece how does that taste cooper it'll taste even better when it's cold it's good what would you rate that cake all right 10 out of 10. a 10 out of 10. and is it in your top favorites you see cooper can't usually when he does a taste uh test he just does one bite but cooper can't stop eating it as you see that tells me that's how good this cake is look at that so if you want to give it a try try it and let us know in the comments what you think about it and also if you want to follow cooper on the cooking journey as he learns how to cook um be sure to hit the subscribe button um set the notification bell

already on there so until next time guys bye", "-Yn9dXRFT4Y": "the Joe Rogan experience what was the last second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "u7KE2WOgoL8": "good evening happy st patrick's day happy singing projects day i'm amber and this is kelly and we're going to do another video for you guys so tonight we thought given that it's saint patrick's day we would maybe go ahead and do something green we're not very festive tonight callie yeah or not no well your shirt says happy oh my bracelet and your your bracelet's green your sweater this morning was green but i'm not very festive with my red and my black but that's okay we're making sure we are we are going to make a green shamrock shake because we love shamrock shakes we used to love shamrock shakes at mcdonald's mcdonald's when we used to eat mcdonald's we don't eat mcdonald's very often anymore now but we love their shamrock shake so we're gonna make the healthier version of the shamrock shake tonight for st patrick's day and then we also thought we would do another fun one we've been looking and eyeballing this recipe for a while yeah because cali she loves a good chewy candy she really does and she loves starbursts so we came across a strawberry it's supposed to be lemonade starburst fruit a super fruit super fruit food chew that is a tongue twister kelly can you say it better than i can starting lemonade limeade superfood chews hot you did better than me so we're going to make a couple of things for you and we're going to get started so kelly should we get started on the shake first do you want to shake first we'll do our green saint patty stay shamrock shake first i'll get some you want to grab the blender okay callie's going to get the blender just just the top no just the top yep yep okay bring it on over we can always go over there mix all righty so miss kelly you want to grab the ice i think we'll put the ice in the there's a bottom full in there yep so we've had this shamrock shake a few different ways sometimes we add chocolate and make it chocolate mint but tonight we're just gonna stick with the traditional shamrock shake i can't see any hold on let's see if we can get our comments nope we can't see any comments and it's not really showing us anything tonight so we don't know if we're having a technical glitch or not but can you say hello just so we know that our comments are working we're going to do six ice here should we double this recipe do you think we should share with your brothers and your dad okay okay so let's maybe double it these shakes are always huge i think doubling it will still give us lots so say a quick hello if you can hear us because we can't seem to see the comments right now i'm not sure it doesn't seem to be working well so yeah let's do 12. let's do 12 cubes so we're doubling the recipe for the sandbox shake so this shamrock shake is the low carb mint milkshake from brianna thomas so you can find it on her website and we will um post a link in the card somewhere oh the comments are working hello nice to see you thanks for commenting three four five six seven and we're being very precise tonight eight okay i'm gonna get your spinach ready okay so we're gonna put in a whole bunch of spinach to make a green you're daydreaming while you're doing that do you have a tough day long day at school maybe zoning out all right so we are gonna get the spinach ready hi julia um so we are going to put in so it's supposed to be one cup of loosely packed spinach but we're going to put in enough for two so two cups do you want to grab a measuring cup i'll grab a measuring cup you throw the ice away how's that done oh dear okay so we're gonna do some loosely packed we get a little generous on our spinach and our cheeks we really like having spinach on our shakes like you don't even notice you don't even know what's there right we had a chocolate hazelnut shake last night with supper it was kind of a strange color because of the spinach but that's all right we didn't mind right oh no okay two cups of spinach callie do you want to grab the almond milk yep yeah grab it grab the open one yeah that sounds good is this a open one nope i got it how much do i need you're gonna need we're gonna double again so you're gonna need it says half a cup so you're gonna need one cold cup you wanna just use this one that we've got out you might as well keep rolling with it [Music] can't join um what's that we gotta use until we can't anymore did you give it a shake good job i shook the other one oh you shook this one i think you're gonna need both i think you need both we kind of have a weird angle going here tonight yeah there we go until we get the tripod how is everybody doing on this st patrick's day anybody having green food our kids had green lunches they had uh spinach in their waffles for their school lunch so they had green waffles and they had micro greens and they had celery and green peppers was a real green lunch for school today any more this one's really fully let me give you a hand yes okay so how much did i say we were going to need one cup right once it's pretty like much like three quarters it's pretty close we might have to add some more depending on how thick this ends up okay cali next up the cottage cheese cheese you want to grab that yep all right callie's getting the cottage cheese i love the cottage cheese in these shakes because it is the perfect way to imitate ice cream in this shake so this is like a milkshake this one so you need the cottage cheese the traditional shamrock shake is actually ice cream based if you look at like ones that are not tma to thm they are actually ice cream based usually so i'll need a cup of this are you gonna need a cup actually that says a third so you're gonna need two thirds of a cup sweetie okay all right you got it oh i'll get you a tablespoon it smells interesting so it smells interesting does it smell like cottage cheese hopefully it's not smelling funky okay so you're going to need two for this side if it smells like cottage cheese we're doing the smell test it smells perfectly like cottage cheese to me i don't know what you're smelling but so we're using low fat cottage cheese just because that's what i tend to have in the house did it really callie read further into the recipe than i did apparently well it called for the low fat but this is an s shake so you could go full fat if you have it but i think we just don't want to get too crazy on our calories here with this shake no no need for it we like this one this one um again we've mentioned before we are in canada and we have some phenomenal cottage cheese if you buy the land one percent it tastes excellent if you buy the other one percent brands they're terrible so this is the one that we go with sitter probably be generous we like the cottage cheese in there you want me to hold it up so you can scrape it in get this in view so people can see you in action [Music] how's everybody's wednesday going it's hump day we're almost through the halfway point it is hump day right oh yeah yeah it is wednesday oh boy it's been a long week it's been a long long week one tablespoon mm-hmm keep going all right i'm gonna get the next ingredient ready we're gonna need some heavy cream and we are gonna need again we're doubling the recipe so we're gonna need four tablespoons of the heavy whipping cream you're getting close we're getting it all over the counter i don't care keep going keep it up good it's like the whole container is it pretty much the whole container oh not quite not quite that's looking good okay how about i take this from you and you can scrape that in i'm gonna grab the lid go all right we're going to get this put away [Music] maybe i'm going to wipe up your counter there too uh i'll just put this over here yeah you might need it again we'll find out okay so we're going to need to put in some cream and then do you want to grab the next day you're going to call us oh there we go yeah it's gone that's okay we can't take a call right now anyway next ingredient i'm gonna do the whipping cream so why don't you do the collagen okay okay so going back to this we are gonna need four tablespoons of our heavy cream to give it that nice ice creamy taste you got that that's really a big thing of collagen we love to get that huge thing of collagen at costco sometimes it goes on sale for a really good deal and it's it's really nice i like this one because it dissolves completely whether you put it in hot or cold it's really good at dissolving [Music] it's the organica yeah it's a really good one so i need a two tablespoon you need two tablespoons see if i can find one we need to get some more measuring spoons i feel like every time we do a video we're like we need to get that we need to get that we need to make a list just what we need to do we need to make a profit i think we needed scoops in one video we need measuring spoons there's a few things our kitchen is kind of lacking or some things are just showing their age because they were wedding gifts almost 15 years ago my husband and i all right the kitchen stuff kind of got put on the back burner right replacing all of our gadgets okay it doesn't have to be super precise in a shake you don't have to be quite as precise when you're baking you got to be pretty pretty particular but in a shake it's more forgiving so don't worry too much all right where's everybody watching from tonight yeah we are yeah we want to know this is your first video watching us we are in saskatchewan canada and it's a beautiful day we finally have less temperatures that are significantly on the plus side the snow is almost all melted four teaspoons of this it's awesome today four teaspoons okay we're gonna use this super sweet do you say four teaspoons okay kelly's gonna measure in the fourth because it's normally two teaspoons i'm gonna go ahead with the extracts so we are gonna need vanilla extract and we're also gonna need now it did call this recipe actually calls for dried mint but we don't have dried mint in the house and we don't have a garden going yet in the backyard for fresh mint so we are going to go ahead and just use the pure peppermint extract too bad we didn't have like any mint leaves i know we've done mint before in our pots on our back deck and it's been awesome we did mojito mint the one time and we used that for our kombucha and it was so good newport richly oh nice from florida i bet the weather in florida is nice okay kelly i'm gonna go ahead with this and i'm just gonna i'm gonna do we're gonna start with two capfuls we'll see if that's pepperminty enough and if it's not minty enough for our shamrock shake then we'll increase it we can always increase it but i find the mint is pretty powerful can't take it away you can always put more in and i just got it all over myself it's a good thing it smells good okay i'm gonna wash my hands i'll keep this out because we'll need it do we need it again oh this is the super sweet maybe if it's not sweet enough i guess but i don't like i'm pretty sure we don't need it for our other recipe it's just for this one okay so then we're going to add some vanilla and we're going to go through the dash so we're going to add we're going to be generous i love it okay don't worry about that one right now kelly let's just do this one okay so do you want to do the salt it says pinch so maybe do a cup of cranks like i'm gonna do like one crank well it says a pinch so that would be like one pinch and you're doubling it right perfect okay now we have to add the glucky but we have to do it while it's whirling because otherwise we might get it lumpy this stuff as soon as it hits the anything moist anything wet um it clumps up so badly so we are gonna do that over the thing maybe i should bring it over and we can blend it right up here how's that sound okay okay you guys should check out our youtube channel oh you think everyone should go to youtube yes we do have a youtube channel now and we would love if you go over and you go ahead tell them what it's what it's called i'll get the blender donut and okra donut okra yeah and let's grab this people say ogre's a vegetable and it shows it's seeds so i wonder if it's like a frenchy a fruit or a veggie a fredjie as frenchy as a fruit and a veggie oh you mean because okra has seeds in the inside and cucumbers are a fruit because they have seeds on the inside i don't know we might have to google this whether okra is truly a vegetable or whether okra is a fruit or a veggie is it freddy a true thing yeah i figured this is a made up kelly thing a frenchie a thread or a vegetable whatever it is we love it you could put okra in this shake too but we're just going to stick with the way the recipe is written because the okra would probably be tasted in this recipe but it would certainly give it a really nice puddingy milkshake texture we love the texture of okra in our shakes okay do you want to get this started kelly it's going to be super thick so i'm going to get the plunger it's gonna be loud [Music] we want it to be green it's a shamrock shake it's the perfect green okay if you want to grab a scraper we'll scrape down the sides we have a few little tiny chunks of of cottage cheese and a spinach on the side and that's not going to be very nice yeah you want to scrape down those little pieces of cottage cheese and spinach we might actually have to add some more ice we kind of decreased the ice because our ice cubes are big but we might have to increase the ice we'll see we're going to put that glucky in glooky lucky i still haven't figured out if it's glooky or glucky i'd really like if somebody would tell me if it's glooky or glucky so we could be saying it right or lucky yeah i don't know we said glucky for like two years already so now it's hard for me to get that out of my head i want to call it glooky still you want to call it glooky like no lucky clucky gucky lucky and what we can call whatever we want i guess but i'd just like to know what it's really called it's like you scrape these down here we want those chunks of spinach to if you say if it's like if it's glooky can you say if the two o so we can tell it's like okay so cali wants to know if it's glooky or it's glucky or it's glucky like lucky lucky we really want to know somebody tell us somebody help us out okay so i'm going to sprinkle it in i think you just splashed me oh sorry well you'll smell minty you'll be very festive okay i'm gonna sprinkle it in how much did we need hon we need a quarter of a teaspoon for one recipe rounded and we're gonna do double so we're gonna need half a teaspoon around so we're gonna make some noise again and i'm going to sprinkle it in super slowly get it going anytime this hits the liquid it's going to start forming these little rubbery balls of clump it's not very appealing oh she thinks it's like lucky lucky that's what we were hoping lucky so were we saying it right for those two years what did we say before i can't even remember now i think we said we said lucky yeah we said right the whole time so baby we're saying it right well thanks for helping us out letting us know what we should be saying there brandi okay cali so let's add a couple more ice cubes do you want to grab the ice back out it's looking a little thin we want it nice and thick like a true shamrock shape it's gotta be thick perfect maybe add well originally it said we should add eight and you added six right six times two so go ahead add four more let's go the original amount we should have just followed the recipe and done the eight cubes like it said all right i said wrong not lucky oh not lucky oh oops so it isn't lucky it's glooky with two o's like that sound lukey no i'm just confused glooky we're gonna have to retrain our brains callie okay [Music] so now what it said to do is it said once you've got your glucky in there you're supposed to just like let it sit 30 seconds to a minute let that glue activate and then put it back on again and it's supposed to give it the best texture i don't know i'm not a very good rule follower i have a tendency to just throw it all in there why don't you get us some glasses and some straws so yeah i'm not really a rule follower when it comes to the shakes i know many of them say add the protein powder in the last 10 seconds and i'm not so good at following that we like a fluffy shape so we don't we just usually all throw it all in there all right can you reach out get rich our fridge is way too full considering it has nothing in it can you reach it do you need me to grab one yes i don't want a glass to fall on your head no that would have hurt you're going to use that one okay sure you can use that one i'll use this one these oh this looks good let's see look how nice and shamrock shape and it smells like i think we got it had a really minty maybe you could have cut it back we ended up doing half i did two capsules so probably closer to half a teaspoon and it probably definitely could have been more like one one and a half capfuls but we like minty so a shamrock shake should be minty right callie we said we were gonna make for the boys we should better save some hey uh-huh we better just you're having less sure i guess i'm having less it's all right i'll have more if there's enough for everybody to go around let's give it a try um it's really good oh it's really minty i really like it but i honestly i would like to add okra to this i think the texture would be even more milkshake like if you added okra so i think the next time we're going to add two cups of okra one cup per recipe um yeah um you know those um things that you can find at sweet and sprouted which things are we talking about those make your own ice cream package yes you could make some of those and then put it in you totally substitute some of the ice you totally could so kelly thinks next time we make the shamrock shake we should make some homemade sugar-free vanilla ice cream and plop it in there and that's a great idea it would taste even more like a true shamrock shake okay we're gonna hop to our next recipe another really quick one and this one is our strawberry lemon we're calling them lemon limeade because we're out of lemon juice and we do have the strawberry lemonade packets so we're going to use one of these you have the same brown as this for the yeah we normally buy the same brand so we're going to do the strawberry lemon limeade starburst superfood chews um so if you follow in the trim healthy book the superfood chews i believe are in the original trim healthy cookbook but there's not this recipe this recipe was just found on the page on the trim healthy main page so i will still link it in the comments so you can see it there so it's just somebody tweaked the original recipe which is normally a chocolate one and there's a few other variations and we're gonna do a strawberry lemonade hardly any of this stuff that's okay we won't quite have enough of the strawberry protein powder but we will add a little plain two and a half scoops scoops oh this scoop is what you just dropped off of there let me move this out of the way and then we can bring the food processor in and then you can get started on it i can tell you guys kelly is chomping at the she loves starburst if you have any like really good cheap fruit processors food processors yeah we talked about that last time our food processor is very sad when we do one of these videos with it one day it's just going to give us the ghost because it's very old that's okay hopefully it won't be today hopefully it's gonna it smells like strawberries it's a strawberry yeah don't dump it we don't have a lot especially strawberry starburst well that's the goal here we're trying to make something that tastes like strawberry starburst do you want me to just dump it in if you hold the scoop over we'll do it as teamwork okay okay so you're gonna need for these starburst fruit chews oh we've got glooky again oogie i think it says goofy yeah we have to start saying it right callie we're gonna embarrass ourselves saying lucky a hundred times i think i just like that it sounds like a lucky i don't know okay so we need to think that should you maybe we should just call it oh we could call it lucky good point cali okay so we need two and a half scoops of the strawberry trim healthy mama we're using their strawberry protein powder you could probably use a different strawberry one if you've got it use what you've got we're just using what we've got which is apparently not enough one and a half so don't dump that yet because we're gonna top it up we're gonna need two and a half all together so we're gonna need some plain we've just got the plain this is just the trim healthy mama plain protein powder we are in desperate need of going for a shopping trip kelly because that's all i've got left for protein powder in the house and that's like a tragedy okay so we're gonna need two and a half this stuff's fluffier i wonder if they're gonna turn out different with the plane in there oh well we're gonna find out so that's two and then we need another half well maybe the other one's not so fluffy because they don't have it the other one is less fluffy because of flavor i'm not sure why the flavored trim healthy protein powders are less fluffy than that do we need glucose we need no we don't no we need uh collagen you want to grab the collagen one more time and we did have this from our previous recipe that we used it for collagen let me get these other dishes out of the way callie one half see it isn't see me does it mean cup cup yes a c in a recipe would mean cup oh oh half a cup honey so not the table food what's that oh yes not the tablespoon i'm totally wrong you are right i think callie's reading the recipe we have a cup of collagen there's a lot of collagen hence what makes them super food chews there's the half cup cali get some of that in there this is almost like the strawberry really dip it in here turn this like that sideways i'll hang on to it for you this is almost like the strawberry what protein powder because it's like oh the texture the collagen yeah it's the same half cup yep we want to be kind of more exact on this recipe because we want them to turn out where they stick together okay perfect and then we need to see the star ingredients which is going to be floss tea lucy lucy lucy they say glooky they say everybody says something different apparently yeah that's all right i'm gonna call it lucky that is so so so minty next we're going to try it with the dried mint like the recipe calls for see if it makes a difference because i really like that that's the difference between her recipe so okay we're gonna use in this case the recipe calls are you okay you bump your almonds it called for these the true lemon lemonade don't be mistaken and just buy the true lemon that are just the crystallized lemon you need these to be the lemonade mix and there's all different flavors so you could change this recipe i got two more in my hand i need a cup so you can use whatever flavor you want and change the flavor of your starburst fruit shoes to be whatever flavor you buy there you are dear cali is on a mission tonight we are on mission make this video short nice and short we're gonna try and be quick tonight one it smells like strawberry night kelly's gotta head to the bath after this it's like a purple color it is um that smells good this is a real life school weeknight kind of video we gotta be fast right kelly gotta go chop chop so i'm excited if these are good we're gonna buy more of the true lemon packets and do different flavors and we're gonna make a whole like mixture so when we've got those cravings for something chewy and candy-like we can be chomping on these her it's really perfect no there's a good chance cali we'll test it before we completely decide we like the flavor but we used some plain protein powder so there is a chance this might not be just a second okay there's a chance this might not quite be sweet enough because we didn't use all strawberry protein powder we did have to sub some plain in there so we're gonna taste it when it's done and if we need to we'll either add some super sweet or we will add another packet of the lemonade so we're going to have to just be careful of that don't let me forget to try it isn't lemonade like sour yes but there's also sweetener in this this is already pre-sweetened this one it's got um well there's actually cane sugar in here but it's just such a minimal amount and there's stevia leaf extract in there okay callie so it said you're supposed to combine all of this first blitz it up a little bit just so it's all combined evenly so that you're not getting like some that just tastes like collagen pulse it um you just whizz it on low maybe give it a quick whiz go ahead smells like it's burning i don't smell burning i smell lemonade no like when it was whirling then it smelled like oh dear that's just because our food processor is dying okay so to this cali we have to add some lemon juice and then we're gonna process it a little more and then add our coconut oil oh yes the lime juice we're gonna do lime juice because we're out of lemon so two table two tablespoons you can use that tablespoon measure over there extra collagen no all right collagen for what because i have like a little less oh that'd be fine that little tiny bit in the spoon will be fine i'm gonna let callie do the cooking video and i'm just gonna drink the shade give it a good shake those things when they're kind of new you have to yep you're getting it keep going [Music] keep going you're able to see this one you want it to be a bit more precise so that they stick together good keep going keep going a little bit more perfect one okay go ahead with one more we need two tablespoons it's bubbly in there add the lime juice or you could use lemon juice and two tablespoons of coconut oil i'll get the coconut oil started cali okay i'll get it ready to go but i'll wait actually because i don't want to interrupt you and i need to have a measuring spoon excellent i'm just gonna grab a spoon for the coconut why is it bubbly in there in here it's probably reacting with the um the packet of the lemonade that'd be my guess okay i'm going to grab something like that and vinegar yeah sort of like that okay so you need to begin processing and it says says when you put the juice in you need to start processing it like online like on low what no lime juice it smells like really like lemonade oh it smells really good and it's a little crummy it's supposed to be crumbly at this point it's supposed to be crumbly that looks right i'm using kind of a one and a half tablespoon measure and then a half tablespoon because again that's all we have for measuring spoons around here is random random ones so we're gonna use this one is a half so that'll give us two tablespoons of coconut oil i don't think you want to use a coconut oil that has much flavor here we're using this one this one's our favorite you see it there um it's ideal for cooking the omega nutrition one it has no coconut taste whatsoever i just got a sugar so it's my favorite to use i like coconut but i don't want coconut starburst that's it oops it actually sounds sort of good coconut starburst well that'll be your next creation maybe kelly okay so that you want to whizz it up again and we'll check if it holds together okay now be careful for the blade we gotta check if it's gonna just be careful there's a blade in there we're just going to see if it holds together i think it's going to hold together it's very coconut oily but it seems to be holding together holding a nice little ball there it's like a little gumball yeah we want it to hold together taste it see if it needs anything that tastes really good it tastes like a strawberry starburst mm-hmm which is exactly like a strawberry lemonade starburst i don't think we need to add any more sweetener there is no such thing as strawberry lemon there's no strawberry lemonade starburst but that would taste like a strawberry one you know all the flavors i don't but i'll take your word for it okay so now you have a couple of options a person can either take just take your fingers like we just did and make little balls out of this or you can roll it into a log and slice it i think we should roll it in a log and slice it what do you think callie can i slice it sure you roll on too long okay i'm going to grab a cutting board to do this one because this looks like it might be pretty greasy from the coconut oil and we'll do it on a cutting board and then if you want to grab a knife there should be one check if there's one in that drip tray over there for doing the supper dishes okay so we're just gonna form this into a log it seems to be sticking together nice okay then you can grab one from this drawer but just let me roll this out first okay because you have to get in there a little bit of sausage it's very coconut oily like i feel like it kind of had a little less coconut oil it sounds very coconut oily anybody made this does it look right i think it's supposed to be like shiny i think it's just melting from my warm hands yeah but it's very very coconut oily you're not gonna wait hey no no you're eager i'll just use this you're gonna use that big chef's knife okay nobody can see you want to come on the other side of me yeah but i gotta roll this up a little bit this knife in the house be careful with it please kind of holding it dangerously there for a minute all right now we may have a problem because this is not really wanting to roll out nice and thin we may have to do some forming of it with our hands i think that's what we're going to do it looks honestly like all the coconut oil is coming out of this and that can't be right so we're going to try and improvise well if your hands are melting well we don't want to lose all the coconut oil in our recipe yeah right so if you want to cut in pieces they have to be kind of even pieces calisora they're somewhat the same size and then what maybe i'll do since this looks a little on the big side i'm just going to break that into two maybe we'll go ahead and just form these with our hands starburst yeah absolutely you cut them in or even you just cut some and then you can help me form them i think we should do them in little squares like starburst would look like little cute squares can you see that our lighting in our house in the evening is absolutely terrible so i apologize because it looks like we're in a cave right now yeah we have a light on the way so that the lighting will be a bit better because it still gets dark here really early it's only 7 30 and it's getting dark outside so we're gonna get something but can you see our little starburst fruit shoes aren't those the cutest we're gonna have very greasy fingers when this is done cali did you cut them into half again yeah they're gonna be pretty big i think kind of just make them form them into little cubes flat they're gonna be bigger than a starburst i feel like we could have even made these into half again oh my god well you make that one whatever size you want it but i think the rest will make them just like little tiny one bite poppers because these are super filling with all that collagen in there and that protein powder you know this is a one right one that looks like a huge bite one you'd be full after just having one really you don't want to slice it in half and make it smaller i can make it smaller that would fill me up with just one it would so i think it's fun to do these in different flavors i like i do like the chocolate ones they remind me of a tootsie roll so i do like those ones too although i do not remember them being so drippy with coconut oil so i don't know if that is something to do with the lemonade packets just not being quite the same as the original recipe there's less dry ingredients but i mean they're turning out they're just drippy with coconut oil do this over guys this is pretty small and try to make sure sure you do it whatever you however you like that looks great this one has to cut in half after i made it you're gonna make it a starfish mini sausage a mini sausage so i think these would be fun to do with the kids if your kids like to eat thm food my kids do you can like probably make these any shape you want these would be really fun to do as something the kids could get involved in doing it's like school safe they would be school safe we have a tough time finding school safe snacks that in our house is really important as well because we have a son with a peanut and a sesame allergy so it's really hard to find snacks that are safe for him that are both peanut free and sesame free sesame is the even harder one i think than peanuts these days is finding things that are sesame free so whenever we find something fun like this this would be a super cute little lunch box accompaniment are you trying it yeah you taste testing it no see if it's any good i think they'll be even better once they're cold we'll chill them and then all that coconut oil will firm up and then they will be super good because that's what i used to do with the traditional recipe they used to wrap them individually and then put them into the fridge so like you'd wrap them and then you put them in the fridge so yeah i don't want to chill these because i well we're not going to eat them all this is making a lot so we're going to keep forming these and enjoying them yeah right i'm not sure if we have too much else to show you guys tonight we want to keep this really short and sweet we just wanted to show you a

this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "0v6VE4aNkN8": "what happens if a ship falls into a big whirlpool whirlpools how dangerous can they be how deadly are they for human beings how destructive are they for vessels can whirlpools suck ships boats or even barges in or do they pose a danger only for human beings who fall into them in these shots you can see how the rafter Steve Fisher got sucked in by a powerful current that the athlete had the bad luck to encounter when descending the Congo River as part of a red bull sponsored competition Fisher a world-class athlete had a run-in with the mighty rapids of this African River yet this was not among the most dangerous whirlpools that exist on our planet and far from the most dangerous whirlpools and that are theoretically possible don't try at home what one of the world's top drafting pros barely managed to escape from and that was even with the help of others there are whirlpools much more dangerous than along the Congo River some of these vortexes in the water pose a threat not only to people would even heavier objects a boat a yacht a ship a barge even giant vessels can face destruction if any of them separately or together are sucked into one of these real aquatic monsters but let's start by taking a look at whirlpools themselves at what they are how they arise and what real danger and destructive force they pose no not like that whirlpools are not specially stirred up by anyone rather they form in their own due to internal processes currents in a body of water collide and merge and thereby they create circular flows that are made stronger by the turbulence as if the waters being turned inward if there is a deep hole under the water and above this hole tons of water are flowing from opposite directions towards each other a vortex is created and this is what a world actually is let's try to helpfully illustrate this principle with oddly enough a clockwork mechanism as we explained you'll understand why we chose precisely this as an example you can see how the tirelessness appears in a clockwork mechanism drive one another on by rotating as they constantly grip on one another with their teeth each of these gears rotates only because the entire ensemble of rotates together they never slowed down by friction against one another but rather they work together in mutual movement now imagine that these are not little gears at all but water currents the flow of water when there is turbulence and currents moving towards each other will rotate from the impact just like these gears the principle of torque is basically analogous only water unlike the gears in a clockwork mechanism there's more than just rotate and if there's the necessary turbulence it'll form a funnel that sucks things in thus for a whirlpool to arise in nature we need the following a sufficient mass of moving water the presence of currents moving in opposite directions within this mass and a pit that's deep enough to generate a flow that swells inward generally the fastest whirlpools are those of mountain rivers that can sometimes reach speeds of several miles per hour however mountain rivers do not have an amount of water sufficient to suck truly large objects in people and animals often perish in these currents but larger objects for example ships are just too big for mountain rivers to affect for those big objects you need to bring out the heavy artillery the salt Stroman whirlpool norway today is perhaps the world's most powerful naturally forming well pool it arises four times per day precisely every six hours in a straight that is one point eight six miles long and 492 feet wide and connects to salt Jordan and the skier stat fought with the Barents Sea in this hellish funnel there are gigantic volumes of water that move at unimaginable speeds over a single cycle the salt straw Manuel pulled circulates billions of cubic feet of liquid all in a speed of up to 23 miles per hour if a person fell into such a whirlpool then sadly the chances for survive aslim and even if a whole boat fell in it's believed that the salt straw and whirlpool does not pose a risk to large vessels but to avoid any tragedy traffic in the Strait is scheduled to avoid the times when the dangerous Norwegian whirlpool comes to life the Maelstrom a well pulled famous from Edgar Allan Poe's short story a descent into the Maelstrom similar whirlpools are found in Norwegian waters in the Norwegian Sea these are less brutal than the salt Stroman whirlpool but much more unpredictable and sneaky and so they are no less dangerous indeed they can be even more dangerous Maelstrom flotation barely ever exceeds eight miles per hour but these whirlpools are dangerous because of how sudden they can appear the rocks the currents everything here is set up in a way that makes it impossible to predict when the vortex will arise and how fast it will spin and when water will begin to be sucked into it maelstroms just like the salt storm and whirlpool can form several times per day but there's no rhyme or reason to their formation they might appear two or three times a day they might appear five or six times in such cases are known infamously people have been killed or severely injured in maelstroms on a number of occasions maelstroms are capable of overturning even small fishing boats and such incidences have happened today ships prefer to give these Norwegian monsters a wide berth in order to avoid tragedy the Naruto whirlpools these come in at number three in their danger to life and limb and are rightly called the Japanese wonder nowhere else in the world is there such a large number of powerful whirlpools in such close vicinity to one another it's practically impossible to escape them if you break free from one you immediately fall into another these vortexes spend only in the Naruto Strait under a bridge close to the city of Naruto three or four whirlpools conform at the same time on average every six hours the average diameter of each of the Naruto whirlpools is 50 feet but the diameter constantly changes depending on the frequency and intensity of the Evan flow in the Strait the peak activity of the Naruto well pulls occurs during the spring flood at that time these whirlpools grow to a diameter of 65 feet in the speed at which they rotate reaches as high as 13 miles per hour the Naruto whirlpools are a magnificent sight but only at a safe distance getting up close and personal with these wonders of nature is not recommended the salt Stroman well pool maelstroms the Naruto whirlpools these are gigantic vortexes that exist under natural conditions but let's imagine how big a whirlpool can grow that's created artificially through technological means for this we need to make the strongest current that already exists on our planet and make it spin through powerful turbulence causing the current to become even more deadly the world's most powerful current is the Antarctic circumpolar current also known as the west wind drift it flows around Antarctica and is approximately three times more powerful than the Gulf Stream the length of the west wind drift is over eighteen thousand six hundred miles and its maximum width is around one thousand five hundred and fifty three miles over one second this monster of a current moves 200 million tons of water along and over just one minute 12 billion tons this unimaginably fast amount of water dozens or hundreds of thousands of billions of tons is swept along at a speed of 190 feet per second now if we exploded say a few 20 to 30 Megaton atomic bombs around the perimeter of the west wind drift under the tectonic plates then due to the holes that are formed in the oceanic crust a whirlpool will be created with five to ten times faster than the raging river current that swept Steve Fisher alone imagine that rushing at you with the speed of a car is an entire ocean this is what our artificially created whirlpool would be like with the amount of water that would be involved hundreds of billions of tons of only would ships yachts boats and barges disappear and so would entire fleets of many thousands of vessels oil rigs and any other structure that's in the path of this wild Antarctic current in addition as a result of such a catastrophic development currents and even the sea level could change all over the globe will return to artificially created whirlpool shortly but for now let's turn away from these horror stories and back to reality and to our champion athlete Steve Fisher do you see how hard this was on the extreme athlete Fisher later says that he nearly drowned and that it was a miracle that he's still among the living he was saved by the fact that he had an air cylinder with him underwater Fisher was able to continue breathing with it for about a minute and then he was pulled ashore fish's many years of experience in the sport and high level of qualification was still not enough to save him from a run-in with this fast-moving River current even a whirlpool that's not among the world's strongest and nevertheless be a mortal danger and now here's a real example of an artificially created giant whirlpool that turned out to be thousands of times more dangerous than that one in the Congo 7 a.m. on Friday November the 21st 1980 at eeeem of drillers from Wilson brothers corporation was prospecting for oil underneath the bottom of Louisiana's Lake Pena however under the lake bed was an old salt mine and the drillers did not take this minor detail into account during the drilling a hole was punched into a shaft in the old mine at a depth of around 1,300 feet what happened is something that no one could have imagined the water plunged down into the space that had opened up instantly demolishing the walls vaulting and supports of the mine shaft on the surface an enormous whirlpool formed 180 feet in diameter and it destroyed a tugboat a drilling rig 11 barges a whole island with a Botanical Garden on it dozens of trucks and even several houses luckily not a single human life was lost a whirlpool of such immense power could easily pull the legendary Titanic to the bottom as that ship's mass was several times smaller than the total mass that the artificially created Lake Pina well pool sucked in the most surprising thing about this incident is that the video of it has got a lot of likes on the internet and only because luckily not a single human life was lost is there any chance that a person aboard a ship could survive after being sucked into such a mega whirlpool to make it out alive you'd need a seriously strong capsule that could withstand the water pressure of many tons and in addition that'd have to be a large amount of air in the capsule take for example what happened when the tugboat Jass gone for was crushed the tug boat capsized and sank off Nigeria on May the 26th 2013 everyone on board died except the ship's cook Harrison Okene he was fortunate enough to lock himself in an airtight cabin and survived underwater for three days before being rescued when rescuers bought akkanee up to the surface it turned out that an air pocket formed in the space where the cooker sought refuge and that's why Harrison Okene was not crushed however the chance is that any other person on a sinking ship would be so lucky a slim so to survive a mega well pool you need to be in a capsule which is a hermetically sealed air bubble and of course rescuers have to arrive quickly as you might soon run out of oxygen otherwise if there is no hermetically sealed compartment with an air pocket then the many tons of water around you will do their work they will instantly crush the space itself and everyone inside of it secondly such a powerful whirlpool always forms when the depths reach hundreds of feet and it's impossible to escape from such a depth just on your own although if the depth is not great not 13 to 1,700 feet but just 50 to 65 feet the chances are still slim a person would have to have an incredible level of physical fitness to swim up from under fifty or sixty five feet of water for an ordinary person already at a depth of ten feet due to the water pressure the diaphragm is unable to expand enough for the lungs to fully fill with air all-in-all whirlpools are no joke it's best to avoid them even the smallest ones even gentle little whirlpools can grow stronger at any moment leaving even experienced pros unable to get out of them that's all for today we hope you liked the video don't forget to tell us your suggestions for future topics in the comments if we choose your suggestion we'll mention you in a future video thanks for watching [Music] you", "hhTPYdjGxP0": "oh my god you guys all wanna be in my video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys

Cheers", "hebvgdlyzYQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] good morning so I finally made it and I am now in drum roll made as a candidate I got here last night around like I want to say three four in the morning I would have blogged like me driving stuff but that's kind of boring and I would have did customs but customs is not name playing no games at that border she was not only I was some little friendly stuff she was not only and I pulled up somebody come on radio off I said he gets he'll be twice miss lady turned it off and she asked me five thousand questions literally questions I don't even understand why you need to know the answer to well how much money do you have on you why do you need to know that everything is just so nice here like it's just generally just nice the view is nice the Sun feels nice low you can see the Sun reflecting off my skin right now but I will say last night when I got here there was snow on the ground not like three inches of snow heavy snow but really I was driving around through some of the neighborhoods and stuff and they were powerless no yards full of snow and now I wake up this morning to sunnysean it and there are people downstairs swimming in the pool so our regions don't know how things work at Toronto it's clearly they just do it different here apparently you can snow one day and then you wake up and go swim in the next so hey I'm not gonna complain I'm gonna go put my swim trunks and I'm gonna go get in that pool later today but for now I'm just get my day started on the shower get dressed for today and then I'm gonna go explore some of the smoke shops because weed is legal in Canada so I'm gonna go see what's that's like I see if they got a gasser another thing I know gasps I'm gonna clown the whole store because you just cannot have a weed shop used to finish smelling rage now after that I'm gonna get some lunch or something and then I'll probably go I don't know today I'm in like a relaxing move so maybe I should go do some chilled stuff like our own little Museum or something go get a massage go spicy a little bit see what I can get myself into see if I can find a place to take pictures at and then after that I'll probably try to get some more food well let you see what we get let's just see where the day takes me I fell to the small shop that's my first mission smoke shops cuz I have to go see this is gas or not cause if it's not gas listen all right to get ready and we gonna air through the smoke shops okay so the hard part is now finished I got already did everything I had to do have my little pre-party turned up in my hotel room now the first stop is to go get lunch so I was looking online and the first thing God that popped up for like good food places he was plantain and it's supposed to be like this vegan place and I'm like have vegan have ice to eat chicken tenders whatever is not that it's not important but we're gonna try a plan to see if it's any good and then what you don't see what a day takes us hopefully Fanta is good because honestly I'm very hungry like very very hungry and I just don't have time for my foods to not be good because if my food is not good it's just gonna be a bad time all around for everybody involved all parties the waiter the manager the doorman the security guard at the parking lot everybody's gonna have a bad day if this food is bad but it is cross no bad vibes we gon expect this to be good let's hit the planter and dad so I just left plants on not too long ago the food is actually really good it fills you up really fast I wasn't able to finish my whole meal but I got the general gist of it and it was actually really good um I had an energizer shot the orange drink that was an energizer shot and it had like ginger in it that was actually to me nasty but it's only because I don't like ginger not because of anything else the lemonade was good fries are good they had some like dipping sauce I don't know what it was she said it was like dijon or something but I didn't hear what she said so now I am on my way to the smoke shop that is on the corner it's either this tree that I'm walking towards or the other Street but I'll figure that out after I start walking I guess I'm gonna go see what the smoke job is about hopefully they got good guess so that okay no you have seen but somebody will see what that's about hopefully I let me record in there if they don't then I'll try to like sneak a couple get a couple videos or something for ya everybody can see what's going on in the smoke shop because I'm curious as to how they do this here in how they I'm curious to how they go about the we stuff here too because it's legal here but it's not legal in the state so I'm wondering we don't see how they um how do you operate with the whole week [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I'm back from the smoke shop back in my hotel room and I got some food on the way to the smoke shop was crazy it's like a whole like personal shopper in it like somebody follows you around a store but I don't follow you but like you can go up to somebody and ask them like oh can I get some help and then they have like this little tablet thing where they walk around the store with you basically and tell you about each turn each other disposable pens the pre-rolls all type of stuff while you were on tell you about everything the name she rang you up on the thing and he goes at the front and check out they do ID you at the door though because I think in Canada you have to be 19 in order to buy legal marijuana but yeah that was super dope and then food was I just went to the bottom the floor level in my hotel and got a turkey burger from the little cafe down there but let me show you what I got from the hallway story so this is the bag it comes in I spent honestly I could not tell you how much I spend was in Canadian dollars and not a US so I don't know I spend a hundred twenty Canadian dollars it you know either convert that to us okay this is afraid it's already open don't don't only or nothing this is a disposable DAP in whoa there's disposable with THC pen it's tangerine dream innocence sativa him and it actually tastes just like oranges like its Lily just like oranges I don't really like it because I don't like oranges blood is what is the actual pin looks like it's already at the box because I was ripping it in a car I poured it like 20 times so there's that that was the disposable pan was 38 Canadian dollars again if you know how to convert it you got it okay this is the good supply Royal Highness pre-rolled blowing that's what it looks like it's not open yet because I didn't phone my readers need to bless yet that was 14 canadian dollars and as you can buy them one for you come bottom as singles or you can buy them in like some of them come in packs how about when it's a pack this is a single so it was one for one gram but then some of them say like five four five minutes which means that there's five blunts in there well five four one gram so it'll be five blunts in there at each dunno one gram this is an indica THC pyro blunt this is oh it's called Soleil oh this is there were new strands it's a reduced rate this is the one that grows only about its carbon new it's an indica and this is a female but it's 10 Canadian dollars and it's 14.5 so this is 0.5 Grambling also I'm not at telling nobody to smoke I'm not advocating nobody to go smoke out their smoke I'm just saying this is what I do she's known to get her money on me but I'm not very smart this is the houndstooth hybrid notice it's a sativa help sooth sativa one gram this is the actual flower here they call them flowers this is the actual like look you gotta roll up it you know this person got explaining this off this is the five things I was talking about so there's five pre-roll blessing here and there each one gram this is the the boss it's called the Boston Tea Party yeah and that is 31 Canadian dollars and these are it doesn't say but I'm trying to remember where I picked them up at in a store I want to say it's a sativa yeah it definitely is yes is this even yeah so that's pretty much I don't like to see what the rest of this stuff just all these products hitting like again I'm sure yeah that's pretty much it for today I just pick up tomorrow I started doing more stuff but let's taking the view one last time before a game for the day [Music] [Music]", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "oUg7W9EtOyE": "[Music] this video will show you how to properly use your sublingual trochee also known as the trish or a lozenge this is a dissolvable medication that can be made with a gelatin or wax base to use your trophies first you'll want to wash your hands with warm soapy water before getting started it comes in a prescription container like this so you'll want to take the prescription cover off and then this plastic packaging to make it a little bit easier to work with you can actually twist and kind of select the packaging to loosen it and one side comes with the lid so you can open that lid up and then you'll see that they're pretty easy to separate and if you want to make make it a little bit easier you can flip it and kind of push one out so that would be one method of dispensing and you can see that's easily flexing out or you can flip it back around and then kind of play around with the pieces until you get them out but they should easily kind of separate once you play around with ink come out as a clean piece if the doctor prescribed less than a full trophy it is scored and easy to cut with a knife in 2/4 or 1/2 if needed the trophy should be used as directed by your physician it can be placed either between the teeth and the gums the side of your teeth or under the tongue allow it to fully dissolve for complete absorption of the medication this can take up to fifteen to thirty minutes the goal is to have the medication enter your system through the oral mucosal membrane layer through your skin rather than being swallowed do not eat drink or brush your teeth for 30 minutes after using the medication it is best practice to rotate the location where you place the troche to prevent any irritation these medications can be sweetened or flavored upon request due to the sweetness or flavor of this medication be sure to keep it out of reach from children most trophies do not need to be kept refrigerated they can be stored in a cool dry location or at room temperature do not leave them in your car in direct sunlight or warm places because they can melt if you have any further questions feel free to call our pharmacy at seven one four four six

to help you in the best way that I can and I'm gonna try my best so Miley I think I've said in several videos it's my picky eater like baby and billions will literally eat anything I put down anything but Marley he'll sniff it and he was like nah breath they say this ain't what I'm used to so when I started with him earlier I think when we got named I don't remember what brain he was on middle summer and he wasn't eating it no that's what meteorite oh that's what he started kind of eating so he just was not eating it and I was like oh my god this boy is not eating and we went through a couple of those we will get on for its and Petsmart pro tip if you're trying to figure out what kind of food your dog likes do you pick smart because they have a awesome return policy to try it on your dog if they don't like it you can take that back a food back and get your money back you don't have to you know waste your money your dogs might eat in the food take it back get your money back I had to do that compass on some money so anyway so we tried a couple different brands and we finally got to Blue Buffalo and we got these kibble for these smart dogs and he would eat it so so that was the best I could get him to eat and so we stuck with that brand but he never really ate it on I was always worried that he wasn't eating enough because he was so picky he would work I'll try to eat then I heard giving him like chicken and things I would eat and he was more so he sat in his kibble and so I was always like being you Jesus not eating you just like eating books online looking up trying to research different friends and I did try a couple different brands other than Blue Buffalo and Blue Buffalo was the only one that I could get him eat maybe half of this food it back and so then that's when I began to get into homemade food so um my tween 1450 I started making their home and I have a couple videos on how to make homemade food and he ate that no hesitation no problems like he was just eating it up and I thought oh finally he's eating all his spoon of one setting out to put his food up put it back down and hope he eats it so the homemade food was awesome like I joined it yeah hey Marley enjoyed it but the humming food it was too bad and so what's happening is he was starting to get issues with this Patriot and with that he began to get sick and at one point I had to take him to the emergency room I'm having a video on it or not if I did I linked it but he was throwing up but he was pooping in a hatful at any a news stream lee stressful time and so the doctor didn't format that Marley does have painted tires he's got too much fat in his diet and he got a prescription for a mouth brand food very low fat and we did the whip because mileage is not too fond of kibble and that was maybe like two years ago or so might move to a year so like that and so now Marley is on Strictly wet food like he eats with and I do um the girls are also nobody oh okay nobody's being in love my food anymore at this point they're all the girls are on the same brand of the Medicaid braid you have to have a medical card you get from the vet to be able to buy the food the girls are on the heart version I mix it a little bit away Miley is doing 95 percent weight with a little bit of kibble cuz he's just not a capable guy you know Miley just doesn't like kibble he likes wet food I can get him to eat a little bit but not a lot so one thing I would suggest Elaine is a try before brand of dog food and maybe one will work maybe you like the taste of one there's so many nice grace but I'm better with Miley I think buffaloes like the best brand out there there wasn't that many brands within these last few years there are so many brands of like really really good dog who are really good ingredients that really are really really awesome they're at the airport I always think that it wasn't a few years ago so I would definitely research try getting a quality dog food and if he's not a fan of kibble that's okay because they have the rotten teeth rotten stink that's both of my dogs like that I'm I had them on that for a while and I think all these not stop buying it I have enough well I think I thought well don't feel good on it at first I think the girls started having a few issues with it so um I thought feed them on because there's so many brands right so you know techsmartt and lick and then they also have these companies that have the homemade food that they're selling you ordered that bring your dog get some dog like Marley just don't like yeah well I don't know what it is I can't get the guy to kill little sunrise sunset I'll put killing its food and it'll be okay he'll eat it a couple times and then other times he'll just go through the wet food pick the kid walk and put on port so it's just obviously the Pens like his blue so that would be suggest number one it's just to try other brands be brought with him suggestion number two of your really really really want kibble maybe put like a dog gravy on top or get a little bit of wet food maybe a can of wet food and put it on top as like a kind of sauce on top of it that helps with my little bit when we first started introducing what we started putting what on top of this dry and you didn't completely finish his job he ate more of it so I would definitely do that really it's kind of like this topic is it's kind of like subject to your dog of course some people will be like oh you know they'll eat if they get hungry enough I don't subscribe to that message I kind of my dog to not have to be starving to eat something that hey I want to find something that they kind of like that it does I like to force them to eat and so like I said now he's doing well so maybe your dog is either okay food person or maybe this is kibble you have so my suggestion would be to do some research and try out different brands in the trifle Buffalo you can try out like a nutria there is a bunch of different brands and you can do the ones where they mailed it off to their mill and it's fresh made he may like that so just kind of play around with it and know don't give up hope don't lose patience it's been a long journey with Marley Marley at six he'll be seven in November and we're just kind of getting to a place where you consistently eats it took us a while to get there so don't get frustrated don't give up he'll get there so hope that helps a little bit and if you guys in the comments have dealt with dogs that are picky eaters and if you guys can help give more suggestions to Elaine on things that she can do and um that is it for me today I definitely thank you guys for watching those jerky times 3 we are so close to 15,000 subscribers as we do here we're gonna do an awesome giveaway so definitely like comment share and subscribe to this channel and we will see you guys in the next one bye guys", "cDwgUU27NwA": "okay guys i just want to um do a quick disclaimer um before this video first um if you're not a medical patient or live in a legal country or state et cetera um leave bye i'm sorry but like you're not welcome here um anyways so if you're not supposed to be here leave and then the other thing is i my scale wasn't working properly for some reason and um i couldn't probably measure how much i was putting in the soup and um it turned out really badly like it turned out good but i consumed way too much way too much so like you can almost take this as an educational um a video on the effects of being dumb me i'm the dumb one because i'm like yolo um who cares i can tolerate it i could not tolerate it i could not bad bad bad bad okay anyways sorry for this long intro but i really want to stress you guys make sure you're not putting too much in there make sure you know your dosing okay i'm going to put a video below that can explain how to figure out how much you're consuming um but there's so many different ways to figure it out you don't have to watch my video my video is very long it explains it in a lot of detail but um yes please um be careful don't end up like me so i don't know how to explain this because i'm like pretty high right now but the after effects of the soup very dramatic okay if somebody had a low tolerance this would like destroy that like so there's a lot of video i'm just trying there's a lot of video so i just decided to make a separate video so this video is just about how to make soup and then the next video that i like stop stop what am i saying stop where was i oh my god my eyes are they red i don't get red eyes no they're not red anyways i'm checking i ended up like literally stuck in one spot and i couldn't move and it was the worst ever so i regretted my decisions literally every minute here we go what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to show you guys how to make infused noodle soup instant noodle soup to be precise but you could use any type soup that you like because really what we're making is an infused water and fat solution and with that infused water and fat solution you can make anything you like what i happen to be having is the soup like i said but you could use it for tea you could use it for um you could add like um um flavor like a flavor packet to it like um you got iced tea powder to it and they a infused iced tea you could drink it straight um so let's get started because it's going to be sitting on here for a while so i'll talk a little bit more about it once we have it cooking so we're gonna start by turning our stovetop on and i have two cups of water here and i'm gonna pour it in now i'm using two cups of water because that's what my instant meal packages call for um but this water is going to evaporate over time and you can add more water to your liking it's not really going to affect um how the product turns out so use one or two cups and add more water as you like but it's better to have less water than too much um because you can literally add more water any point so i'm just gonna put this aside while it's heating up and what we need to infuse our soup is um some decart cannabis now this is just a bag from before it was the carbs but i'm just keeping it in there and i need fats okay so you can't extract the thc from the flour in the water on its own you need fat for it to bind to so you could use coconut oil you could use sesame oil which is what i'm going to use because i like to taste sesame oil with my um uh instant noodles um and if you didn't want to use this for soup like i said because you can use this for tea you can use this for anything i would recommend something more like coconut oil because it has a more mild flavor um taste whatever but yeah so you could use this and make an iced tea with it right like that would be good actually that would be really good i think i might do that i am going to be using peanut butter and soybean oil for it's not soybean sesame oil for my um fats for my soup because when i make my instant noodle and i might accidentally call it mr noodle because in canada it's kind of just like the the go-to brand and i in my head i call this noodle but um i add peanut butter and um sesame oil to it anyway and they're both fat so this is like the perfect solution um i add a bunch of couple things that make it taste like so good um and i'll add it after but uh you don't need to you just need a fact okay any kind of fat coconut butter soy bean sesame olive peanut butter doesn't matter butter okay so we don't need this coconut oil because i was just showing that uh for demonstration purpose says options and then you're going to need um instant noodle packages package singular um or you know mr noodle not my stranger that's what this uh chicken noodle soup or chicken noodle soup mix or any type of soup mix or anything you want to add to your cannabis water so while we have this heating up here i am going to add in my fats so i'm going to start in by adding about a tablespoon of my sesame oil and i'm not measuring it because it doesn't really matter that much because i'm going to be adding probably more fat than i need anyway um but i think i'm gonna add about a tablespoon of peach so we have our tablespoon of i'm gonna keep calling the wrong thing sesame oil which smells and tastes so good and i'm gonna add a tablespoon ish of um peanut butter actually more than a tablespoon because i really like peanut buttery taste in my um soup so this is more than a tablespoon but this is how much i'm adding and the water's not warmed up yet so that peanut butter is not going to fall off just yet so i'm just going to leave my spoon in there so it can melt off until it warms up okay so we got our fats in there and now we need to add our cannabis in so i am going to be a little bit extra here and um oh well you'll see what i'm doing but um you can put your canvas in there one you can put it all straight in there and um not strain it out and eat the cannabis flower left over whatever but like i don't want that i'd rather strain it and there shouldn't be much thc left in it by the time you're done with it so there's really um that's not necessary so you're gonna at the end a lot of people um will run it through a strainer or they will um put it through cheesecloth or et cetera et cetera but i it just seems like i feel like we could do this an easier way right um so i went to the dollar store and tried to find something that would work um like a deep sitting mesh whatever this is called but i couldn't find any so i bought this one and i'm going to cut it and you could use like a big tea thing like this and the reason why i'm doing they do make smaller ones that would have fit in here but i wanted to have like as much uh i wanted it to like be able to like float freely right i didn't want to have the cannabis all like stuck in one spot if i feel like it's gonna extract better when the liquid and the fat is able to like fully get on all um sides of all the cannabis so i bought this and i have my uh wire cutters i think they're called and i'm going to cut the mesh out like obviously you can cut your fingers doing this so be careful okay our water is um starting to simmer and heat up and we don't want this to be boiling we want it to be simmering so i'm going to turn the heat down now to a low-ish heat hello-ish medium so it's simmering but not boiling okay no matter how hard i try like no matter how hard i try i cannot cut it with the wire cutters um maybe they were just not good enough so i got these like plier things and i'm like just pulling it out of the like just completely taking it out this is like just maybe do this like outside or somewhere because there's little pieces of uh metal or mesh coming off so i'm just gonna finish this outside the easiest way to do this would have been to do it um in the pot when there was no liquid in it but i wanted to do it on camera but yeah that way then you could kind of like shape it uh you could shape it to the pot and now we can put our weed in so i will post the link um below for both how to de-carb your weed and how to figure out how much thc is in it so you guys can figure out how much you want to put um if you're completely like unsure of how much to put you could put like about the same amount as you put for um the fat right so i have put like two tablespoons of fat maybe a little bit more and i'm probably going to add i'm going to add a little bit less than that but maybe like one tablespoon i'm going to do one brown so i had just decarb some weed yesterday i just did it in my leftover and then i just put it in here to keep it fresh so i'm just going to weigh this out my scale male functions and that was definitely more than one gram it's probably like two grams but um i have high tolerance if you don't have high tolerance start low and be more careful with it but if you do have a high tolerance you're probably fine like me to just take your chances i'm not recommending you do that i'm just saying i'm just saying let's get all the rest of that and again we're not having our water boiling or having it simmering i'm just gonna put my crumbs does anybody else do that like take their crumbs and like put it in it's like kinda okay now all i have to do is let this simmer for 20 minutes to like a half an hour um and like i said and i'm gonna keep saying don't have it um boiling just keep it simmering and you can stir it around occasionally but you don't should be fine without it um but yeah just keep an eye on it and we're gonna cook this cook it for um about 20 to 30 minutes so here's how it looks we just have it on um what is it on it's on like three and a half there it's a little bit too high to be honest i'm gonna lower that a bit because this is that's actually like on the verge of boiling there so we'll turn that down and make sure all of the flour is submerged because it's my mesh thing um it's kind of getting stuck on the side so maybe i honestly don't know how good of an idea this mesh thing was sometimes i i think i have like really good ideas and then i try and execute them and like and like trying to see it from like outside perspective and i'm like they're probably thinking this girl's dumb but um we're on crack i i've definitely been told that people call me crackhead all the time on my youtube videos i can't help that actually yeah i can okay um i don't know i still like it and i wasn't gonna waste my four dollars i spent on that mesh since i already started taking it apart you know also why do i always say no okay we've been cooking for about 20 minutes and i think i'm going to do another 10 minutes why you ask i don't know just because i'd rather get more than less you know oh my god if i say you know one more time i swear okay i'm gonna try and see how it tastes to see if we can see how it's going oh my god the embarrassment this mesh thing is i don't know what i was expecting it tastes like that's literally oil and peanut butter yeah ten more minutes okay i'm gonna prepare my other ingredients for it to make it extra delicious also i don't really smell it but at the same time i'm used to it so so since it's almost done i'm going to add in my other ingredients um this isn't necessary for anything other than flavor right so like skip if you want but if you want something tasty and you like like peanut based and like spicy and like yummy add these wow english okay but yeah you don't have to add these things this is just because this is how i like my stupid taste you could add oregano you could add parsley you could add onion you could add you could make a whole soup you could add carrots you know um but then you have to strain them out so that's a whole issue i would wait till after so i do some honey okay a little bit more i know you like honey ew but i love my sweet and sour i mean you can barely taste honey then we have rice vinegar a little splash of rice vinegar and then i'm gonna do some soy sauce and some chili flakes too after we'll grab those flakes i love flakes so we're almost done we're at about 30 minutes or just about 30 minutes and it's looking really good it's smelling good and shortly we're just gonna take it off of the strainer so i believe it's safe to say that this strainer thing was the dumbest idea i've ever had because i could have just put the strainer over the bowl and poured it embarrassing okay so it's been on here for like a little bit over 30 minutes taking it off simmering the whole time not boiling i stirred it around in my bowl i have frozen broccoli because i'm not eating very many vegetables these days because i'm lazy and i figured out frozen broccoli is a great addition to the noodles but not when noodles are by themselves but when you add those ingredients i said mm-hmm like so good so so so good i'm gonna be using my mr noodle spicy chicken mr noodle is like a popular instant ramen i used to say raymond until one day i figured out it wasn't raymond it was ramen like how embarrassing how many times you think i said that out loud everybody loves raymond you know okay so i'm going to take this out i'm honestly embarrassed about how stupid this idea was so dumb and i'm good i'm going to put it back in the bowl which i could have done this the whole time and i'm going to pour my um soup and i'm just uh oh my god i forgot to add the noodles and the seasonings so at this point this is when you add your stuff i'm going to turn the heat back on because we gotta cook these noodles a little bit um and if you weren't making noodles and you're making a tea or whatever you could um you could put this coconut oil and water combination in like a jar put it in the fridge and then you could pull it out and warm it up and make some tea with it or add some water enhancers whatever so just add my noodle how am i gonna strain the noodles out okay maybe this wasn't that bad an idea after all so put my noodles in this video is definitely like i could have been like a three minute video instead of whatever this is going to end up being um please tell me what you guys think would you have liked if i when i realized how stupid of an idea this mesh thing was if i would have like just completely took it out of the video and like pretended this never happened or do you guys enjoy watching me mess everything up i don't know let me know because i don't know okay so i'm just cooking my noodles in the water the juice um and there's actually less liquid than i wanted because um it evaporates pretty quickly if you're letting it simmer for like over half an hour so i'm just going to add some more water and i'm going to turn the heat up more let me show you guys what we're working with here watch me spill it noodles fat and liquid and you want to make sure when you're straining everything out like not that the fat would get stuck in here but the fat is what is containing most of the the thc right so you want the fat that's the good part so i'm just gonna cook my noodles and i'm gonna pour it into my um see you can even see some of like the fat stuck to the bottom of this so i'm just gonna try and press as much of that out as i can use my fingers here oh yeah yeah can you guys see that get all the good stuff i can't believe to waste that also you don't have to strain the flour out because um you could eat it i don't want to though just because i just don't want to and um i'm not serving this to anybody obviously otherwise like gross um i can't believe i almost forgot to strain that out just ignore me i'm so sorry i hope you guys don't hate this video okay for me my noodles gonna go wash my paws and then we're gonna eat and then i'm gonna show you guys how it's like when i'm done and it's kicked in a few hours later i just need to show you guys like look at all that fat that's like the peanut butter and come on there we go like the peanut butter and fat mixture that i like squeezed out of um that remaining amount oh yeah look at those colors the green the pink that looks good okay our noodles are almost cooked and we are almost ready to eat oh boy do you ever look tasty let me just let me try a little bit of that oh i hate human okay our noodles are cooked i'm gonna pour my soup here i am i'm gonna pour my soup into my bowl splashy splash i feel like we should scrape some of that up here i mean there's not really much to scrape i feel like that might be kind of like the the fat sitting on the edges but i don't like wasting things so i'm like i feel like i will just like i'll literally lick it after because i'm just like any bit that i can not waste better i'm very frugal i don't like wasting not like actually never mind okay yeah see there we go yay snack time i mean lunch bone apple tea i wonder if it's a good enough temperature because um the broccoli cooled it down a bit since it was frozen sorry so there's something in my teeth okay oh my god i forgot the seasoning mat so like this doesn't taste as good as usual what is going on what is wrong with me one second okay i got the mix you guys i'm sweating and dying your feet but i have to keep my clothes on usually i would like to take them off well like i'd wear like a smaller top because it's so hot and the windows closed so it's not so loud and noisy for you guys but then everybody's gonna complain about how i'm not wearing enough clothes like does it really bother you that much although it's interesting because it's usually only women who complain about what i'm wearing hmm oh my gosh i've never tried this sauce mix on its own but that reminds me when i was younger and i'd like really want to um uh i'd really want to you guys i haven't even ate this soup yet why am i acting like i have uh i used to love like eating them in the package when you like broke them up um and like put the seasoning eggs my mom didn't let me because i wasn't healthy you know i was like i wish i was allowed to eat that but it wasn't okay it smells like herbal soup let's give it a try temperature is pro oh yeah that's good very very good i never used to really like mr noodle or instant noodles but um can skip over me eating this if you like because i'm not gonna probably say anything that it's like information you need to know to make it this is more just for my peeps who my peeps for my friends my my best buds for my people who like are like i'm not functioning properly today i honestly could use some salt um and this looks like all the msg it already has i'm a salt addict i can't help it i honestly do want to add some more salt or maybe some soy sauce it would have been better with more peanut butter and honey but they're very high calorie and the soup is ready oh soy sauce is good by itself too yum but yeah i never used to like mr noodle because or instant noodles because i'm just like they're just not that good until i added like lots of peanut butter and it's just like game-changing peanut butter and then some acidity from the rice vinegar and the sweetness from the honey honestly it tastes better without the weed in it because like you can still taste it but um it does taste a little better than we but it's still good if you serve this to somebody they wouldn't be like is there weed in this they'd be like what's the unique herb you have in there i'm putting the broccoli for the broccoli like the perfect temperature to eat right away if you do i have the same things that i add add more peanut butter because um there's nothing like peanut butter and like spicy chicken spicy chicken was the flavor i chose of my soup um uh oh my god i'm so hot and the soup is hot i'm gonna open my window the temperature why is it so hot what temperature is it in here it's only 22 degrees what's going on oh yeah that's a look okay i'm gonna finish this off camera because and then i'm gonna report back once i feel like it has hit me i'm gonna let you guys know how it goes okay okay i'll see you guys anywhere between well i mean it's gonna be immediately after for you but it's gonna be like two hours probably for me depending on how fast it hits me actually i should have added some muscle than into this but since i didn't i'm gonna take a less than capsule to help the absorption absorption okay see you guys soon in a couple seconds now bye because of all the fat in here has been making me full a lot faster than usual but you know the fat is necessary for what we're looking for thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you are at the end please tell me um um thank you for staying with me to the end even through my um my struggling through the video am i struggling with words my struggling with ideas am i struggling with really the whole thing doesn't mean it didn't turn out it just i struggled that happened so and that's okay well like i said already i think but who knows i'm gonna say it just in case thank you guys for watching i hope you enjoyed the video if you did please subscribe and um give it a thumbs up and i hope you guys all have a wonderful day goodbye um i feel like it's already hitting me and it's only been like 20 minutes i have so much that i need to do like i didn't even finish the soup yet i'm too high i can't oh my god um didn't you finish i didn't even finish the soup yet and i'm gonna have to read it again because i still haven't eaten it yet oh that looks gross now i don't want to brace myself also is anyone even watching at this point i feel like i've been like documentary my whole evening like i am checking out for the day for this i like i'm like i'm fairly able to like i'm like one step at a time i ended up like literally stuck in one spot and i couldn't move and it was the worst ever so eventually i fell asleep eventually i regretted my decisions literally every minute", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "XOpIqX95KWI": "[Music] ready yeah what's up YouTube try and done them comeback head you're here and oh crap are you serious all

recommendation for you so if you're looking for a great american imperial porter and one that will surely make you look like a connoisseur then join me on this tasting my name is eddie and i have tasted and sampled many beers from all over the world and it is my passion to help you find that perfect beer you're looking for whether you're looking to try something new or there is something very specific that you're looking for to pair with your foot i got your back [Music] welcome back beer lovers thank you for spending the next few minutes with me as i said in the intro my name is eddie and on this channel i taste and review all kinds of beers and give you my most honest opinion about them as well as some ideas to pair them with your food just like the one you're about to watch so if you're new here consider subscribing and hitting that bell icon down there so you're notified every time i release and you'll be a review video if you like the video hit that thumbs up let me know you like it now what did i say i have an imperial porter other wise known also as a baltic porter so um you know those those two styles are pretty pretty similar sometimes they are you know also known as kind of stuff and today i have one from this brewery that i have never tried anything from them before they are out of idaho laughing dog brewery and i'm bringing you their pecan porter today check it out that's right pecan porter that sounds tasty and guess what i'm going to pour that on in to my nonic pine here which is the glass i recommend that you use when you're putting yourself a nice border whether it's a robust porter or an imperial porter or any other kind of powder and remember having the right glass for the beer that you are tasting is always an important piece of being a beer connoisseur so if you want to get your own set of beer concert tv glasses look in the description below check out the store and see how you can get your hands on a nice set of glasses now where do we always start appearance more importantly the three c's of appearance which are color clarity and carbonation that is right now the color it was or it is but you know you can be full and think that this is black it was very very dark brown color very clear actually it was clear when i poured it a nice carbonation yeah i would call that a very lots of action carbonation the head it's not as big a head of foam you know and it's dissipating somewhat quickly i mean you can see some of the lacing you've lost about half a finger already but it's still a nice still head there and it's nice green color head of foam so very very nice appearance all around now where do we go next aromas right well they're not trying to hide that pecan for sure it smells like caramelized pecans in there and all kinds of kind of like vanilla maybe even a hint of kind of like espresso or maybe even like a cappuccino scent uh smell there yeah very very nice sweet malty kind of aromas there it smells like dessert to be honest with you and i like pecan pie so maybe that's what i'm thinking about and now i'm going to taste it and let you know how it goes well slightly different than i expected i would say it's a lot it's a lot more bitter than i would have led to believe with such sweet aroma so tip of the tongue is very bitter actually the carbonation is nice throughout so you know if you're looking for something that cleanses your palate very nice carbonation and then that malt base with some of that sweet pecan caramelized pecan maybe burnt sugar and even a hint of like i said roasted coffee maybe like espresso all that comes through the middle then what lingers is a dry bitterness so it's and i'm still feeling kind of like a smoky even peppery dry bitterness there in the back of the palate that that kind of lingers so uh just keep that in mind but it's very very good i would call that light to medium body so again it was a lot more um it has a lot you know it was more bitter and a little bit heavier than i thought it was going to be from the appearance and the aromas but it's not a heavy beer at all it's maybe a little bit light to medium body there um that all comes important when we go to the next piece which is the part that you come to me for the part that makes you a concert the foot pairings right now porters you know they are bold beers with bold foods you want to pair them with foods that are equally bold so that the food can stand up to the beer and in this case we always look for you know meats grill meats smoked meats that have maybe sauces and stuff like that and in this case the first thing i'm going to say check it out honey pecan barbecue sauce chicken sliders yes it's a thing look it up if you don't believe me but that is going to be a great great pairing because a lot of those flavors are going to harmonize and like i said nice carbonation throughout by the way this is 8.1 alcohol by volume and i could barely barely uh taste some of that alcohol so they they do a nice nice job of you know kind of like balancing all the flavors there but because of the alcohol that's also going to help you enjoy some of those bold foods like the one i just i just um suggested also if you like thai food and if you're like you know noodles and stuff like that thai peanut noodles yes it's going to go great with the beer again it has that pecan flavor so a little bit of that nutty peppery peas part of the beer all those are going to really help you enjoy that thai food and it has enough malt to stand up to spicy food so go and enjoy your spicy foods with this beer because it's definitely going to to help you you know put down the fire when you need it when you need it to and um you know i rarely give any suggestion to vegetarians and i don't want to forget my vegetarian friends who love beer so a nice grilled portobello mushroom burger with some caramelized onions on top that will go great with this pecan powder that i have here so all those are my suggestions and as far as the cheese is smoke gruyere yes anything because what i have been learning and teaching you as i've been learning here is beers that have that long kind of smoky part of the taste they benefit from a smoky cheese to kind of pair and sound like it can almost like a rest it stops some of that smokiness from lingering way too much in the back there so i think a small gruyere would be a great great pairing with this beer now you know you can always trust me to leave you a great recommendation as far as a dessert pairing and today i think you're going to enjoy that again if you enjoy this kind of flavors here that's going to be a winning pairing there for you my friend now that concludes today's lesson but not before i ask you have you had laughing dog pecan porter before how have you enjoyed it have you enjoyed it with food have you drank it solo what are your impressions what are your comments leave me some comments below that's how we we all continue on this journey right so i hope i have helped you increase your beer knowledge as we all continue on this journey of becoming beer connoisseurs and i encourage you to be on the lookout over the next few days when i release my next beer review video and until then [Music] enjoy", "GlNRlD6udeA": "the heist but he's back he's back after an hour yes yes guys he's back he's back are you doing are you doing so roughly an hour late it's being literally about an hour and three minutes day but feel the effects I feel the effects very very nicely actually it feels lovely it's not overpowering or anything like that I really really enjoy it it's nice I don't think the 300 milligram sweets were quite enough for me I have quite a high tolerance to cannabis as you guys know you've seen more smoke but yeah you really really feel a nice effect from this like I said it's not overpowering I don't want to sort of - don't mean I'm not gonna sort of an uncomfortable position or place or anything like that I just feel really nice I feel good I feel like I put some games on I feel like I've got I'd be fighting for a walk I could be absolutely active scrappy-dappy-doo being stop it nor pussycat but yeah I feel I feel really good I feel really really nice on her I don't feel salt down all over or anything like that lovely I'm not see it's only it's only just being just over an hour and it does say quite clearly on the packet may take up two hours so delay by up to two hours okay so I'm probably not in the full of the effects as of yet anyway so it's probably a little bit more time I would say I think I'm just on a gradual buildup in a minute but I would say that after about half an hour I started to feel something which like so I didn't on the other packet of sweets at all I didn't it took like the full hour before I started getting the effects of it so it works a lot quicker but I'd probably put that down to me doing it first thing in the morning I'm not having anything to eat as of yet so so for me personally if I do have any of these sweets again I'm going to try my best to probably take them first thing privy inside you and I mean unless I've got loads of em and then I'll just wash them like anything but yeah if you just use them as medicine then yeah I think first thing in the morning for me works the and I'll be interested to see actually how long it lasts as well so be out feeling nice and feeling nice and I'm nice and relaxed nice and mellow nicely stoned in my body yeah just like not overpowering my vision feels a little bit like it's going a little bad times when I move my head's so definite strength to it but I personally think that I could eat a couple of packets of those no problem and it would be OK for me to do that I would recommend you guys do that obviously if you don't smoke a lot just you know mean they'd split up into 50 milligram pieces so it's really really good to go shoo just because I've taking a whole pot don't go do that please you know me know your body know your limits but for me it not problem been smoking quite a lot of years to be fair my tolerance is up there so but I think of ninja had taken for example that packet of sweets I think she'd be really really feeling it bang so a tolerance a little bit lower than mine Oh see I am the main smoker cheers guys so still on the black cheese loving it though does it make me feel like I want to stop smoking which is which is good although sometimes about as it was it's like I can't touch the smoke for hours but now I feel a right of your eye not a particularly high dosage for me but gets really good guys [Music] you're quite chatty as well I'm always chatting you know that my job really over chat in a minute nice pecked on me I've had a bomb since the last bomb over so again it's been an hour since all that bomb definitely like to try some more of these better bores I [Music] definitely like to probably get to a position where I can maybe have a couple of packs of em and see what they feel like but left me for me I've still got half of my speaker left which is just oh no I think I only have one mil of it or whatever it is but there's about half of it left night so starving hungry I'm gonna make a famous Ryan fecal pizza okay I will save a little drop of it just for the for the fecal hot chocolate cause I didn't want to do a thick hot chocolate as well but I'm gonna do yeah I'm gonna do a pizza with some Pico on it which is what like so Ryan eats it and he recommends it and I thought well do you know what that sounds really good last time I got it all over my teeth I've tried it in there's other ways you can do it as well but I think that defeats the way I really really really like the idea of that so I will try that I will try that definitely so I've seen a few people do the Pico pizza so yeah it's made me think hmm lot lot easier way to go down and a lot sort of safer in your body because you're digesting it with food at the same time lovely a little bomb well I'm a rocket oh dear cheers guys Cheers yeah I feel it [ __ ] lovely I feeling lovely nice they like say it might affect you differently if you take a packet about if you're like a one joint add a person and you know you you're not make particularly a heavy heavy smoker maybe you're not a smoker at all maybe that's the reason why you'll you know you're taking metaphors is because you don't like smoking so I would just say start with a low dosage and then just just build yourself up after an hour you'll get to feel whether you're comfortable or not and then obviously you can you can take another dose and so yeah don't do a packet in one go please please guys one love I'm fashioning I've been trained for this [Music] lovely Peter [ __ ] noise noise a cocktail - Peter [ __ ] lovely [Music] become picture here we come you'll be on the live stream do their life garibai straight after this pretty much as soon as the pizza sketch [Music] Wow what can you say to that cheers guys cups tea on the go you know how we roll in the am one huh let me feel really good I mean ready if I was gonna rip you know give him a proper sort of a review is sort of mark then I mean Oxley the pack her packaging tell accent the sweets himself really really really nice I like the fact that you can dose by having the eight sweets which are basically fifty milligrams of peace they sell I think that's brilliant really really nice really really nice of fat not quite strong enough for me but for some people that might be really really strong so yeah probably set by an eight out of ten on though so a ten on sweets by would like soy two packets will certainly see what the sweets and the feet can do together with the black cheese you will see what sort of stately and getting me into today though shall they so yeah peaceful nerve thank you very much for watching this video and I will be back very very soon because I'm gonna be doing a live stream in the next 20 minutes so peace will learn seriously noise just ate some more meta balls and got stoned yes yes hey attend for the chuckles one love one love [Music]", "3xi5DazwqMY": "[Music] well hello there guys girls non-binary people it's your favorite unsalted crackers brother reed here yet again and people with us today as always we're joining back by our sidekick you guys know him as the box we also have with us today we have alexa when was ben and jerry's founded ben and jerry was founded on may 5th 1978 by ben cohen and jerry greenfield it is 42 years old 42 years old anyway guys as always it looks like it's that time it's time for other exciting insane super official thought-provoking straight edge food product reviews youtube's only true there's if i don't everybody where ben and jerry's punchline ice cream limited batch it says people it's got brown butter bourbon almonds uh chuckles of cherries chuckles of cherries so this is a netflix netflix taco takes on comedy as sears as we tight as we take making ice cream but neither of us takes ourselves too serious here's a punchy flavor to prove it we recommend pairing this lickable libation with any netflix stand-up special sitcom or funny movie netflix is a joke but this limited batch flavor isn't anyway guys we're gonna give this a review and see what it's all about so remember if you have anything you'd like read the box arch your legs review you gotta leave a comment below if we like that comment guys we might just pick it out and review your request next thumbnail looking forward to this limited batch of ben and jerry's ice cream all righty guys now i picked this up at kroger for three bucks so let's open it up here if it's not child proof that is it may be child proof it may be read proof i guess you could say and that's some good plastic i'm glad they really seal it up like that that's a good thing most people's not going to be eating this in their car so take it home and get you a knife and tire into it you know so there we go we got it that's good good sturdy package very impressed there from ben and jerry's let's see man oh it looks just like vanilla ice cream a little bit there as you can see nothing special it doesn't look like anything special does it let's get down into it here and see what we've got okay okay wow wow it's almost like they have the nuts very finely cut up inside of the ice cream [Music] they do that's clever isn't it very clever there's uh very finely the nuts are very finely inside of the ice cream very finely chopped up it's not like a big like a big almond it's very finely chopped up i like that very clever from netflix and ben and jerry's punch line flavor so this is probably gonna be a limited batch like they said it's not gonna be out long so i've always figured i've always seen ben and jerry's is a little bit overrated anyway people i think they're while they're good you know they're there's a little bit of cherry right there let's try this here it's like the cherries mixed inside of the ice cream you really can barley you can barely see it people you have to really look so they've done a great job people i was expecting to have like big size uh cherries in it and big peanuts but they've done a great job just you know chopping it up and mixing it right in the ice cream very nice very evenly done no doubt about that definitely a lot better than i expected people so overall people it's great flavor got the brown butter bourbon you can taste it the almonds are great it's good a little bit of cherries in it it's good ice cream it really is and i just said it was overrated well i think they're a little bit upready but it's good to see a company with just two people in it start a company and just do great at it so overall people i highly recommend it you can see the nuts if you look see the nuts all around it there it's pretty neat but overall people i'm going to give it a very solid is that a cherry right there you can see oh no what is that look at that people would that be a cherry i guess that would be yeah anyway people overall i'm going to give it a very solid score you know there really isn't any bad the only bad ice cream i would say that i've had people is ice cream that's out of date it's hard to find bad ice cream it really is so overall people ben and jerry's punch line ice cream vermont's finest is gonna get a very solid score of four stars it's good it's good so that's going to be the official review people as always thank you so much for watching me the box archie alexa we'll see you guys as always next time man that i was just i just could not get over how well they had this thing sealed up with that plastic man tell you what that was very impressive and uh it

minutes and get the second that's pretty much it my name is great way to go klondike i didn't think they would put out anything new i thought they were just all about ice cream bars", "vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "6sBWiwLyvK4": "[Music] no till uh orange spatula sick you're a long time wheats fan you know what that means it means I'm breaking my cardinal rule today fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited thank you so much for watching this episode here on weeds glad we had a fun result I will check you out on the next review thanks for watching peace pretty good hello and thank you so much for

talking about my visit to zen leaf in Jessup Maryland so exciting stay tuned take a left sound left medical cannabis in 800 feet you'll arrive at Zen leaf your destination will be on a right I think if I'm not mistaken man this is one of the places where they actually grow it and sell it all right you've arrived destination is on the right okay I've got a quick little mini haul from zen leaf in jessup let me quickly tell you it is right off the highway just like a mile or so not too far really easy to get to you're driving like an industrial complex and then you get to this Wow this beautiful little layout where they have they grow that cultivate their own they process it and they sell it so and it's beautiful so when you go and you do feel it smell the aroma in the air and then you go inside and it's just like white and clean and Cris just like you imagine Zen leaf - image conveys really nice friendly helpful people I was a [ __ ] mood I was a [ __ ] let's face it I was in a bad mood we were in the area and we're like quickly let's stop but then I had to go pick up my daughter and I was a [ __ ] but these people were so nice it blows it to me I felt so freaking guilty anyway when you're in the waiting room they have a big board up TV screen that tells you all everything that's available in the price and that was really helpful especially when I was panicking so we could decide what we wanted fast and get in and out and these people were so kind and helpful like I was obviously panicked like because I had to be somewhere and so we told her what we wanted and she went back and got it all ready for us so when we finally finished processing our paperwork we were able to run back there grab the stuff and then like be mesmerized because there's all this stuff to look at they had like a little glass display cases where you can look at things and all this glass work to look at and I don't even know what else because I was like both focused but like I wanted to spend time there like I wanted to go there and spend an hour looking at everything they had and I felt good it felt like a really good beautiful place to hang out and be educated and talk about what they have also I wanted to tell you they told us that on weed maps is automatically linked to their inventory so you could see exactly what they do have at that time before you go and let's see let's get to the hole oh my god okay so this is Blue Dream by Liberty harmony it says how many liberties here you go it's just THC it is raved about online and so we were like oh let's go check it out I think we had hoped to get a cartridge got the tincture and I don't have a review on it I'm sorry I will hopefully get back to you with a review soon this is a hybrid and it's good for like beginners and experts it's just THC in it and I just tincture I don't you think you'd get the turbines trapeze terpenes I'm getting better I'll get better all right and it's a 500 milligrams in this bottle and I think it's like six seven for a dropper home or milliliter it's not really much of a home video if I don't show you what's inside so let's look inside for him so inside you have a Liberty in a black ball anyway breeze it's all proof as always everything is freakin childproof really crazy and you pick it up and this let's get some and it's a pale yellow there you go and it smells like alcohol hey that's what we got so there's number one second thing that we had to go for a cartridge a lemonhead cartridge here you go but look at it alright and they look - this was $90 I've always open it up cuz you talk to see and I always love opening there go it was very like anti-climatic let's pop it open and see what's inside alright and here is someone ahead oh I can smell it yes it's been used alright so it is a nice beautiful like it really looks like a lemony color doesn't it lemony and that was the lemonhead cartridge and that is good for pain and I think it was a cush and I wish I knew more I wish I could give you a description of more about it but I can't sorry I can do what I can do but I do have a sec I have a back onion uh problem but let's end up that was the end of zen lee sin leaf was a great experience the crosses are application that the fast beautiful waiting room beautiful showroom I highly recommend it definitely check out Zen leave in Jessup Maryland and now let's get to secondhand review of Dixie half-and-half I've heard this [ __ ] is delicious like delicious like you want to pour yourself a big old glass of it but don't do it because it's like a serving size is this remember it's hard to open everything a serving size is like half a cup and that's six milligrams so maybe two but you're not like really I don't want to go more than two so anyway delicious stuff highly recommend it's between 28 and $30 for this little container with a bunch of servings in it I should work out what if the price works out too but anyway check it out this woman was

moon rock art and I think after like 2 hours that I waited to see if they kicked in I just started hitting on the moon rock art and I got me it got me high as hell but these they didn't do anything for 15 bucks I bought these at a dispensary in Compton and yeah these are not worth it at all guys definitely 15 bucks down the drain but you know you pay for what you get or you get you get what you

experiment we started in the last video which is does eating an edible on an empty stomach or a full stomach matter if you watch my last video you saw that I ate on a completely empty stomach and came to the conclusion that I don't think that it truly matters if you eat on an empty stomach well now I have just gotten out of the delicious lunch filled my belly up and I am ready to try eating the same edible this time on a full stomach to see if I feel less high so what's he open it up page this bad boy and this is the same edible I had before dark sneakers when my favorite edible is available cost seven dollars my dispensary for a 200 milligram edible tastes delicious so again we are just experimenting to see if I feel less high now that I have a full stomach with this edible and what we're gonna do is I'm going to take this edible I'm gonna eat some of it here in front of you then we're going to come back in two hours to let you guys know how work feel see if we're feeling YUM okay guys and with that I will see you in two hours to let you know I've got 30 large crickets so you know what that means it means we're about eating and edible on a full stomach and guys it's been two hours since I had that dark sneakers bar on a full stomach and I feel nothing not one tiny shred of me stone in any way shape or form I am flabbergasted to be honest eating an edible on a full stomach definitely seems to affect your high when I had yesterday on an empty stomach I was  bloody bloody high after two hours but now don't feel a damn thing at all so guys always be sure to eat your edibles on an empty stomach if you don't want to waste your ammo and with that guys that concludes this little mini experiment that we've run I'm gonna go shout down on these crickets and we'll catch you guys on the next week's review thanks for watching hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any

Here is a plant in front of us that is known in Central America by the Spanish speaking Indian they call the Sauco, is a plant that in the berries we find that the mineral of iron is found, iron phosphate iron phosphate is found in these berries and these berries are responsible for us reversing a lot of diseases that sits in the blood they contain iron phosphate. This plant the Sauco when it sends its roots into the ground it converts that oxide mineral into a liquid digestible substance, known,  the process is known as iontopherosis or the conversion from a solid to a liquid and here Mother Nature has converted iron which is solid into a berry for you to enjoy. And over here we find now that the flower, unlike the berries that contain iron phosphate the flower now is a different chemistry here we have potassium phosphate when the children here in Central America has fever rest assured that the mother would come here and ask me to give them some of the flower of the Sauco to remove the fever because it means that inflammation is sitting some place in the body and this is extremely effective because of its high content of iron and potassium phosphate the SAUCO  ", "mkuqEMpC4a8": "yeah that's what you get for stealing my [ __ ] we sniffing to get

a question that i wanted to [ __ ] um know but yeah man we're just gonna [ __ ] sit down and pop these open and then just give them a try but yeah let's just sit down alright guys we're currently sitting down now um it is currently 10 30 so i'm on i'm gonna be on some crackhead [ __ ] and just taking these [ __ ] edibles hella early i haven't ate anything so i'm gonna be on an empty stomach

the [ __ ] um it'll rebuke edible review i just wanted to [ __ ] talk to you guys and just say thank you to you guys real quick um but let's just pop this [ __ ] open oh [ __ ] i hate ripping [ __ ] all stupid um but now it's just early as [ __ ] and i'm eating candy and [ __ ] not even just candy [ __ ] edibles but and then they're sour as [ __ ] too well i'm guessing yourself but this is what they look like how many are in here so i got one two so i have one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14. there's 14 little um um 14 little [ __ ] wow heads or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call them um they don't look like the [ __ ] regular warheads um every other [ __ ] review that i've been trying like the [ __ ] sour patch ones the watermelon ones really look like the [ __ ] regular candy um this one doesn't look like the regular warheads but or what the [ __ ] do the regular warheads look like anyways actually doesn't matter but i'm just trying to give you guys as much detail as i [ __ ] can um it doesn't say how much [ __ ] thc is per little little um little gummy or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it but it says the packet says it's 500 um 500 milligrams so we're just gonna [ __ ] take these shits and see what's up i mean all of them all fourteen is it fourteen i don't know i'm probably sleeping one two three four five six oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] again one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve three four yeah fourteen um but yeah they're regular as [ __ ] jelly beans or they taste like regular jelly beans i don't taste any weed i was just one of them they're not that sour i was over scared as well i think i was young i was gonna be on camera soured out and [ __ ] looking like my guy right here and [ __ ] um but damn [ __ ] jelly bean flavors are these either like the best jelly beans shits are fire i got me doing my happy dancing [ __ ] i get so i get so excited every time like i'm [ __ ] eating candy and [ __ ] or even when i'm [ __ ] eating too and i'm enjoying that [ __ ] i started dancing them like yesterday i was at ihop [ __ ] in my ass i'll just eating and [ __ ] all that happy um [Music] you know what they taste like or this one or basically all them they taste like those one [ __ ] long sour ropes with like different colors and [ __ ] like blue it's not like different ropes that are different colors but they're like a [ __ ] rainbow i don't know what the [ __ ] they're called but it tastes like that little sour ropes one two three four five six seven eight i just ate half of these [ __ ] it's still earliest oh no it's early we'll take a shower right now um hopefully you should snack we're gonna see if they make me feel different um or if they don't i'ma just be honest i have no [ __ ] hate against any company if it doesn't smack then it just didn't smack this it's not saying that they don't have any anything that [ __ ] smacks but i'm gonna just let you guys know if it just didn't hit me or or what's up i'm not gonna lie to you guys either all right we got two left that's all of them i enjoyed myself eating them for five the taste i gotta give it a 10 out of ten honestly i give some [ __ ] ratings on here i can say i'm not attending [ __ ] but my [ __ ] opinion doesn't [ __ ] matter speak from your own experiences and just try them honestly what i'm trying to do is like see if like if you guys seen these in a local dispensary if you guys are thinking of trying them but you guys wanted to see someone's review first that's all i'm trying to do you know um i'm not telling you to try them i'm not telling you to go out and buy them right now i just want to give you guys more insight on these [ __ ] or if you guys ever like haven't heard of them and then you see this video and then you guys [ __ ] find out about them or find them and you're like oh [ __ ] they actually [ __ ] smack i want to try um that's all i wanted to do or um get out of this video my [ __ ] ratings don't mean [ __ ] everyone has their own [ __ ] ratings um but it's currently uh like 10 10 40 now or 10 yeah i think it's 10 40 because when i started recording it was like 10 35 and it's been like eight minutes so it's like 10 40 um i'll pick up the camera like around 11 50 or some [ __ ] or an hour from now and just let you guys know how i [ __ ] feel so hour by hour i'm going to be updating you guys um i don't know if it doesn't smack within like usually i get smacked within like the first hour two hours um but who knows the [ __ ] sour patch edibles took like four hours before they actually [ __ ] hit me and [ __ ] um so we're just gonna go with the flow and see what's up see if these are actually 500 milligrams or what's up but all right guys i'll pick up the camera later alright guys i currently just got out of the shower um you guys can see um dude i got a comment one time someone said that my [ __ ] perm looks goofy um it's not a perm i have natural curly hair it's just that sometimes it should just be looking goofy as [ __ ] because i have some thick ass [ __ ] girls and my hair just gets dried out sometimes um but i know i don't know i just wanted to mention that [ __ ] someone said i got a permanent [ __ ] it's not perm natural [ __ ] curls um but anyways it's currently like [ __ ] 12 [ __ ] 12 30 i think um i didn't pick it up within the first hour um but i'm just here to [ __ ] let you guys know i i don't know if i [ __ ] feel something or not um i want to wait a little bit more longer give it another hour or so but as of right now i just feel relaxed and i don't know it's just [ __ ] weird i'm not gonna say i'm smack smack but i'm also gonna say like i don't feel a little something it's not drastic but i can't say that i don't feel relaxed and i feel like i'm just chilling you know like i'm just vibing and [ __ ] um like if i had to rate it it's probably like a six six point five right now where i'm at i don't know um i'm feeling something chilling [ __ ] vibing um but i'm just give it another hour or so and see what the [ __ ] happens cuz right now uh i'm not feeling [ __ ] but yeah man we're just gonna [ __ ] let it run and i'll pick up the camera within another hour or so and see what's up i still haven't ate anything so we'll see all right guys as you guys can see i just made um my tea i got a maca and ashwagandha tea mixed with some with two tablespoons of honey um just to get that vitality up and that energy up um but that's just gonna be pretty much it it's currently 115 um 120 or some [ __ ] or some one something um but i i'm gonna rate those edibles on my personal scale 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't [ __ ] try them um but honestly i'm not gonna say that i didn't feel anything because i do feel like some haziness in my eyes and usually that's [ __ ] an indicator one like one of the indicators for me that i'm [ __ ] like high and [ __ ] but like i feel hazy in my eyes my eyes feel like low-key kind of [ __ ] heavy but nothing major you know i'm [ __ ] chilling i'm rocking um i would suggest some more if you have a a lower tolerance um and then and if you have a lower tolerance and it may [ __ ] hit you a lot more harder um but it wasn't nothing crazy for me it was just i was just chilling um but it's cool trying out these different [ __ ] like candy um replicated edibles or whatever how however you would wear that um it's just cool to try out like [ __ ] like a wonka bar [ __ ] sour patch [ __ ] flavored ones warheads it's [ __ ] crazy uh mixed with weed that's crazy as [ __ ] that's just dope um but yeah just because i give it a 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't try it if you have a lower tolerance or an a [ __ ] tolerance then go for it give them a try they're [ __ ] the taste of them is fired um i'm pretty sure it will [ __ ] smack if i like gave it to my sisters or some [ __ ] um but yeah i'ma just go ahead and end the video here man um if you guys enjoyed this video hit

this stuff right here is supposed to be the granddaddy of desert babes this is a vanilla bean ice-cream sandwich between two Fruity Pebbles cereal rice krispies treat things right there this is a big mother bottle of juice right here this bad boy is huge I mean look at that thing it's messes the biggest bottle of juice I think I've ever had even the drip top thing goes all the way down it's absolutely a behemoth when I received this guy it came in this box right here look at that how awesome is that it's like a big wrapped up piece of candy and you got that nice logo on it right there it looks amazing that's actually maybe you want to buy this bottle of juice if you guys haven't seen the promotion for this thing check it out right here so I pretty much saw that thing and I was like oh my god I need to have this like in my life right now okay so inside the actual packaging right here came with a big bag with the juice in it right here as well as a separate unicorn bottle so you don't have to walk around with this big-ass behemoth in your pocket right here haven't really use this bad boy yet I assume it just works like any other drip cap but it does have a also a treats logo on it it didn't just come with a plain generic one right there the marketing for this thing is in full swing it is some really hyped up juice right now the low going is very minimalistic looks really good such treats it looks like a 1980s hotline Miami neon style stuff going on here two three milligrams of nicotine in this manner JAMA and Max VG so really really good drip juice right here so for getting further I've actually never had vanilla ice cream and fruity pebbles meshed together as an ice cream sandwich so we're gonna solve that problem right now okay so what I have right here is a vanilla rice krispies treat homemade smash between some vanilla bean ice cream we're gonna go ahead and try this manage a minute then we're gonna compare it to the juice we go ahead and actually do the review on it oh wow yeah I'll prove huh tastes like diabetes okay so now that I've experienced that I know what to expect hopping right on into this bottle right here so we're gonna go ahead and open this bad boy up and start the smell test on it okay so this stuff right here legit smells like some fruity pebble ice cream with a heavy sense of cream coming out of the smell of it it could vape completely different so I have it all loaded up right here an MVP 3.0 Pro Edition tugboat RDA brand-new dual coil build new cotton new everything is loaded up run at 60 watts it's ready to go this is treats buy treats I think hmm it's mixing real well with the treat that I just ate okay so like usual the lemon is very dominant inside this cereal babe however I am tasting the vanilla ice cream a little bit very very cloudy juice it's not so much like a looper it legit tastes like an original juice it's not the greatest thing in the world and if for damn sure does not taste like what I just ate I just think it's a little overhyped I mean the presentation is absolutely amazing with that being said though I do however think it's a really good cereal juice I am getting the vanilla ice cream but it doesn't really taste like an ice cream it tastes more like a standard vanilla mix with some fruity pebbles it has a very distinct amount of cream to it kind of like a fruity pebbles milkshake does that make sense that's kind of what I'm getting out of this like a fruity pebbles vanilla milkshake now the cereal is not as lemony as some other juices out there the lemons is still very dominant inside treats I think with the extra cream and the hint of vanilla to it it actually holds its own do I think it's worth 50 bucks no I do not however it does only come in 120 milliliters so if you guys do want to try yourself dropping 250 bucks on maybe you guys can pitch in with some friends and you guys can all take like 30 mils out of it or something like that and just kind of share the bottle pass it around do that sort of thing and if you like it then go ahead and spend the extra 50 bucks and get yourself your own personal Boheme a--the right here I do think it's a little overhyped however it's still a solid cereal juice it's not a bad juice by any means I do wish it had more of like a marshmallowy taste to it versus like a creaminess sample it out a little bit because it is an investment this is a $50 bottle of ejuice right here now you do get a lot of a juice however if you don't like it you're stuck with a behemoth of a juice that you're not probably not going to use and you're probably gonna give away to your friends I however thoroughly enjoy it I think it's a pretty good juice I'm giving it a solid two thumbs up just because it does kind of hold its own in the cereal market and the presentation is amazing the juice is a it's definitely a top not a juice I like max VG juices so one of my favorite cereal juices on the market right now is kilos cereal milk and I still prefer kilos cereal milk over treats right here now I do have the juice and I'm gonna let this steep for a little bit longer and it's probably going to grow on me a lot more bottom line though it's a solid juice if you guys want to make the investment on it I'll put the link right down to description as far as being overhyped I really don't have anything bad to say about it it's still a pretty good juice and I will gladly recommend it and that's about it anyway guys if you enjoyed this video be sure to give it a thumbs up and stay tuned for another one hi", "ByfO4tIzcSs":

that butter right in there like that and then you make your next sandwich just like this put it right in just like that and then we make another one get another one right here and finally our last one just like this and we have four half pound sandwiches half pound butter sandwiches and yeah I like to use a little cheese bread to add a little flavor to the butter even though the butter is just delicious but that's what we do and I mean if researchers say I have the two pounds of butter a day then I should probably just do it right I mean I like to just do it in one sitting just get it over with you know so okay uncle beau Oh stop working and passes over there Oh five stuffed work is one kind of morning without a lock whoa and with that's been sick - bullish he's right Oh just gonna save these guys for the afternoon since this is my daily diet so yeah remember guys get that butter in yeah", "l13SfeCm65c": "okay everybody so I have a bag here that I found I met with the owners last night and they actually played a little trick on me and it worked so I'm actually gonna do a live demonstration with somebody a complete stranger they don't know they've never seen this product before but they brought up a problem and I had a solution for them which is this and I'm gonna show their hands in this video and they're gonna try to try to figure this thing out okay so this is the e pack I think that's a company name but it's basically it's a childproof bag okay so here it goes alright opening I think I would name sensory remember this is a complete stranger this is not this is not a setup okay okay I'm gonna give you some more time anything you want except scissors okay I wouldn't do that all right can you try it okay hold this camera like this like that all right so it's a child it's a child safety lock there you can try that right there bring it down okay all right can we turn this thing around no okay so here it goes okay it's child lock you got a pull back that's how it opens okay so you pulled the back with the lever with the front gear now I think that was like kind of a kind of a genius idea you know I was on the show like these like yeah this is childproof like how did you make a bad child loop and I'm like I literally couldn't open it and it just went pow and I was like oh my god is this so amazing so there you go but this year we'll actually see oh that the odor in and then it's child proof at the same time up to maybe like age 13 depending on the IQ level I think Oh anyway I don't know this will solve your problem right there you can have that just take it home and play with it now you actually got a bet you got something you were just gnarling I think we're ready to pull your own hair yeah so yeah I think it's it's a pretty neat product it's kind of smart yeah so it's back and in the front pull it from I'll give you guys I have more detailed demonstration actually here to be sure maybe you might not be able to see it so she actually tried to bite on this thing and you can tell so anyways um normally bags are open up right in the front here but you can't open it so obviously an average kid may not figure it out but you know depending on their IQ level so you have to pull the back here okay with the front and then it opens up that way and you reach back into the front here okay so there you guys have it this is a EEP AK flexible

just an old diving [Music] what thanks Bonnie that's enough low-grade red to get me home at least ah see Simon what we both got something we needed oh boy", "CYRpuIf_zCw": "hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today however we are not going to be reviewing a product we are going to be doing an experiment we're going to be experimenting to see whether or not eating an edible on an empty stomach can enhance your high so I went to the dispensary and picked up two of my favorite edibles on the dark sneakers bars by mcclenney confections and what we're gonna do is on the first video I'm going to consume this dark Snickers bar here and it has been roughly 15 hours since I've had any food in my body so I'm gonna eat this entire thing and then not in any food after to see if my high is enhanced from eating this on I can't entirely empty seven then on the second video I'm going to eat the other dark Snickers bar right after consuming a too big meal and to see if that affects the high as well to see if I'm not quite as high as from the first dark sneakers on an empty stomach so this will be a series of two videos again first one empty stomach second one on a full stomach to see if the high is in hits or if it is detracted from an empty or full stomach alright so let's go ahead and open up this dark Snickers bar here eat it up and come back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling after you eating this whole thing on an empty stomach if you've not seen my review of the dark Snickers bar you suggest you go check it out I love this product it only costs seven dollars at my dispensary it's a 200 milligram edible and it tastes delicious and it gets you pretty [ __ ] up YUM I do love that candy bar okay and so with that guys I'm gonna finish this off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how we're feeling after eating this whole thing on a completely empty stomach you see if it's gonna hit me harder or not and then on the next video we'll eat this one on the full stomach and let you know if it's hitting less harder or not so with that I will see you guys in two hours to go to the next level of this experiment thank you so much for watching wheats we'll see you soon hello everyone welcome back two weeks it's been two hours here since I had this dark Snickers bar and I'm not a hundred percent sure I would say that I'm more high than I was if I had eaten this on a full stomach or with any food don't feel more high I think then when I have had the dark sneakers in the past on an empty stomach or on a full stomach or you know having eaten recently but it's hard to say for exact sure for exactly sure until I do my next experiment which will be my next video where I will be eating one of these immediately after eating a huge meal to see if I feel less high than I do now but it seems like eating on an empty stomach does not necessarily increase your high but I'm not sure if eating on a full stomach will decrease your high or not for that one what to check out the next video and thank you so much for watching wheat skies but for now I'm gonna say eating on an empty stomach does not enhance your high thank you so much for watching wheats guys we'll see you on the next video hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "wYX_zhlTDr8": "you tried these new berries and cream starburst pardon me what could have stopped busters you just say very Larry's better than what else and cream Oh berries and cream berries and creams I'm a little out of those berries and cream there is a grave there is a pretty mom with a lot of those berries cream [Music]", "_pg1lPaeQaA": "in your words tell me about the very basic difference of ingesting marijuana via and edible versus smoking or vaporizing it sure so so the first thing is your body deals with cannabis very differently when it's ingested it if you're eating something it's actually processed by the GI tract and processed by the liver it changes from Delta 9 THC to hydroxy 11 which is more potent and the biggest thing is that takes time right we when we drink wine with a meal we don't get drunk like that right we let it kind of prickly and enjoy the experience so edibles are very similar when consumed there's other uptake or delivery systems right your oral mucosa is a very efficient delivery system our mints for example are dissolved in the mouth or tinctures right go under the tongue those are quicker one of the hardest things about edibles is the delay and getting consumers to understand that you have to be patient we are not a patient people so there is a learning curve there right education we have to talk about it we have to talk to tourists we have to be able to have a dialogue and not be afraid to ask questions especially because if we do have history with marijuana maybe smoking marijuana it's kind of an instant gratification thing we know if we're at a six or even an eighth about five minutes in edibles it can be anywhere from what an hour maybe sometimes more than two yeah so the the state language is this will this product may be delayed by two or more hours what we see is depending on the product type really you're looking at 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on a lot of things right are you eating an edible and then putting a meal right on top of that that will get the THC into your system much faster than if you eat a meal and then take something that is a slower process the state changed some of its regulations regarding labeling just earlier this year on February 1st and and and part of that was being more explicit about this could take more than two hours but I know before you guys were before that regulation took place the Dixie had some really creative activation illustration on the back of its products and and I'm wondering have you guys tweaked those since the states regulations have kind of caught up with you guys on that level yeah you know we always continue to tweak those as we get feedback on on how long products are taking to affect someone we will adjust our barometer right it's a strength time scale and one of the things we believe really strongly is we can have a whole paragraph of warnings that no one's going to read or we can make a visual icon that someone's going to see and get information from quicker so when we say that a serving size is 7 milligrams or 10 milligrams and we'll take 60 minutes that is a easier way for a consumer to understand faster what they need to do and and everything we do on our labels as much as possible is to get consumers to understand how to take that product and how to dose that product", "Sts_DMj4IGU": "what of your db2 saucy back at it with another one today we're gonna be my bad I just woke up cold sick that up yeah today we gonna we're gonna be doing a review on Stoney Pat's edibles if you see it say I don't know if it's gonna focus but they say extra strength 300 milligrams 350 milligrams just starting packs Oh sour patch kids 350 milligrams usually just the packaging got these from the homie he said I can go ahead and have him up the plug when I had shot me these when I was picking me it looked just like a regular shower packs kits - the sour stuff you don't really look sour they kind of masked honestly they gross y'all gonna eat this you also have something to drink because you probably don't need it don't know if a so it tastes like dirt we are not even good we just won garbage it flavor like of three out of ten you come with a decent amount up in here still command like this meaningless just probably like 10 y'all about 10 of these left but it tastes super like tree it's not good after I finish these I'm gonna get back to y'all like an hour I'll let y'all know what it did if you did anything telling you right now they're nasty look I'm gonna go ahead and finish the recipes get back to y'all in like an hour let y'all know what it is if you did anything I have a high tolerance so sometimes edibles don't even do that honestly it's like 6:30 in the morning oh I'm talking low everybody's still sleep where these things are disgusting I'm gonna get back to you on the Alberto alright y'all so we back hour later and I feel nothing not high it was garbage wasting my time it tastes like we but no effects I don't know if my toddler and something cold but I feel nothing maybe my hair fell maybe my head feels heavy but I don't know that's just cuz I'm tired just looks early as [ __ ] in the morning so far so far these I know good the one that we're doing anything with them garbage Josh don't they still money if you got a hard taco don't waste your money bro please don't that's it negative reviews for me buddy negative reviews from me better just smoke some trizzie something I do don't fit around that something right now I'll see what time it is trade time on the road some get faded so yeah like I said edibles it's not the boom don't I am my review I got to get an F I'm not any higher than I was never buy those again please don't waste your money", "ItS53Ve80Rw": "I just can't help it I'm such a masochist after three unsuccessful tries with the vile candy line I bought three more I'm just gonna knock these out gummy chicken feet we're terrible gummy fried eggs were awful yummy turtles were bad but now we're going to have a little look at gummy tropical frogs maybe it's gonna be good doubt it also well what really prompted this was that I thought I would give a little bit of an attempt at these sour offerings bye-bye dough thus our triple bears interesting and thus our watermelon slices these retail like a dollar a bag it wasn't really a big investment I thought maybe they really messed up on their treats that are non sour and the sours are going to be okay but I'm just gonna do all these together because I don't have very high expectations the ingredients list looks just about the same on all these probably just wouldn't have it souring agent that's probably low quality or that's well weird it's probably just going to be unusual because if I Dow is among all the candy brands that I've reviewed so far they've thrown me some curveballs of some I mean just some elements that don't even seem like foodstuffs so I'm gonna get this one out of the way first packaging is highly regarded by me I like it I like these frogs now once again in kind of the Donkey Kong Country style of the 3d artwork especially like that little guy just crouching on a lily bed and it looks looks pretty good to me you look like you're having a good time packaging is a great color I especially do love the color scheme of aquas and greens so it's a it looks quite beautiful in these splashes of blue and red it's it's really well done and in the back once again nothing to speak of but what's going to embed itself in my nostril cavities let's find out it's totally different I'm getting a bubblegum aroma sort of like those cheap old-style powdery covered pink Bubblegum's from the baseball card packs mixed with a heady truck heady fruity aroma so not so bad really this is um this is quite a surprise there's a number of different colors of throbs in here and they all seem to do they all do seem to have that same by dhow consistency this one's got some blue legs actually just about every color of the rainbow on this one frog is representing I don't know if each component of the products going to taste different depending on the color but I'm just gonna go ahead and begin by eating this pink foot tastes like ice cream from the ice cream truck the blue foot actually go over yellow in there too yeah it's got that mmm that's kind of an uncanny ice cream taste once again we have similar to the turtles also jelly-like consistency making up the back of this frog like a jam tart I'm actually pretty tired I'm not an aggressive targets but it's they're mingling with this base flavor which is pleasantly fruity so good combination um I have defaulted a few times back to the sour sweet sour twins which is marketed by every other it is but it's got the on the package the two twins ones the evil and ones friendly and that they're molting together this sweet sour combo is appealing to me and these sour frogs have an element of that going on I'm gonna eat this other problem to find out if all the legs are uniformly no if all the base flavors are uniformly the same it seems to me that they are base flavoring this one is actually pretty good texture is nice it's not overly pillowy like some of the others which it's um got just enough tooth in there to give it a familiar gumminess although a little on the soft side and then the jelly alone easily removed from the back of the Frog ooh wonder how many trouble its I just ate you know we're living in there yeah unusual the way they've done this with the geli back these turtles and frogs the jelly flavor kind of well harder than I would have expected and not bad works not too good on its own but in concert with the fraud material making up the bottom of the frog just me too bad it does have a little bit of sweet or sour combination going on overall but this wasn't branded by Dale I mean I was trying this for the first time out saying I like it so that's their 1 for 4 hmm well one out of four has been good well these are actually pretty good I'm going to buy the entire bag and I'm pleased by them this is a frog that's really well done you can see the way that they structure their product they've got a pretty good design going on an unusual element so I would recommend the frogs if you're going to try buy Dell product that's not explicitly marketed it's our unusual you can see some cracking developing like some the confection itself you can see how it's just got this appearance of like barren thirsty earth colorful exciting vibrant fruity good tropical frogs pecking looks good I'm gonna give this one high marks let's move forward sour watermelon slices watermelons a hard one to land if you take off on that watermelon trick you are not often going to come back with something pleasing to my palate at least but these sour triple bears I'm intrigued by it I think these might be okay so actually I don't know what to expect so sour watermelon slices are one begin packing things pretty good workable unique the shape of the treat itself looks interesting I I'm pleased by this they've done a simple design but I think it's very effective and their characteristic style just basically the expiration date on the back and some alright already already we're in hmm another kind of a gum smell I think that something in the bubble gums of the American marketplace shelf is also in these it smells like I'm smelling a pack of modern bubble gum mmm that watermelon aroma is off-putting nothing about watermelon our official water Mountain flavor is good it's not good to me it's not good to you not good at all but I like this shape triangle it's very good Oh some tooth in there mmm much firmer than all the other vital treats I've tried which is a good thing to give this a fair shake well I did try Haribo happy Cola remember that be Cola was not something I really would have expected that I liked but coming away from the review I'm now fond of it I've not bought it again I admit but they did something unusual groundbreaking and it turned out to be successful against all of my wishes against all of my I like it I like it deserted - what's going on what universe have we entered into I never would have thought this is going opposite how I thought I was going to feel about this treat I came into it wanting to dislike these sour watermelon slices but I like them I'm not particularly hungry I don't feel like it's being skewed in any way my legitimate sensation is it has a blast of sourness that's there it's just prickly enough it's also got and who would you know sour up watermelon what a unique idea in itself that it is textures good I'm especially turned off by this just this soft texture of these video treats traditionally but these strong wholesome treats with a little bit of tooth are really doing it for me and I like this I need to try one more and then clear my palate but so far I think that this is just unusual enough to be worth your while so I'm gonna eat this whole yo sour the taste would probably turn off some people there is kind of a hmm a sharpness looking around now but it mixes with just enough sweetness it's just enough off kilter yeah now I'm finding something buried hmm it almost has a is it the rind I don't know some unusual savoriness in there just peeking through of course it doesn't taste like watermelon but mm-hmm it's a puzzler it's ending on this almost not red licorice but it's something on this note and I will associate with the treat that have the characteristics of red licorice those being steady base flavors lacking any sparkling acidity just a loping you know steady path take the path take the dose you might come out smiling yeah okay these bears I'm not so pleased with their countenances I know what they're up to they look like unsavory types they look shady to me they're smiling they're smiling what are they smiling about just act like three different colors in each bear believe the camera is probably not picking it up but this is a deep indigo okay the aroma I'm getting if you've ever tried them they're called strawberry puffs or something but it's these sugary coated pillowy strawberry bites it's kind of smells like that it's a little bit of an added nuance of and definitely kind of a scratchy acidity and we've got the green pink white bear not really any well no face I suppose is what I mean there's there's no indication of a bear face just a flat nothing let's try this one first once again a good amount chewiness um substantial gummy it's not overly yielding a strange interplay of flavors much more of a mmm well a sparkling sourness was what we begin with this bear had a more direct like a lance of sour flavor it's ending now on a sweet kind of a green apple not as uncomfortable as some of the green apples I've had in the last few weeks it's probably about the best you can do utilizing that stock of green apple flavor and I think that they almost got away with it really wasn't too bad and what we did go on quite a journey there that bear first began with a an exciting almost a tantalizing amount of sourness which come on accustomed to and transitioned into kind of this sweet green apple too bad who would have thunk and now we have a yellow pink white bear let's see what he's like listen citrusy but you have more aggresively I love that there actually have the consistency of gummy bears now I mean I had totally pigeon-holed them into being novelties I mean the chicken feet the fried eggs were terrible Turtles are marginally better still I would never have even fathomed that I would be giving these treats a good review let alone thinking that in some indeterminate future I would buy another bag of one of them that one ended on a really well-done flavor it came to think that maybe my pal is just really responding to this sweet sour interplay which I really do like and then that one kind of blended swirled it felt like it was draining into a really harmonious sort of a citrusy orangie flavor so really actually surprising to me that it ended on such a good note I'm looking forward to more and now we've got like a pink slash red and white one and then maybe there's even another one in there that's that's like orange so Wow hmm this one's a little bland err flavors a little more hidden definitely strawberry actually tastes pretty good not a low quality stock fake strawberry flavor I'm actually was pretty good in the yellow I don't know if the last one I ate was orange or yellow so I'm just gonna go with this yellow these are great just to be certain not eating this orange I'm gonna have this one one two wow I was at the register I was thinking do I subject my audience to this you do I subject myself to this do I buy more buy dog treats do I perpetuate this market place filled with novelties pure novelties executed so poorly and then I'm throwing them in the waste bin I am totally shocked I liked every one of these treats I think the sour triple bears for the quality of the flavor was the best because those flavors really rounded out and developed into something that was exciting and stimulating in every case it tastes good the sour watermelon took me on a journey I'm gonna get more familiar with them I'm gonna need more of them and I'm going to see a heart feel about them but as an initial pret impression they were unusual they were novel in all the best ways and gave me a delightful surprise and then the frogs were spectacular too so well not quite as good as the sour triple bears but four of idolatry I mean an incredibly spectacular so I have done a full turnabout I mean am I going to get a terrible treat that tastes terrible tomorrow we remember how we I felt about those raspberries or the the blackberries the raspberry and Blackberry Haribo back I thought you're a book you do no wrong I thought Arabo was it the be all the end all and I thought that I was the worst of the worst what type of world are we entered into here together well thanks for tuning in", "UFZyDK4w884": "yeah I think the guy who drew the artwork for these games used to work for Walt Disney so not surprised Reagan's lair play as the heroic Dirk the daring the valiant knight on a rescue to the fairway from the clutches of evil great Prince's name is Daphne and we learned how to pronounce that name last night [Music] all right [Music] yeah we need a substance Eddington Oh close like a drawing time oh yo fresh we'll watch the intro this this is the art original arcade intro when the cabinet was idle Dragon's Lair look bad as the adventure will you become a valiant light on a quest to rescue the fair princess from the clutches of an evil dragon you control the actions of a daring adventurer finding his way through the castle of a dark wizard I love the staticky noise on the screen to make VHS 83 baby so the thing about drink is lair is you guys have to understand when you walk into an arcade and you're surrounded by games like Tetris Galaga [ __ ] pac-man space invaders okay a guerra like that and then all of a sudden you see this machine that literally has a [ __ ] cartoon plane and you control the character it was mind-blowing it was like how could they possibly do this in that time in 1983 this machine was like this game was like so ahead of its time you just didn't comprehend in right it was kind of like the equivalent of when when what's it called Donkey Kong [Music] but Donkey Kong Country first came though for the Super Nintendo yeah I see what you're saying calls and you know they had all this pre-rendered [ __ ] so it was really clever what they did with this of course it's all cutscenes that's how I worked around it but back in the arcade days like this machine was [ __ ] expensive for me I think around the time where everything was like 25 to 50 cents this machine was like a dollar so when I was a kid I did not have the ball to play this game and it looked [ __ ] hard I saw all the adults play it I didn't know what the hell they were doing because I'm just watching it and like mesmerized and not understanding like what the controls because there's nothing on the screen that tells you what to do and they're just controlling the cutscenes so I thought it was like mind boggling and I didn't understand how like different capture scenes worked like that back then so it was it was [ __ ] madness bro so yeah like this these games laserdisc games or art are really really sick ok see if I can fix the video sighs my cat will just fullscreen it it's not a big deal you the research I think Enzo put it too put it - what's a coal hey we'll just fullscreen this [ __ ] we'll just fullscreen like re3 Louise the re3 over there No you it should have a good change all right let's play ok so I was looking at some of the settings and I don't really know which settings we should use definitely should max out the last [ __ ] here's the way to get infinite logic to do that move beeps we'll keep on moved I definitely have on then the original arcade version it showed you nothing on the [ __ ] screen the controls are literally up-down left-right and attack and it's just I guess I'd cancer our cake at with the phone off so the arcade version play the original scene order from the arcade cabinet easy [Music] the homers is the original laser this version of the game third must pass through each scene before I think we should do the home version just so we see all the cutscenes and difficulty easy we'll have more time to react for certain scenes some difficult moves have been removed [Music] we should pipe it on hard and see how that goes oh we should play on the hardest setting first alright alright let's do this you if it's too hard then [ __ ] it we'll play on easy [Music] in the arcade version I haven't even have that scene for something oh I think I [ __ ] I see how spoons press right twice dude in the arcade version it wouldn't tell you anything you just have to know you lose your [ __ ] dollar right there like this game is hard as balls if we match this can I go show you guys there is an arcade version man I'll show you all [ __ ] stupidest to at least a shoal something there but still I think you guys going to see the screen a lot by the way man you're gonna be fast dude who's like Oh [Music] [Music] but his screams are so funny dude no [Music] [Music] I [ __ ] press right oh no Rapids okay how am I supposed to kill the press up here how the [ __ ] would you figure that out oh god okay this is obvious dude you be screaming too if you're in this [ __ ] situation [Applause] okay good let's let's continue thank god this is just scary bro what this whole castle is a Disney [Music] revitalize Daphne that's sound effect [Music] once again I'll have to remind you guys that the original arcade version had no prompts on the [ __ ] screen you literally just had to figure it out and you would go broke trying to beat this [ __ ] English is he stabbed in the back bro you this game is designed to eat your money exactly it was oh [ __ ] holy [ __ ] down [Music] [Music] [Music] and there you can choose different hats too in this game which is really sick but we're playing so we see all the customs Oh God holy [ __ ] oh my god okay that seemed looked impossible like without the prompts you would be dead there's no way do don't get my ass kicked that I do have prompts like I said after this I want to show you guys the original arcade version I want to show you guys how impossible [Music] Oh God oh my god I like ice cream damn it I think that chad has counted how many how many ladies have spent on the game how many times have I [ __ ] up guys 14 dude that's not even enough for a for a [ __ ] apex gun skin I can't even buy anything apex legends with that apex gun skin is $20 oh [ __ ] like sometimes the game has mercy on you and shows you at him man up for days [ __ ] [Music] this sounds e makes or so I thought we just did this [ __ ] oh it's another way to try to trick me dude reusing accents what'd you say oh [ __ ] what'd you say no [Music] Jesus bounce if you actually saw come on [ __ ] I didn't let three times bro if you're in the medieval times and you went down the elevator that's looking faster you [ __ ] your pants oh [ __ ] I remember this [ __ ] I remember people swearing at the arcade arcade cab during this [ __ ] cutscene this is notorious this is cancer [Music] - it was cancer this dude is on my ass slice them holy Kate how are you supposed to figure this out in the arcade I just wanted him five times you're telling me someone figured that out on their own what I didn't see a prompt hold the [ __ ] weapon rack what the [ __ ] fifty dollars deep at this point bro I'd be [ __ ] broke-ass by here and dude I'm talking about one with the swing six times that's GG there's no way to get past that scene oh my god [Music] no not the [ __ ] marbles again slice it Oh God reuse assets Oh hopefully doesn't trick me drink me okay so it requires you to memorize certain scenes and if you have it in the reverse you gotta remember the opposite directions that's crazy Google is over [Music] what whoops dude the time it is so fast [Music] okay oh no not this [ __ ] again [Music] [Music] [Music] what [Music] [Music] this is fine this is the status tree Firefly right now this is fine [Music] [Music] [Music] what what this was supposed to do there [Music] okay that shake hand fall oh [ __ ] what there's a different time guys it was a different time a better time [ __ ] don't weigh all the way back here [ __ ] impossible [Music] [ __ ] it's hard to see the damn arrows because the [ __ ] goal is the same color [Music] [Music] save me the cage is locked was the key the dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon use the magic sword run run nice no come on I pressed it so [ __ ] fast okay it's three swings in a row it's three swings in a row god damn it you guys are understand this is explosively difficult difficult yeah this is this final boss [ __ ] you just the Regal bro yeah this game separates men boys clothes almost [ __ ] up there the damn sword okay three swings [Music] nice [ __ ] the tacky we win no consent they'll consent [Music] so how many tries that take us while technically chinking not changing what am I saying cheating I was gonna say thinking and she at the same time [Music] 29 that's with the arrows that's with the air if I had no arrows would be impossible especially that one scene where you got to swim like five [ __ ] times but it gives you the mood yeah that's what I'm saying that's worth cheating basically 29 death so how much in our case do it be like in the arcades when I played it was like a dollar each and that was back then when games were like 25 cents to 50 cents that's why when I was a kid dude I was I was like way too poor and way too afraid to play this game it looked so insanely hard and it is hard it's basically memorization yeah here I'm gonna show you guys the actual actual arcade machine and I'll show you guys the ridiculousness of it a second I'm good oops Kevin gonna set up for us here the actual actual arcade version - version brain-dead for laserdisc games I got pretty much all of them [Music] you dragons lair of fantasy adventure - a as the actual cancer at least to tell you some stuff on the screen there's nothing on the screen there is nothing on the screen you literally just have to know definitely boys to men this is boys them into the extreme sometimes the screen will give you hints just to show mercy on you and believe it or not there is no pink in you there is no continue you will start from the beginning of the [ __ ] game if you lose all your lives [Music] boys the men I was boys the men honey lives per dollar it's between three and five four it depends on what the arcade owner is sets it to right but it's usually like three lives it's too oh it's too long for me to remember as a kid but like like I said like this kind of game was kind of like it was so pristine back then because like I say you stepped the arcade you see all these [ __ ] games like space invaders and Tetris and pac-man is [ __ ] and then you see this game here like wow like this game is amazing you know it is just so expensive and so difficult right but it was a very amazing game yeah so if you--if you had the game of completely memorized I mean I guess you can show off to people and show them the whole thing but yeah okay uh we're gonna jump ahead now to 1984 we're gonna play time go and then we're gonna bounce back to space ace so let me a sort of time go here you [Music] so I showed you guys a little preview of time go on the Sega Saturn but like I said most laserdisc games the ports of laserdisc games are most of them are pretty bad the only good ones are ones that came I reported to PlayStation 1 or higher or PC but for the most thing you gotta use that emulation you should just do straight image because anything that's poured over two Sega CD or Sega Saturn right is most of it is garbage there are really bad ports how did you play laserdisc games there's a there's a laser the specific laser discs emulate emulator called Daphne you got to use that okay you before we get picture okay good we're good so this is the actual arcade version we're playing right now but it does have on-screen prompts so this is the actual arcade version come on make sure the volume is good for this [Music] start by blasting your ears [Music] so this will be tough because once again I don't think we have continues in this but at least we have on-screen prompts guys it was a different time it was a different time a different time [Music] it was 1984 those 1984 guys [Music] Oh [ __ ] it was an action but he knows an action button

definitely on arcade cadet our captain or ace there's three difficulty settings I mean we already know what we're gonna pick [Music] there we go there's worship oh I love the music already oh [ __ ] [Music] energize their Rashid Oh ah [Music] I like how you still I was like when he's the kid he's like still like super hardcore you know [Music] holy [ __ ] look at the sequence aha boy is here [Music] [Music] I thought money was ease [Music] No [Music] dude I have a fraction of a second in confession get ready and ready what you want to hold it down or something I think at the hold it down or there might be another button that I don't know about what the [ __ ] I'm gonna mash it [Music] what okay it must be a different key or something left am i pressing left's you got you guys see a left arrow I just see energized that's all I see cuz the left is lining up oh maybe you're right no don't know I don't see you left I just see the gun that's it maybe it's a different key we don't know about athos spacebar though because it's left on the animation oh right it didn't tell us though that's odd maybe the game [ __ ] up there and it gave us the wrong command yeah we'll just remember that for next time good I though it seems like every time it says energized we can't use the gun if maybe it's like only if we have it we can skip a cutscene yeah because I didn't use it I just press it up instead there it's hard for me to read the chat score very hard OC house really use my gun there [Music] Oh Wow and it has a different button maybe if control I'm going to guess this controller okay so if it just shows the gun its spacebar and if it says energized I think it's control I press spacebar backs and there we go we get lots of the funds control doesn't work I don't know the controls are we can't get further if we don't figure out what the damn control is for this unless we don't fire and it's one of those things again where we have to wear the right lights up okay thanks I was just about to say unless be at the Dodge [Music] you [Music] Wow wait wait holy [ __ ] I can't imagine what the arcade version of this game is like [Music] [Music] [Music] No [Music] just check the PC version guys if you can help you find the controls for the energizer it's not control I try control could be alter something or shared [Music] [Music] nice Jesus this is such a long cutscene look at this this is [ __ ] crazy what's going on Oh No don't timing the game is frozen that's the end like this you you die Gigi you you see vertices kind of bugged we always have the original arcade version would you like to exit no continue you and inserts coin it's not a [ __ ] arcade port I see the pause symbol that just brings up the options I think it's [ __ ] guys you guys find out what the other control was No Oh No there's that tons of controls [Music] / let me try relaunching again real quick just in case if it doesn't work then we could try the arcade version but it would be impossible it would be virtually impossible without knowing the directions because you [ __ ] impossible [Music] Oh Oh you could continue maybe this will work where is the same this is yeah this is seen before see if it goes further yeah this week this scene is so [ __ ] long I couldn't imagine spending a dollar on this [ __ ] [Music] please work it's thought it's actually [ __ ] dude no this port sucks what should we do what should we do there's a million parts of this game though I'm sure I can find another port or another stream a mill there's a million ports of this game ok we'll try one more time on a new on a fresh thing and we'll see what happens if it doesn't work then we can try the arcade roll Avenger what you're glad come out though you guys are breaking the rules without rules here you guys now that we've played one laser at this game you guys want to play them all can't do that in the 90s see a 90 then you guys got asked me to play mad dog and then Johnny Rock you can play all that in one stream no can't we can't just indulge in a single stream like that guys there's rules that's trying to game I put the move beeps on this time we change the difficulty maybe you think that won't make a difference [Music] I was just gonna say both of those oh okay whatever will I'll put it the captaincy it makes a difference so you said slash for energized [Music] now I didn't do anything we do not know what the energized button is [Music] master ik nice [Music] how the hell my people say that key [Music] aha boys here [Music] you [Music] then um have my

you're posting we don't know the energized button this get hit up you guys did forgot the button yet why don't you ever energize because we do not know what the key it is and the chats trying to figure it out we do not know what he is there's a PC port some boards are saying hit any button the energized pops up I'll bet it does [ __ ] [Music] okay here comes the glitch glitch cutscene [Music] [Music] nice [Music] oh it continued no not the [ __ ] energized key is I don't know where to go they just use they just suicide on me yes they sent me back the Street Fighter 5 he beat it [Music] oh

these and I'm going to come back on roughly and then I was time when the star when the effects stop taking obviously I look a little bit tired as its first thing in the morning guys so I'm really looking forward to these these chuckles yeah so we're looking at 20 calories per serving so I guess a serving is a sweet though so yeah but I don't really care about that ingredients are calories oil

comment how much it's going to take you guys to really feel their backs [Music] mm-hmm best for second as the 721 so they got a long a lot of date or love so much sugar in the morning man mmm-hmm I feel like feeling like I'm rushing off the sugar more than here people I'm getting a [ __ ] a bit of a sugar rush [ __ ] going on here my god the things I do to experiment knowing the things I do for this channel then you guys like that boy [Music] someone that guys when I meet my sweet hope you having a good day you been lucky enough to try any of this or anything like that stick in the comments again really into a interested to know what other people's experiences on with them - I mean I'm nailing with vegetables now obviously I do need a slightly higher dosage in mouth but I know also to take a little bit too much whew you can go the other way so you have got be careful [Music] sugaring the more advanced hearsay yeah too much so yeah to explain from last last night's live Bob snake we've got Lana here and we've got ninja here a little robbing in the room basically so my son's in Greece so just to move around a bit of a family night where a few drinks got on the live last night but that's why they're here in this review obviously off screen but yeah they're in the studio like they're in studio oh I mean I can't really normally eat that makes through that then one go but again it's an experiment do like sweets but I just have a couple normalling yeah and then I give it to the girls but not the sweets last one here oh if we should look at that one it's ridiculous to my sugar I need the pack we're gonna have to have as well what can I say guys Silurian sweets at bloody hour past 10:00 in the morning 114 [ __ ] years old but it's for a good cause Bottoms Up boy bottoms up let's see how interesting this get Sam lots of sugar and now secrets of use got every last bit [ __ ] right mmm well gotta say they went that pretty easy although I do feel like I'm having a real mud sugar rush right now won't run smoothly my sugar on them it seems to be more sugar on them but whether that's where the THC is whether it's infuse sugar or if you sweets I don't know I don't know how to make so some people will accuse the sweets as well as the sugar and some people would just put sugar on it so I don't know I don't know animate I will do once I come up on that because I do really really feel it then it's probably all the way through it I would say yeah as I say I need a dose I need a dose so you have four milligrams Bob's up got sugar all by my side by that guy's normal you see smoking videos to me but you've seen any in video me but I'll say it's a good good cause but suppose if you don't need a lot and you had a pack of those and they're like 50 milligrams a sweet you could probably carry them about stab a couple of sweets at a time and just sort of go along your day we as a nice do it mean put in a hundred milligrams into your body every couple of hours or something like that just gives you that little bit of pain relief and stuff like that I bet so good from that point of view that their portions you don't mean I like the fact they are portion in a way so you can do that I'm still I'm mad I just eat all of them all it won't go basically right long time guys so still on the black cheese but I'm still loving life guys 1190 so please join me peace wonder have a bomb and we'll all get along it's one of those I'll be back in roughly about an hour's time and I'll stick the camera on and I'll do another 10 15 minutes with a

probably anywhere between 12 and 17 percent I said to have a hazy aura that in cost the body and mind said to be incredibly relaxing and calming and reported the last four hours of the exact sativa

smoke too much an afternoon unless you are looking for some serious couch time I haven't tried afternoon's light hasn't come around me um from what I understand is that even though it's pretty popular in the Netherlands it's not it's not readily available in America so if you can't find it I probably say try it know if it comes around I'm going to try it even though it's not call it a high THC strength know if you tried it even come in the comment section you know I did for you I'm Tula Mori just a certified pothead thanks for liking the share", "kVI6X3fVnQY": "hey guys this is girl hermes welcome back to my channel says today we is getting lit if you are not 21 over please click off this video but today you guys i'm going to be eating some edibles so i decided to copy stoney gummies but i actually had these before but honestly just one like tab is it is enough to get you you know buzz or feel high but i'm gonna have more today okay i have it in watermelon i have it in papaya and i have it in cherry lime so these are all of the different flavors you know what i'm saying and this is how they look like so it comes with five gummies it comes with five gummies and it's extra strength 350 milligrams of thc so i'm guessing that the whole entire package is 350 milligrams my friend gave me one tab before and i just felt a little high i don't know i don't know you know what i'm saying but i'm only gonna have two today so i'm going to pick two two gummies that i want i'm gonna have two of those i'm also gonna have these nugs so these are medicated chocolate cookies and cream nugs you know what i'm saying so we'll see how these look like once i open them so i'm going to pick two of these i'm just going to pick two random ones and those are the two ones those are the two i'm going to try for you guys all right so i have these two in my hands so let's see what they are this is the cherry lime and this is the papaya i love you want to try the watermelon but it's cool it's cool so i'm gonna try the papaya first y'all my hardest raisin a little bit because every time every time i eat edibles y'all it literally don't work for me i either don't feel i either don't feel nothing either i stepped through it whatever the case may be i've never like had a full-blown high off of it edible but anyways this is the papaya it looks orange it's orange and like i said before these are little tabs i do not suggest consuming this whole entire thing y'all but 350 milligrams isn't a lot for me you know what i'm saying so it all depends on your tolerance we'll start off with start off with one and then move on so we rip one off this is the papaya one so let's try that it's currently 6 37 and yeah it usually takes an hour or so for edibles to kick in way longer than smoking you know i'm saying way longer time than actually hitting a joint so there we go and you just gotta suck that bad boy out you know what i'm saying so this is i don't know how many milligrams in here but not bad at all no wheat smell no we taste no saying very discreet if you're trying to be discreet so no issues with that now i have the cherry lime one i want to take that i'm so scared i'm looking getting scared i don't know if i should just have one of these and then one of the nugs all right how about this i'm gonna have two of these right and then in an hour at 7 30 i'm going to see how i feel i don't feel like you know super lit then i'll take the i'll take the nugs as well so i'm gonna take another cherry or should i just try the nugs right now right all right i'm just gonna try the nuts instead the the nuggets then but with the nugs you guys this is 450 milligrams you know what i'm saying 450. it's definitely higher than the sony gummies so i might not even need another stone yummy i might take notes for me don't i might take another stoney gummy depending on how i feel so these are just chocolate bars in here i thought it was going to be those nugs that are chocolate but it looks like weed you know what i'm saying that's what i thought those were going to be but i guess not but anyways these are some pretty it's like a pr it's like a cube it's like a chocolate cube and this is cookies and cream cookies and cream is my favorite if you did not know because in korean my favorite chocolate bar it's one of my favorite chocolate bars and yeah so let's give this a try don't smell like weed i don't think it's that good it has it tastes like cookies and cream but it has a like an aftertaste to it it tastes a little like it tastes a little spoiled you know what i'm saying i don't know so with the nugs you get six you get six chocolate um bars and these have and there's different flavors of these also so i got cookies and cream and yeah you guys it's kind of sexy it's currently 6 40 and i'm going to come back in an hour or so to other you guys so stay tuned you know i'm saying all right so i was pretty comfy in my bed as you guys can see but i don't care about the setup right now but anyways you guys it is one hour later you know what i'm saying where's my phone right there it is one hour later and it is 7 38 you know i was saying i took the idols around an hour ago and i honestly don't feel anything like i don't feel abuzz i don't feel slightly nothing so so with that being said i'm going to try the other one of the gummy sony gummies i'm going to try the cherry lime one now since i don't feel much at all i'm going to try the cherry lime one now and yeah the 75 milligrams per chocolate bar and with the gummies it's 70 milligrams per gummy so i've had i have one stony gummy i'm about to have another one so that's 140 plus the 75 that's 270 milligrams yeah i don't think that's much for me so i'm going to take another one i'm about to take another another tab this is not good cherry lime but anyways you guys it's 7 42 now i'm about to wait another hour and another hour i'll be right back if i still don't feel nothing i'm gonna have another chocolate bar so let's see y'all by the way i paid 20 a pop for these so i'm pretty sure i could find these cheaper online but i paid 20 a pop for these and for everything but are they worth it i don't know because i don't know because it's like i have to eat a lot for me to feel anything so watching some youtube videos about to go back to that i'll see you guys in a little bit okay honestly i feel a tad bit like i felt have a bit high you know i'm saying but okay um yeah i guess there i guess it's kicking in now it's currently nine o'clock and i took the edible at the last one at seven anyways you guys i'm hungry i'm starving you know i'm saying so i have me some pizza this is my second slice of the day so this is my second slice um i had one slice before um i took the edibles so that's why i feel like it took forever for it to kick in because i had you know i had a meal before i had my edible but it was like two hours before two hours before i even started y'all and i haven't uh you're making me happy so yeah i think that's why let's a lot for the edibles to kick in i gotta go i gotta start going back to my meal prep smoking [ __ ] because now i'm just you know i'm going back to my old habits again i can't be doing that you know what i'm saying says i can't be doing that so so my husband go back to my meal prep because maybe tomorrow i should do it tomorrow tomorrow saturday tomorrow saturday but i want to be filming a door dash vlog for you guys the dag is all the videos as you guys have been seeing have been like pre-recorded since like last week i honestly am filming filling the feeling the edibles i'm not gonna lie like i'll let you guys know at the end of the day at the end of the video if they're worth it or not you know what i'm saying i had two of these i have two of these and i have one of these and i feel high as [ __ ] right now i love jalapenos cheers this is just making me happy but yeah yeah i've been working out damn there every day so proud of me my sister my cousins you know sam we've been working out almost every year and i started doing my yoga again i was doing this challenge just

I'm back with another video today's video is gonna be a edible mukbang and I thought the perfect way to start out an edible mukbang it's with the drinks so I actually have one for Skye and one for myself I'm gonna take the blue Rhys and I'm gonna pour her up the Tigers blood she's like upstairs chilling and she had somebody go like scroll up a blonde you know I'm gonna just start eating all my edibles but just thought I'd introduce these syrups because they don't have a label they just have the flavor on them I got them from a really nice guy the other day he runs a company I think it's called like power nap or something I actually have to get the the name of their company I just know they're not too big online and they're not too big on like anything so he was one of me to try the serum so I think this is a really cool looking syrup so far it doesn't look too liquidy but we'll see when we pour it out I just thought I'd say it like you know before everybody's like what kind of soup is that okay I don't know but looks fire so we're gonna try it out don't want so in senior you okay but take two on that sky look we just came downstairs to like make some food or whatever and like hot that she's seen that whole freaking thing but it's all good blue raspberry here we go for a random guy this guy knows how to [ __ ] package something what the [ __ ] it's childproof possible so far that looks fire at the bottom you can't really see it's so blue we can but you can't just looks thick oh I'm scared to open this back up I can feel it like carbonating a [ __ ] and when I open this back up it's gonna explode I promise you that it's just making me nervous you got to take it slow I don't really use that much I'll use like you know there's a 4 ounce bottle can you see it I'm gonna pour them up I need to stop getting so excited with this [ __ ] I'm gonna pour the whole bottle in here though I'm gonna put all of it in when I can fit it in it's gonna be some of the best stuff I've had so far because every single syrup so far you could taste like a really thick thing or like you taste like weed in your mouth this is really good it's actually really really good I like it a lot how much is left in here literally 1 ounce exactly is left whoa is he getting I didn't wake up you're supposed to mix that up man that wasn't a bad taste I just didn't like that looks like one of those like lava lamps when he makes it around cause it's so syrupy it's like real I think I don't know if they made this way additionally I don't think he made this with dissolute man cuz like that I've had this bottle for a while and usually when you make series of dis wit it like looks like a ring around like the whole bottle like wherever its it's if it's like filled up to here it'll leave a bottle like a ring around the bottle of dishw it like right where it sits like this this didn't do that and it's not mixing like dis will it would normally dissolute would sit at the top of the bottle this is actually really cool I don't know what he made it with I need to find that guy now I need to go find sky and give her hers we should look far I just go upstairs and I'll say I should have put this [ __ ] over some ice he's amazing I mixed up skies by the way where's yours and she already started drinking her rosary these were up the stairs yeah quench your thirst I like that one [ __ ] you I got a bag of goodies here I'm gonna start off with yes actually no this is so heavy on my stomach I actually just ate some pizza so I don't know why I decided to do this after I just ate I don't know but all right so you know what let's start off with something light I got these myths they're Kiva petra minced for petra means compliments of Kiva confections this says they're two point five milligrams each and there's four in here so two points like two two four six a there's like ten milligrams what a minute to use [ __ ] it smells like toothpaste eat them all video because I'm not really a fan of mint but it's interesting that was interesting here's my decrepit bag of goodies and I hold us all the magic in here so I have some three heads company sharks these are gummy sharks 50 milligrams each so there's 500 total in the bag that means it's par like what like 10/10 in there or something I float there's more than ten it looks like a lot more than 10 so prime more than 500 milligrams are there this is also for three heads it says sugar-free butterflies 50 milligrams each so 500 total in the bag sugar-free butterflies that actually really intrigued me what do these taste like sugar free gummies do get a say they smell like ganja's oh man I taste like weed dude knocking on front these look dirty but that's the weed on it I'm gonna eat them all don't try one whips by eight two three four five six there was turning the bags they do it kind of dirty those are that oil oh wow no way I want to like it mm-hmm it's so we dude it's such a weed these are chewy yep I'd really joke yeah sure you just felt like all those amounts to serve us anymore I should go you could live I got two of green ones in a pink very nice I'm sure ate them separately shoot they've different flavors I don't know I feel like at this point they all seems like you don't chew in the butterflies [Music] don't run with these don't really taste like we I can see the weed all over the bag they're good right these I feel like these like don't taste like as much weed but I thought they're gonna get me more [ __ ] up I feel like the other ones were sugar-free and that's why it looks so dirty like the weed because if I didn't have much to stick to like though like the weed and stuff but this has so much sugar just like the we can stick to it all over it everywhere there's like the sneaky ones [ __ ] you up it seems so good like real candy smack you these are really really like the texture is more slimy hip the truth is even more well this is so fun there's 500

tongue these are the truth after I'm done like with most of these nerds I can move on to the baked goods I just don't want to like be eating a [ __ ] brownie and then switch over to the lyrics that's

heads company they have amazing edibles I think no matter what gummy you get it's always gonna be bomb but they have tons they have watermelon ones and they have like a million different baked goods doing like they make them so oh no all these edibles are pretty official actually I had our own edible bacon and that was from blazing edibles but I took a bite of it and like I don't even know what happened to it and then I also had but yeah I also had um some what it was a corn bread and like I don't know it was like a like a banana bread type thing and that was from be healthy and that was another edible that was fire because I got to build mighty little bread loaves and then it came with like this this like churned like whipped edible butter it was so good but I actually kept it in my

time I had these popcorns it's like their flavor didn't [ __ ] and I have like these yellow ones and those were like banana so I'm guessing that there's like a strawberry blueberry digging happening here these aren't yellow these are like a tan so I wouldn't be surprised if they're not just regular popcorns and there's like some type of weird flavor but it always smacks yep with some type of

lungs by smoking so that's the cool thing about it but with that said I will talk to you lovely people later bye yeah", "s27rLgQMaBE": "good evening ladies and gentlemen today I'm going to show you how to make my locally world-famous tricks marshmallow treats what you're gonna need is one bag of marshmallows today I happen to be using strawberry marshmallows you can use the big ones or the small it's the same amount in the packaging it's about 10 ounces and both and you're melting them down completely so it really doesn't matter whether you get the big ones or the small ones I have 100 grams of marijuana butter a big not big nonstick pan a wooden spoon or any type of spoon really a box of tricks you can either use tricks or generic tricks it doesn't matter they I finally tastes the same this is just what I Cap'n to get at the store today and then I get a cupcake tin because this helps me to portion them into twelve servings you could actually portion my edibles into 24 and eat one or I pushing them into twelve and I'll eat half of one okay first what you don't want to do is I actually like to start off by putting a little bit of margarine or butter or a little tiny bit of oil in the bottom of the pan because you're gonna be putting the marshmallows in without any butter in addition to it and that just helps it stop them from sticking to the bottom of the pan [Music] you know what I'm gonna do is I'm going to let these start to get soft a little bit and in about two minutes I'm going to add my butter to it now that the marshmallows have started to get sticky and gooey as you can see what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my butter and just pour it right in [Music] basically gonna want to keep stirring this make sure it's on the really low heat is the last thing you want to do is turn this it's gonna take about five more minutes until it completely becomes a pace at which time is when you will add whatever type of cereal you like to put in this sometimes they use tricks sometimes I use Coco Krispies sometimes I use Apple Jacks sometimes I use just regular Rice Krispies Fruity Pebbles cocoa pebbles they all make really really really good sweet edibles I'll bring this back and it's completely turned into a face the whole process to make these is no more than 50 minutes now that the marshmallows have been cooking for that's been almost five minutes it completely turns into the pace at which time you're gonna want to turn the heat off move it over a burner because the less heat you have the better it is and then you just take a whole box of cereal and boardin pretty simple to be honest you get the picture take it from the pan after you give a good stir making sure it's fairly mixed Trix tends to give you pretty good sized treats good size 12 good sized treats which is really what I like to use these tins just to help accurately make them all about the same size of course you're gonna make sure you want to wash your hands thoroughly before you do this always be safe I'm gonna make 12 treats about that size which time I'll show you when they're all done and while your end result takes about 15 maybe 20 minutes at the most don't they look awesome thanks a lot for watching my videos you guys have a good one", "wKX0mVfsrKo": "hello my old school soulful family chef jeffrey back with another video hey y'all today i'm gonna do a quick video i had nothing to do with birthday month had nothing to do with my favorites but something i wouldn't been wanting to try i want to try a mixed berry cobbler here i've seen these before i've never made them before so here i'm going to give it a try here uh the berries here i got is strawberries blueberries blackberries and raspberries so i see i want to give it a try and see how this will come out so we're going to give it a shot here because i love blackberry cobbler i love blueberry cobbler i love raspberries so we're going to see how it is so i already added my and my sugar to this i've added my my pineapple juice that's the secret of my cobblers if y'all been following me long enough y'all probably have seen me make so many couples so i'm just putting this in here let go and i'll let you know what's in it put my butt in here vanilla and this is my cobbler pot y'all a little vanilla here y'all been following me long enough when i make this when i bring this pot out it means it's cobbler nutmeg little cinnamon and i'm gonna put the description of the video here i'm gonna put the recipe in the description of the video y'all and i'm making this just like i do every other couple the same ingredients and everything the only thing i'm changing is the type of fruit it's going to be the same amount as i do with every other every other cobbler so we're going to let this come to a boil like every cobbler once it come to a boil i'm going to tighten it up with some uh cornstarch and then we'll pour it in the pan put the crust on there and we'll have with some cobbler and i do like everything i'll do others i got half the berries in here and i'm gonna leave half and put in there right in directly into the bacon dish that way these berries get mushy i still have some berries that's uh holy shape that's not in actual in the uh in the actual cobbler so we'll be right back once this gets the boiling i'm gonna get my i'm gonna get my dough and gone put the bottom crust into my y'all know i use uh y'all know i don't make potato i don't have time i'm not gonna waste time making pie dough y'all follow me long enough y'all know i use the peel berry rollout crust so easy so simple uh it's a it's a game changer so anyway i'm gonna put the bottom crust in there and i'm gonna come back like in a few minutes and tighten this up with a cornstarch and we'll go from there we'll be right back okay y'all we back here okay y'all i i like for my uh cobbler to come to a complete bar before i add the cornstarch so it doesn't take us too much longer for it to to take effect before they thicken up but you know cornstarch to really get the full activation out of it your liquid needs to be boiling so we're gonna put the cornstarch in here thicken it up see see how quick it got thick if there hadn't been boiling it would have took longer for a little bit more because i'm gonna make it a little extra thicker because i got the frozen berries over here remember that i took some frozen berries and put in here so that that liquid from the frozen berry is going to thin this out a little as is in the oven so let this cook just a second here see how pretty that feeling is and that's why i took some of the frozen berries out y'all and put in there and not in here because see how it broke it up but it did give it a nice pretty color you got the blueberries in here blackberries raspberries and strawberries okay now what i'm gonna do now how quick that was i'm gonna ladle this in here i would pour it but i think i'll make a mess today so i'm gonna take this let me make sure y'all can see what i'm doing here just a little here okay take this and ladle the juice in here y'all make sure you get most of the berries there see that's why i made it so thick because i know when this started cooking and mixing with the other berries it's going to thin out a lot a little bit more and that's it now over here out of the way now all i'm gonna do now i'm gonna put the top crust on here and we'll be ready to put it in the oven the crop crust is very easy very simple move it over here y'all can see and all i did let me hear you you know the recipe is description of the video i took frozen berries pineapple juice butter like every cobbler cinnamon nutmeg vanilla i make the same way every cobbler y'all no difference no matter what fruit i'm using so now all i'm gonna do is just nothing fancy here just put the topping on there like i told people you don't have to be fancy with this just get it on there get it on there any way you can some people try to be fancy with the lattice cut that ain't me that's not me y'all go there we go and you could put it also just cover it up completely with the dough you don't have to make the little strings like i do i just do this kind of give it like my buddy uh jack chaplin you know of uh daddy jax y'all watch his cooking channel like he say i appeal is half the meal i remember that same time he watched his video he said that sometime i appeal is half the meal meaning presentation very important okay now i'm gonna put some butter on here a little butter i had left over i use a little butter y'all see i got some cornbread sitting there i made some homemade butter beans from my neighbor i've already did rest i already did a video on that i didn't show a video but they want some homemade butter beans and and ham hocks today so i made them that with some cornbread about neighbor got seven people seven a family of seven big ol pot of butter beans and ham hawks can't go wrong for that okay now i got the butter on there now i'm gonna sprinkle it with a little sugar a little sugar on there and then that nice crystallization when it come out and that's it i'm gonna put it over 350 degrees by 30 to 35 minutes and this cobbler will be complete and we'll check it out we'll be right back all right y'all we are back here the cobbler is fresh out of the oven and y'all i'm gonna let this thing sit for like three hours i'm never definitely gonna let it set up and cool off so when i do scoop it it's not uh running all over the place a lot of times i do that and people say oh it's too loose too no it's once it cool off believe me it thickens up so i'm gonna come back in about three hours and we're gonna uh taste a little this the rest of this going to my neighbor like i say tonight i'm cooking them some butter beans and ham hawks and cornbread and this dessert is uh old school mixed berry cobbler i'm gonna take a bowl out of this and give them the rest and let them enjoy so anyway uh we'll be back in about about uh three hours we'll check this out and we'll see how good it is we'll be right back okay y'all we back it's been about a couple hours i let this thing kind of set up and cool off now we're going to cut into this thing it makes a big difference when you let it set up see that man look at all that fruit in there it's also easy to eat easier to eat y'all okay now let's try this out see how this tastes here oh wow the berries they work so well together you got you can taste the blackberries coming through i think that's the dominant fruit in it blackberry and then the raspberry the blueberry custardy the blueberries and the strawberries didn't break down but the raspberry and the blackberry definitely breaks down and definitely the dominant uh flavor coming through but it's awesome my neighbors gonna love this cause i'm gonna get a good melon scoop here and i'm gonna let them have it but yeah try this recipe first time i ever did the fort berry cobbler i did every bird cobbler separately but i never did the four berry cobbler so try this out try this recipe and i'm gonna close this recipe out now like i always say please follow me

speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "VEiE_EhsW6Y": "a warning from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "kGoQovjQWZ8": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about one of my favorite brands again we are talking about punch bar punch bar key lime pie this time I've reviewed I believe three punch bar products in the past I've liked them all they're an impressive little package this cost me $12 the dispensary know we're thinking $12 for something so small but as the name suggests it does hit hard and it tastes pretty good too or the ones I have had in the past have I've not had the key lime pie before but I am looking forward to it and hoping it is just as good as the punch bars we have reviewed here on wheats in the past so we opened up we can see a little chart there telling you different 25 milligram breakdowns but of course we're going to ignore that and eat the whole thing and if you've never tuned in to weights before and you don't know how this works what I'm gonna do is I'm going to open this up eat this bad boy or at least a portion of it here in front of the camera for ya and then I'm gonna come back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so the key lime pie is white chocolate which is not my favorite kind of chocolate but you know could still be good has a slightly donor and a lime motor for short you can smell both weed and lime break it apart there ignore all those 25 milligram little break ups you can see it's fancy little printing there this little fist printed right into the chocolate pretty cool just give it a taste that's interesting um not my favorite thing I've tasted from punch bar but it definitely tastes like white chocolate with a hint of lime in it um it's good nobody like my chocolate I do like one so it's uh it's okay oh and there is I take it back there is some actual like a cookie crunch in there as well for the philip for the crust of the pie it's a little bit but you guys pretty much you're gonna know exactly how this tastes imagine white chocolate with a slight lime taste and a slight cookie crunch and also a slight weed taste that's the fudge bar uh uh just trying it here is not the most important part and the most important part is what happens in two hours from now which is when I'm gonna come back to you guys to let you know how we're feeling and hopefully it'll be just like the other punch bars in the past and it'll hit pretty hard and we'll be singing their praises so guys I will see you in two hours to let you know if this punch bar continues on with the positive legacy thanks for watching well we hit the two-hour mark guys and I am pleased to tell you that the punch bar key lime pie does not disappoint it's just a star strong as its brethren love it love punch bar the only problem is they're a little expensive at my dispensary this warrants 12 bucks which probably is a value for a lot of you but for my dispensary runs a little high but it is uh again such a little a nice package it's so small you know for a small thing you would expect you to have a heavy weed taste there is a weak taste it's not overpowering but it's easy to transport easy to get down and it really does hit hard it does so man this might be the last punch bar I do of the 225 milligram variety they have a whole bunch of flavors I don't think I need to do them all for you guys but I even more happy to have done the ones that I have done so far uh yeah so guys punch bar gets the highest seal of approval from us here at wheats thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next review bye hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the

old a 40 year old um I should kids try this at home yes ah [Applause] [Music]", "462zIfmmZIo": "[Music] well no eat skies we are talking t K o edibles again today this is the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and as I said we are talking the fine folks at t KO one of their hundred milligrams today the peanut butter and jelly crispy that's right the peanut butter and jelly crispy from TKO we've reviewed a variety of products from TKO and I think on the whole they're pretty good I've liked them all pretty much they all seem to be as potent as advertised and they usually taste at the bare minimum okay and sometimes even verging on good so I'm not actually sure what makes it a peanut butter and jelly crispy what what the jelly part is or the peanut butter in this don't know but looking forward to try it sounds good to me it sounds like flavorful and good it's a pretty affordable edible only cost me seven bucks in my dispensary as the packaging sort of indicates it's an affordable edible but in this case or than the previous TKO edibles does not mean it's they skimp out on the potency just means that you've got some less than fancy packaging which it's fine with me as long as you know they if they're saving that are passing the savings on to you that's great so let's go ahead and open this up and give you a little taste test then I'll finish it off and I will come back to you guys in two hours or two hours from me just a couple seconds from you guys just to let you know how I'm feeling so here we go open it up there you can smell the peanut butter smell to it for sure it smells a lot like peanut butter let's give it a taste mm I don't know how they do it there is a peanut butter and jelly taste to it what peanut better than jelly but there's definitely that fruity jelly sort of taste to it as well it's good I like it quite a bit this might be my second favorite tasting one behind the s'mores which I had but this one's pretty good I like the cereal like rice krispie treats and this one is not bad so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I will come back to you in two hours to actually let you know how it's feeling and for you it'll just be right after this break thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace hungry YUM got me some munchies um welcome back sweets guys sorry about that it's been two hours since I had the TKO 100 milligram peanut butter and jelly krispies and I gotta say I like it a lot I'm gonna solid five five and a half somewhere like that which is a pretty good value for a seven dollar edible I'm about as high as I you know I'm happy with where I'm with my high and not really wish it was any higher I really like the taste of it too one of the better tasting TKOs just all around a good product for another winner from TKO certainly one of my favorites from them and a surprising potency from just a hundred milligram edible so if you see this one out of the dispensary near you and you're okay with the lower dose edibles do not hesitate to grab the peanut butter and jelly krispies I don't think you'll be upset that you did and guys I'm gonna eat some more of this food I'm really looking forward to that and I will see you on the next review thanks for watching peace", "VpMpblAm-Nc": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time the wonka gummies instead of the wonka uh chocolate bars we looked at not last week i think the week before um anyway lab tested i don't know about that lab tested for quality inconsistency confused with solvent free cannabis distillate [Music] so these are like a black market edible pretty much they have a bunch of different flavors i guess or types of gummies these are peach rings i think um there's some a nice nice government warning for you don't mind my dog complaining um but i like to like i didn't even notice this before but the rainbow finish on it i don't know what exactly that is but it looks fire 500 milligrams no children's california wow if we take a look on the back there's an actual nutrition fact section um no serving size or anything just really all that's in here it's just really just sugar and a tiny bit of saturated fat um not a significant source of vitamin d calcium iron or potassium i was not planning on it ingredients cannabis oil sugar glucose fructose syrup wheat flour malic acid dextrose palm oil citric acid artificial flavor antioxidants sorbic acid dufferin artificial colors um and usually these are um hopefully if you ever get these they will be sealed but even if they are sealed you can kind of tell they've been like tampered with like heat sealed you know what i mean so it's always a risk when you get something like this um it could be very very good but also uh could be very bunk but these ones i got pretty lucky because these ones are actually pretty gas for what they are i saved one of them so we can take a look at it let me take this bad boy out and there we are your basic candy ring and says these are infused but uh you can really really taste it on like the outside so i'm assuming these are sprayed and not infused but if you're looking for a really cheap edible that you're willing to take a chance on i i would recommend these uh it comes with a good amount of them and i i ate a few and i was feeling very nice so they do work depending where you get them but wonkagumi's uh a classic company made into something very frowned upon but oh well i hope you guys enjoyed the video i got a ton of videos like this on my channel if you want to check it out and uh yeah later", "l5CnT3CzYMM": "hi there bugs in my last video i showed you guys how to make can of butter in the magic potter 2.0 machine if you don't know how to make magical butter click up here and i'll show you how in today's video we are going to bake something with it i asked you guys in the comment section what you guys wanted me to bake with it and the number one comment was chocolate chip muffins and i'm totally down for a chocolate chip muffin i love muffins and i'm a basic guy i don't like a lot of crazy like random things like cranberry muffins or anything like that like blueberry muffins chocolate chip muffins that's that's about it so today we're going to turn this can of butter into some chocolate chip muffins i want to give a huge shout out to magical for sponsoring this video and for sending over a magical butter machine to give away i will be giving away a magical butter machine on my instagram page check me out on buds and beards on instagram for your chance to win a magical butter machine thank you so much magical for sending this over and without further ado let's get into making some weedy chocolate chip muffins oh yeah you guys can use cookbook and beards to save 20 off at passionbutter.com okay now let's get into making some weedy muffins there are a few ingredients that you will need to make these cannabis-infused chocolate chip muffins you'll need one and a half sticks of melted can of butter two cups of all-purpose flour two large eggs a half a cup of milk 3 4 cups of granulated sugar 2 teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and lastly 1 cup of chocolate chips let's get to making some muffins the first thing you want to do is preheat your oven to 375 degrees [Music] the first thing we want to do is add all our dry ingredients to the mixer so i'm gonna add the flour the sugar two teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and then we are going to mix that up [Music] once you're done combining your dry ingredients then it's time to add your wet ingredients the first thing i'm going to add is the melted can of butter [Music] the vanilla and the two large eggs and mix those ingredients well [Music] once you've mixed that well you can add your cup of chocolate chips [Music] and our muffin batter is done before we fill our muffin pan with our batter we need to prepare the pan and what better way to prepare it than using more peanut butter i'm going to use a tablespoon of melted can of butter and i'm going to brush that all over each of the muffin tins now that our muffin pan is prepared it is time to add the batter to each of the tins all right we're going to place these in the oven for 20 minutes what just had a thought i think once the muffins are about halfway done baking i'm going to add on top a little bit of sugar and brown sugar just to give it a little bit of extra sweetness we're trying to hide that wheaty taste as much as possible so little sugar topping to it these are our cannabis infused chocolate chip muffins yes i went a little bit ham on the sugar topping but i'm gonna let these cool for about probably 10 minutes and then we'll try one all right you guys i'm back i've been waiting over these muffins waiting on them and i think they're ready i think they're ready i think they're ready okay so i'm so excited i have a nice glass of milk let's get one of these muffins out and try one first things first the can of butter worked really well at acting as a non-stick like type spray because it came out all in one piece like this is the most perfect little [Music] it smells a little weedy i'm not gonna lie when we were baking it it didn't smell at all but like now that it's actually in my hand i can definitely smell the candy butter which is [Music] um it's not the best it doesn't taste the best it's not the best tasting on a scale of one to ten i'd give it probably like a a six it's edible oh my god it looks green [Music] look at that it literally looks like lime green inside of the muffin from the can of butter and the taste is just like it's just so off it has like such a strong wheaty taste but you guys know i'm gonna still eat it so that i can give you guys a report on how did it make me feel i both said from the big bite that i had at first it just kind of felt like a walk on my stomach which is more like how edibles feel when i'm like this is gonna like slam me adding that sugar on top that was a good choice [Music] because there is such an aftertaste to this muffin you were gonna want that sugar it i think it's what it's like saving it like i keep lifting my fingers because like i have the sugar on it and it makes it like slightly better i need some milk gonna go finish my muffin and i'll be back i don't know if i'll have a second muffin or not probably not because like i'm not feeling the taste unless this muffin just like knocks me on my socks and then i might have another one like right now but they're gonna be something i'm gonna have to space out and make myself eat i'm not gonna lie to you guys all right i'll be back in probably like 30 minutes to an hour probably an hour it normally takes about an hour cheers [Music] oh my gosh when i smile ew what gosh no you can't have my muffin no no what the hell all right let's talk it's been like probably 45 minutes and i'm gonna tell you guys what i've never had an edible hit so like hard so fast before ever like ever in my life like these muffins have to be at least probably like [Music] 150 milligrams probably each like these are strong ass muffins um they taste absolutely horrible like no lie this was probably the worst tasting edible that i've had in a while like it was pretty bad like i did not enjoy the taste of it at all the feeling though is amazing like 10 out of 10 recommend for the feeling the only thing that i've ever made that i would recommend more than this would be the sugar cookies that i made at christmas time i think it was last year or the year before those those actually taste pretty good and they were like really effective these taste like crap but they they are really really effective so i'm not mad i'm not bad at all because like at the end of the day this is what we're searching for is like this feeling right here if i'm able to do that with like trim and like a little bit of shake that's amazing because that's just stuff that would have gotten thrown away anyway so thank you guys so much for watching this video if you like it give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know what else you guys want me to make because i still have some peanut butter in this refrigerator over here like we still have three and a half sticks of can of butter over here to make stuff with and we're gonna make stuff with it so let me know what you want let me know what you guys want to see me make out of this canned butter i'm like having problems with my sentences now i'm gonna go check out my instagram page if you guys want to win a magical butter machine you can use cup buds and beards for 20 off at magicalbutter.com and i'll see you guys around for whatever sewing activity or video that i come up with for next time and i hope that like whatever we make is as effective as those muffins and i seriously think that it had something to do with this butter i think that that d-carve box really ensured that i was de-carving that cannabis properly because i feel like my oven was off not that i've made a bunch of edibles in this oven but i bet my other oven was off too and i wasn't de-carving it properly i think that that made all the difference in this butter which made all the difference in those muffins [Music] i'm like out of breath and i slightly have the giggles from the the um the muffin but anyways thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever show activity or video i come up with for next time bye guys [Music] you", "BVeNyeJ2f5s": "direct connection is made by MPT to serve all of our diverse communities and is made possible by the generous support of our members thank you live from Maryland public television this is direct connection with Jeff Salkin welcome to direct connection we are live tonight from the state's largest grower of medical marijuana these plants which it would be illegal to have outside of this building are the beginning of the growing process here at curio wellness joining us is Michael Braun fine curio CEO thanks for having us nice to come in Jeff first question is why am I wearing the bunny suit because this is a plant where we grow raw material to create medicine and so under FDA regimes it has to be hygienic we don't use any type of pesticides insecticides or any other crop control agent except or law of water and fertigation and people may hear this is a noisy environment it's the air purification it's bright LED lights tell me about the business this has been live for over a year now what's happened in that here it's been an exciting time and candidly a lot of time of great learning when you undertake a new disruptive industry you build a theoretical model about what you think it's going to be and then you create an actual operating plan and then you learn you've made plenty of mistakes and I've played it wrong in substance but you had some good ones also and and so we have evolved literally 180 degrees over this first year through a lean management system and some other techniques we use to the point where this is a very well oiled machine now where we're delivering large quantities a product every week with no defects and great customer satisfaction globally we got beyond your company what's happened to medical cannabis in over the last year or two I think it's become more more accepted as a true medicinal product and I think some of the historical negatives or things that people thought they were probably aided by the government with your Falls are starting to clear way so it's kind of dark clouds going away and interestingly the largest cohort of growth for us has been baby boomers and I suspect first of all they probably had some castle experience back in college but more importantly they got a lot of aches and pains and traditional medicines can sometimes be interactive in a way that's not very good and the medicinal cannabis plan is very safe it has very low interaction tolerance so it allows you to use it with many other things at low levels in a very effective way let's explain how the system works in Maryland designed by the legislature there are licenses for growers and retailers essentially and somebody in the middle what what do you have so there are three different licenses there is a cultivation license to grow the plants there is a processing or manufacturing license to create the product that is in some other form you extract the oil from the plant and then you turn it into other pills capsules like and then there's a retail distribution network those are the dispensaries we're fortunate to be one of seven companies that has all three licenses but our primary business is to enable the success of the dispensers across the state by giving them our products on a very regular and consistent basis you're a business guy trail of successful healthcare businesses private equity businesses so you didn't come into this I don't believe as a marijuana expert you've learned something about these plants the things behind us the big ones it looks like a topiary a sort of thing and then we have these little cuttings yes sir these came from that that's correct these are called mother plants we use a cloning process so that we could get the genetics from a particular strain exactly the same from crop the crop plant the plant so we have a proprietary process for picking seeds turning them into the best by winning out the weaker genetics through both growing and testing we have a lab here and then once we get to the prime prop if you will will use one of these mother plants for approximately four months the first thing we do with the new mother is we take cuttings and start creating the new baby that's going to become the next mother because these mothers have a useful life where the quality of the plant is determined by how many cuttings you click that as it gets older they diminish in quality so we focus on measuring certain cannabinoid content and other markers of health and yield and we try to maximize the life of the plant to optimize that yield let me remind our viewers if you have a question about medical cannabis shortly we're going to be talking to the head of the pharmacy the dispensing operation you can send us an email no phone calls tonight but send an email to live questions at mptv.org and we'll try to get your question answered during the program what's your competition like and and how do you do things differently than the rest of the market well one of a very few that are only dedicated to medicinal cannabis we are not in favor of nor do we want adult use because we think Maryland is a place where we can build an ecosystem in an industry that creates exportable intellectual property and products and we'd like to see that happen in fact we've just worked with the legislature on a new bill to allow for academic research here in Maryland and so most of the companies haven't made the investment in the pharmaceutical grade environment and equipment that we've had and they don't have people from big pharma like we have we're working with chemistry and drug discovery and such things there are some very fine companies out there and then there's some companies that really just want to grow cannabis because they think it's a good thing and they think they can make money doing it but they're not dedicated to the investment research and development that we are the trend is moving in the direction as you said of varying degrees of legalization whether recreational becomes law in Maryland at some point or not but federal law has changed Congress passed President signed a bill and I think it was a side item in the bill but it makes CBD and I get that letters mixed up that's correct but it basically legalizes CBD and hemp is that right it legalizes the CBD that's derived from him CBD could come from hemp or it could come from the cannabis plant they're both derivative of an original plant the hemp plant has very very low acid less than 0.03 percent THC the psychoactive agent that's in cannabis in if it were to qualify for his half and so now because of the farm bill which what you're referring to people will be able to on a state-by-state basis decide what level of participation the Hef market they want so they've kind of maybe the state's Rights Act but with a pure go-ahead from the federal government CBD is the stuff that gets all the press lately does it affect your business model if somebody without all of this investment overhead it can grow acres of hemp and refined CBD out of it less expensively potentially yes and no it really doesn't because in our case we could grow at very low costs and in addition we have to have certain levels of purity and we don't know yet if hemp can deliver that because we've never work with it but we know we can get it from cannabis so we now a full flower or hygienic cultivation chambers we call them that's filled with a 18 to 1 CBD to THC ratio plant which we use for our CBD products ultimately I think if it is available and it's pure we'll buy it as a raw material just like we buy other raw materials that we don't create on our own first question in my email how can somebody invest in this industry your privately held but not everybody is there is a about 30 or 40 new newly minted canadian public stocks to which actually trade on american exchanges and so you can pick through one of those one of our local competitors here we happen to think a lot of is a company called GTI they've recently went public so you know there's a lot of companies out there that we think are very good but their public this is a family-owned business we have outside investors but we're going to continue to just build it and grow it and keep it i have a bunch of emails on some of the more technical questions about prescribing so what we're going to do is take a break and we will come back with your clinical director as direct connection continues on MPT got an unused vehicle going nowhere donate it to the one

helping patients making sure that they're getting the right products the right way counsel patients all day long also make sure that we're living up to all of the regulatory requirements that we don't do anything wrong what's the last year they've been like for you it's been a whirlwind it's just unbelievable so our dispensary has been open for about 10 months 11 months now and it's just been fantastic surprise after surprise every day I get up excited to go to work seeing what I'm going to learn let me ask you a slightly skeptical question which is what I do I mean clearly a lot of people are being helped by this but you also read increasingly about people smoking this stuff psychoses impaired driving how do you think about the balance between taking the good stuff and and people maybe not knowing what to do with the dangerous parts so the way that I approach to this is that I want people to be able to use this in a guided way and using it in an unguided way it's much more likely to cause problems than if you're using it guided properly so that plant contains hundreds of bioactive compounds and matching the right ones to the right person with the right condition is how you eliminate or real you know lower the chance of having problems the intermediate step that Michael was talking about between grow these things and sell this stuff which we'll talk about right describe the functionality there how does it work and and how is it evolving it's amazing the way it's evolving and especially the way that we occur you go after it making sure that what we're making is reliable it's repeatable we know it's going to be effective for people more like a pharmaceutical than it is an herb more the science than the art of using this medicine we we mind the research we do some research on our own we put together products that we think are going to be effective we test them alright we haven't we haven't talked about this stuff before but but I'll ask it in terms of the most common complaints that people walk in the door with and and how some of this may be able to help me Payne definitely I can't tell you how many patients I have who are no longer on opioids where they were six months ago a year ago sleep is a big issue a lot of autoimmune diseases things like ms neurological problems like Parkinson's or ALS anxiety all right so what might you yeah a whole variety of products that are available here in all sorts of different forms so this is a container that would actually contain the flour the raw flour that someone would grind down and then either smoke or consume with the vaporizer these are packages for the actual vapes that we have and so this is an oil that someone would attach to a battery and vaporize that there are pre-rolled cannabis products I'm sorry we used to call these joints now they're called free rolls right or there's all sorts of ways to consume the medicine in a different way so this is a tincture that somebody would put underneath their tongue and it would absorb through the mucosa in their mouth there's some advantages to doing it that way one of the things as a pharmacist I love about that is that I can be very very specific with the dosage that I'm giving somebody there are topicals there are all sorts of concoctions that people use viewer writes in and says you mentioned not being completely supportive of recreational abuse can you elaborate on that so as I said I want people and it's funny because I don't even think in terms of adult use versus medical anymore I just think in terms of guided versus unguided and what I want to do is make sure that people are using this medicine in the most appropriate way for them and there could be lots of ways that it may be used inappropriately maybe there's interactions with prescription medicines that they're on maybe the combination of cannabinoids that someone uses isn't really good for someone that has anxiety and so I just want people to use it in a guided way how good is the data that the guidance is based on it gets to this email from a viewer for adults over 50 who need to manage pain are there long-term studies concerning short and long term memory loss so yes there are although I have to say that a lot of the studies don't come from the United States because of the constraints that have been put on cannabis here in the in the United States it's been difficult for institutions to do the kind of studies that we're used to but we can look to Israel we can look to Europe we can look to Canada where they've been doing studies and there are the short-term memory thing is completely manageable if we're using the right combination of medicine and if it were to happen to somebody when they stopped using the medicine that problem has a tendency to go away but I can tell you with 11 months of clinical experience I have not seen that problem how does it work in Maryland the nuts and bolts of it somebody can't just walk in off the street to your office and walk out with something correct so the step one is they have to become registered they do that online they go to the MMC C which is the Maryland medical cannabis commission website click on the button for patients and you upload some information and then you become registered that process right now is taking somewhere between two and four weeks assuming all those things are correct you'll get a 16 digit number that starts with the letter P for patient step two is then to become a certified patient which means you have to go to a prescriber or a recommender who will certify that you are a valid patient for using cannabis once that done then you can go into a dispensary and get medicine there was a pretty liberal definition of who the prescribers can be here right you don't have to be an MD well so you could be an MD you can be a nurse practitioner you could be a podiatrist or a dentist if I if I had that correct they all have to be able to prescribe controlled substances right now so you have to have a c.d.s license to be able to recommend this okay viewer wants to know can medical cabinet cannabis alleviate pain from Lyme disease have you seen Lyman I've had several patients that I can think of right away that have had success with that so it's not necessarily the Lyme that it's treating it's the pain part of that cannabis has shown to be has been shown to be anti-inflammatory very very helpful for pain well let's see the question about him and I asked Michael about this this earlier the federal government basically legalizing CBD through the hemp channel that's on that we use it we sell it to our patients they don't have to be members or registered within the Commission to be able to use it basically you can get it over the counter okay see so you can sell some stuff to people who are not registered that's correct so hemp Durai of CBD doesn't really have THC in it and can be very effective although I'll tell you that clinically most of us feel that CBD with at least a little bit of THC is more effective than CBD by itself okay all those letters confuse me a little bit THC is the stuff that people who are into recreationally that's the that's the one where you can feel some euphoria from where has CBD been tested I mean what do we actually know about it other than it's hot at the moment well it has been tested and we do see results with pain for anxiety for energy helping with sleep if that sleep problem is related more to anxiety and pain muscle relaxation seizures immune function all of those issues or conditions have been shown to be helped by CBD CBD from hemp hemp is sort of like a cousin of cannabis so it supplies the CBD which is another can happen I didn't by the way there's I think they've discovered over a hundred different cannabinoids now and so when you and I have this discussion in a year and then another year we'll we'll know so much more how often do people consult dr. Google before they they come see you in other words how much how much research are our people doing how accurate is the stuff that people find online about these products I'd say the accuracy is about the same as in regular medicine when people consult doctor Google you can find some good information and some bad information that's why people come to us that's why I'd like to see people use it in a guided way and use it that guidance from a health professional who understands biochemistry potential interactions with other medicines that someone might be using I would say that a lot of my patients especially the sort of cannabis naive patients they haven't done any research they've heard about it either from their doctor or from a neighbor they get certified and then they come in and then they rely on us to help educate them what's happening in the medical community so you were a long-term licensed pharmacist do you think the establishment the medical establishment is becoming more favorable not to what degree what do you think what do you see yeah there's sort of three camps out there and there's the ones who are the adopters who understand it who see results with their patients and like it there's that camp that says I'm not sure I don't know about it and then there's a camp that says no you can't use it or you shouldn't use it and so I'd say it's changing and it's it's shifting and probably this shift is most responsible for that shift is patients coming in telling their doctors that they're getting results very good Brian sanderoff curio Wellness thank you for

curio wellness Michael Braun fine is the CEO here how many are standing next to a lovely plant by the way how many how many folks have you hired in starting this up so far we've had 105 people and I'm proud to say that over the course of the first 18 months 18 of them have been promoted from an entry-level job to a mid manager from amid to a higher level and we instituted once we passed over break-even a living wage so our minimum wage in this building is $15 what are most of those folks doing I know there's a big production operation here yes what are most of the jobs like so there's really kind of semi skilled and highly skilled so 70 school would be people that do horticulture preparation pruning planning all the things required to tender to the plants and then the trimming curing and packaging lumber those take various levels the skill sets that we've developed trading programs and best practices around all those on the manufacturing side we have chemists we have pharmacologists we have people who are involved in analytical work and so there's a number of advanced degree people who are doing drug discovery formulation and then we have a manufacturing team who takes the oil that we create they purify they separate it and then they create recipes and we create products where do you think there might be misconceptions among regulators among your fellow business people among members of the public about just what has happened since this might live in Maryland and and what the business is all about I think probably the first misconception is that people don't appreciate the level of quality the maryland program has we have an excellent testing protocol here so the public is getting very safe product no medals no pesticides no contaminants of all and and all of us all the growers in this state have to abide by a very very strict regulatory regime for hygienic quality so we're providing cannabis and cannabis derived products that are highly pure where can people get more information well they can go to our website curie wellness.com they can go to the maryland medical cannabis commissioner by the way we call it cannabis not marijuana it's its proper name so well I say can I say marijuana sometimes so people understand what I'm talking about we're trying to change the conversation that's a lot of part of what our strategy's about it talking about science and facts as opposed to other things so but the the Maryland medical cannabis commission website is also a good spot very good Michael Brown find CEO here thanks for the time thanks for making us sort of look funny and appreciate it thank you for joining us for direct connection we're back Thursday with your money & business and I joined this Friday for state circle and a

my viewers are subscribed which is very depressing so if you like what you see scroll down press the subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time wonka bar edibles uh i had one of these over a year ago um but when i had it it was a bit fatter this way it was a bit wider and it was 500 milligrams instead of 300 and also they didn't have these um flavors it was just the milk chocolate but now there's a bunch of different flavors mostly based around cereal i think there's some like candy based flavors as well this is the captain crunch it says it's basically like a black market edible i don't think these are sold in any dispensaries that from what i've seen warning contains medical marijuana each chocolate bar contains 300 milligrams plus 300 milligram milligrams plus of cannabinoids i got your nutrition facts right there three grams of protein wow um 220 calories serving size one bar i don't know how some people can just eat edibles like that but i they [ __ ] kill me like i i cannot handle edibles very well anyway if we bust this bad boy open i i swear i'm pretty sure the one way back actually had wonka like on the chocolate but i guess i could be wrong because i don't remember it that well but i'm a big fan of this chocolate to be honest um very potent i would say as well for for for a uh black market not extremely legit edible they're very reliable and consistent for what they are so i would definitely recommend them but i would also be very careful unless you are experienced with edibles i guess unless you eat a ton at a time and know where you know what your limits are if you have any limits i know some people that can just eat tons and tons and tons of these things and i feel nothing my dog's complaining in the background what bud i'm making a review one second anyways in conclusion if you're looking uh for you're not trying to spend a crazy amount of money if you're if you're in the realm of uh black market edible then i would definitely recommend these if you're okay with that pretty cheap only about 25 bucks a bar if you're just buying one 25 30 dollars definitely worth it this captain crunch flavor pretty good and i'm not the biggest captain crunch fan so i'm sure the other flavors um are even better so thank you guys for watching i got a bunch of videos like this if you enjoyed it uh drop a sub check out my other videos and yeah later", "H6md_iTZGc4": "hi guys happy Monday its medical Monday with dr. Leslie Apgar today I'm joined with my girls we got Tracy Scott's flower and we've got two vana Austin both from grassroots so everybody waved hi so thanks you guys for coming and hanging out all right now Devon I just met you today I think I might have met you way back when we way back in the summer was my girl Tracy and I go way back and we are so grateful for you guys to come back thank you for having so first Tracy you get to go first tell us how you got to be in this role what is your role at crossroads so I am basically what you would call a relationship its manager which is basically sale if you want to be honest you're the one who tells us I'm the one that oh you're your failure dispensary and help you with your products awesome but I I basically fell into this okay I mean I did this kind of job back in the day sales okay but a friend had told me that they were looking for a person that was good at selling basically and and I went and I talked to him and I was like this is an amazing industry and I'm so passionate about healing and helping you know and that's how it happened I love it yeah about two davana so I started smoking weed in college and I was also following the industry because I thought it was interesting and I decided to write my thesis on the growth of the cannabis industry oh wow and at the same time Maryland's program was getting started so I found Danny Cohen our owner and met with him periodically over the summer after graduation and now I'm here I do marketing and outreach for grassroots so getting hard exactly so you guys may see these people out in the community well again we really appreciate you guys coming by today so let's talk a little bit about what makes grassroots different like why should our patients be purchasing from grassroots over any of the other grows that are out there well first and foremost you know the one thing that I love about this company is its passion for helping and serving me serving my dispensaries us serving the patients and and even our motto is to serve advance and respect them you guys you guys always say that you do we people joining washtech join the movement right right and we have actually been to their grow just beautiful and obviously you guys put your money where your mouth is because we have just received a very large shipment this is RSO for those of you who are wondering it says so right on the container are as Oh which we love that you guys are making that a priority and also making it affordable for the patient yes Aurra so I would say is probably our most medical product out of you know the many that we will have and that we do have now as you know it's helps with cancer tumor so much I mean there's been tons of studies all different ailments and our processor loves making it he says it's fun mm-hmm and I said great because I know they're already so them and Sierra and I have talked about this in the past but are so is really good for patients who are fighting cancer patients who have chronic medical illnesses and planetory disorders so it's got a lot of uses and we're so thrilled that we have a big supply so that we can really help our patients yes we just have to say a heartfelt thank you for doing that and thank you for helping you know that patients know we talked to Matt earlier who was Matt except Matt garbowski who is our head of processing the processing okay in our company though Matt actually gave us some pretty interesting feedback and I wanted to pass that on to our patients who are watching and that is to please respect grassroots RSO because not all RSO is created equal and this is incredibly strong incredibly he doesn't actually expect anybody with any kind of tolerance to be able to tolerate a full syringe daily he wants us to start off just as 1/10 the syringe to begin with and then to work our way up but he's not thinking that we would actually be able to get a full syringe and daily even after a month of trying to increase our tolerance yes I mean I guess it depends on every you know everyone is different every ailment you know every you have to listen to your body and that's you know we always talk about micro dosing right but yeah you know it is so apparently so potent I've never tried it but it's so potent that he wants you to take it easy whereas there might be other products that were less potent or for whatever reason was may different that you can maybe and have a little bit more he also had mentioned that when you ingest rather than this is both edible and smokeable so when you ingest it it's like 10 times more powerful a longer right so it really it's dependent upon that and the way that we ingest it correct or take it in yeah and then also just to clarify that we have two strains we have khaleesi and we have dead cherries and look to him in his estimation there's really essentially no difference between the two and I've looked at these and kind of you know evaluated the terpene profiles they don't look to be any different to me so I think they'll be fairly interchangeable for the patient's yeah it'll be nice okay so that's great information for the patients so yes we have it guys we've got lots of RSO so come and get it that's amazing yes some of the other things that we are carrying that we have in stock because I know we sell out of your stuff a lot I guess we'll start with your favorite this is my favorite a beautiful nightmare it's just a great product I happen to sometimes get heart palpitations when I use a sativa as you lean toward anxiety is that true my friend sometime I have a little anxiety right now that's some time but so I but I like a sativa because I'm and I like birthday and I like right I have a lot to do and this is just a great ride if L it does their main it doesn't upset your hurt no it doesn't it doesn't you might wanna mention about the CBD with that too or no oh yes yes yes because one of the tricks to being able to tolerate this a little bit better is to take CBD as well which we appreciate and the reason why I thought about that at the same time is because sometimes when you do have that that kind of heart-fluttering publication you just you know take a little CBD and it'll that works really well yeah yeah all right here's another real popular crowd-pleaser the Pelle Roja yeah I love that job this is something that sells very well very uplifting and then we have three as your favorite so actually he likes oh you like so Mambo sauce is my favorite so a lot of people like they're really skunky smell or cheesy this one's sweet it's no sweet and so I really enjoy it it burns nice and then what else do we have and then there's sweet D yeah it was named after me my name is Donna I was on that they also did name beautiful nightmare too laughter you just kidding that's just nightmare faceoff is also apparently great for like locations Wow it was just a no it was the pain yeah we're like if you have cramping is that do we talk about Sossamon area painful cramps yeah yeah these patients love the face off for the pain component totally and the one that you're missing is our blue sticker which is our hybrids and some of them lean sativa some of them lean hybrid I mean indica you know but our grower will say there's no such thing our poor patients have heard me talk about that but it's really important to educate the public because you know you see people are maybe not the old for all patients but you know a lot of people are like I need the most THC most THC it's not about the to you it's not it's about the plant and the breakdown all of it and how it's going to be wrong that's correct and it's not just about you know explaining the plant it's about removing that stigma and bringing legitimacy to the industry you know right as part of outreach we speak to anyone who will listen you know we go into hospitals and you know old-age home exactly assess elevating churches temples we try anywhere I'm sit on this conversation right if you show them it's not that scary you know people are curious yeah they know the guy helpful hear about it humans have been using this planet for thousands and thousands of years so now it's just time for the studies to you know watch a street yeah exactly how those of you were watching Dateline last night I know that I'm saying lovely little taste of what's to come so yeah finally we are catching up yeah so and so this is some of the stuff that we have available right now at greenhouse what are some of the things that you guys have in the works for us so actually we just spoke about it today more processing products we have disposable pens that are coming out within a week or two they're called torches they're 500 they are at a nice price point gorgeous it's just you know if you especially for somebody who's not looking to smoke weed but maybe wants to just be able to start off and is new to this type of introduced and we also have chatter coming and waxes and even though you know you wouldn't think that you know somebody who might be older or is is some kind of you know there's a stigma I feel like sure that a lot of people like that a lot of it you know a lot of people like life as well we love libraries and I mean that I like that yeah and it really it can helpful it can help a lot too I really have a medical anodized makes sense to me that you take that whole plant master rs7 exactly higher plan know about everything it gives you every benefit right you know the substrate totally I mean it's just it's a really incredibly we're talking about off camera I used to self-medicate and then I became a patient and it's wild for me to you know know the back stories and know the terpenes and know everything and I'm like oh and might have some crayons or you know whatever it might be and I know that if I take a certain strain it's gonna help me and it does it's pretty and it's wonderful you know your your stomach relaxes you maybe aren't nauseous like it's just amazing fruits balance right it does and it's just wild to me that something like this would have a stigma and we need to be doing community outreach that compared to other but this was filled with oxycontin it would be okay saying and it's just it's crazy it is a little silly yeah you've never heard one person died of an overdose not one nope it's impossible possible but if you take all of this you're gonna be in your areas especially if you eat it because I'll stay in your system for yeah all right well what else did you guys want at the public to know about grassroots is there any last little pearl or anything you want anybody to know well they can always reach out to us if I don't have any questions concerns we are truly here to serve our community and this industry and you guys and we just really believe in this product you're passionate it's not about you know uhyou it's hard to not read things on Facebook it's hard to not be affected by oh this sucks that sucks this is a very young industry right we're there's growing pains but I can promise you from the bottom of our hearts we're in it to help people and make people feel better and you know just how it not be such a not be illegal and I just you know be able to feel better well we have I finger questions we have a question from Blake he wants to know what you guys have thoughts are on oil color you see sometimes an amber color versus good dark which I've seen yeah and what causes the difference in color when processing well I was told and again I'm no chemist by any means okay but what I was told by our head processer Matt garbowski that you know I again I saw him Facebook bleep that there you know somebody said that's not RSO it's too light it's supposed to be tar it's chlorophyll right there's all different processes but Matt believe if he will tell you that it when you put it on something and you rub it out it should be like a golden color it should not be at our it should not be I think those are the impurities quite a yes is that what it is so yeah but I haven't have Reds on and and people just need to be educated right so thanks for the question Blake yeah that's a great question all right guys well I think that about wraps it up for our motivating wasn't that they hardly needed any CBD to get through this just all right guys well thank you so much for joining us you'll see us again next Monday for our next Medical Monday [Music]", "EIWcO3mVdGk": "well how's it going youtube cintron productions here and today we are going to try and review the sour patch kids popsicles yeah yup these are totally real you're seeing them right here yeah you know the sour patch kids candy well those are actually some of my favorite gummy candies because they're really sour and they taste very fruity and sour i really like them but uh there's also these popsicles and believe it or not there's actually a sour patch kids cereal which i have also tried before uh yeah all this is real we're gonna try the popsicles yeah red berry flavored shell with vanilla center and original sour patch kids candy bits inside wait is it blurry i'm sorry okay they're fixed let me read that again red berry flavored shell with vanilla center and original sour patch kids candy bits inside yeah so let's try these bars okay so here's one of the popsicles and i gotta do this real quick because you know they melt yeah let's open it why is it so hard okay so here is a sour patch kids popsicle and as you can see it's red and white i'll get to the white part later much later i promise now like the box said the red part uh it tastes like berries i guess okay now let's try it oh yeah it's very sour just the way i like it now it has some vanilla cream filling inside and that's actually what this is also made of it's vanilla cream now i'll get to that part later but right now let's keep trying this baby oh man oh yeah wait a minute the box said that inside it has bits of candy but i don't see any and i don't feel any either was that a mistake or i don't know it's still good let's keep trying maybe the candy pieces are very very inside and you can't see them or i'm not sure but or maybe they're very small i'm really not sure but uh still the red part is absolutely tasty and but uh i gotta admit i'm not a big fan of the vanilla cream it's just that i don't know combining vanilla cream with sour red berry flavor it doesn't match you know it's like there's like something that doesn't really match it but it's still kind of good okay [Music] okay we're reaching the bottom part and i gotta say that's my least favorite part yeah i gotta admit uh okay the vanilla part is not bad uh it's kind of good it's just that it really doesn't match with the flavor of the berries it's just i don't know it's like mixing waffles with hot sauce or like i don't know how to describe it well let's bite this part okay it's really not that bad but uh i'm not sure it's okay it's okay it's not terrible but uh i don't think they should have combined vanilla with sour berries like you should have picked one or the other but combining the two um it's not that bad of an idea but it's not good either it's like it's okay i guess they wanted to try doing this but uh if it were me i would have just stuck to the red berries oh yeah in the end it's kind of good i mean the vanilla part isn't exactly my favorite part of the popsicle but it's fine it's fine it could have been worse but it's fine it tastes fine and there you have it it's gone well youtube that was my tasting and my review of the sour patch kids popsicles and i give it a um eight out of ten yeah it's pretty good uh i still don't think it was a good idea to combine vanilla with sour but it's fine it tastes fine yeah it could have been a lot worse but it's fine it's fine i really love the sour part and on its own the vanilla tastes good but i don't know merging the two together and tasting the two together i don't know it feels kind of weird but but still it's okay these are pretty good popsicles and if you see them you should totally try them because uh yeah they taste awesome especially the red part but my main complaint is that well it says that there's pieces of candy inside but uh you clearly saw that there weren't any i'm not sure if this is a mistake or if it's false advertising or it's just well that they're very very very tiny and you can't see them or maybe they're inside the red part i'm not sure each box contains six bars and yeah they're pretty good pretty good well yeah that was my review uh like i said eight out of ten pretty good pretty solid thanks for watching this video yeah if you see these popsicles you have to try them and well that was it for today thanks for watching bye wow", "Ha8Eej6E7i8": "hey guys and welcome back to the channel today on this redline vlog style video i've got the newest member of the volkswagen suv family that's right that is the 2020 volkswagen atlas cross sport now the last time i drove this thing i was in vancouver it was about earlier this year right before the pandemic started as you can see this is an sel with the r line sport appearance package designed to be a competitor to things like the ford edge a jeep grand cherokee a honda passport the upcoming toyota venza it essentially takes the very successful 303 row atlas and shortens it creating a two-row version and kind of gives it a cupified look to kind of make it resemble like an audi q8 or a lamborghini earth so the big question i want to answer is the new atlas cross sport the perfect family vehicle for today's modern family that's over here to find out [Music] so just like the regular three row atlas the cross sport has the newer front fascia which actually volkswagen just put this new fascia on the 2021 atlas so stay tuned for my full review on that video called a later date but as you can see compared to the last one that i drove in vancouver which was a boring silver color this is a very pretty shade of kind of like a greenish blue tint this is the sel with the r line package it's not the full sel premium but you get full led headlights no led fog lights instead you kind of have this sculpted front fascia with a deeper uh blacked out painted lower air dam and you get more of that chrome trim this kind of very subtle r-line badge and this is a very big vehicle remember it goes head-to-head with cars like the honda passport the ford edge the chevrolet blazer and compared to the regular atlas this is about three inches shorter but at 195 inches long overall this is still on the bigger end it's about five inches longer than something like the honda passport now because this one has the r-line sport package you get these 21 inch wheels wrapped in two 65 with tires these are one of the largest wheels that you can get in the industry and just like the regular atlas you still get a fairly decent amount of ground clearance around eight inches total and it shares the same 117 inch long wheelbase obviously when you get back here you can see it's got that sloping coupe like look kind of reminds you of an audi q8 or a porsche cayenne coupe which is also a really stylish looking vehicle now the tail light modules just like the regular atlas are kind of an led combination but they do look slightly different this is the most differentiating angle between this and the regular atlas you have these fake chrome exhaust trim pieces vw and audi have been very guilty of that as well this particular one here also has the towing package which can tell a maximum of 5000 pounds and because it's an suv the trunk capacity is huge you can see with the seats up which this doesn't offer a third row my dog cedar happily kind of jumped right in you get 40.1 cubic feet of space and if you fold down everything you get around 78 cubic feet of space and you also get a very happy puppy now of course on the inside of the atlas cross sport if you guys are pretty familiar with the atlas interior and a lot of other newer volkswagen interiors it's going to look very familiar now first things first as you can see this is the sel with the r-line package it's got this really nice tan interior with the two-tone the seats are just heated if you want cooled seats you have to go for the sel premium which my tester is one notch below it shutting the door it has a relatively solid thunk that you associate with other german cars and this interior at a glance looks fairly nice however if i'm going to be honest here vw really needs to do something about the design of their interiors they just don't really have that wow factor that they used to have a few years ago i mean sure you've got the digital cockpit display over here which is very close to what you find in a lot of audis with their virtual cockpit you have an eight inch touchscreen over here that includes things like android auto and apple carplay it is a very nice easy to use system the screen is bright although i think that at eight inches it's starting to look a little bit small especially considering how expansive and large the dashboard is of this vehicle the materials here have some of that faux stitching with the leatherette there on the upper portion here the door panel here is also a soft touch injection molded plastic you've got some silver painted plastic and some imitation plastic which tries to look like carbon fiber the door handle here is metal at least and it's also slightly padded over here the window controls are one touch up and down for all four so that's all very nice stuff in here really the newest thing that you're gonna notice in the interior is this steering wheel it's the new volkswagen steering wheel with the new volkswagen emblem it definitely looks a lot slimmer a lot more modern it looks a little bit more luxury oriented as well i really like the emblem this is what you're going to start seeing trickle down into other volkswagen products the steering wheel itself tilts and telescopes offers a lot of adjustability and range which is very nice and then over here you can see the dashboard layout design is pretty similar to every other volkswagen that i've seen and i kind of think that's where vw could have done more to differentiate this car from other vehicles i like this little shelf over here where you can store stuff you've got dual zone climate control just heated seats no cooled seats on this particular one here there's a couple of empty buttons over there and then over here down here you can see there is a wireless phone charger two usb ports and then lots of controls over here for your drive mode selector this controls the eight speed automatic which by the way because i don't have the premium package i only have just a standard backup camera if you guys go for the sel premium package um you'll get the full 360 camera with the top down views your cup holders over here electronic parking brake and then of course nice big center core storage over here with a nice padded lid the lid itself however doesn't slide forward and back that's always typically been a volkswagen thing so that's weird to see it missing here the seats are also a little bit boring to look at but i do like the color i wish they were cooled on this trim but you got to step up one more notch and then they feel relatively good this is not a real leather this is the synthetic leather leather that volkswagen offers on the lower trims the premium package gives you a real leather and then the glove compartment here you can see there's two us sd card slots there for the gps it's not lined with felt but it is damped and then above me you can see panoramic roof is included on this trim which lets in a lot of light the back seats as you can see are huge let me show you guys that real quick and as you can see the back seat of the cross sport is actually larger versus the three row atlas because volkswagen said when they took out the third row in this vehicle they were able to kind of push the second row a little bit further back to give passengers more space vw says you get around 40 inches of legroom back here 40 inches and you have a nearly completely flat floor surprise there's actually a little shelf here where there should be something here maybe for like your climate control settings in other parts of the of the world two usb ports over there a household power outlet and then when you shut the door you can see it sounds pretty similar to the front this is a hard touch plastic material here on the upper door panels of the rear door so a little bit of cost cutting there two map pockets which is nice the seats themselves you can see they don't actually slide forward and back which would have been nice but they do offer a little bit of adjustability so you can kind of fold them forward or you can also recline them slightly which is good but i'm surprised that vw didn't allow me to actually slide the seat forward which would have been nice to uh to include on the two-row version so overall if you're looking for one of the largest back scenes in the segment the atlas cross sport definitely will satisfy that and really this is about as big as what you're going to find in the honda passport so the atlas cross sport is volkswagen's entry into the continuously growing two-row mid-size crossover second remember this is a segment for vehicle for people who think that the compact crossover like a tiguan or a rav4 or crv is too small because you want something with more space in the second row and the trunk and you potentially want a six cylinder engine most vehicles a lot of entries in this segment have a six cylinder a v6 or vr6 like this one and honestly when i first drove this car back in british columbia when i was in vancouver i was pretty impressed with it it's a relatively solid entry in the segment it's not the sportiest it's not the most luxurious it's not the sleekest looking but it covers a very nice middle ground volkswagen has priced it well and it also looks relatively handsome on the outside now the one that i tested in vancouver was a very boring silver with black interior but this one here in tourmaline blue with this beige interior combination is really nice this is how i would i would buy this car if i was going to look at one of these and the outside like i said um for 2021 vw is adjusting the regular atlas to have the same front fascia as this but unlike you know the passport and the pilot which have basically just a different grille and slightly different tail lights they look like exactly the same vehicle this however looks you know slightly more different to me i also think that the vw did a good job with the proportions of the rear even though i hate this sloping coupe design i think this particular one looks good at the back now regarding the interior vw has been heavily criticized by consumers and myself for being a little bit too safe on the interior and the cross sport is technically no exception to that rule either so the inside may not be super luxurious or full of all the latest tech it doesn't really wow you but it is comfortable it's easy to use it's also very quiet in here and this car has a really good ride quality despite the fact that it's on 21-inch wheels now a 2-liter turbo engine is the standard engine in the cross sport i actually haven't driven the 2-liter turbo i would probably skip it just because i don't like that engine in the tiguan but it is tuned to make 235 horsepower in this most people who buy a cross sport will probably go for the vr6 and this is vw's 3.6 liter unit with 276 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque it goes out through an 8-speed automatic transmission this one has their hall decks based four motion all-wheel drive system and when you put the vehicle into its sport setting here and put your foot down this definitely has the grunt that i'm expecting for a vehicle that's in the midsize crossover segment i mean the tiguan um which is pretty big for a compact car is just ridiculously sluggish with the two liter this 3.6 has a very nice snarl to it it's very smooth it's very refined it's not the quickest in the segment cars like the honda passport will be faster the subaru outback turbo will be faster the chevrolet blazer with its 3.6 is faster this feels pretty comparable to the last grand cherokee with the 3.6 liter pentastar engine that i drove i also like this has a traditional stepped automatic so for those of you who hate cvts this is going to be a really nice option for you it feels like it gets to 60 in the mid 7 second range which is adequate performance um it's got plenty of power for most people i actually thought it felt underpowered when i was in vancouver now that i have the car back at home at sea level where it's not we're not at elevation i find the power to be adequate um do i wish it had a little bit more power sure do i wish that the crossbar was a little sportier to drive sure absolutely i mean this car feels big and heavy it's very wide you really notice the width of this car which translates to a lot of interior space in the front you know between the two passengers at the back or the front here it's a very smooth refined car but there's a reason obviously why you know the audi q8 gets the turbocharged v6 because it has way more low end torque it feels a little bit more effortless this engine you know you kind of have to rev it out to feel a little bit of power but it's a good engine that you want to rev out that you know is very smooth and quiet so i don't really have a problem doing that the 8-speed automatic in this car also is very smooth it shifts perfectly fine it's very competitive with the segment it's not you know one of the best transmissions in the business but it's a transmission that will just kind of you know fade and fade into the background as you drive this thing daily so i think that's really important uh when you're talking about a daily driver really the cross sport is so middle of the road just good at everything that i have trouble finding faults with this thing i mean sure i could complain about it being boring on uh to drive i can complain about the interior not having that wow factor but really volkswagen knows you know their target audience with this thing and for the people who are looking for a family car that has way more space than most of the competition this is going to do very nicely in that regard now if you guys were planning to actually tow use that 5000 pound towing capacity i would be concerned that this v6 doesn't quite have the grunt but like i said for most everyday usages you get it up to highway speeds it has a very soft controlled ride quality it's very quiet in here this would be a really excellent road trip car just from the sheer amount of space that it has really where i think vw needs to work on is the fuel efficiency for this engine it is rated at 16 in the city and 22 on the highway which in my week's worth of testing i have been averaging around 17 mpg which is not great um on the highway i did get this up to about 23 mpg so it will do a little bit better than the actual epa numbers which seems a little bit conservative to me but you know with the turbocharged engines that everyone's going to in the competition set vw does need to work on the fuel economy and make this thing better it is a product of the fact that this is a heavy car this weighs you know a little over 4 500 pounds so it is pretty heavy and it feels heavy when you're driving it but that heft translates into you know feeling of safety a feeling of quality so i think there's a reason why uh vw did that so overall if you like the way the atlas drives this drives the same way it doesn't feel any smaller to me or any sportier but it's just as every bit as comfortable it's just as quiet it's every bit as smooth and it's also different you don't see you know that many of these on the road like you would see at an edge or in grand cherokee and let's be honest here i don't really particularly like the way the current edge drives i also don't really like the way the grand cherokee drives with the v6 you got to go for the v8 if you want the grand cherokee and then there's the passport of course which i think the passport has a transmission that i don't love the nine-speed auto is not good and then of course the nissan murano is another option which the murano is a very smooth driving car but a lot of you you know hate the cvt and i also am not fans of the looks of the current generation so the crossport definitely has enough high points in here to warrant a look if you guys are looking for something like this size so the 2020 volkswagen atlas crossport may not be the sportiest vehicle in the segment to drive that's not its mission of this car you can't deny how ridiculously practical the atlas cross sport is just like the three row atlas the cross sport offers a lot of space in the second row and the cargo area and the front seats because it's the same width and rides on the same wheelbase it being three inches shorter does give this car a slightly different look in fact unlike the honda passport which always constantly reminds you that it's a pilot uh the crossboard definitely has a unique look at the rear now of course the front will remind you of the regular three row atlas but i think that vw did a good job with making this thing look a little bit more standoutish especially the r-line package that gives you the 21-inch wheels this tourmaline blue exterior color and just the sloping rear roof line of the rear area it reminds me a lot of the lamborghini eras and the audi q8 and keep in mind this is about half the price of something like the audi q8 now of course the cross sport isn't perfect i wish that the interior looked a little bit more special to kind of match the premium look on the outside and i also think that this one here at 46 000 should be the fully loaded version i don't like how i have to go to a premium package to get things like the real leather and the ventilated seats which will push the price a little over 50 000 but this car starts at around 31 550 which is about a thousand dollars more versus the three-row atlas it represents a good deal and it's going to be less expensive versus cars like the jeep grand cherokee and the ford edge but keep in mind that the hyundai santa fe and subaru outback which are smaller vehicles will be less expensive versus this fully loaded atlas but with all that said i hope

cannabis when we set out to create a brand for edibles we wanted it to be sort of sheffy under the Cresco brand we're looking at Mindy's artisanal a little bit more high-end that's where our chocolates and baked goods come in they're made with a distillate oil when we sat down and we talked about like I want to do my Brittles I've been making these brittles for years I want to see what it's like to make my brittles have THC in it what starts with good quality chocolate really she likes to blend so our flavors are a little bit of mix mixes of this chocolate that chocolates our specificity and then we add on the crunchies and the gooeys as we like to call them so she loves rich dead decadent caramel or peanut butter and then we'll make a toffee or brittle that will chop up and kind of mix into the bar I kind of feel like we have a really wide variety of edibles and I kind of feel like there is something for everybody and they're really really accurately goes on our more confectionery base and our sugar products I guess is Mindy's kitchen so that's where our gummies fall under we have Fruit Chews under that line as well as hard sweets so you know you're sucking candy

mean it's gonna be like it's the craziest thing it's gonna be like you know like the Wild West I'm very excited about the future of this industry I'm glad that I'm in it and I'm glad that I'm a part

folks make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at a new to us capsule brand from the folks at get zen we are looking at their cannabis infused capsules today this is the high thc line where each capsule has 25 milligrams of thc uh for 750 milligrams in the total bottle uh like all of our wheats reviews we're not going to be doing all 750 milligrams at once we're going to be taking four capsules for a hundred milligrams uh and that is what we will base our review off of so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach california uh for i believe uh with taxes included uh around about ninety dollars uh so pretty expensive for these 750 milligram capsules uh certainly on the upper end for what i've seen in the area uh so we've got some decent expectations for them uh and on their website they've got such wonderful boilerplate uh text as this let's let's give you a read here gitzen is on a mission to improve the quality of life for patients by manufacturing the highest quality of cannabis capsule and other cannabis products our goal is to bring honesty integrity and accountability to the cannabis market and change the way cannabis is perceived by the medical community in the general public how noble i'm sure they are uh fulfilling that mission uh with the absolute utmost zeal every day of their existence so uh let's get into the product review here uh here's our little bottle uh it's got some lab testing results on the bottom that doesn't really give us more than just the number there uh which actually comes out according to these lab testing results to about 821 milligrams 10 more than advertised there's one of these like little funky stickers that you can pull away to get more information than you occasionally see on these pill bottles oh and uh back here we just have uh the ingredients which uh is more elaborate than i would have thought and now i am seeing that this is actually um rso in here or at least as advertised this is uh not just any um thc distillate it is rso rick simpson oil doesn't really change things that much it's just a different extraction method uh let's get that sticker off and get to the promised effects of these pills which are high euphoria we shall see i'm realizing now i have no liquid in here with me so good old-fashioned dry swallow it is and here are capsules ah okay these are quite a bit different than what i have seen these are just little gelatin capsules but instead of like liquid filled there's a very dry amount of i guess rso there at the bottom uh just kind of splattered in there i'm not sure how well it's showing up on camera uh but it just looks like somebody just took a little dropper of some really sticky goo and put it in this capsule um not very appealing looking but you know uh you gotta do it one way so here we are here is again our 25 milligram capsule uh let's give it a try down the hatch it goes one and two no taste believe it or not other than the elegant capsule two all right that's half of what we're gonna be doing for this review we're gonna do all 100 i'm gonna take about i don't know uh 30 minutes to an hour or so before i try these next two but once i do about uh 90 minutes to two hours after i have my second half of this dose i will come right back here guys to give you those most important part about all of the reviews the wrap up thoughts are these get zen high thc capsules gonna get you high for that guys you'll just have to stick around and i'll be right back in just a bit thanks for watching welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two and a half hours since i had my first get zen capsule i was about to show you the logo again but i ripped the sticker off i can't do that uh and about what did i say two and a half hours inside my first probably about 90 minutes since i had the second two the other half of my dose and these capsules work pretty well they're good uh the rso oil in there will get you quite high i'm still pleasantly high two and a half hours later um i'm not sure however that they are worth the premium over some of the other capsules uh of a similar strength at a lower price or higher milligramage um uh so if they are cheaper at your dispensary or if they're the only ones capsules they have available and you like capsules these will certainly do the trick but i don't think that they are necessarily worth a premium over anything else if um if they got some buddies or some papa and barclays or whatever in there and there's you know cheaper than these you're fine using those uh but these get zen will certainly get the job done so i'm gonna give them a thumbs up but again it's kind of a qualified thumbs up uh these are good but you don't need to spend the extra expense if these are more expensive than any other at your dispensary anytime we give a thumbs up we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that is not weed related we can give a little recommendation of very simple quick easy one this week just finished or re-watching the 2012 uh movie killing them softly uh which is i think available on netflix the stream right now stars brad pitt uh was a legendary bomb the year it came out but it is a great great film pretty quick like 90 minutes to get through too uh super cynical super dark uh about um oh uh what is the movie about uh it's it's about [ __ ] you pay me that's what it's about i guess uh so check out killing them softly on netflix and if they're not too expensive check out get zen capsules the high thc especially if you like the capsules they'll get the job done and that guy's then is gonna do it for this cherry on top it's gonna do it for the review until we see you for our next one stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "ouBRn7P0SvA": "also new tonight a parent in Richmond Heights is facing charges after their child got into their marijuana laced candy police posted to Twitter

Phil via a general practitioner and writer and this is Africa where health where we provide you with direction and clarity about everything medical the measures to manage cycle cell anemia the inherited condition that affects hemoglobin in the blood which can cause significant illness have evolved over several years in this video we're looking at the current that is the most recent updates for potential cures we have available in 2020 now for several years a cure for sickle cell anemia has been largely elusive in places like Nigeria and West Africa the country that has the highest burden for sickle cell anemia people hardly talk about a cure for the disease and people who suffer with sickle cell anemia resigned themselves with prevention as much as they can sickle cell crisis and taking treatments that can promote their health as much as possible however for some years now there has been a cure but it has been mostly available in high-income countries where there are adequate facilities and effective health came from structure to manage the process of delivering the cure and maintaining people's health afterwards what kyoto called stem cell transplant has developed challenges in terms of its use and administration and so a lot more recently within the last six months a new alternative has developed known as gene therapy we're going to talk about both of them but start with stem cell therapy stem cell therapy in sickle cell anemia requires that the individual with sickle cell anemia who is going to undergo treatment has a healthy brother or sister from whom stem cells can be taken or harvested in order for the procedure to be carried out now stem cells are particular types of human cells that can develop into many other types of human cells for example muscle cells or brain cells or bone cells how do we get them cells there are two main sources first human embryos some human stem cells are produced from the embryos that is immature fetuses during in-vitro fertilization and donated to science other stem cells can be formed from fully developed adult cells the critical thing about stem cell is their ability to develop into other types of cells inside the body so essentially in stem cell therapy for sickle cell anemia it is thought that the healthy cells taken from the donors bone marrow will be transplanted into the recipient and developed into non sickle cells red cells within the recipient the person who's suffering from sickle cell anemia the like I mentioned earlier there are some challenges with stem cell therapy one of the problems is that many people with sickle cell anemia do not have a healthy relative or healthy sibling brother sister who can act as a donor for normal or healthy stem cells to be harvested from the other problem that could happen is that they may develop serious complications following the transplant assuming they're able to get his sibling donor there may be serious complications after the chance but all the transplants may fail and the finished stem cells stem cell science is still evolving is still developing they still in lots for scientists to learn about techniques which with which the stem cells can be controlled and used appropriately the way you want to for the benefits of of science of medicine and there's also also the issue that some people find it troubling use stem cells obtained from embryos that are not used after cycles of IVF but an alternative solution has come up and this is gene therapy in gene therapy for sickle cell anemia it is the patient the person who suffers from sickle cell anemia it's their own stem cell that I used so removing the need for a compatible donor now to understand how this works we need to digress a little bit and talk about the role of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell disease now fetal hemoglobin or hemoglobin efforts we also call it is unique for quite a few reasons number one it appears to be very well-suited for supporting or maintaining the baby within the wounds low oxygen environment compared to normal or healthy adult hemoglobin researchers have also found that the presence of fetal hemoglobin prevents the formation of the cold red blood cells now after birth and as they developed infants or young babies gradually stop producing this fetal hemoglobin and instead start to develop what is MV an adult hemoglobin the hemoglobin that they will eventually continue with us and all the children and as adults for the rest of their lives now this process where they stop producing hemoglobin fetal hemoglobin starts or tends to happen from about four to six months age so what you find is that from about forty six months of age in children with normal immigrating genotype the hemoglobin F will be replaced by hemoglobin a but in a child with the SS genotype the hemoglobin F is going to be replaced by hemoglobin s that causes the cleaner of the red blood cells now the crux of gene therapy and this is research that's still ongoing with clinical trials that are presently going on at the Boston Children's Hospital in the United States this research has shown that the production of fetal hemoglobin can be reactivated which in the case of an individual with sickle-cell disease will be first the condition now the scientists working on this belief that this process can be reversed by the activity or or suppressing or preventing the activity of the of a protein called be the L 11a and so what they do is they use an inactive virus to deliver instructions genetic instructions to the RNA of the red blood cell of the person the individual with sickle-cell disease and these instructions are meant to drastically reduce the production of this protein bcl11a in the individuals red blood cells and this is what allows the reversal from the adult hemoglobin in that individual to the feats of hemoglobin okay so it's a lot more complicated than what I've just said and clinical trials are going on the process is underway there are if they're described as promising they're individuals who have received these treatments and they're promising resource and if you want to read more about sage and find out more details I will put a link to the Pape and E and research studies in the description box below so please are the measures available for people who ask what is they care is their care for sickle cell anemia these are the measures available to consider in terms of cost accessibility availability they are technical highly specialized procedures that have still been looked into in high-income countries and the United States so the feasibility of having them performed in lower middle-income countries of course can be quite challenging but they are fair as an option and possibly in the next decade or less maybe more available to other parts of the world so let's watch this faith now if you are interested in a 7-point checklist for what people with the a s genetic short considered when the ancient relationship is all generally should be aware of about their health care status make sure you check the link in the description below because I got a free II leaflets on that particular topic now next time in this series are going to be looking at the treatment available for sickle cell anemia understanding the treatment of sickle cell anemia so what drugs to people the sickle cell anemia need and when they are having a crisis or just to maintain their health generally and why do they need this medication so make sure you check out that video could put the link
