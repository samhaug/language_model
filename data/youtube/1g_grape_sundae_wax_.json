{"Lu-2PoSmPpk": "what is going on YouTube family this is pressing peat the press and puffin coming at you with another one so it's gonna be a little different today anybody who follows me on Instagram noticed that I had an issue or even saw my video with the grass roots Bubba diagonal live sauce or live butter it's live butter it was more of a sugar so I instagrammed him I posted about it they emailed me grassroots / and asked me to send them my address oh they gave me a choice I could a drive two and a half hours back to the dispensary I bought it from and return it or be keep the product which I don't mind I enjoyed the product and they would send me some stuff so I chose option B obviously I'm not driving two and a half hours for one one half gram of product just not [ __ ] happen so I got my box from grassroots sent me a little bit of stuff so we're gonna crack into her and see what they sent me and then I'm gonna do a review so get my handy-dandy stabby pokey stick here right in Nice so when I emailed them and I want to email anybody now I finish it with stay safe and be well be well primarily being the point and this is a shipping label they sent me and right there stay safe and be well hahaha it spreads see love spreads the the good good vibes good things spread so oh a bag good looking at grassroots I appreciate the hook-up I got a grassroots shirt and it's in my size and no they didn't ask my size they just got lucky Oh Oh yep I'll be wearing at my next review and the grassroots dab Matt oh yeah can always use another dead man cactus I only have two I have a big one from Doug Smasher and now this one so and they're both black and white which is awesome sweet so shout out the grassroots for the love and the hook-up I appreciate it that's awesome it's a nice quality t-shirt yeah next-level apparel never heard of them but it's nice soft but good quality I like the color the dark grey and I I wanted a grass root shirt yeah deeply that's what's up yeah okay so let's get into it we are reviewing shatter prism by Alera this is grape pie great pie shatter I did the homework on this one folks it is grape stomper crossed with cherry pies indica heavy dominant hybrid so according to the packaging in the you know molera they're basic basic basic with their packaging THC a seventy eight point six eight one CBD a zero terpenes B mark one point 106 human point four six three little all point four four nine car point three to eight this point three oh nine limonene point one five eight be pining 0.079 terminal 18 point oh seven eight PI nine point oh five six that's all she wrote folks now I picked this up on April 4th this is April 9th actually it's the 10th now and this was packaged on the 13th so not the freshest not the least fresh so you see it's still sealed at the nice little sticker there we're gonna change that real fast when we bust her open now these are those childproof containers I keep talking about the one that defeated me when I first got into the program it took my wife and I both to figure this damn thing out and even then we couldn't I finally got it so you have to push in on the two ends while pressing down on this tab and then you can pull the tray out like so that easy but it took I don't know why it took us a bit to figure it out now of course this is trim run it's usually what happens with the layer that's what you get that's the envelope break you're open it's dark you know I expect that with Alera it's not the darkest stuff I've ever seen with them actually actually this is better looking I'm surprised usually it's a weird green a weird green color but this is actually it not a bad color it's a nice amber it's a it's actually nice-looking shatter I'm surprised that's actually some of the better-looking stuff I've ever seen from Alera and I don't mind they're shatter it's a little expensive for my opinion for what it is but I [ __ ] with a shatter or sometimes when it comes around we have a nice big old fat chunk here we're gonna stick that bad boy they go i dabs stick that in there another little piece top it off now I almost forgot actually I did forget I broke that off and I wait I didn't weigh it so we're gonna weigh it without what I just put it in the Deb and we'll see exactly what we got here okay you folks saw me load up my two big chunks into my Jeep and connect so I've got two nice chunks in there the chamber is pretty full in fact I'll pull it out here so you can see so you can see that chamber is full chatter okay and I just weighed what was left 1.05 so it's probably you know pretty sight of this little over 0.1 I would say it actually 1.07 1.07 so I'm gonna say that that's probably 0.4 0.5 maybe so yeah with over not only was a better looking than normal but it was over which I like to see so shout out cool air for that at least let's crack into it and see how she tastes now like I said it's grape pie or grape stomper and cherry pie grape stomp or cherry pie so supposed to have you know sweet flavors to it but it's also supposed to be a little spicy from what I read we'll see alright cheers folks hmm Wow not too shabby okay mm-hmm I tasted it you got a little bit that grape little bit that cherry it does have that little bit of a nutty spicy exhale like I said that's actually an accurate description that they had yeah sweet and a little spicy I like it grape pie all day long yeah definitely a favorite for me as far as the lair goes time for a haircut again oh that's good stuff it's right where I wanted to be this morning having a rough day at bad night last night not having a good day this morning this whole corona virus things got my [ __ ] [ __ ] up my schedules off because of work being messed up so it messes with my sleep schedule messes with my routine and I don't know how many of you watching suffer from PTSD and anxiety but one of the things that keeps me functioning well is a routine it's not a lot of unexpected you know a general routine I mean I can have your usual daily stuff of things that get thrown at you but my whole world being thrown into turmoil like this is not good it's got me just freaking out for no reason ever I'm gonna have some reasons but I'm taking I'm freaking out to the extreme and I know it's to the extreme I just can't stop it - even though I'm aware of it I can't stop it from happening I just have to kind of try to roll with it and get past it it's kind of like back in the days when I used to you know trip I used to just have to tell myself look this is temporary it's only the trip it's just it's gonna go away so I have to tell I have to try to keep telling myself is this what I'm trying right now is you know medicating Aniki it's only temporary it's gonna change it's gonna go back to normal or you know obviously it's not gonna go back to the way everything used to be because nothing ever does but I just it is what it is so this is what I needed today because this is starting to calm me down it's making me feel a little better physically as well as mentally it's calming very calming I will say that I was pretty I was pretty anxious to worked up at the beginning of this I put on a happy face but I was pretty pretty upset when I started the video so it was nice to get a care package and to have some medicine so it's little things like that to brighten my day little things like that but it's huge to me oh yeah definitely like great pie that's one I'll buy again I don't care what you think about the company now that you just stand myself but there are some things I will buy I'll buy their flour because the press as well I won't vape it I think it's trash for that but it presses well makes good wax so I will buy it for that they're shattered once in a while if it's if it's great pie I'm getting it redheaded stranger I'm getting it um otherwise we'll see but those two all day just because I mean they're expensive for what they are but I like them so it is what it is I gotta be honest you know people can hate everyone you can jump on the bandwagon I hate to I hit on them too because they do have some garbage I'm not gonna lie but the same one oh this is good stuff this is actually the best chatter I've seen from mallero quality and effects it looks fantastic compared to the other stuff it's like this weird green color at least this had a good proper amber I mean it wasn't as clear as I'd like but it was a good proper amber color not that weird green [ __ ] also shut up - mama an ex-con John my business partner and best friend who makes these awesome rise & grind shirts hit him up they are awesome they are comfortable get him in long sleeve get him in short sleeve it don't matter I'll get it in a hoodie man I mean it's not that time of year but uh I wear hoodies all year-round so that's just me I know we're not doing the cannabis festivals but all the products will be available online through us just hit us up we can make that happen hopefully I'll have some prototypes here to show you personally I'm ice to channel otherwise check out ex-con John he's got him up there and some recent videos to show you what we got also like I said Prizm great pie by Alera it's a wind folks overpriced boy win I like it it's good stuff I'm not disappointed at all I actually kind of wish I bought a second one just because this one is pretty good its heady a little unfocused but its heady which is really needed right now is to kind of clear my head or at least clear of the bad stuff so if you are not a subscriber hit that button below we hit 200 thank you all that is freaking amazing I mean it's nothing in the grand scheme of things I'm a little nobody but 200 to me that's freakin unbelievable I never expected to have you know 200 subscribers and that's that's awesome guys you guys are fantastic thank you all so much for the love I'm I just also get 420 on Instagram last night so that was kind of cool I'm gonna have to look about doing a giveaway when we hit 420 on the YouTube channel we hit 420 on the YouTube channel and I'll do something crazy maybe I'll give away a piece of glass or you know something we'll think of something the closer we get to 420 we'll brainstorm it but if we can hit 420 this year dude yeah I'll do something I'll do something silly I'll give away something cool just because to me that's that's crazy numbers everyone else look oh and a thousand but ten it that's unheard of to me to me that's unfathomable 1,000 so far away that's unfair I'm at 200 and to me that was crazy I couldn't even picture that six months ago so thank you all as always be safe be well and keep on puffing", "_BnAbBlMJwQ": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the canvas somali a I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for a cannabis extract review I'm really excited that we have cannabis extracts back in Canada and that I have some great friends who are making them growing them with their allowed for plants and sharing them legal rosin how cool is that if you were here from the start of the channel you'll remember that I used to do all my pairings with extracts and only extracts and as soon as legalization happen ox ox 17 20 18 I shifted to reviewing legal cannabis just to make sure that I was playing within all the rules now we've come to a point where we could finally have these craft extracts again and some of these producers from that legacy market I'm lucky to have built friendships with and have them share phenomenal phenomenal products with me which is great I love legalization in Canada super super cool what's the first one we are going to try I have two today we're gonna do two of these new reviews and see how they go I was just in Vancouver for lifting coke conference and I was finally able to meet a very cool gentleman I had done quite a few reviews of his rosin in the past and it was really great to finally meet it's melt season if you're from the show I did a lot of great things about season he has a phenomenal rosin maker it does a lot of collabs with a lot of big wonderful companies in Canada so we have our label says Sunday driver 120 you let's just break that down a little bit so Sunday driver is a genetic from can urato genetics that went to jungle boys and that's where it became really really popular as soon as it was jungle boy then it was one of these really big hype strains and what is the build of it it is fruity pebble OG from alien genetics and then a grape pie and has just all these wonderful fruits and gases and all that great stuff all the Terps that really really like our in here so I've been waiting to open this and make sure that I opened it and could review it so that's the strain we have the producer melt season and then you can see that it says 120 you and if you're not familiar with hashes or Rosen's especially hash Rosen's or hashes that might make absolutely no sense to you and when we're making hash there are silk screen sizes generally they start 190 hundred and fifty and then you get to the Year 120 you and your 90 you then you have a seventy five a sixty a 50 and a twenty five but or seventy three you sorry but that 122 ninety you section of screening is where you get the most mature heads so your 120 you and this is just as I assume this is just a straight 120 you pull of this very specific a lot of people blend their 93 you and their 120 you to get a larger output but very interesting to see the 120 you and I'd really like to do some tasting differences to see if a 93 you would taste different than a 120 you because of the size of the glandular head would be very very interesting experiment to find out so you can see in the bottom we've got a nice wet delicious rosin nice and white absolutely fantastic let's dig in to the nose you can see there I'll get a nice closer video you can see how bright and white it is I believe this is a keyword hash rosin hmm and on the nose the first layer is like this almost creamy herbaceous gas that could only be related to hmm this one's quite confusing cuz it's very complex there's a layer of white flowers there's a layer of gas there's a layer of skunk there's a layer of Rudy miss mmm absolutely delicious super complex which is great and just kind of wet we'll break it up a little with my dab tool here and see if that'll release an aroma so I can really get on point with those mmm if I was gonna relate it to something it would be almost sweet lemongrass petrol some very fresh delicious earth that has some fruits some tree fruits some black and red tree fruits falling in it some plum some blackberry some blueberry but very creamy as well hmm very interesting aromas but a medium plus exaggeration of area it's a medium plus expression of the aroma sorry for my stutter very delicious smells very fresh smells very nice and knew and loved for so I've got my puff go peak here we're gonna load it in the puff Co peak and see how it tastes we'll get that big of a dab in there but a Bing C it is it's a big one but it's not a small one or it's a small one and a big one anyways let's put make sure this is on the right temperature we're gonna put it on medium on green and let's fire it up this is really great to be able to go back and do these types of videos I'm really excited to be putting out more bras in education more hash education because there's a lot of verbiage and vocabulary in there that gets quite confusing so already this lesson on 120 u-verse 93 is fantastic hmm it really translates well I have a quartz insert in here but the flavor really translates well from what I was smelling that creamy lemongrass there's a taste of ginger there's some citrus there's some petrol it's very mouth coating it's very mouth filling and delicious how can you complain about something like that big vapor clouds on green tasty confectionery a little bit of herbs gas everything that you could really ask for in cannabis I guess that's why this genetic is so famous sent to a very famous extractor why it's made its way around the world I totally understand I really like the sunday driver thank you melt season for the wonderful gift I really appreciate it I hope for anybody watching we helped to clarify a few things I should mention that this hash was made from cured cannabis so it's not a live rosin but it's just a hash rosin absolutely fantastic make sure like comment share and most importantly subscribe so you can see all the new videos coming out always working on lots of content I'm really excited to share it with you guys till next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "-Oc7Nz5ojss": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis trade review so today we are going to be reviewing sunday driver by infinity by bloom now this is my first time ever trying any of the infinity bud by bloom but sunday driver is no stranger to me or the channel but if it is a new stream to you let's go ahead and talk about it this is an evenly balanced 50 50 hybrid strain that is a cross between fruity pebbles also known as fruity pebbles o g and grape pie so oh my god i am expecting this to be ultra sweet i got a little sampler bag from one of my friends who wanted me to review this so i am really excited to try this out so let's go ahead bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out then we're going to take a look at it together and get right into this review okay so what did you think of the sunday driver by infinity by bloom you guys i gotta be honest so let me kind of give you a rundown here on this stuff and how i got my hands on it i was over at one of my buddy's house uh houses we were just hanging out in the backyard we're smoking a joint and he had this bag of this bloom ganja on the table and i'm like oh what kind of crap did you pick up at the dispensary just expecting some [ __ ] and it was a bag full of this sunday driver they're small little popcorn nugs i honestly don't tell him but i probably took the best nug in the jar uh or in the bag that he had but like when i open it up and i'm gonna do it right now man this stuff is so tropical and sweet smelling it's like berry mixed with like almost like a heavy gas flavor but man it just smells so tropical like there's some purple punch in there and it's crazy because i'll tell you that when even as i'm looking at the butt and let me look at this stuff this back side the back of this bud looks like purple punch like that is 100 purple the orange hairs are sticking to the bud um and then i look on the other side of the same exact bud this is insane and it's completely green with those same bright orange hairs and it doesn't really resemble purple punch at all i mean weird weird stuff now i think the only thing missing on this butt if you want my honest opinion because i think this butt looks unfreaking believable um first of all i could tell you one thing i'm almost positive it was machine trimmed just base i mean god look at the undertones of purple on this bud it's beautiful beautiful um now i'll tell you that i think the and i think this was machine trimmed if you want my honest opinion and i think that they could have done a better job with the trichome production on the outside of the bud i think that's all that it's missing for me is the trichomes like i'm just not seeing major trichomes on the outside of the bud but the smell itself is just like it's intoxicating tropical like a bunch of tropical flavors came together you know think of like you know that pog juice from hawaii where it's like pineapple orange guava you know um this has a lot of like some berry in it i almost smelt like what i thought was some cookies or like maybe even gmo in there like just in the heaviness side of things you know um man i am so excited to get into this now i don't have a lot of this to puff so this is gonna be the nug that i am going to be smoking on today and i'm going to grind this up in real time just so that i can kind of get get um a better idea of you know how it breaks apart and all of that good stuff now i'll tell you after that first little break off of the nug all inside of this bud is like beautiful purple undertones but again still kind of lacking some trichomes i really love the orange hairs and i love the coloration they're actually the the orange hairs are very nice and thick and this bud itself i will tell you guys i mean this is it's really dense bud it's very dense blood and you know i don't think i'm even gonna save any i think i'm just gonna grind it all up right now i don't think it's all even gonna fit in the vape this is what it looks like you guys this is what it looks like so let me go ahead and i'm just gonna grind it all up right here in real time it was still fairly malleable so not super super dry and it did grind up this is grinding up very easy i mean my grinder is not getting stuck or anything like that now i'm expecting that when i take this lid off of here this stuff is just going to reek up oh my god wow it's like a sweet mixed with a savory like a biscotti or a gelato but the sweet and the heaviness i mean there's some like cushion pine even underneath there wow it smells heavy oh my god honest to god the the smell alone and wow this stuff up uh broke up very nice it's very soft it's not super dry um now i will tell you it's not really sticky i'm not noticing it um sticking to my fingers very much that's for sure um but boy did that stuff just grind up like a dream and i'll tell you that from a smell perspective oh it's just it's everything i look for in weed it's like it's sweet which is my favorite the sweetness is there but it's very savory and thick and lustrous and i mean oh my god i'll tell you that like just that smell alone like that the pine notes at the end oh my god this stuff is off to like a great start man i am glad i was able to convince my buddy to give me some of this to uh review here i mean listen you guys just uh while i'm waiting for this bowl to heat up i had never been to bloom and i didn't really know anything about their product he said he was in line on black friday waiting for this stuff waiting for this stuff so i'm like oh damn like this this must have uh been some good ganja um today i'm gonna be enjoying this sunday driver out of my air riser extreme q desktop vape i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees fahrenheit as you see right there i have got my whip which is basically just the silicone tube that brings the vapor from the vaporizer to me it's got two male ends this male and the one that has the screen on it and that little piece of lint stuck to it probably from when i just cleaned it off it was honestly actually probably some cotton from when i just cleaned that with some alcohol um iso and uh my little cotton q-tip that one's gonna go into the actual bowl that sits on top of the vaporizer and i want to smell that again it's like a fruit cake that was like just sitting on the oven for just a little bit and it's starting to warm up and all of the flavor is starting to rise from the top now the other end the male end is going into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler now i am only using two of the three filtration chambers today the second which has got some distilled water the third which has got a brand new organic cotton filter now the first chamber there sits in that in the downstem that little bubble right there that would typically hold carbon and prevent ash from reaching the water but since we are vaping today you guys know there's not going to be any ash that is getting in this water today so if you guys are ready to burn down i am certainly ready to try out this sunday driver by infinity by bloom i think that's their in-house infinity by bloom because when i went to the uh bloom's website it said infinity by bloom so that's uh how i'm going to refer to them today so um let's go ahead and see what the sunday driver is all about okay no visible vapor at all on that first rip honest to god i don't think the botanicals are really warmed up enough so i'm just diving back in for the second rip here i'll probably take three on this one just until i get some visible vapor formed here okay so that one i knew it was coming i could already tell actually immediately i was getting some citrus notes there now it's funny because it's like a grapefruit mixed with an orange mixed with kind of a lemon it's like a mixture of citrus flavors um maybe why they call it uh you know the fruity pebble side of things that's kind of where i'm thinking those flavors are coming from um and then that grape uh grape pie that's mixed in this as well this is just a flavor uh combination of fruit strains let me go ahead and dive back in and see how the second one develops wow that was pretty smooth very thin thin vapor now i'll tell ya the taste and flavor it's not i'm not really like there's not a whole lot to report um i'm kind of like at a loss actually because i would think that like i would still get some more it's like it's just this kind of more of the same from what i had the rip before with some of those citrusy notes um which is unusual it's very light um i'm curious to see how this develops on the actual third rip that produces vapor and so on um so while i'm finishing out this sunday driver by infinity by bloom i want to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the magnification of a 25 times macro lens you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this bud so here it comes now okay so you are looking at the sunday driver by infinity by bloom and boy oh boy where do i even start here this stuff has got dark purple it has dark green it has bright orange hairs it has some darker orange hairs light green i mean it literally is so freaking colorful there's light violet on there even i mean honest to god this bud is crazy like i'm looking at a kaleidoscope right now i will tell you guys that this stuff is very dense you guys see those bright orange hairs they are hugging very closely to the bud now the bud itself has absolutely been manicured very well you guys see those leaves trimmed right up to the bud no excess leaf material on this stuff and definitely a good number of trichomes from what i am seeing here uh under this macro lens this is some really good looking bun okay so what did you think of the sunday driver by infinity by bloom you know i gotta tell you guys that you know this was just so funny because just how i came across this ganja um and how i ended up with this in my hands is just literally making me laugh like i i just replaying the story of like dude what kind of [ __ ] we did you pick up the dispensary and then picking this up and be like damn dude you actually picked up some good dank for once man i'm used to smoking these like shitty pre-rolls and stuff and honestly not to knock the pre-roll but like we smoked this pre-roll actually while we were over there by bloom um the banana cream pie and i thought it was just trash pre-roll to be honest and i have no offense to bloom but i'm just being honest that it was a trash pre-roll um now i don't know that i've had a good pre-roll um i've got a few by genesis that i have a feeling are going to be pretty legit those use actual flower and point one of keith in every grand prix roll but uh that's not what this one was but i'll tell ya um this sunday driver by infinity was so legit for me you guys um there are so many redeeming qualities about this stuff and really there's only a few areas for improvement and i want to talk about those so how i do all of my strain reviews is i rate all these strains out of ten zero being the worst ten being the absolute best i break that down to four different categories look smell taste and potency it's that simple i'll sign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories we'll tally up the total at the end and then i'll give you my final rundown on this stuff anything seven or above is going to get my dank thumbs up approval and then at the very end if it does get seven or above i'll tell you if i would recommend this strain or if i go out and buy this straight again so let's go ahead and start by talking about the looks or bag appeal i want to bring this stuff up on the screen one last time for you guys to check out then we'll go ahead and get into my final review okay so you've seen it multiple times now i don't even have the nug because the nug that i had i smoked already but you guys just saw it it was so crazy because when i went to photograph this i'm like oh that nut it looks so perfect like this then i flip it over i'm like it looks like a completely different strain all together i wanted to take two different do two different photo shoots of this because it was so different the one side was like that light lime green with those bright orange hairs flip it around it looked exactly like purple punch if you've seen purple punch go to any of my strain reviews where i do purple punch or the purple pinot by 22 red check out any purple punch i've reviewed it multiple times and it looks just like that you guys it was very crazy um now here's the thing when i first saw it i was really wowed because i saw it in a bag it was all these small little popcorn nugs and it was just so colorful in the bag and again i told you i picked out the best nugs like oh this is the one i'm gonna take man don't worry i hit him up and gave him a nice nice joint that i hand rolled in return but you guys um it was a beautiful nug it really was um i do think it was machine trimmed just based on what i saw i don't think it was hand trimmed and i will say that it was kind of indicative of that just based on the amount of trichomes on the outside like it seemed like those were just rushed off um which happens when the bud is not hand trimmed and not um you know being handled delicately and being you know well manicured i mean when the buds are roughed up like that you know you lose all those trichomes on the outside of the bud so while this butt did look good i don't think the bud looked great um you know it needed more trichomes for it to look great it had every intention of being great based on the colors based on the bud structure um based on you know the um the like the color of those hairs that offset the bud so nicely i mean great proportions when you break break into the bud there were certainly some trichomes on the inside not as many as there should have been but uh it looked good it didn't look great 2 out of 2.5 now the smell i loved it when i opened the bag that's what won me over i was like oh man it reminded me a lot of that tropical heat or the tropic fire you guys saw me review i've reviewed that multiple times you guys so go back and you know check those reviews out but just really sweet just a flavor combination of fruity flavors um you know is how i would best describe this stuff and then even on the end there was like a little pine or a little heavy gassy flavor it was great um very dynamic and you know not as loud as it could be but man i mean what was there was amazing i mean when i opened that half ounce it was like it smelled amazing i'm gonna give it a 2.5 in the smell um and i only had this one little bud in this bud when i broke up in the bag it smelled really good um and then when you ground it up got even more intensified so yeah 2.5 out of 2.5 now here's where it lost it for me the taste i just had a little bit of those multiple mixture of citrus flavors which you guys know i'm not a huge fan of citrus um it did go down pretty damn smooth um but it just wasn't really flavorful i mean it was really really smooth that first rip had the flavor and i'm not joking i feel like it just died and died and died and like it wasn't that it got super bad prematurely but it just like there wasn't a lot of flavors to discern just kind of like a little subtly sweet air you know citrus air um and i i think while it was good and smooth um and there's some work that needs to be done in the smell or excuse me in the taste department here because to match that smell you gotta match the smell the smell is like so so good and it just didn't translate as well in the taste um could be a freshness issue could be a packaging issue listen um you know i i got this uh that was he said on you know uh on black friday i mean that was ten days ago so imagine t got that 10 days ago um you know i am assuming it was back you know a week or two before that minimum you know i mean this bud could be months old i don't know but it was still fairly fresh but you know again the taste has some work to be done 1.5 out of 2.5 in the potency this is an easy 2.0 it's an easy 2.0 i don't think there's any like i don't i don't have to question it i'm like oh this is a 2.0 it came on pretty damn quick i feel good i feel very medicated i don't feel overly medicated by any means um it could fight for a 2.5 in all honesty i mean just with how i'm feeling like i feel really good i feel happy i feel positive it's a very balanced strain so like i'm still what i like about the strain is like i still feel like myself but i'm still very lifted i don't have that obnoxious pressure on my head i just feel elevated like my whole head and body everything feels elevated my essence and soul feel like i'm lifted um and that's like just good clean medicine um yeah i'm really satisfied with the effects of this stuff so if you've been following it was a 2.5 excuse me i'm so sorry it's a 2.0 on the looks a 2.5 in the smell a 1.5 in the taste and then a 2.0 in the potency it's an 8.0 out of 10. getting our day thumbs up recommendation this sunday drivers absolutely getting our dank thumbs up recommendation from infinity by bloom bloom dispensaries i'll tell you what i'm going to go in there and take advantage of my first time patient i don't know how i've never been there before now i'm looking forward to it um probably honestly you you want to know it's funny this is what you're wondering like would i go pick up some of this again i would go pick up some of this straight again absolutely i would because i would hope that when i got it again i could make sure that it was like a fresh pack um to see if that flavor developed i mean you know how big i am on the terps i want to see if i could get a fresher batch that had better terpenes um you know i would try this again just purely based on the effects alone i feel good i feel medicated and it smells so good and looks so pretty that like it had everything else that i really look for so yeah this would be probably a no-brainer for me to pick up again um at an 8.0 holy cow you guys have you tried the sunday driver by infinity by bloom i think this is some of the best sunday driver i've honestly probably ever had personally um but yeah room for improvement don't get too cocky and arrogant there infinity by bloom 8.0 still means there's work to be done so let me know you guys if you've tried this and what you think of it have you been to bloom let me know you guys are there other strains from them that i need to check out keep me posted i know they do a cool lotta and i have tried akulata and now i'm kind of wondering if maybe the culatta i tried um you know may have been i think it was actually culata times oj so maybe it wasn't maybe i didn't try it from them but regardless um let me know what you guys want to see me review and until the next one you guys take care of yourself and one another and i look forward to seeing you guys soon peace [Music]", "z_wm2gjJX4k": "as you can see it has very nice looking green hairs i mean orange hairs it's a very nice looking light green with bright orange hairs hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now let's get a show thank you for the view yo what's up my stoners welcome to juvenile styles today we are going to be doing wedding cake sunday driver hybrid so check it out on my channel we've already done boom wedding cake white wedding and now we're doing wedding cake sunday driver hybrid it looks very delicious wedding cake was very delicious white wedding was very delicious and this one it smells looks and i guarantee it's going to taste very delicious so let's light this butt up and pull out the bud take a nice look at it and have a nice thorough review of it and have a good time and relax like always this one actually has like a very very sweet taste to it it's actually a very strong taste but it does taste very very sweet it's almost kind of like i don't know what to like kind of like honey a little bit like it's very sweet tasting and it is a very strong flavor as well so these buds are a lot more packed than the last one we did which was campfire og that one was a nice packed bud too but these ones are even more so compressed i think it's because they're a little juicy and sticky too so check them out so it does it is a lighter green too it's a lot lighter green i'm trying to make it so you can have a good look at it it is a very nice looking bud it isn't the biggest but if you can see it has a lot of crystal on it so i'm trying to get it so you can have a closer look because it is a very covered up and crystal is a very nice looking bud so it has this one and this one i already rolled the rest of it so i already rolled the rest of it up in this joint so like the uh campfire oh geez i think i said in the last video i got three of the chem fire og and i got three of the wedding cakes sunday driver the wedding wedding cake sunday driver was only was five bucks more it's not a big deal but the campfire og it was 25 and the wedding cake sunday driver was 30 for three so from my experience you always get what you pay for when you pay a little bit extra you always get a little bit better i mean they're both fire though i mean the chem dog or campfire og was also a very good strain and here i'll put this up right now so you can see that was the bud from the that was the campfire oh gee but if you didn't check see that video that one was just posted so you can go back and check that one out so i gave that one a 3.5 to a 4 out of 5 for overall rating in this one i think i'm going to give it a little bit more it's kind it's a really top-notch bud sorry we had a little issue so i gave the campfire og on the last video i gave that a rating a 3.5 out of four and this one the wedding cake sunday driver has a little bit more stronger of a flavor it seemed to come a little bit less account or not really less account but more compressed buds so i'd say you'd probably be able to get a little bit more out of the kemphar og but the taste and everything else it seems to be a higher amount of thc in the wedding cake sunday driver i believe that kemp iog was 28-ish and the wedding cake sunday driver was 30 32-ish something like that i don't remember i should have wrote it down but it didn't and what the i'll give at least a four for a four to a 4.5 for taste because it is a very delicious strain i am loving the flavor is a very delicious strain and the smell it has a very strong smell it's like kind of like a sweet like it does kind of have like a bit of a honey smell but it has a little bit of a lemony smell but not very much it's not overwhelming like some flavors are but it is very delicious and i'll give i guess i'll just give an overall rating of i'll say at least a 4 to a 4.5 out of a 5 for the wedding cake sunday driver it has a very delicious taste very nice smell to it it's good to count and it's like covered in crystals nice and sticky as hell when you're trying to bust it up so with that i'll leave it there and i hope you all are doing really good in your lives and have some very good [ __ ] to smoke y'all have a good night now peace time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some

That cloudy stuff on your\ngrapes...can you eat that? No, don't do it! Just kidding...Of course you can eat it! That white stuff is called the \"bloom\", a natural waxy coating that protects\ngrapes and things like blueberries and plums from mold and decay. If you rub\nthat coating off, the shelf life of your grapes will plummet...That's why harvesters try not to touch the grapes while they're picking them. So\nis that white stuff the reason why grapes can make your mouth dry? Nope. Those are tannins found in the skin, seeds, and stems. These natural compounds are meant to ward off insects and other predators. But you have nothing to fear. Table grapes have thin skins and small seeds - so, minimal tannins - and, well, the\nonly harm they would do anyway is make your mouth pucker...mua...Hey before you go, click here to check out our sponsor: Fresh Point - they provide top chefs with\ntop produce; and here, for more videos on what your food really is and where it\ncomes from...", "LIyzUVfJpN4": "you hid your vape underneath your pillows yeah and you would come and smoke how often oh I couldn't go longer than like 10 15 minutes without hitting it it was so addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

to say the sunday driver get a little more on there already got the email all set up so let's get a hit in cheers everybody sunday driver by skunk feather uh i did a little research off the first uh initial hit it tastes really good it has a nice uh packs up a nice little punch to it and i have tried skunk feather before uh yeah skunk feather before but i tried like their crumble and stuff like back in the day when i first started going to the dispensaries so i haven't tried their live resin sauces the first time i like the consistency of it it was real smooth and how you get sunday driver is you cross fruity pebbles og with grape pie and it does have like a fruity pebbles type taste to me okay and like over everybody knows two for the review stumbling up on my words right there we're gonna take the next one out of the yoshi rig i really like the yoshi rig it hits [ __ ] really well we're going to get the uh shoddy end this is the green can budweiser holiday edition [Music] i was going to get one out of the karta but this [ __ ] it doesn't like drip down in there you need like crumble or diamonds something with a a different consistency that sauce is too hard to get down in

burps out i like the email so you don't have to do the whole torch thing but i like taking old school dabs i'm not taking them all the same way give you guys a little variety i had a damn frog in my throat these yoshi rigs are pretty expensive i got lucky and wanted a raffle a big i think 25 bucks for it and then an extra 15 for the shipping so like 40 bucks total for this bad boy i looked up on looked him up online there pretty [ __ ] expensive okay let it cool down a little bit so we can get the second hit in so i can get a review for you guys two for the review okay fruity pebbles oh gee crossed with grape pie and it's sunday driver uh like like uh spelled like ice cream sundae not like sunday of the week like day of the week type [ __ ] all right let's go this might be a little hot but let's get it fat dab damn that was a fat ass dad [Music] that one hit me sunday driver okay so start calculating it up price where i got this at blue fire dispensary in merced california it's gonna run you up like 30 bucks for the gram it's a great price the taste i really like it it [ __ ] tastes really good you can taste the terps in it and you take a you know a lower temp dab but it tastes really good the smoothness is there didn't [ __ ] up my throat uh the high is definitely [ __ ] solid i'm getting higher as i'm sitting here so it's a live resin sauce hybrid indica dominant skunk feather let's see so for the sunday driver live resin sauce by skunk feather i'm gonna give it the even eight i really like it it has good terps to it it got me uh pretty [ __ ] baked nothing really negative to say about it the the sauces are really messy they're hard to put like in the car loser and stuff like that so that's like the only knock other than that it's a really good strain if you guys are into live resin sauces or into the strained sundae driver i highly recommend it the skunk feather sunday driver live resin sauce i'm giving it to eight that was my review i hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town", "2Wvb6fw2xKU": "hey guys what up its apex today I'm bringing you a review of rocket fuel by Cresco hybrid strain it was like testing at what like 84 85 % definitely a nice piney smell to it not offensive at all a little glob Arino going right here slide that little bugger off right there so I can get it nice and place down and today we're going to be using a nectar collector because it is the simplest thing to do right now I don't want to break out me dye my titanium even though it's plugged in and everything I just don't want to deal with that a rather deal of a torch something tactile something something fiery okay smear it all over there this extra sure always make sure you close your lids before you take a damn because these can spill please bear with me when I get this torch ready I had to do the most sketchy yes hahaha we have fire you in there so I don't lose you now titanium starts to cherry-red Titanium's at about a thousand degrees so our goal here is basically to heat it cherry-red enough that it retains enough heat to basically counteract me getting to this dad it's basically the idea definitely Pawnee Jaime and urfi are really the flavors I get out of this on this nectar collector the airflow on it is such that it makes it super cool you barely taste it sometimes I will admit that's my second dab of this so far today if I did be honest with you guys right now it's a 4 out of 10 it's just below getting me to feeling Medicaid it on it's definitely not on beer it's definitely not like back in the mine type thing it's definitely you can feel it your you can you're feeling you're getting high on definitely have more of a body high it's starting from here outward and now it's only just starting to get up this is definitely more indica than sativa right now on yeah definitely way more indigo its facts at least for me so you stay so now I'm gonna scrape up some of this gloopy gloop that is left over from nectar collecting and I'm gonna take a traditional port's tab of the banger just making sure I get as much as possible and it is alright to put these silicone mats after you nectar clicked with them in the freezer so they harden up so it's easier to collect because some of these concentrates after you like heat them up once they just become possible I deal with or more pass through make sure I get all of it on the end here there we go it's beautiful set that right here you see how dangerous this is guys don't don't be me that's how you do it know what let's get another one going this and we'll see where we're at from there because I feel like a nectar collector on some things is a it's the way it hits I could sometimes you know it's not just the potency you know it's the way it hits sometimes I don't know why but guess it's just that you know what and this stuff is really like thick you know it's like this league they're saying this is what works this is more like a really thick butter but it is reliable it is nice it melts slower than I than usual which I love yeah cuz this is the last one I'm doing until I can forget it later [Applause] [Applause] okay I'm gonna close this out because I'm at the camera at the end of my camera reel it's been a pecs it's been real peace I'll give it a six out of ten for right now I'll let you know more on Instagram", "Ra2EY9giECc":

the time hey it helps very much I greatly appreciate all you guys thank you all so much for the love on the merch drop let's dive right into it so today's video we are talking about a growing problem that I have been noticing more and more in my DMS we're talking about fake exotic now some of you guys out there might be wondering what the [ __ ] is fake exotic but I assume most you guys know what I'm talking about here we're talking about those cookies packs the runts packs the jungle boys packs that are obviously not real those are the main three but there's a bunch of other like fake packaging brands where they aren't actually real weed brands it's just packaging companies that sell the [ __ ] to anyone right now for those of you guys who are uninformed there is a very large trend going around in the weed smoking community where people will take some fairly decent weed and put it in a fake knockoff dispensary look-alike bag and then sell it for $50 an 8 which is unacceptable absolutely ridiculous so today we're gonna break down how to differentiate between a fake and a real bag and we're also gonna talk about some information that you guys probably need to know about this now first and foremost I'd like to say here that if you were cab going to buy weed from your plug and he's ever got some some quote-unquote exotic that is prepackaged in a bag like this you should generally run to the [ __ ] hills you should fly as far away as you can you know what snitch on that [ __ ] guide you'd call twelve six nine that dude bro [ __ ] that guy alright he's selling fake [ __ ] and here's why 99% of the time this is exactly what happens people will go on sites like DHgate or Aliexpress or Amazon and they will buy a bunch of these fake bags these pre-made bags from [ __ ] Wuhan or some [ __ ] right get them mailed to him open them up seal them all you know fill them up with some decent bud and ate the bud seal them up and sell them now there's one dead giveaway to these bags that really tells you right off the bat that they're fake right and I don't here's the thing before I ever made this video I figured that a lot of this stuff is like really self-explanatory but ever since I made my reviewing subscribers weed series I've received a concerning amount of DMS of people like flexing these fake bags like a shocking amount of DMS which I feel need to clarify this the number one way to tell if your cookies runts or jungle boys or any kind of pack is fake is to look at the coloring that is the number one way the best example of the throw on here I think there's two in particular that are always a really easy way to tell we're gonna use cookies as our first example here we're gonna use the gelati and the sticky buns bags now you look at sticky buns in gelati right the colors are very vibrant the legitimate bags the colors are super vibrant popping gelati in particular it's a different color for each letter of the word right super vibrant colors and you guys have to remember that with all of these weed companies with all of these legitimate real-deal packaging's right the colors are always really gonna stand out the colors are gonna pop like crazy like it's meant to draw your tension in right so they're gonna use high quality coloring high quality printing on the real bags on the fake ones now the reason I use sticky bouncing gelotti's because it's so easy to tell with these to write the colors always come out faded or dim and worst case scenario they're not even the same shade right but essentially every time when you're buying these fake bags you have to realize they're printing these in a lower resolution right they are printing these with very like just worse material worse quality then the real brands are using right and that's gonna reflect in the print right and the best way to look is just honestly even go online right go on if you guys live in Cali you know go on the cookies website and look at some of their information on there or watch youtube videos where people have some real packaging and do a compare and contrast and you'll note it's almost right off the bat that the colors are [ __ ] I mean even from the images that I've thrown on screen in the past couple minutes here you guys should be able to tell in my side-by-sides that yeah it's it's a pretty blatant Lorde particularly the sticky buns and I I did my research here pretty much every single print of the fake sticky buns I could find had this [ __ ] coloring right and all of them do cereal milk is another really bad offender a cookie strain and then you move on to other brands right let's look at runts and jungle boys for a minute right runts is another one that is pretty obvious because runts their packaging is arguably even more vibrant and popping than cookies right their packaging is just color just Bank Bank BAM right and with them once again just look at the brightness in the contrast of those colors right look at the look at the resolution of the print actually look up close and see okay it is that resolution bad you know is it almost like blurry you know when you when you look at it real closely because you know if I were to take for example I've got a cookies bag on my shelf actually here if I take this bag and I look at I hold it really close to my eyes that text doesn't look like it's bad quality or blurry like I don't have to hold it far away from my face to read it as clearly as I could imagine right 20/20 I can hold it as close as I want and that text still looks great quality with a fake bag that will almost never be the case if you look very closely at the bag you'll notice like hey that image is kind of blurry right it's not looking good but moving on from comparing the bags like I said there the comparison in looking closely at that that kind of blurriness is the best way there's another one that people seem to look past quite often I don't know if people look past it or if they just don't give a [ __ ] but the second one here now this is how it is an Illinois right with every bag that I've gotten of cookies in the state of Illinois yeah cookies did recently come to Illinois it's a very new development but mine dispensary guided him for the first time like two months ago I think but either way with my bag it says resealable at the top right but there's a little like safety seal that you have to pull to actually open up the bag to make it then resealable right that's how the real bags are for example think of like a bag of beef jerky right you pull that you pull the little tab off the top little strip that you have to peel like a bag of cheese from the store right peel that little strip then you can open it and reseal it right it's the same thing with real cookies bags as far as I'm aware now correct me if I'm wrong in Cali but the Illinois bags which they are actually a little bit different from the Cali ones they are like that right and that's what I've seen from a lot of my friends who are in California too now I'm not up to date on packaging I know cookies changes their packaging a lot as do a lot of these other companies to try to outsmart the you know counterfeit so of course but as far as I'm aware that is a thing pretty much consistently on almost all of these bag companies right these companies that use bags instead of a glass container right these fake ones won't have that these fake ones you'll be able to just no safety thing to pull you know nothing to avoid it you'll be able to just yank it right the [ __ ] open right there will be no thing right there will be no thing to peel off that's like a safety thing typically bags will have that and some bags some real bags you'll be able to open without that I'm not saying all bags are like that but most bags will have something like that to indicate to you that it's already been opened if there isn't anything like that that is a huge red flag and you should really really look closer at that bag but moving on from ways to tell it apart from being real or fake let's talk about the real problem with these kinds of things the biggest problem that I have with these fake cookies fake runs fake exotic fake cally packs is that half the time the weed that people are putting in these isn't even bad that's the thing with a lot of these other fake branded things like edibles or concentrates a lot of times it's bunk or it's fake but what I seem to be noticing is a common trend is whenever people put the weed in these bags it's actually pretty decent right it's not it's not always swag and by the way a little tip here I've gotten a shocking amount of UK viewers European viewers who are sending in cookies bags and runts bags I hate to break it to you if you don't live in America you're not smoking cookies I'd nobody is [ __ ] importing the Gary Payton to the UK all right nobody's taking the gelati and shipping it on a boat past customs over to UK all right I hate to break it to you nobody's doing that for a bunch of eighths all right I just I hate to break your heart right but either Webb back on topic you're only UK viewers put the cookies back down right now throw the bag away take the weed out of its decent but back on topic here a lot of the bud that these people are putting into these bags is not bad and that's my problem see back in high school when I first started smoking it was never like this there was no fake Cali bags there was just like carts were just hitting the market in Illinois when I I like was starting smoking right like like carts were just starting to become a thing in Illinois as far as I remember like nobody was hitting them right like like I got lucky and got one early on when I was younger in high school right but like nobody was [ __ ] hitting them and all of a sudden as times gone on right as times progressed these fake bags have become a thing and I miss the good old days when you could just go to the plug and you can just get that bass that gas right out of the plastic bag I don't know I just had passed I'm baked as [ __ ] dude that's like a fat dab of some mag landrace dude I'm like I'm tweaking right now but either way back on topic here so I I just I miss being able to go to the plug and know that I'm getting the best [ __ ] he has straight out the bag right nowadays it's difficult to find a plug that isn't sound this kind of [ __ ] an a in bet here come all the [ __ ] heroes of cannabis who are gonna come in the comments like Mary a goblin huh makes me laugh that you don't have a plug my plug hundred pounds of Kali Zaza ten dollars right hey keep that [ __ ] out of the comments but really it's become a lot harder for the average smoker to find a plug that isn't selling these [ __ ] bags whereas if four years ago that same plug was probably selling that same weed but for a better price and out of a plastic bag like it should have been done and that's my biggest problem here and I want to make this little segment of the video here a call to action all the plugs out there everyone cuz listen this is the Goblin viewer vase okay if you guys are gonna sit here and act like you're not drug dealers you're wrong I know a good chunk you guys sell drugs right so I'm gonna lay it out right now all you plugs out there sell your weed out the bag don't sell it out of the fake [ __ ] sell it right out of that vacuum seal right out of that ziplock dude sell it the old classic way scale it out put it in a plastic baggie give it to your cost to you don't prepackaged this [ __ ] dude and harass and shame other plugs who do cyberbully them if you see a plug selling this [ __ ] swipe up on his story and say damn dude I didn't know you sold schwag in a bag nice bro just absolutely ruin his [ __ ] day because listen the plugs you sell this kind of [ __ ] they always have like egos about their bud they're always like man I'm selling real Cali all the rest of y'all are selling fake so if you guys just [ __ ] cyberbully I'm a little bit and tell them it's swag in a [ __ ] bag they're gonna lose their marbles I guarantee it it's gonna be content for everybody so chat not I'm so used to streaming dude I said chat Jesus Christ ladies and gentlemen the comments section harass your plug selling these fake bags and remember two important takeaways from this video 1 get your bags from a dispo there's no real reason that anyone would ever sell an authentic cookies bag on the street and 2 if you really are in the position to buy one of these if you're in the position where this is your best option before you give that plug money ask him to take it out of the bag and sell it to you for a real price because I guarantee the plug might even respect that a little bit a I'm not trying to get y'all killed out there but hey I've had I've had experiences where I've had bad times with plugs and I'll hit them back up and I'll be like you know do you just serve me some bunk and a lot of times sometimes I'll be like oh my bad and they want to keep you as a customer right so be like oh [ __ ] they'll understand a smart plug will realize oh this guy knows what he's talking about he's gonna be a comeback customer because he's an experienced right but a dumb plug would be like I'll [ __ ] you so a give that a little try that's my recommendation but ladies and gentlemen hope you guys enjoyed this video hope you guys got some information out of this that you might not have known before thank you guys for watching drop a like oh and also don't forget to cop merch if you haven't already ladies and gentlemen do not forget make an investment link to the top description hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did and I will see you guys next time peace", "2Nvj70U1AdA": "what is up guys I'm the 4/20 gamer and I'm back with another video today we went to one of our favorite collectives in Los Angeles called TLC TLC has oil refinery CO wax and we got some really awesome waxes all sugar trim which is their lower shelf we're on a budget but TLC makes them good as budget wax today we're gonna try the Sunday driver I actually don't know anything about Sunday driver at all so there's gonna be a pretty fresh experience tasting this I have my email set at 6:40 let's see how this goes let me tell you guys what I smell I get sweet definitely sweet it looks like a musky sweet and musky I think going I'll tell you guys what I taste Cheers Sunday driver is a unique strain by the jungle boys it's made from fruity pebbles and grape pie fruity pebbles is a hybrid that keeps you happy and relaxed grape pie is also hybrid and is combination of grape stomper and cherry pie great stomper that's a sativa dominant hybrid and you get grape diesel and sweet flavor notes out of grape stomp cherry pie is GDP and urban poison and it's also hybrid that is sweet berry and earthy so Sunday driver is a combination of fruity pebbles and grape pie and grape pie is a combination of grape stomper and cherry pie so this strain should be something right away you get that sweet flavor of a mix of all of those things so it's definitely a hybrid I want to say it's leaning towards the indica side it's definitely sweet and I get a little berry out of it that would be my guess oh yeah this is the new gabber cool we got glass dabber cool with a carbon cap and I think it was very cool so we recently bought more attachments for bubble gum we bought this drop down and a smoke shop it has a male 14 point five millimeter joint right here and a female 18 point five millimeter joint I wanted to start collecting some reclaim down here without it affecting or touching the water at all I use disjoint instead of this joint so if this joint were to break it would only cost $12 it also lets me use any of my vapes that has an 18 point five millimeter male joint and my VAP XL is one of those I have a 14.5 millimeter adapter two 1855 millimeter adapter in this

review I got the Sunday drivers sauce Sunday driver is pretty good strain I had it from a bunch of different extract companies already so I have a good idea of what this strange should taste like and today I'm gonna be trying this sauce sauce has really gotten popular recently sauce is a mixture of THC crystals and terpenes really interesting texture and flavor is pretty intense with sauce the facts are really refined too you get like a pure THC kind of effect so right away this container it looks pretty good I hate when people sell quality extracts and put it in a really cheap container oil extracts is not cheap out with this container just a pretty good sturdy container it's a glass container with just a black plastic lid on top and it put their little sticker logo we're gonna be judging the looks the smell the taste and the effects of this Sunday drivers sauce today so I'm just gonna go ahead and open this container of sauce look at that it looks really nice you can see all the Diamonds shining like glitter in this yellow orange sauce looks really nice so you see a bunch of undissolved like solids in a golden amber liquid looks really good it is in turns flux I give this sauce a 4.5 out of 5 it looks pretty good there are some other jars with bigger THC crystals and I also dab the biggest one from earlier so there's not too much big crystals left but I always say this looks pretty good Sunday driver is a mix between fruity pebbles OG and grape pie fruity pebbles OG is a hybrid that is sweet tropical and very like grape eye is like hybrid between cherry pie and grape stomper and has a sweet crepe like taste these two strains combine together to make a deliciously sweet grape like flavor with a punch of diesel to your face right away when you open this container of wax and start to smell the sauce you instantly get that diesel smell you get a sweet berry like smell with hints of grape this Sunday driver smells pretty good when it comes to this Sunday driver sauce from quail extracts I give it a 4 point 4 out of 5 in terms of smell this thing smells so good you just kind of want to smell it a lot I think that most of the smell is coming from this orange terpene liquid because I believe the THC crystals are odorless if I remember correctly now that I'm done judging its looks and its smell now it's time to taste this Sunday driver sauce got my Mobius already got a pretty big sized tab ready now Cheers I'm the 4/20 gamer Oh No well Cheers I'm a four-time gamer [Music] the sauce tastes exactly like it smells with that diesel coming through and you also get a subtle hint of berry greatness pretty good I would definitely recommend this straight tastes really good it's Sunday driver quail extracts in terms of taste I would give this training four out of five check it out Sunday driver oil extracts about 10 minutes have passed I can start to feel some of the body effects of the string and I'm also I also feel way more relaxed there's a tingly before feeling throughout my body about 10 minutes and and I ready filled uplifting effects that makes me feel relaxed and giggly I can see this stream working really well for stress or relaxing after a long day of work in terms of effects I give the sunny driver sauce like whale extracts a 4.6 out of 5 overall the Sunday driver gets a 4.6 out of 5 it's a must try thank you guys

take a look at old pal here and this is dou C does indica didn't seem very into Kush though it seems pretty upbeat very happy and this is from old pal classic shareable flower and so far I'm pretty pressed little pal the cartridges are you impressed - right smoked this before is pretty impressive so I guess will that you take a look at that I mean 425 1/8 Nevada you really can't beat that probably cheap medium cheaper in California so well it's up we'll see how it smokes all right old pal Zedan tell us island t-shirt yes did you get that well it was free I won it from the casino guide or did you win it with someone else commands old house smooth it's really smooth top shelf a bottom shelf price yeah it's like back of the day like what people pay for bids this is like this is top top shelf man this is just as good as any other premium weed you know - greatest values we got old pal in this RV look at this RV humble abode really it is man not a single crack hole really really tasty immediately it's good effects though buddy old pal oh wow and so they call it shareable because it's cheap you know so chairs but yeah I say if people were sharing before they were sheisty yeah they're about really they were not really your friends I can say if someone only ever shows up with a blonde trap and never any weed it's not really no they should go to jail there's a new jail sentence that really just only brings a rap though they're absolutely what the [ __ ] oh they take some elves we try to put as much together yeah it's like really just hang on the bunt forever to like someone just like you some in Abunda circle and thing like dude it's only five there's five people here yeah hang on grass so pal what are you gonna give it to big thumbs up to big thumbs up to big thumbs up rope out yeah even standard price is just totally good and that's the thing would that you with me I'm dealing with California and we got the pure of eight oh my god those pure vape surges in East LA and those were the budget thing and those sucked yeah it was budget the pure one syringes were so weak that even at half price it got you like a quarter of the high it wasn't even a good value I would I would have way rather paid I think I paid thirty for a full gram I would rather bought like a root cartridge and paid forty five bucks or forty bucks for a half gram and wouldn't last longer than pure as real gram and that's the problem of some of the budget [ __ ] the budget says sometimes sucks yeah both pal exception to the rule totally man yeah she doesn't mean good with old pal cheap she means so really good still good really good yeah we have old pal carts too don't we yeah we've been hitting anything like I wonder how these other companies are gonna compete if old pal keeps getting a stock like it's good enough that it's like it's not worth you know maybe I would still get it sometimes just to try the stuff but on the regular I would probably just get old pal because for 25 bucks I mean it's just almost as good as everything else I would say though that I do think some of the other brands are a little bit better on I think remedies weed was a little better than this but is it worth twice as much no no or the cartridge the cartridge worth twice as much no no and honestly the the old pals it is that is better than a lot of the other expensive watch as well yeah so so bow easy I know pal give us some cheap weed basically giving you a wholesale price at the retail yeah that's a - big thumbs up roach little pal thanks for watching I'm gonna give you

sorry i almost forgot what we were doing but yeah uh the other day i opened this on stream um and i was you know i was really hoping to save the opening of this for a video but you know couldn't help everyone's saying try it out on stream and um honestly zero regrets i've been looking for buddies for so long and i'm just i'm just super super satisfied with the way this this hit this this turned out like like i'll tell you guys right now i've been looking for buddies a buddy's car for like four months now i saw it first on a simplistic youtube channel and i was like whoa this looks crazy like i'm not big on distillates uh some of you guys know that some of you guys don't i kind of quit cartridges for the first time or the first time i started trying cartridges i quit because i didn't really like distillates and i had no idea what live resin or cured resin was at the time and so now that i know what live resin and cute resin is i've gotten more into cartridges and since i've gone back into cartridges got back into this lids so without further ado let's take our hit of this and i'll discuss you know what we normally discuss the flavors and you know what i'm feeling about it so everyone out there at home please pack yourself a bowl pack yourself a dab get your pen ready open your bag of chips whatever it is get your your water i don't know we're all just gonna you know cheers together and yeah so cheers boys for a distillate the flavor and that is impeccable like i'm really impressed with this buddies card stuff like before i tried this right you guys were able to see on the channel i was able to try another canon striped terpenes type cart it was a stizzy pot the i tried the grape sorbet and the super glue silver lines dizzy pods and the one thing i'll say about them in comparison to this buddies is that they don't have like they don't hold a candle they don't hold a candle of this i've only had one this is my very first buddies i'm not even done not even done with it and already i can tell you guys that this is much better than the stizzy derived cannabis terpene or stizzy cannabis derived terpenes line um and this is my honest opinion guys like i was expecting so much more when i um got the cannabis to drive terpenes pods from stizzy i was expecting so much more i spent like 70 bucks per gram 70 75 bucks per gram for them and um it just was it just didn't didn't hit as hard as i thought it would you know i wasn't expecting it to knock me out like a [ __ ] truck or anything like that right but i was expecting the flavor to be very very very very nice like there were a lot of people who were telling me like it's comparable to live resin carts which i thought was a stretch i think that's a stretch in in any in most regards like even even this distillate with cannabis derivatives this doesn't this doesn't really hold a candle to the flavor that you can get from eyebrows and cartridges right but this is still very very good yeah i get a lot of sweetness tones or sweet tones from this you know tiny little bit of tartness and there a little bit of sour um and pininess yeah so another good thing about buddies cards is that on the back of their packaging they've got the terpene profile right there for you so you know maybe not ex exactly you kind of know exactly what flavors you'll get with just looking at the back of this so the back of this right we've got ter profile 2.61 limonene 1.25 percent limonene is a terpene that is responsible for that lemony citrusy flavor um a mirror scene i think if i'm if i'm remembering this correctly i will correct myself later but mirror scene is the sweet stuff that's the generalized okay just i'm generalizing and pining the piney stuff so all that pine soul whatever piney taste that i've been talking about that's that's actual stuff yeah so that's that's what the most i can say about this you know buddies card so far i like it it's got great flavor it's better so far in terms of flavor and effect than the cannabis drive terpene pods from sizzy so yeah let's take another hit of this and um see if i can find anything different in terms of its flavor for you guys so yeah cheers everybody that pininess really sticks out in the uh the initial taste i didn't really comment too much about that but yeah i think it starts again nice piney lemony citrusy kind of flavor and then it finishes off with some very nice sweet tartness which is kind of like a candy really really nice so yeah i highly recommend you guys try a buddy's distilled cannabis oil with cannabis derived or distilled cannabis oil with cannabis derived terpenes cartridge this this stuff is really good sorry i'm kind of big like i can't even speak properly it's it's already affecting me yeah i've been it's i'm just really happy with being able to find something and not being disappointed with it um i was a little disappointed with the silver lines dizzy pods but i'm gonna give them another chance for sure because you know i just might not lie to i might not have liked the strain but yeah legend og watermelon skittles card this one's definitely a must try i mean i've had watermelon skittles a lot of times but in its live resin caviar form so having it in this uh this little can this little oil form is pretty nice yeah that should about wrap it up for this really quick cart review you know nothing too in-depth just just letting you guys know how i feel about it we'll definitely get more in depth when we get to a cart comps with this uh be on the lookout for that we'll be doing a cart comps between this buddy's cart and uh the very next cart you guys see in our individual cart reviews that that's going to be the one that will stack up so they're going to be some pretty hard hitters yeah thanks everyone for watching and we'll take one more hit for the road for you guys cheers oh yeah thank y'all for watching and we're going to see you on the next one for

nice man I like the relaxes powerful seems like a fat round flat [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] later I love your stuff I'm a supporter I like the stuff I like very nice body Phil like oh it's not to be a hybrid I'd say but I don't know very good the taste all the taste was very well the first on the first day but when I reheated it and hit it on the second one I had that like crap your burnt taste but that first initial wax is fire we're gonna try through the puffs that later you guys are all I got so with you guys three days later here we go we're gonna try through the puffs go is there any left oh yeah fruit medley it tasted good through the rig don't get me wrong one bit but let's charge through the old puffer it's not a new porcelain piece in every ceramic whatever it is but I torched it down to freshest completely so it's totally clean so we're gonna get the full taste of this baby taps I haven't even used this is probably a minute it seems like a minute I think I did yesterday but I've never tried this through fruit medley 85.1% Liberty was she should [Music] turbine [Music] [Music] yeah Hawaii better tations you're tough though just push the button then

stupid thing is that why would they leave that open circuit you guys are awesome have a wonderful day make sure you hit that subscribe button make sure you hit that like button make sure you hit that Bell and oh and the shirts really expensive I love you", "OmPpUx08RwY": "[Music] something I simplistic here back with another video and I know I said I wasn't going to include prices and stuff into my into my titles by figured you know other youtubers have prices and I feel like maybe the prices and titles didn't really affect my second channel from getting the lead is just a more eye appealing or eye-catching title when there's like the price in the in the title I just don't know why it just seems to get much more views basically this is going to be a comparison between two $20 waxes that I got from the club's recently you might have seen them in video it's already I don't know why I'm going to be uploading this but it's probably going to be after I reviewed those ones individually but the waxes in question are let's just see so I got two of each just put things so I mean you can see right here I have a gram of each well now not all of them are full grams anymore but as you can see I got two grams of each brand and they were both $20 so this is the reason why I am comparing them they're both the same price and we're just gonna see which one I like better I'm pretty sure you guys Brady know which one I like better but we're just gonna do it for this video as well so for the first one we got the quest go so we're gonna do the worst first I guess and as you can see right here that's you bet this is their strawberry banana which I barely have any left so please bear with me I'm going to try and uh zoom in you can see very sugary consistency and just show this one more actually hold that dot guys I am actually just switch my battery because it's low so this is the chunky diesel very sugar waxy twenty dollars this was and it is a live sugar so the consistency you can see very very stable and let me just take a hit of it he knows I'm just balance this a little bit my trusty utility in you guys already know the deal like I love this piece I really do black rings are [ __ ] nuts we're just going to get at this one we're going to say best strawberry banana I mean it's not like it tastes better anything but it's the only I barely have that much left of it so you know did I use what you have more even though it's not like particularly any good I guess alright but there's not too much flavoring and I think I mentioned it in those videos as well when I review them I mean the first initial taste was kind of second taste is all right but for waxes it doesn't really I'm not looking for a wax that gets better over time I'm looking for a whack that good off the first day [Music] like I said not too Pleasant in terms of taste or terpenes but not bad and you know I've had worse I'm had why's that you sleep under trash but this one's acceptable you know for 20 dollars I'm not too upset and it didn't taste all that great because you know like I said it's only twenty dollars if I would've paid thirty for this and it's trash yeah then I would be a little bit upset but all-in-all crystal is pretty good I just feel a little cheated because after I bought this I bought bear and it just blows out those out the park and it's the same price I'll be it you know they were at different dispensaries but they're both around the same price I feel like if fresco was that fee knows where I bought the bear stuff it'd be priced around the same maybe even lower I don't know when you guys know my history with fresco I wanted to try their cartridges and then they're basically douche bags to me so but this is not gonna reflect just like on the review it does not reflect what I think about their products you know I thought to you know if I didn't like if I really didn't care for them I wouldn't have bought two maybe not because at the time this was the best place to buy wax because everything else was in 30% off at other places so you know sometimes you just want to spend 20 bucks you don't have to even want to break another bill another 20 just to spend 25 on some [ __ ] you know now we got the good stuff we got there and this is botanical extracts and research labs guys and this is basically acronym but they use that it you know worked out it spells bear they got their right here this is their purple punch and I believe banana cream pie and these are full-spectrum boys full-spectrum for $20 you can't really like you can't really get that unless it's like I think bright Labs is full spectrum but the taste for bright Labs is uncompelled to this I'm saying when you just open these be these are running about be percent keeps the ugly it's definitely not bad you're just gonna so this is the purple punch guys this reminds me that the consistency that you would see in 710 labs like that very buttery a clean-looking butter eat look you know I'm saying my lewis [ __ ] and it smells phenomenal smells like purple punch for sure this is the banana the banana the bananas a bit darker than the the Provo punch and not as tasty but still nonetheless really really really really chirpy for for what it is you know full spectrum let's get let's get a double let's get it triple there you go hopefully you guys can see we'll take a hit at both you know they're gonna end the video here just a comparison video I do these videos to help you choose the best product for you at a reasonable price you know a lot of people complain that oh you only get them the Bunco leader or whatever it's like first of all we doesn't last meal what like it lasts me probably like hours just an hour or not even that long okay so what's the point in me getting like these crazy like [ __ ] designer strains that cost $50 an eighth and then I'm done with it for now you know don't get me wrong on the flowers it's probably phenomenal you know but flowers don't last me long you know and when I do get wheat I try to get a deal where I could just smoke out my homies because not a lot of us are buying weed nowadays and when we were craving weed it's when we're out in the city and we just want to smoke a joint you know but other than that it's just a waste of it's not a waste of money don't get me wrong but it doesn't last as long as wives get my drift this is the promo punch cheers guys god damn that's tasty that tastes like fruit spunk like no lie like if you ever see bear and you see purple punch get like I don't say that much [ __ ] takes me this is why we try to conserve this as much as possible but we're gonna take the hit of the banana cream pie now and we're gonna call the video just the video it's it's more of a side by side $20 wax I guess or I don't know if it was more of a comparison because you guys already know when my opinion was on all the B's and which one I liked better banana cream pie cheers this is my wake and bake as well guys so hopefully you guys are waking and baking with me Cheers all right guys [Music]", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back

couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know

my dad pin videos or most of my dad pin videos people were saying they were fake and everything i was still getting like really high so i'm guessing like fake is just like fake brand like it's off brand the effect was still there but now 90 for a rail cart this is select elite that's the brand crack open this sprite sprite ain't even that good of a tasting drink i'm not gonna lie it's just not that many competitors i say competitors compete competitors so yesterday i got sent to my whip finally flick him off they wanted me to see him or me and at first i was a little bit wary on like getting the windshields in it like i'm like shot do it worth it i did it and i definitely like it like now that i did it's like damn there's no way going back it's like no other car i get will not have windshield tip now it's like a must but that's how i feel right now i feel like windshield 10 is great [ __ ] drop the [ __ ] dab pin [Music] all right it looks like it's so good but that's concrete could have cracked the cart oh my god this cracked especially because this is glass like see it got the glass tip on there that looks fancy i like that um i made a video like sitting in my car and i'm pretty sure like it was right here wearing the same shirt and i really made a video it was called why i stopped smoking dab pins and literally here i am smoking a dab pen how hypocritical with me well yeah that is really true like i am kind of a hypocrite for that but basically it used to be like i would smoke like a dead pen like every day like how i do weed and [ __ ] but um yeah i don't really smoke it that often this actually i talked a lot of bad about it and i don't want to like really influence no one's opinion because like even if i say these are bad what if i might get one again like this to right here is that drill like road trip i would take this for sure um any like place where i'm going for like a long time and i can't like bring weed or bring a joint but um let me go outside get a thumbnail it's important all right got the photos got the thumbnail let's hit this a few more [Music] times [Music] wake up in the morning [Music] is [Music] [Music] i got the door open it's vape coming out you could kind of it's a vape high box i didn't even know you could do that it don't really got to smell like that so it's so convenient but we just still better like i feel like i still have a fun time with weed with friends like just smoking a joint especially with gas but um this is still cool this is like a substitute teacher it will never be like we but it's a good substitute even though i got a real cart now and this ain't fake me hitting this a few times i'm still like similarly as high as i was when the other videos when i hit it a few times even though those weren't official name brand carts they still did the same thing and they were a lot cheaper but this is a lot safer because it's like official and it's like sold in store so it's like made shorts proper and everything but it's like they taxing i feel like the same as the street carts in a way see yeah oh [ __ ] oh my god is it worth the 90 it's weird like i don't even know i might buy one again but it's not gonna be anytime soon like that i'm gonna buy one whenever this one runs out but this is probably gonna last a while because i don't use it every day now this feels like safe i feel like actually comfortable because it like tastes better and i'm saying certified i would probably try if you can yes spin the 90 when it's like it is kind of a lot but buy other things with it so it like blends in like you get other things on top of it like instead of getting like an ounce or a half ounce of one string just getting multiple eighths of different strings maybe something like that it's pretty cool you can just try a new train every day mix and match we are going to work hard in life and sunday driver cart review i would give it a 9 out of 10. it was 90 one gram cart hey that's

use that I have a bit icky early for two years I don't know that was their moment that the lion impacts or the cantaloupe so YouTube right so is the sky clear or blue question everybody have noticed that I was talking about cantaloupe is that a cantaloupe yeah the sky is clear you know there's no it's no coating is the question does this clouds have ever been real I believe so how as far as I know there's been a being always manipulating something going on precipitation precipitation that's got a ring oak all of it it does have to rain but you've raised without clouds I'm just saying sometimes wouldn't be the thing is that's a idea in Georgia though with radar but here here a storm pops up out of nowhere a tiny dark cloud I mean I know they say yeah storms come from dark clouds but [ __ ] I saw a machine making clouds and it's like okay hydrogen clouds maybe no it wasn't hydrogen it wasn't hydrogen dissipates once it touches you know what I'm saying once he gets in the atmosphere and all that crap like that vaporize harder than I thought it it looks like smoke if it's the vapor disappears for that one - it won't stay in the sky that's why they call it uh chemtrails and contrails contrails of the vapor the vapor disappears but chemtrails they stay in the air and I'm not saying that they make clouds from chemtrails but I have seen them go across the sky with you came true and three hours later that should have spread out like this yeah I said in forms or zooming cloud but they have a machine dude that [ __ ] [ __ ] sits on the ground oh Jesus crazy some dude was like it's gonna rain in Mississippi or some [ __ ] a video [ __ ] all right they made that just like yeah it's gonna rain they call our they call this seeding looks the sky they actually put an article on the body in like 92 or 93 they said they were going to see the sky because there was a drought or some crap like that don't quote me on it though I know it was somewhere around the years or whatever but they literally put an article on paper saying that they seeded the sky and that my friends like they manipulated the weather say yeah we see this guy I need to see this guy Hannah summertime just make us some clouds that joke is a trip though have everybody fooled I hear tell the people organic it's not organic but if it's not organic is non-gmo bought organic is that right in the grocery store not the Hat g/mol nobody had organic no that's it yeah I have it because people weren't all into it some people were but you know what they used to call those people crazy but wasn't real was a fake was a fake all of the weed was the first strawberry peak there's been a time where strawberries weren't able to grow in specific areas that strawberries grow right and they had to come up with the CD or they had to harvest seeds from the strawberry right so the NASA next generation but what if they're grown in indoors hydroponically once they start growing it indoors hydroponically that strawberry is not its original self anymore that suck is coming from a lab though even if it's just hydroponics was just a tube of water so we're like that even if it's just that I wanna know who

this is recreational 420 or we give you the most in-depth reviews as efficiently as possible and today we're not this tangi Xfire alien or live resin bye once again cash value as you guys know this is one of my favorite companies so with that let's hop right into the numbers so thca let me zoom in and get this all nice and clear for you guys boom there we go THC a comes in an eighty point four eight percent Delta 9 THC comes in a two point two percent with the total THC coming in at seventy two point eight if you don't understand why there's three different numbers for THC there is gonna be a video linked at the bottom of this towards the end that goes over that and I highly encourage you to check that out but I also encourage you to keep in mind that I don't buy my cannabis based off of THC if I did there's a chance that I might go past this one considering the fact that there stuff that claims to be ninety eight ninety seven ninety nine percent THC on the shelf but I just know that there's so much more to cannabis than just the THC alone and that I just kind of ignore that number and I go for the other things that I know affect the high kind of like the look and the way if you know we'll go into it and further videos but this is the terpene breakdown they do include this for you I won't go through and name each and every single one of these you guys can check them out right there feel free to pause do some googling and see what each one of these does because each one of these has a different effect and it does something a little bit different so always worth checking out with all that I'm gonna go ahead and open this up let me zoom back out so we're gonna go ahead and pop this open as you guys know they always have their sort oil right here and this is me opening it up and do this alright so let's see what we got going on so as far as this stuff is concerned it looks beautiful look at that color let's see so this is a live resin and it's got no man look at the way that looks the granules on there are so nice I almost thought this was like those THCA dipped in like terpene stuff almost and I was like wait a minute no it's not as far as the flavor is concerned this smells like mango oh my god this smells like mango mixed with like a little bit of skunk enos Oh oh man that is fruity that is incredibly fruity I don't think I've ever smelled a concentrate that smells this fruity it's like yeah it's like mango cantaloupe kind of like one of those like fresh tropical type fruits with that I am incredibly excited to go check this out and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this went [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so I went ahead and tried that tangi Xfire alien Arkell sorry that's a really long name and try to remember her and as far as the flavours concerned this stuff has been one of my favorite concentrates I've had in a long time and the reason is because it tastes like candy if you guys remember in the beginning I said it kind of smelled like guava tastes nothing like guava but it does taste like melon it tastes like a really really bright sweet just like candy delicious freakin melon and that's really the only way I can describe it it's really amazing we've been babying this stuff for about a week now and just because it's so good that you just you don't want to just let that go as far as the highest concerned this thing hits like a truck there's no and ifs or buts about it it does give you kind of like a happier euphoric kind of you know lift to it but I would still say if you're a newbie take it easy on this one because no matter what you're gonna be floored if you're more of a you know regular user this is something that you'll be able to enjoy just the flavor and just sit back and then like I said it does give you a little bit of euphoria it does give you a little bit of like uplifting this but I would say that it's still something that you want to be careful with and you still want to wait till you're done doing whatever you need to do for the day before you go ahead and start dabbing this stuff with all that if you enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "hccSbmzQhrU": "hey guys what up its apex wanting to do the wrap-up and bring you another review the Moxie city hold on one second I got I remember the name ah Moxie Viper City og live shatter you eight live UHP shatter it was a different kind of high when you hit it it was super super harsh throat hit wise and after I ended the video that's when it finally started to kick in it was a creeper and the fact that it went and then it went for your whole entire body like the batter did but the high was more of indica dominant high cut and on how it and had a lot of sativa effects but on the weirdest one was the high wasn't really like skyrocket it wasn't even like six to seven high and it fluttered in between before finally going into a more you fear acai and just like knocked me out overall um it was very different nothing that I it was something I really didn't expect it from this um this one's a weird one try it though I mean some people might like it but that's what I felt off it was like super weird but um I give it a 7 it wasn't really what I was looking for but some people might like the hi it provides in my opinion is this a standard hi know is it a good hi to someone yes but I didn't like it so that's why it receives lower scoring but if you have 50 bucks or less or if it's on sale try it out moving on we're doing the aisle era cherry diesel half gram cart today and I mean did stander I let our car I really can't go into more detail about this but I guess try it out I had the airflow set to walk set to two it definitely tastes like cherry diesel I'm gonna cut it here and I'll get back to this whenever I can um I guess the next whenever I do another review is when we'll pick up on this um it's definitely gonna take me a while to get through the whole cart and right now it's just a waste of your time in my time if I just continued to smoke this or vape this but um anyway I'll get back to you guys in a bit anyway peace", "HvKQdH07lBA": "wild grapes are in season beginning in the fall

wild grape wild grape vines often grow very high reaching 60 to 80 feet grape leaves are large alternate simple and deciduous the leaves are three lobed and heart-shaped and resemble those of the maple tree however during harvest these are not always present so other features must be used to identify the plant when ripe the grapes turn a dark purple and form clusters much like store bought grapes only they are very much smaller and more CD be careful not to confuse wild grapes with another climber the Virginia creeper which is toxic I once made this mistake but thankfully I was able to spit out the offending fruit quickly before it did too much damage the Virginia creeper contains raiford's which are microscopic needle shaped crystals of calcium oxalate not only do these produce an awful reaction if swallowed these can even be harmful to the skin of certain people the toxic Virginia creeper unlike a wild grape has a bright orange or red stem and also holds a cluster of berries but these are not arranged in the same way as a wild grape the Virginia creeper also has five leaflets unlike the single leaf of the wild grape a second look alike is the Canadian Moonseed however while the Canadian Moonseed has only a single crescent-shaped seed hence the name Moonseed the wild grape has two to four seeds therefore to avoid misidentifying wild grapes be sure to look for tall vines having characteristic tendrils which are often forked containing two or four seeds with single three lobed leaves resembling that of a maple tree once the three species have been identified they are not easily confused but please do your homework first see cautiously picking wild grapes can go quickly when they're located in abundance as is often the case don't bother picking individual grapes instead just pull off the entire cluster be careful not to pile them too high on top of one another or you will crush them and they will begin to form an grapes store well and the refrigerator for a few days grapes make an excellent juice wine or jelly after washing simply crushed the entire lot stem and all with a potato masher in a large pot add a little water to help dilute the mixture and a little bit of heat to soften the grapes during this process careful not to boil them or some of the nutrients will be destroyed by the heat to remove the seeds and stems push the law through a jelly bag or a thinly woven cloth the edible parts will squish through leaving the stems seeds and skins behind after straining the dark purple grape juice can be consumed straight what makes for a very potent drink ha grape juice yeah Ken's Tower Bruce our and priest wrong this is a great kind of very strong Greeks to improve the flavor add some water and sugar or mix with apple juice however I prefer it's strong and slightly sour taste all by itself some varieties of grape might leave you with a sore mouth and throat which is caused by high levels of tar trade even contact with the skin can cause irritation from these small gritty crystals tartrate is found in all grapes but is higher in Riverside grapes to remove tar trade from your resulting juice simply let the mixture set in the refrigerator for a few days and let it settle to the bottom then simply pour off the good juice which will make up the upper two-thirds as well advised that one does not consume or process the juice any further such as making wine or jelly until the separation process has happened or the results will be less than desirable to make jelly mix in six and a half cups of sugar to five cups of undiluted juice as well as a package of pectin and boil wine is made equally as easy with sugar yeast and five to eight weeks of fermentation wild grapes can make a decent trailside snack although their seediness makes them less than enjoyable therefore it is recommended that they instead be processed down as described here okay so let's sugar sugar added and water added to dilute it what I'm going to try now good good for real ah a little bit better so good taste more like water too watery kinda now okay through try try that good good check it there we go", "QouGLDWRvgc": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today I'm gonna be taking another look at the marmelade cannabis strain previously we covered this one back in 2018 we are going to talk about it including any developments what I've learned and anything else going on in this video let's talk about the background of the Marmalade marmalade I absolutely love this strain and it is in my top 10 bred by ladies 44 genetics marmalade combines the Exodus cheese with the odv 3 orange diesel version 3 another lady sativa strain crossed with the oh so classic Exodus cheese cut the resulting that strain is an absolute powerhouse delivering well over 20% THC but also it has got that possess there is something about this high that is a little bit special that will leave even a seasoned stoner thinking waiting on a minute that hit me quite hard and it is a wonderful strain as a result so we're going to go into more detail about it in all of the different areas what I'm talking about the background I do want to mention that there is an impostor marmalade there is another marmalade that has been created somewhere in the US or Canada he is bred by solstice and is an evenly balanced one to one ratio strain THC to CBD and it combines the blueberry cheesecake with the sour tsunami strains so if you are here smoking that this is not that this is not that version of the marmalade this is the originator the lady sativa genetics marmalade bred in the UK grown in the UK dead fox cut grown by chem dank organic living soil no-till garden let's talk about the appearance of the marvel 8 I don't not to say about that during the intro wowser been building it up this is seriously one of my top strengths no exaggeration this is different to how it came last time last time I reviewed the dank growing farms and grow of the marmalade rainbow candy cut this is the chem don't grow of the marmalade rainbow candy cut that was me Ganic this is grown in organic living soil no-till and we're gonna see how that has affected their bud or just fell apart oh man I was just taking photos with this and it was all well dug and I thought I was happened I think there's a squeeze it back into the jar I pulled it apart but the appearance of the marmalade captures the Exodus cheese in my opinion it has got that kind of old-school look to it and when I say that what do I mean I mean similarly colored shades of green throughout with copper color pistols right so you've got sort of not a lot of different shades and colors present on this but it's kind of like green very apparent very in-your-face but we bright very well-developed the buds as well they come out really really nicely and then the pistols are deep copper colored running through the buds it feels sticky to touch it has got a fantastic look color trim job density everything about it is just looking great comparing it to the last marmalade I reviewed you can see the same color palette the blood structures a bit different as it will be grown in different way you can sort of see that it is from the same plant when you compare the two pictures side by side let's talk about the smell of the marmalade I love the smell of this strange just gonna put it out there before I've even sniffed it here we go Oh strong dank sickly sweet oranges is the main prevalent smell of the marmalade it is orange peel it is orange mixed with sick super smelly if this was just sat like this the room would smell like weed in no time at all that is throwing off aroma and super pungent in it sir in its smell let me break some of it open yeah it's just a sickly sweet pungent gassy orange that's kind of the smell 280 it doesn't have the cheese smell it's if you really sort of inhale deeply you sort of start to get the wolf that you get with something like and then hints of sort of earthly sweet as well definitely coming through yes God got a wonderful aroma to it the marmalade cannabis strain and that is reminding me exactly to a tee of tomorrow night that I reviewed back in 2018 let's talk about the taste of this cannabis straight so I'll be interested to compare this to the previous taste of the veganic Lee grown marmalade so that would have been using veganic nutrients during the growing process this is using no nutrients to feed the plants and just soil amendments keeping that soil nice and Hill for keeping that ecosystem for Ivan as a result the buds tend to in my experience reach their Terp potential so the buds that I've tried from this growing method have been fantastic to smoke to vape a really enjoyable stuff so trying it with a strain that I know and love it's gonna be an awesome experience so as I've ground it up is just released gluey gassy sickly orange notes into the area is super pungent super apparent we have got the bong here the raw little sister piece and if you're joining me for this one you know what to do get yourselves ready get those joints rolled bombs filled a Briggs heated up hit that pause button if you need to we're about to smoke a bowl of the marmalade and I'll see you all on the other side cheese [Music] [Music] wowser the orange is slower your face even for a bomb it is detectable straightway on the exhale orange flavor just goes and that remains in my mouth it still tastes it can still literally taste marmalade not just oranges not just hints of anything but the marmalade strain itself reasonably expensive actually it did make my eyes water a little bit but was a really nice bomb especially with those cubes of ice through the little sister so in terms of a smoking experience it is a powerful one but one which I'm sure you will enjoy I've got my mighty vaporizer as you can see in front of me and we are going to use it to get a good idea of the true flavor of this sample we're about to bite some of the marmalade in a mighty cure me for this and I'll see you all [Music] that's got a super strong super sweet sickly orange taste it's delicious I remember the first time I wiped marmalade and I was just like oh my god this is so good it is such a enjoyable flavor through the vaporizer compared to other strains compared to any flavor that I've ever experienced this is up there wowza absolutely beautiful the marmalade Turks somehow sickly and sickie and sweet yet still enjoyable and I think it's because you don't actually eat it you know I mean the taste buds and then you're breathing it in so kind of different this is a fantastic taste in cannabis strain and the vapor is superior taste into the smoke of course it is but I like the boat I mean a lot of power from the bunks straight away love the airflow of the mine see I can breathe a normal breath through the mighty vaporizer and that allows me just type in this amazing hit of the marmalade cannabinoids and it's beautiful incredibly nice how does it compare to the 2018 version look I don't remember comparatively which one was better but they both tasted absolutely fantastic and this is just reminded me of the original version they're both the same cut no just two different growers in two different techniques [Music] let's talk about the effects of the marmalade as I talk to you I am fully feeling the effects of the marmalade they kick in hard they kick in really quickly and it took me from naught to six or seven within the space of like a few minutes before I'd even hit the vaporizer I was already feeling the effects of the marmalade now how does it make me feel it is a really enjoyable hybrid hi I can feel like added sort of sensation on my arms if that makes sense so some some strains of weed sort of make your sensation sort of enhanced and marmalade does that it also makes my mind feel sort of really really uplifted I can be sort of in a bad mood I couldn't be miserable and if I smoked marmalade it would take me out that faster and more than other strains managed to a lot at a time there must be minor cannabinoids that are leading to it kicking in a little bit more quickly but it's also sitting over the twenty percent THC Martin when they were testing it before it was testing it between twenty and twenty-five percent THC and I think that lady sativa has done a wicked job because these effects are fantastic it's like chalk and cheese you wouldn't think that putting these two strains together the exodus cheese and the OD v3 would work in the way that it did and that's what's so interesting about her marmalade unless something's up the day I've been looking at one of my top ten strains and once again previously looked at this back in 2018 and it's been brilliant to come back to it now with the additional knowledge that I've picked up over the past couple of years of reviewing strains when it comes to the appearance the marmalade is a old classic kind of looking strain too despite being developed in more recent years this probably goes back to the Exodus cheese a side of things it's got that lovely light green coloration with the strong copper pistols the smell of it is fantastic it really fills the room straight away it doesn't need to be broken open to do so and it will stink of oranges it stinks the marmalade stinks its offensive it's gonna get into your nostrils gonna get into your clothes it's gonna make everything smell like sweet sickly marmalade oranges it's very distinguishable you can pick it out of buds blind if you've smoked it before a couple of times heist-wise really nice through the bong strong effects straightaway kicked in within a couple of minutes and then vaping it they've got even better that oranges just come through in a wonderful way through the mighty vaporizer dank sickly sickie orange and like orange peel sort of orange and effects wise you can see it kicked in quite quickly because my eyes started to go red I started to feel those effects within the first couple of minutes it's a hybrid strain you get effects on both ends of the spectrum but in a really nice way just be aware that it is a strong strain and even if you're a seasoned smoker even if you've been smoking something else earlier that day it has the potential to get you quite high that for someone like myself is advantageous gonna love being quite high but be aware of that if you are a newer smoker this one is good for the seasoned smokers as it will get you quiet even if you've been smoking something else that day as I've experienced before so what do you think of the marmalade cannabis strain I love it so much that I've come back to review it once again

back for another straight review today we're checking out some more grapes some more grapes this stuff is called a humble grape soda first thing I'm gonna say about it is it's kind of confusing when you go to the brand's website it comes up as great tech calyx great leaks or however you save calyx calyx great calyx aka grape soda this is another one from up north I'm pretty sure this is the second time you've reviewed their product on the show probably the third or fourth time that we've smoked it looking up the obviously we like to do our homework if we haven't smoked the strain before we're going to you know to do whatever research we can online to get as much information about the strain as we can that is correct sometimes they get information something out there sometimes it's a little bit questionable yes this brand actually a website that we can go to and read the background of this so I'll set that aside good for you guys cuz it was pure gold just hit that they're great calyx take a grape soda the long experiment that were eventually yield great calyx began in 2012 with the cross between Durbin poison and pure Hindu Kush he knew that he knew that he knew punished from the Hindu mountain from their Cowan's garden carefully a home the strain incorporating dozens of sometimes rare and unlikely hybrids sfv og Platinum Girl Scout cookies and purple pine nuts to name a few super rare I'll be honest you guys lost me right there rare and unlikely hybrid nothing more rare than boji and cookies that will more rare than that you won't find that nobody's bed oh gee cookies and purple pineapple to name a few cherry picking the very best qualities from each strain finally they struck gold swollen calluses soaring THC levels and off-the-charts terpene profile thus great talents report great calyx but on the jar it says on the box it says humble grape soda I think there's a little bit of disconnect here no website and says gree Kaling's aka persona and that's a powerful name that crack that I don't care what you say like that tell me what that smells like well that remind you is it ring available yeah we talked about this just now this smells exactly like the if you guys have been following us from way back you're gonna remember 2012 maybe 2011 somewhere in that time period when we were on the dogs walk the dogs well are you sure we have a string of you up online if you want to search dogs Walt's train review dog waltz stringer video you'll find that da WG thing yep it was I think I want to see freak or burglar cool and the treads walk across oh it's great that's what this smells like for some reason it's the closest thing I found see that it actually looks a lot like it - it tastes like it too so looking at the packaging here we were coming in 17.5% th see there you're soaring THC levels storage obviously that's not high preferred today's standards but yeah yeah up north I think this is I think this is the second time we reviewed some of their flowers on the show probably the third or fourth time we tried it what would you say you know it's your first impression of this one overall about to dress to be honest I feel like it's a weaker version of the dogs wallets that used to smoke like you said honestly it's just I think it's like some pickle show I'm gonna keep it 100 I'm not trying to dog nobody but we keep it real we're not trying to dog wall - nothing like that but you know that I mean the one thing I'll give it is it does taste really good it really does bringing out bring back that flavor of the dog's walls but like I'm just not too impressed I agree with you on the flavor probably being the best aspect of this one this is the we smoked a little bit for the wagon baked this morning this is my second time smoking it yeah both today through tomorrow I'm back in the pine so I was hoping that it would you know looks decent but I've definitely seen you know better-looking tweed the nose line I do like the smell is just not very pungent yeah it's kind of just that sweet sweet creepy I mean if you're going off of the end smell that delay gave us here and there it basically sounds like a mud run yeah it sounds like they got about 20 different strains mixed in here and they're rare I don't know it doesn't really you know really the flavor is good but it's just not no it doesn't really have any traits that really make this wheat stand up yeah there's nothing that stands out exactly it's just you know it's just it's just like something else I'd rather probably just have to something else so in this case I'd rather have with dogs wallets yeah it's grapes we love it we're smoking it it's not great being creepy though like kind of like we've been talking about lately we've actually they're talking about grapes a lot more than usual lately you know it's it's not that pungent sweet candy creepy fruity grape that I really like when it comes to like a purple you know it is it's just it doesn't really have that and it's a lot more mild right so yeah going going to the rating it I'll probably start with the taste because it's its best feature but in the same it's nothing crazy so I'm gonna have to give that like a generous eight a generous that's like the best rating I'm gonna give this this flowers so a taste longer than eight as it is producing yeah tastes are go eight look I would go seven and effect in the way it you know that could smell I probably go five yeah for bug overall I'd say this is probably a solid six and a half six and a half to seven it's a good middle show it was Shino little cheaper and not something the other better flower that we picked up like like I keep saying them the REC shelves are slim pickins right now but we're trying to bring you guys you know good strains slim pickins for everybody man have these shops I mean compared to before the regulations dad like this selection is just really really hurting right now concentrate to specialty so do anything that'll mean more interviews right so yeah it's rough out there in these streets right now yeah we're trying to bring you guys quality content for all these drainages hope we're doing that what's strange is you guys want to see us review what are you smoking on right now that's fire know in the comments if you're still watching this video what's the best [ __ ] strain or cultivar you have smoked this year and we will go hunt it down we promise we will do our best I know people want us to stop saying strains all the super wieners yep and we nerds up there want us to stop saying strain because it's not technically correct what about strands but we got strain reviews and we've been rocking it like this for eight years now I don't remember the other people to say strand from like the strand with a D on yeah man that's my favorite strand now I guess we're supposed to be saying cultivar yeah anyway doesn't sound as good it doesn't have an ice-rink cultivar is that really what we're supposed to be saying stream refers more to life and the technical sense it would be like cannabis indica and then cannabis sativa is like a different strain of the cannabis plant and there's like ruderalis and [ __ ] you learn something new every day hi guys we're gonna drag your day out please like and subscribe down below hit that [ __ ] Bell ding dong hey hey hey I'm Dani flavors and trans in the CCC we're out [Music] [Music]", "jVJzhCQ2wng": "[Music] what is going on welcome back to the I smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene so this is episode 4 about 2020 strain review series and today I'm gonna be taking a look at sunset sherbert let's talk about the background of this caliber strain I've been excited about covering sunset sure but for some time this is an absolute powerhouse of a strain that crosses Girl Scout cookies with pink panties and indica dominant hybrids it captures the complexity of the Girl Scout parents and its appearance it captures some of that magic with both these parents in the tert profile and it is a really nice strength interesting fact it's also been bred back with the Girl Scout cookies to create gelato so if you're a fan of gelato any of those Cali strains that have come from the gelato lineage once that removed in the sunset sherbet super interesting that stuff big up to Roadrunner this batch of sunset sherbet has been organically grown using the no teal growing method and this gives some of the nicest tasting cannabis that I have had the pleasure of sampling today I've already reviewed the skittles grown with the same method and this week it's all about the sunset sherbet you can also check back on our previous strain reviews going all the way back to 2016 via this link I smoked mag Cote UK forward slash strain reviews we've got all in the data they're organized into a table so you can catch up with what you've missed learn the lineage of some brand new strains and generally enjoy some of the previous smoke reports we've put out on the channel really famous breeder this one mister shipp in ski he has been a guest at several UK cannabis club events taking place over the last couple of years he bred the Girl Scout with the pink panties to create the sunset sherbet let's talk about the appearance of this cannabis strain looking at this bud in detail I love the complexity of this bud it reminds me a lot of the Girl Scout cookies I've tried Girl Scout cookies on numerous occasions it's got these lovely deep mottled green with the darker leaf bases and the lighter color raishin of the bud underneath this got popping orange yellow pistols and they just look absolutely fantastic the blood structures are amazing especially considering this is organically grown in living soil so no nutrient use the soil is fed rather than the plants it's nice and dense it's got a solid bud structure and the complex look and coloration of this bud is lovely the calyx is a stat but not overly densely stacked into one nug so you can separate it quite easily I would rate this really highly in terms of look there are still some basis of Leafs left on there but it just adds to this different coloration and complexity I know if you'd have got this from a dispensary in California they're probably trim all of that off and you'd be left with these little boulders that probably didn't resemble this as much this is more than natural form of what the flower looks like before it goes from that really strong trimming process and I actually like this the smoke that it gives will be nice it's not going to taste data from the leaf bases because they're covered in trichomes as well top marks from me in terms of the appearance I would say that this looks nicer than the skills that I've reviewed last week and that got pretty much 10 out of 10 for every other area and that covers the appearance let's talk about the smell of the sunset sherbet let's get some of this jar slow whoa it's deliciously sweet and pungent this one again reminded me of that Girl Scout cookies flavor there's earthiness there's pepperiness and it's kind of like a sweetness underwriting all of that it's kind of a lot of really nice sort of smell just creeping in with a deep inhalation pungent offensive you know what I mean offensive if you don't like the smell of cannabis this is gonna piss you off instead of citrus but it's not like a sour or tart e-types no it's just hint there a little bit like hops really nice smell to it guys again nice and complex led with that pungency let's break it open and see what it smells like inside these mugs cor blimey the pungency just shut up the pungent notes just shut up to the level of blue like not Gorilla Glue like actual super glue when you open up a super glue so parents of this one include og cush Durbin poison so it's got that kind of gassy power to it and you really do smell that coming very super rich super strong smelling strange Oh lovely smell to this sunset sure but top marks from me but how does it taste my favorite bit of a review is upon us we are gonna taste the sunset sure but guys I've got brand new grinder here I've got a brand new lighter here I've cleaned the bong ready because I know in my last video featuring the skittles it wasn't as clean as it should have been let's grind up some of the sunset sherbet and put it into this nice new grinder should have definitely watch the grinder at first got a lot of new grinder smelt going on here smells like a bit like a pencil case I'm like I don't want that oh wait some ground some up let's put it into the bung and smoke a bowl of this fantastic smelling cannabis strain if the smell comes through to the flavor we are in for a treat guys we're going to test it out if you're joining me for this one you know what to do get those joints rolled bongs ready dab rigs heated up hit that pause button if you need to and I'll see you on the other side [Music] white ash deliciously smooth no bite actually pulled it further in than I normally do with a bomb because I wanted to bubble it at the end you noticed as I pulled out the bar we actually pulled the down stem up no need to cough no acridity the flavor that's coming through is kind of like the leading part and a flavour is the sweetness and the pungency is kind of gone it's sweet hoppy sort of flavor yeah really nice it's just not as strong is there the smell that was coming fro let's try again Bowl number two of this sunset sherbert and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] it's got a nice sort of cookies taste on the exhale very very clean no bite no acridity sort of sweet berry but not so pungent in the flavor and the bomb smoke I've got my agro vaporizer here this is a vape by a riser it's their most portable smallest vape heats up nice and fast the agro vaporizer I like the Arizer products you don't really have to do any cleaning because of the way that they are built you just make sure that the tubes get it tonight so now and then alright the vaporizer is ready let's try some of these sunset sherbert war you get a really really strong taste coming through that and what is it it's complex it's lighter that's more definitely more pungent there's more skunk enos in that flavor when I talk about pungent I'm talking about that classic skunk type flavor a lot more guess in that than less of a delicate that I've got rid of smoke interestingly some users reported it tastes a bit like sherbert and I'm getting like different sweet notes but not that fizziness that I would expect from like that the word sherbet but definitely like hints of berry skunky earthy pungent gassy tonight I mean all of those nice vapor let's talk about the effects at the sunset sherbet so as I was vaping this the bongs hit me and I can tell you this is a strong indication my body my eyes feel like this sort of closing a little bit and it's got a very very bright in here actually nice and relaxing but feels that I could be creative and with this sort of mood this mindset that is putting me in you know so so I like that about it yes a heavy smoke yeah I can feel it in my head but like not as in my mind in my head you know like feel it in your body but in my head I can tell from my voice that is on the indica side as well we sort of slowed down my talking a bit and to put a little bit more base and and took a little bit of the energy out of my voices well at the same time so solid indica effects there and that about wraps it up so let's sum things up today I've been enjoying that sunset sherbert is a lovely strain growing organically no-till living soil by Roadrunner big up lovely smoke and everything from the appearance which was complex in this different coloration nice trichome coverage as well but just the different colors of green making it look fantastic smell wise absolutely lovely really like those sort of under sunder tone berry notes in addition to that pungency and then flag well this is what I'm trying to work out is it better food through the bong or is it better through the vaporizer I think I prefer smoking it I'm just gonna I'm just gonna smoke one more bow and we'll we'll see win a mummy relax my main man [Music] Wow some smooth really nice clean smoke from that organically living soil growth week yeah they're smoking it to vapor there's nice through both methods effects wise the indica dominant highest is certainly kicking in nice and faster it's a strong strain suited for an afternoon or even in warm weekend smoke definitely got some creative energy there too as well I'm feeling good relaxed in my body and my mother what do you think about sunset sherbert and did you enjoy this strain reviews

sunday driver sunday driver is a strain i've tried multiple times i know it's got colorado roots it was originally bred by cannerado genetics it's just a great tasting strain in my experience and always is one that impresses me so i was excited to get this and excited to try a rise because they're one of the premier cultivators here in illinois in a lot of people's opinions sunday drivers across of fruity pebbles og and grape pie so without further ado let's check this flower out this stuff is looking real nice right out of the gate in terms of freshness this is some of the best cured and most effectively preserved but i've found so far it's not dry at all the buds are really soft and squishy but not too too extreme of a degree of course really really great cure in terms of the looks at least from what i'm seeing and there's a lot of trichome coverage perfect trim job as far as i'm concerned and you can see it's sort of speckled with some hints of beautiful purple who knows if that comes from the fruity pebble g representation of its genetics or the grape pie i would imagine both of those could have some purple in them or some other ancestors do and the purple could also be a growing condition um making a little bit colder towards the end of flowering can cause that effect from what i understand these aren't the densest nugs i've ever seen in my life but i'm not having any kind of issues with their structure really they're not larfy they're just not the world's densest nugs that i've ever seen i'm going to give it a 9.5 out of 10 for looks overall very impressed and super fresh stuff like i'm saying until you do anything to the nugs this stuff has a very very subtle smell there's hints of a sweet pine and sort of a creamy banana but then when you do break the nugs open i get a really strong hint of gas sort of a spicy peppery almost like the spices you would use to cook like savory dishes or meats or something like that combined with the gassy and sweet pine really good smelling stuff overall just not exploding right out the package but very very much exploding with aroma once you break the nuggets on i'm gonna give it a nine out of ten with all that considered the flavor is not one that you really detect in the smoke too much but it's one that reveals itself more and more the more time that's removed from exhaling sort of lingers on the palate and even gets a little bit stronger for like you know 20 to 30 seconds after taking a hit which is cool more flavors are revealed there's a sweetness there's an earthiness there's kind of a sweet pine it's not as strong as other flavors i've had but it's a really nice flavor when you kind of get pleasantly surprised by it showing up on your palate after the initial hit which is a smooth well cured head i think i'm going to give this an 8.5 with all that considered for flavor this flower really embodies my kind of effects in my opinion it's just really perfect for what i like to use cannabis for which is pain relief a little bit of anxiety relief help with focusing and productivity that's kind of my goals and this seems to really target a lot of those things my back pain was really significantly eased from this stuff i had some anxiety that i was battling and it really really significantly lowered that for me helped me cope with that and work through that and have a clear mind and it helped me just get some of these videos done and be really productive and feel good it was truly good medicine made my whole quality of life feel better i love the effects from this stuff i'm going to give it a 10 out of 10 for the effects it's my kind of high and my girlfriend also noted that she really loved this stuff and she doesn't comment on too many of the strains but it's interesting that there was some external input there without me you know like prompting it at all so i think that speaks to the quality of this strain as well it's not just my one biased opinion i think so that's going to give this sunday driver from arize a 9.25 out of 10 as a composite value some of my higher rated stuff and rightfully so this is great medicine got a nice creeping flavor really potent effects just like i said raised my whole quality of life which is why i use cannabis in the first place i don't see any other reason for it but um really good medicine for me if arise or arise however you pronounce it uh if they choose to put this out in a bulk quantity i would definitely scoop it up for me um i don't do that too often with strains but this is one i would definitely like to have sort of on tap to utilize because it's very handy for me helps helps me feel good man i also want to give a quick shout out to quirky can of use a fellow youtube reviewer makes awesome videos super creative content and it's all cannabis related you should check his channel out but he has always given me love and comments on my videos and in one of his comments he recommended i try some arise because he thinks the aeroponic cultivation definitely brings out more flavor and i gotta say i agree man thank you for that recommendation again give his channel some love for some awesome cannabis content but that's all i gotta say today y'all stay safe everybody and let me know what your thoughts are on arize flower if you like this one or you like any other strains from them let me

"[Music] in addition took a table what are some other grapes native to our local region then make some interesting wine that people should try there's other really interesting grapes they grow in the area and there's there's concord grapes and Niagara grapes and they're both Vitus Lambrusco vanilla is the the grouping that has Chardonnay and Merlot those things involved and the others kind of table grapes so these were created to be able to withstand different climates and different territories and when you think of Concord you think of a wonderful purple grape and you think of grape juice purple grape juice is made from Concord any time that you have grape flavoring it probably came from concord grapes it also makes delicious wine on the sweeter side for short but it's delicious sort of fruity grapey wine niagara is i'll say the green equivalent to concord in terms of grape juice so when you have white grape juice you tend to have that made from Niagara it also makes delicious sweeter style wine and it just happens to be a green grape instead of a purple one [Music]", "Sdpn-iHpu_c": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 this is a medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 all right like say hi to all the new subscribers old subscribers hope everybody had a good Thanksgiving hope they got most of their Christmas shopping done all right we got a hall from cetera we got another hall I might try to do it tonight or tomorrow I might do a smoke sesh I got a fire burning out back so I might like to roll up a blunt and smoke that let's see what else oh if you haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe we still got the thousand subscriber giveaway coming soon I'm just trying to gather a few more things for it try to make it a little unique as possible you know me so make sure you hit that subscribe button leave me a thumbs up or thumbs down if you don't like to see it don't matter alright let's see what we got to the game alright well you know so Tara got there flower today so you know we had you up there for that well they gave out a free gift floats there I've guessed the flower line they're gonna call it float but this is a real cool jar I haven't seen anything like that for it's a stash jar it's a mason jar so you're going to take this plastic lid off and sure enough regular mason jar lid and then this is just a silicone cozy it's on there real tight by the way I'm gonna come up it'll come down a little bit but you can see it's just one the caning cars so the ones with a little design on it but the silicone thing makes it a little bit more indestructible like so I really kind of like that mm-hmm never seen one like that before hopefully they sell bees and a smaller one would be not you know they make a smaller mason jar I'll never have enough to stash in there so let's see what we got here we did yes flower I believe I forgot to take the tags off all the stuff so you gonna have to give me like a what second to do that yeah we'll leave it on the boxes we'll just want to show the boxes all right one more to go all right so I thought they was gonna do something different what the girl told me on the phone was it was gonna be like flood was gonna be the brand but then they was gonna have like rest and awake you know kind of like their a.m. their p.m. theirs in and all that pens but they actually it was granddaddy purples what I got coming at nineteen percent THC there's a squeezy jars come see a little bit of Leafs in there should a dealer went first so I can roll one but you see a few of the leaves in the bottle but there's some trichomes you can see that yeah let's take it up for the close-up look yeah it wasn't trimmed real good you can see that right there somebody left a couple leaves on there but when we flip it over you wouldn't get the light down here that's feel a little dry though which is kind of to be expected here in Florida to be honest with you guys not all the time don't get me wrong but usually when they come out with it for the first time and they hold it for a holiday like they just did this is Black Friday they just come out with their links flower today you got imagine even sitting on it for a minute like I said the but structures aren't bad they've got some trichomes on them don't know if you can see all that or not see glisten in there a little bit trim job wasn't the best but some of the other ones have been like that they learn as they go down here some learn as they go down here some dispensaries don't learn at all but so we'll probably stick these in a jar with one of them a little believe a pax I did a couple the other ones like that and it worked out pretty good alright and then we got the this is Girl Scout cookie and Jack Herer if you look it up on their website it's gonna say Jackie Girl this is the Jackie Girl when you look it up Jackie girls across between Girl Scout cookie and Jack Herer so this one was coming in at 18 percent this was only two flowers they had at my location I didn't get there bright and early now this stuff does look good so whoever trimmed the granddaddy purp just probably fire their asses this one's nice because I trimmed up nice nice tight bugs this one's not really that dry we're gonna twist up one of these because you know we gotta smoke something so like I said this is gonna be a Girl Scout cooking a jack for rare it is a hybrid but I'm guessing it's gonna be more a little bit sativa leaning hybrid believed the Girl Scout cookie anyways a little sativa leaning one twist up too big of a ones and like I said with my cloud to the fire here later on I'll go out to the fire you guys can't see crap out there I've tried it one night but I can start the smoke session here and then after I shoot the video while uploading it I can upload outside around the pit and finish my lunch so we might do that we say from here and it's down here my nose is up here I can smell that when I ground it up got a little bit of that fruity smell like the member berries kind of like aluminum rg4 move - it has that kind of fruity smell to it it's also got maybe a little earthy smell to it something hit me a lot harder when I first rounded up but you never know there could have been something left over in the grinder - that it mixed with it that's why I really don't do a review the first time I smoked it because sometimes there's a left over traces of something in the grinder and I'll give you a little false taste on the first one I did that on member berries one time SOT my ground up before that just was a little bit more stronger than it was and carried over alright just twist it up and see what else we got from there now I will say I never really cared for cetera set up usually they're not real busy you know usually I go in there there's two or three people in there and I still wait twenty minutes so they don't have a real good setup you go up to the counter you order your stuff right in front of everybody there's only two people at the counter then you sit down if there's room but there's only about two little small couches in there or one little small couch and a bench or something I don't know then somebody makes up your order in the back room carries it out carries it all the way to the other side the store to the for cash registers they have and then they holler out your name so as you can imagine today they got flour and wax in they look pretty busy more people in there talking unless you can hear some of the some of the guys in there you know they was loud enough you could hear them but a couple of girls they was hollering names two or three times you know all that just slows the process so I'll know we was there for an hour today got no discounts got the float thing but apparently they was one of the few that didn't have any discounts their idea of a Black Friday deal is just letting us have flour I guess so we did get some shattered we got the Tillamook strawberry coming at 68 percent THC they come in these nice little black jars they're real easy to open not like some of them we won't name names and then it's got like a little cupcake thing in there candy wrapper and it's got the shatter which I don't care for this cuz it's as you can see it makes it a big globs so trying to break a piece off of that is a pain in the butt I like it better on a flat piece of parchment paper so it's flattened out hopefully they'll figure that out soon some of them do some of them don't someone just keep packing it in there but at least I didn't just put it in a jar by itself they did put it on some kind of parchment so we'll give that a shot later on it'll give you a review on it too along with the flowers and then we got some of what they're calling soft wax 69% then my native just as wax on the thing it's just soft wax online a little different than what I was expecting online if you look at it look more buttery more like moves rosin this is more like I don't know like if you melted a turkey roll or something or caramel and neither one never had a real strong smell to them so we'll just have to taste them here later on but like I said neither one of them had a strong flavor I don't know if I got a clean dab to learn on but we can clean one real quick you let it cool off I don't wanna melt it any get a little skip out see if we can get a little better look at it and I guess it is a little dance for sorry I was looking at it yeah once you dig into us a little more wet than I thought it was and kind of touched the top and it didn't fall apart I did ask him you always going to ask him Florida because you never freaking know they tried to trick us a few times I was asked if I can get it under inhalation we're not inhalation sorry oral it's got a little bit of flavor once your smell when you broke into it I always ask him if you can get it under oral if you can get under oil it's gonna be distillate the vitae can pulled that crap on us and rise pulled that crap on us with their turkey nectar stuff or whatever they had and by takane had to concentrate jars that they tried saying was you know they kept saying a honey consistency they never come out and said honey but when you do look online it does say on the float products it does say cannabis derived terpenes at it so you're not gonna add you can't I don't think you can I mean you might add terpenes to the flower so you can't really add it to the shatter I mean I guess you could before it was still liquid when you was pouring it out I guess you could add terpenes in but usually when you see they're adding terpenes back to it it's gonna be a more of a flavored distillate so I was a little bit nervous about that and we'll see cuz this one kind of looks like it could be a flavored distillate if it pops up next week that you could buy this crap under oil on no offense time so we'll just see we'll give it a flavor test all this was 180 bucks it's $60 a piece for the wax the soft wax and the shatter their flower is thirty and eight so neither one of these two strains I've had before I don't think I've had the granddaddy purple in a flower I think we've only had it in a vet cart before let's see what else this doesn't have a bad flavor to it I just smoked a bowl before the video because I got some phone calls on no one to smoke on here but I was wanting to smoke too so I didn't wanna wait so he's a little medicated when we started can tastes more like the Girl Scout cookie I think than the Jack Herer in here it does have a little earthy undertone to it but we'll do a full review on it later along with the Laxus so I think that's going to be it guys I'm gonna try to finish the rest of this we'll see how it goes you know it is only 18% but I've had some 18% hit me harder than anything else some of the hardest hitting flowers I think I've had here in Florida it was around the 18 or 21 percent not saying that there ain't some you know 27 that are good and stuff but I think the best strains I've had have been a lower you know run 18 21 % to be honest so like I said I think that'll be it guys will try to either do a smoke sesh or the other review tonight or will see you tomorrow one of the two pins on how the night goes you know I got a bunch of kids so yeah you never know what's gonna pop up around the air you guys haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe we're trying to grow the channel as quick as we can as fast as we can get as big as we can so make sure you subscribe for all the latest videos so why is hoping now I just heard horn honk so I'm gonna cut this one off and hopefully go in there and help her with some dinner maybe or just sit on the couch and play with the kids wanted to so if you haven't subscribed subscribe leave me a thumbs up thumbs down comment down below let me know what you guys are talkin on tonight how was your Black Friday shopping did you bother go or did you go out and get anything today for yourself some weed like I did let me know and until next time keep on talking my friend", "9xV8DoqZHSo": "[Music] [Music] what's happening guys welcome to another episode of stranded view Saturday for the CCC 420 and my name is Nick today we're gonna be reviewing a really exotic Wildomar cannabis that I've been enjoying lately this is the grape jelly donut and this stuff has a crazy cross it really is just some amazing cannabis so let's start kick off the episode by taking a nice grip of the grape jelly doughnut I broke out in the vaporizer for this episode just to switch it up a little bit I've been doing you know flower smoking and then all the episodes so I decided to break out the bait this is a vapor brothers vaporizer just a standard $160 box fake that actually worked really really well great flavor nice size clouds and the high is just almost unbeatable so like I said let's take a nice grip of this grape jelly donut get medicated and taste this cannabis cheers guys mmm oh wow that is tasty oh my gosh so let's start off I guess with the genetics of this strain so this is the grape jelly doughnut it was grown by a grower who goes by Vicky's 420 on Instagram he grows a lot of cannabis for North Star I think holistic collective in Sacramento and he's knowledge some of his cannabis is available at an urban farm and in San Francisco as well and this stuff is crazy if the cross is birthday cake oh gee crosstube grape sugar and to break that down the birthday cake oh gee is a white fire oh gee some I think it's one of the phenotypes like a number three or something I can't remember cross two cookies I think and then that's the birthday cake oh gee and then the grape sherbert is a GDP cross to a sherbert at sunset sure but I believe and then say you crossed the great river to the birthday cake oh gee and you get great jelly doughnuts so a lot of crazy names going on there but they really describe the flavor and smell and it truly is a crazy cross I mean you got cooking sherbert you know OG GDP it's it's really a powerhouse you know lot of powerhouse trains coming together so this stuff is exotic for sure but as usual let's start off with the smell of this cultivar because this stuff whoa smells incredible guys it's got a very very loud sort of sweet musky woody dough aroma that actually does have a lot of like earthiness in it as well very sweet earthiness but it's just this musky doughy sweet wood eNOS that is so so exotic I mean he just almost smell every strain you can definitely smell the cookies that's one of the most dominant aromas in there and I'm guessing the sugar you know plays with in with that fuel Edo eNOS seems like the og might give it some of that earthiness and the the GDP definitely would have given some that sweetness but it is just an incredibly intoxicating smell I mean it's like a twist on cookies a crazy twist really has that cookie dough we bunk in the background but you know this really sweet musky wood eNOS that is predominant as well since I got the vape out for this episode let's let's assess the flavor next because this thing really provides excellent excellent flavor with flowers all right cheers guys oh my god silky smooth Wow and the flavor is very similar to the smell it has a strong strong cookie dough eNOS in the background for sure really really coats your entire mouth I mean I can just taste it strong really that muskiness and it has that sweet earth as well really really strong flavor I forgot to say again I think the smell for this one is just enhanced hands-down 10 out of 10 for me I love the smell and the flavor I mean it really has to be a 10 out of 10 as well cheers guys and the looks of this stuff is just insane as well I mean I I'm a huge cookie fan it's probably one of my favorite strains and any cookie varieties or cooking process I'm always you know looking for them and this stuff is just crazy looking with the combination of parents come going into the strain you know it really has this beautiful cannabis beautiful colors amazing trichome coverage it's just totally exotic looking the nugs themselves are I would say a little bit like og a little bit like cookies they're you know tight tight calyxes for sure not as pronounced as OG but it sorta has an OG nug structure but in terms of the color there's just a crazy crazy darker purple color throughout I mean in the inside of these nuts are just completely that beautiful like gemstone amethyst purple that's what it is as an amethyst purple and it's just a crazy contrast between sort of the that you know true green contrast with this this amethyst purple that is just remarkable there's sparse pale copper pistols throughout the nug and the tricone coverage on this stuff is just beautiful I mean big large trichome heads they completely cover everything they gleam in the light and when you break this stuff open it's just that pure amethyst purple

your own backyard and if you are new to my channel please consider subscribing and don't forget to hit the like button I am really exciting that it is harvest time for my Easter and Concord grape vine and it is now a latter part of September and my eastern Concord grape vine is ready for harvest now I had a real challenge with the eastern concord grape vine this season because denver colorado got a late May freak snowstorm and check out my video about the snowstorm I literally show my entire backyard that was impacted by that snowstorm this particular grapevine already had buds on the grapevine and I rushed home grabbed all of my frost blankets my commercial frost blink is try to cover as many of my vegetations and flowers as possible unfortunately I ran out and I actually put sheets over my grapevine I doubled up on the sheets unfortunately it wasn't enough to protect the buds on the grapevine however the grapevine did bounce back as you can see it's really really nice except the buds on this side of the grapevine actually froze and so I didn't get a lot of grapes on this side of the grapevine however on this side of the grapevine I got a lot of buds and therefore you can see I had grapes I would have had a lot more grape clusters this year again I we had that freak snowstorm one of the things I like to do is journal all the experiences I have growing all of my vegetations and one of the things that I have learned over the years of growing Eastern Conqueror grape vines is to cut down on what they call leaf rust now in July of 2018 I literally documented that around the middle of July because of the intense heat and the fact that when the temperatures get up to 90 degrees eastern concord grape vines is very it's very common to get leaf rust so what did I do to avoid that I started shading the grapevine so this is a mess shading it gives about 20% shade on the e-string concord grape vine and 2018 I had about 5% of leaf rust on the vines again this is a result of temperatures over 90 degrees so these are this is my my journaling and my documentation so I know from the previous years what I need to do to try to correct issues I'm having with the grapevine and therefore I indicated that in the July temperatures were over 90 degrees for the entire month believe it or not I only had two leaves that had leaf rust so if you look at this entire vine we've had 90-degree temperatures for two months in Denver and none of these vines got leave for us one year I had the entire vine healthy for us and I had to treat it I the the vine suffered a lot due to it but this this is how I corrected the situation so eastern concord grape vines is a northern type of grape vine does not do very well in high temperature so my tip is to get a frost excuse me a mesh covering and protect your your vines if your temperatures get over 90 degrees also it keeps the critters off your grapevine I don't have to worry about squirrels getting to my grape clusters I don't have any of those concerns so as soon as my grape cluster starts maturing the temperatures start getting in the 90 degree temperature this is when I put a mesh covering over the grapevine and I don't have to deal with it from that point on also my grapevine is growing in wood chips they've been growing in wood chips for the past three years and as a result of that I feel that the nutrients from the decomposition of the wood chips has provided my grapevine with the type of nutrients it needs so I really do not feed my eastern concord grape vine except I give it a fish emulsifier right at the very beginning of spring and other than that keep it water keep it protected and over the years those are some of the tips and corrections I have made over time now to try to prevent the episode that happened this season with the late snowstorm I am gonna make sure I have plenty of Frost blankets commercial gray frost blankets to cover the grapevine so I don't have a repeat of what happened in May when I ran out of frost blankets when we had that late freak snowstorm which does not occur that was very freaked it just never happens in Denver like that and I'm a native therefore I lost all the bugs on this side so I didn't get a lot of grapevine clusters this year like I did last year so journaling your experiences with the crops you're growing helps you to understand how to overcome or correct issues that are either predictable or unpredictable so that each year you have a good successful crop so without further ado I'm gonna go ahead and start harvesting the grapes oh one other thing I'm gonna point out that I want to share with you as a result of my grapevine growing in wood trips and being covered I noticed that my clusters are ripening a lot more evenly so in the prior years I had noted in my journaling that that was something that was occurring and as I started making corrections on what what the problems was on the grapevine rust I also realize that my grape clusters were even where ripening more evenly as opposed to not so this is a good season for my concord grape vine except that this half of the road unfortunately the buds froze so let me go ahead and start the harvesting [Music] [Music] so far this is what I've harvested and I still have more to harvest but these crepes are so sweet look how plump they are mmm they are so sweet and they have seeds in it ah beautiful beautiful so I'm gonna finish harvesting but this is what I've harvest so far just want to let you know that I am growing my grapevine on a bilateral cordon training system where the arms from the trunk is trained on this wire and the arms from the truck is trained on that wire as well as the top wire so this is the training system I've been using for my Eastern Concord grape vines I got a really great harvest despite that may late freak storm I'm gonna continue harvesting these are just beautiful grapes to grow especially in in the cooler climates like zone 5b so I'm glad you came along and was bait was able to be part of my sharing the tips of growing this beautiful grape vine especially in zone 5b thanks for watching and don't forget to hit the like button [Music]",

having to do it if line and then waiting longer than you you know should have you'll make things harder on yourself if you don't order online in case you guys didn't already know that it is currently

smell like Blue Parrot so very very cool just want to get into some of the effects here so the effects will include relaxation euphoric happy sleepy and up lifting effects and as you all know this is an indica strains so if you are an indica lover definitely recommend it give it a shot let me know down in the comments if you have tried this before and let's get into some smoking people Cheers so hope you enjoyed them close-ups of the purple punch absolutely amazing flower and super effective and when I first picked up this strain no obviously we did the smell and the taste test and could not put my finger on what it smelt and taste like and then somebody pointed out that it smelt like Blue Parrot or like Gatorade or you know like the powdered drinks drink you get the paved mix you put it in a cup and then you mix it with water like an energy sports drink that's what I could familiarize this stream with I have a bit of a mind blank there so very tasty like berries it's it's like a very

a little bit of overcast the predicted high is in the low 70s today football weather it's a great time and right now we want to jump on picking some grapes here before we get snow a little later on this week forecast on Wednesday so we're here in the backyard I've come to my son's house he's got some great Concord grape vines which do really well here in northern Utah we have some some local horticulturists who do grow some green seedless grapes around here but they're a little more tender and these the plants are a little more tender and they can be tough to grow around here because of the cold weather factor in the winter but the Conchords do really well up here and so we're going to we're going to go you can see right behind me here the the grape vines they're just loaded with these beautiful purple concord grapes the kind that Welch's makes that delicious purple grape juice out of so let's get to work I've got my got my clippers and let's get up and pick a few grapes okay we're as I mentioned it's a great autumn day here the we've had some frosty evenings and let's change the colors on not just the trees but on the grapevine here the during the summer of course it has the lush green foliage but as you can see everything's turning yellow red brown right here and that makes it easy for us to find the grapes so they just they just kind of stand out let's take take a look right here look at those guys oh man that is some some goodness and like like apples once you get frost on these fruits just a light frost they sweeten up so this is a perfect time to be picking these so let me grab my clippers and get that get that going reach out here and keep my handy Clippers by my side area okay all right we'll be able to get a bagful of these pretty quick you can tell these things are right you just walk in the backyard here and you can smell the drapes really good now plan with these of course Conchords they have seeds and so you can eat them but then you got you've got the seeds to deal with whether it's your gonna spit them out or chill of which most of the time that's what I do but that's application for these is to make some juice so the plan here is to take these back enough taken back to the kitchen I'll show you how to make some juice here we have the harvest today off of my sons grapevines you can see we've got a couple of boxes full here these boxes hold typically 18 to 20 pounds of grapes so we've got about 40 pounds of grapes here total right off this one by now what we're going to do I'm going to run these back to the kitchen and we're going to go ahead and make some juice out of these things I'll boot although the the flavor on these is just great oh so sweet almost too sweet they're just delicious you're going to make some great great grape juice so we'll see you in the kitchen you", "SjCqBrLq4RA": "hey everyone welcome back I am kind of experimenting here I don't know what the lighting is gonna be like I have the camera turned around so that way a little bit I could show you a close-up of the buds or the babies so this if you like a couple part video thanks for coming back and I want to show you some things that I got the other day and I was coming back from the surgeons in Ukiah yes instant surgeons I am gonna be having to have surgery it was cancerous but there's not something to be surgery so I have to go to UCSF and get their opinion on what kind of surgery could be best for me and my situation so all the way back I had my friend going with me and we went to can see that okay it says where the grass is always greener well I had gotten okay so I ate some of these already I'm just gonna say right now they are so good but I had he who plunge and I hope they can show you these without spilling them everywhere these are so good they're called space gems I think you could see him I don't know so I don't usually do videos of the camera this way without somebody else doing the camera so I can actually see if I'm in frame or whatever but hopefully this is of it so don't have to do it again but I got some space gems some sour space gems they're so good they're 10 milligram gummies and I want to show you the inside they look like hopefully you can really see these and yes there's only two left [Music] but they are so good and they come in these little things like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup they're so good they really are they're so good they're made with ice water hash and I hope this is coming in clear but they are so good they have a great sour fruity flavor and there are multiple different flavors in here and so it came in at bucks of 10 and I had already eaten all the - yeah but they are really good and I really like them and I'm thinking we're gonna eat one right now they have some ice water hash and you can chase the freeness and the gummy of the gummy and then the ice water hash kind of aftertaste so good but I'm gonna wait till after I do the video in case I need a cue another tape I'm gonna be praying but they are so good and you better believe it soon as I get a video that's a good take I'm gonna be gone so these are awesome space gems I really like them I have to eat like three but that's just because my toys alright maybe because I'm stressing out a little bit you know you never know but I also got a couple kinds of smoke and they're from a place called ridge top of chemicals and they're an an outdoor Mendocino grown candidates they're both from the same place now this one is the Sunday yes the Sunday driver yeah I gotta look over my glasses but this is the Sunday driver I love their little on the top they've got their little let's make sure it's right way up there little shovels with the pot leaf in the middle of the shovel spade part I really think that's cute and they look like kind of Corphish and I think that's cool cuz you know we are in wine country mmm now this is some really good now I'm gonna try not to get too close and see if you can it will focus because my camera always says not to get too close to have it focus right so hopefully that's with me yeah but this is a really good hybrid I can't remember the strains that's come it's combined with but it's called Sunday driver Sunday like an ice-cream sundae looks amazing it's got like some bright red dark and light green it's like really cool tricolor and I hope that's got hmm and it's it's nice and squishy not squishy but nice and dense and moist nice and moist it's been cured really well and I really like that one it's a nice hybrid I've been smoking that's rendered a man I need to get some stuff done because usually I'm an indica girl so I tried to go out of my box a little bit and then this one is another one from the same company with their little shovel now this one is called orange green [Music] yes orange cream orange creamsicle and I love the oranges more than the lemons I mean most people like lemony ones that are sativas and they're uplifting well I like the orange he wants better you know something we big jack them I mean Jackie is great I've had some really good strains combined with it that worked for me but this is the best for me two oranges and yes I am growing lemons gum or super Lemon Haze but that's one of the few lemons I can do and it's probably cuz the haze the haze being with it and then this lemon skunk I can usually do too because it's got that skunk against or the haze and this or that and it's it kind of gives a little different edge but usually the Haze's are the best that go with lemon and when I can't find a lemon with haze then I definitely stick with my oranges and I looked all over for orange like the Caleo and orange dream or even orange creamsicle and I didn't find anywhere that had seeds that had a good package of seeds that they would you know deliver here so I didn't get orange I got this super super or super Lemon Haze and this one open there we go it just did not one open so I just kept talking it's all okay turn this around I know buddy it's my thing is this little boy it smells amazing you just smells really orange II really spicy and I hope you can see it it's not big buds I'm not worried about it it smells so amazing this has some amazing terpenes it really does have some amazing terpenes and i'm gonna change a couple buds out granted they aren't little but I can breathe over here and let you guys see this and that's why I tried to do the video with a cam that's right so I could bring it over and I hope you guys see closer yeah not big buds not the most pretty but it is very good it's good some multicolored greens and some cool redness to it but it's it's so good it's so super yummy and it's got an amazing trip eating for a while it's just mmm it really makes you feel good really does little bit of rosiness in it to me it's like got an orange spice and a little bit of orange kind of after smell it's really good it's like got a little bit of a rosy undertone like we need have rosehips energy and everything it has that little bit of an undertone when you exhale it's really good I really like it and it helps she gives a lot of stuff done really does I really really like it and I'm gonna get to say to you right now so I hope you guys have been enjoying the videos I'm gonna get to show you the girls in a minute but you know they've just gotten more BP and I thought okay a small little video of just them it's gonna get gonna get boring so I thought I would show you guys some stuff I picked up in it after the surgeons so and don't worry everything's gonna be good you caught it super early and it's like stage one so it's not a big deal it's super super early and I'm a perfect candidate for multiple kinds of surgery and hopefully reconstructive so yeah and yeah you know who does you know I can only be a I'll just make the best of it and you know just do it again yeah you know who knows how this is gonna turn out but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna be afraid to live my life and plant my trees and grow my garden and all that just because of a little thing like this anyway so let's get to show you those flowers so now you get to see my whole messy room okay let's move my sticky notes out right here okay so this this right here is the orange creamsicle see if I can get it to zoom in better oh my god you can see the nice cool Reds it's got like multiple orangie reds and it's got some nice green you can it looks spicy you know it looks like it has some spices to it I really enjoy it it's one of the few cities I really really like okay so let's put this one back and I did put the lid on okay so my bad for not taking the lid for shutting the lid and there you can see this is some really yummy stuff I love this Sunday driver this I still can't remember I should have looked up the lineage well I had a plot and post but you can see they're very similar in color but it's it's got some light greens in there take it why is this not it's not very clear I apologize there we go I really like the Sunday driver it's nice I wanted to show you guys some close-up of it and the gummies too just in case you couldn't see it before so here that was the Sunday driver okay so I'm gonna show to you now without the yucky stuff that was on my lens so yeah hopefully the rest of the video doesn't look horrible if it does I'm gonna just redo it I guess but I realized I had some goopy stuff on my lens and yes it looks really good it tastes really good it's got really cool earthy undertones and really great flavors so I

hope you all have a peaceful day and please like comment subscribe and", "XpK8wqi8tIo": "[Music] guys channel MacMaster sugar again for another episode of canvas connoisseur connection today we just wanna check out a new dispensary which every check out before bonus or the best time to really really great clip and all around these guys are super professional with their stuff we got two great strains and I went there for the first time I found the best bubble hash I've ever pretty ridiculous as you guys just saw there also the Grape Ape was real good I will hardly ever buy prayer book and the true self is both these chains are just rings are just off the chain everybody in there was really professional man the employees are really knowledgeable a real nice tool yeah everybody was really nice very knowledgeable people they give you a complete walkthrough and you come in it takes them a little while to verify your stuff you got to bring your actual paperwork with you when you go I like to pack I like to package a lot yeah definitely the top show of all their top shelf meds come with these nice jars right here just overall man I get these guys I give these guys a 10 mm great Club great meds great staff friendly knowledgeable great packaging competitive prices actually pretty pretty good prices I'd say really Saudia to the area the middle shelf was the best middle shelf I think I've ever seen yeah we got some stuff for 15 great babe great the great babe that was pretty good let's see I mean there was pretty nice they took a little while to verify but they were giving out free West Coast cannabis magazines they had plenty of stuff for you to wait all their medicine is also tested by a steep hill for THC content cannabinoids it would also take if there is any mold present or any other you know contaminants that you wouldn't want your medical marijuana so basically a bike going to anybody who has their testing done by these guys ensures that the medicine that you're getting is safe no pesticides no no and it also is a much more you know professional way of looking at marijuana and this I really think more clubs are moving to this this style this place reminded me a lot of like Harborside and Oakland you know they have another Harborside in San Jose but I think everything's just headed towards that like movement yeah we're you know we got to be start becoming more professional with it it's not it's not so much medical marijuana anymore it's medical I could care less if you're wearing a white doctors you know robe when you come in there I just want nice friendly knowledgeable staff and I want my medicine to be backed with some kind of proof and I mean they have high CBD strands in there the Harlequin strain is like ten point three percent CBD it's like off the charts so if you're really just looking for strictly a medicinal strain and you don't want any of the head you know effects or anything like that then you know there's strains like that for you know an alien cancer patients who have extreme pain you know but maybe can't have any anything else to interfere with their daily life you know when you have that testing available to you it just makes everything more professional and safer in my opinion so big thumbs up to elemental Wellness out in San Jose gotta get these guys out of ten at ten appreciate the great medicine and the good work done these these guys are definitely going to be see their meds a lot of areas from that watches you know we can go here any time to get the top nine strands good tons of push turns into good sativas tons of concentrates ahead let's see here twenty two concentrates eleven top shelf thirty-one different strands and all of its tested they gave us a free one Graham cone joint with ki Fateh anyone in there all the medicines laid out on trays for you displaying the THC content you know whether it's indica dominant sativa dominant you know cannabinoid levels so you know it really eliminates a lot of the questions if you know what you're looking for when you go with it makes makes society a lot easier than it could sometimes be especially when you walk in if you have ten or eleven top-shelf strains some big thumbs up to elemental wellness at San Jose first we're going to check out the Grape Ape these buds are just completely frosted with purple inside and out you can see they're kind of the light cream leaves a little bit of the trim that was left on there but these things are so dense basically all you buy frosted no I mean there's a little bit of give to them but they're just rock-hard they barely do anything grab good amount of orange hair is pretty typical looking bud pretty typical looking for but I'd say the smell is what really gets me on this it was just overwhelming when I smelt it in the store so fruity great be sweet sort of like like grapes or raisins or something like that and the smell just usually with strains like this translates directly into the taste and in this case it definitely did taste exactly like it smells just overwhelming sweet creepiness right when you inhale and only get stronger as you exhale stays right there on the tip of your tongue this is an example of some perfectly cure perfectly flush but man great faith growing to perfection I don't really smoke too much but out of all / great babe has got to be you know probably my favorite strand the perfect fish if it makes with some OG or something as far as effects on the great babe it's a really really typical heavy-hitting into custom gets you right away keeps on hitting you kind of like a creeper but you feel it definitely like in your head it's real good body how you feel it in your extremities your hands through legs especially but the one thing I noticed for this one is a definite creeper smoked a little bit and then weight a little bit see how it hits you before you medicated with it again and I would keep that one pretty much strictly to a pm medicator some real real great stuff there I've got three og here it's the premier straining elemental Wellness they had it in high Times Magazine and they won in second place at the indica Cup and you can see here it's got snow and green bugs it's super super light greens one of my favorite types of Bud it's got the bright amber trichomes as you get a look in they're not as light as some other trichomes as you can see it's got one of that amber color there as far as density goes it's rock hard and it's got that cushy texture for sure its real gummy and overwhelming pint sentence bar smell goes with the floor undertones for sure taste-wise it's not as lemony as some OG i've tasted but it definitely leaves that first taste in your mouth for a while that like super highnesses more piney instead of lemony as soon as you take a hit of that the effect is right to the forehead room and behind the eyes gives you a really like head high and then the body pie comes in like slowly but surely I'm sure and it just relaxes me up definitely a good into cook right in the head great stuff right here the trilogy famous strange is their staple in their shop [Music] we're also checking out the bubba kush full amount from elemental wellness this without a doubt is the best bubble hash that i've ever tried I know we told you the guys that a couple times before but I've never really smoked for metal until I seen this this hash doesn't even bubble it just melts so wet that it's just super wet let me see if I can grab the Dever here you guys a little because if I this stuff is like oil if I get it on my fingers it's game over just it's almost looking this is bubble hash it almost looks like it's bubble mix with oil or something but it has that create hashey floral taste I don't know I wouldn't really say that the strained bubble really comes out too strong in this but it's just smells super super hashey whatever is yeah for anything we can honestly say look this is the first truthful melt we thought on this this is the first actual fun moment you've had on the show and it is really really full melt we're gonna get in there and show you guys this is gonna be like hash born right here so I Amy you something like Miss Piggy side all night right on the clock know what define TV Monday I'm up in stock a second black are this Ronnie first update on the

season organic no seriously but yeah so i'm sharing with you guys how i wax my brows from home and i really hope that you guys enjoyed this video i have a hard time filming this video because my setup is so low budget hopefully hopefully you guys still take and learn from it um just a quick disclaimer um this is a fresh tint on my brows right now so you know that first day when you get your

pretty cool this is this is cool low lighting whatever i have my essential oil diffuser on and it's just giving my room this sweet essence of lemons right now let's just go over the things that we need for this video for this whole like little service treatment diy at home that i'm gonna do for you guys i love love waxing and derma planting my face so let's jump into the things that you need obviously you guys are going to need some wax um this is the brand that i got i got this from sally's um wax sensitive microwave wax for face and body clean and easy professional um and inside of like the box it came with these three items as well it comes with a pre-wax cleanser i usually don't use this cleanser but today for the purposes of this video i am going to try it out and use it um and this is just to clean off any oils that's on your face to make the wax really like snatch the hairs but like i said i usually don't use this i'm very skeptical with the stuff i put on my face especially like cleansers and stuff like that because who knows what they're putting inside their cleansers an oil is different because you you kind of just know like okay this is this specific oil but whatever also using this aloe vera gel which also came inside of the box which i would have like if it didn't come with aloe vera gel i would have actually went and bought my own aloe vera gel because this is very soothing to the skin it's a post wax treatment also using the remove post wax remover which is nothing but oil if you don't have like all of this stuff and you have the wax all you need is coconut oil and replacement of this but this is just some type of oil that they put together mineral oil yeah so this is just a mineral oil yeah i'm also using of course my trinity's organics and said the castle soap this is like the only thing i use on my facial so i'll be using this when i finish with everything to just you know wash my face off i'm also using these blades that i got from the beauty supplies oh no i'm sorry i'm not focused have i even been like this this whole time these blades that i got from beauty supply store um that brand is annie very sharp really really love these blaze i really like to use these when i'm derma planting you're going to need the cotton swabs for the post wax pre wax removal all of that you're also going to need some tweezers underneath these tweezers this little cotton i'm so sorry i just keep i'm just lying in focus today all right so you're gonna need these swag strips right here that i have came within the kit but you can also get some like strips at the reason why store i ran out of my sticks that came inside of my kit so i had to go to the beauty supply store and purchase some more which i honestly like these more so in particular because they're shorter the ones that come inside the box they have like big popsicle sticks and we also have the narrow sticks but they're long just like it's easier to manage with shorter sticks also you guys are going to need a little eyebrow razor blade i'm going to use this to clean up my brows after i wax you're going to need if you're a beginner which i'm guessing you are because you're watching this video you're going to need a um white ink eyeliner pencil it's a liner pen but it's like liquidy this is the brand i got i got this also from sally's it's pretty pretty good it comes on like it really shows on the skin nice so i like this pencil i mean ink pen liner when i tint my brows i like to use the just for men beard dye you guys can use whatever tint you want if you're scared to use the beard dye tint but y'all i'm trying to tell y'all this just for men for a tent like it was trending on youtube for a minute and i like actually tried it and i love the results so yeah get that okay that's all you need for this tutorial okay guys so before we get started i went ahead and i heated up my wax for about a minute and was and that's actually like way too hot you're supposed to do it in 30 second intervals but um yeah i have to do a lot of stuff to my eyebrows before i actually even begin to wax so by then it should be cooled down to like a nice skin safe temperature y'all i feel like an official beauty girl okay just know this entire setup is so ghetto oh so good though and i'm like literally two seconds delay from everything like two seconds away from everything completely falling apart on the floor everywhere mess chaos oh you know what i can do to make this better i can put a book underneath this like guy here i'm saying playing books underneath stuff just so stuff can balance like that's what i'm working with for the making of this video give me by the end of the year and i'm gonna have an official youtube studio and like perfect setup and it's like perfect everything and i won't be doing all of this extra stuff just to film oh yeah that's oh yeah that's a way but that's way better make sure you stay hydrated just let that sit so i'm still recording right now yes i can see myself let's begin because my wax is like all the stuff that i literally just did just yeah i may have to end up reheating my wax we'll see so first things first what i'm going to be doing is brushing my brows into shape i know like y'all probably looking like girl you're taking forever brushing your brows but yeah like i really hope that y'all can see what i'm doing okay so i've been doing my eyebrows for a long time but i still need to use a guide every time i wax them because like i just want to be on the safe side so i like to use a guide and this pencil here is my guide there's like rules that you guys can follow to like perfectly measure your brows and all of that jazz we're just gonna like i'm gonna use i'll show you guys all right i'm gonna show you guys i'm not gonna skip any important steps because i'm an og i'm gonna talk to you guys like the beginners that you are and give y'all all the helpful tips that i can give so first things first we're going to slime where your eyebrows are supposed to start they're supposed to start like right here where you're like right here on your nose and then you want to go up that's where they start okay so i'm gonna use my pencil and do the exact same thing go up and i'm gonna make a white line brows really do not be this close yeah they do kind of whatever i'm not really worried about the beginning i let them kind of grow in as thick as they want to anyway so here on your nut wait is it here or is it over here is it yeah no because this is where the end is and then the arch i don't really okay so you use your eyeball for the i'm sorry y'all i obviously don't do this but i do know the steps i do know you use your eyeball and i'm i'm kind of sort of centering my pencil like dead in the middle of my pupils like right there do you see that y'all see that and then i'm gonna just draw a line i see the line i'm just going to darken it that's what my arch is supposed to be is it the same thing on this side center it with my eyeball draw the line all right so now we're going to do the tails and i'm use the outer edge of my nose for this and then like kind of angle it with my eyeball as well and just you'll line it up and draw a line do this side here draw i make the best one don't tell me that i need a new one please it's not in the middle of the video just last for this video and i'll replace you and then can i see gosh let me know yeah let's go here oh put my tongue in my mouth all right see that arch line let's just line it up yeah right there that's what our arch is and then i'm gonna start to go down here can't see i really hope y'all can going down here y'all i wax my eyebrows about when did i wash my eyebrows about a week ago so they're not really that well maybe two weeks ago point is they're really not that bad next i can also clean it up a little bit like underneath it right there but i guess i'll wax that off because i i can literally see where i kind of drew my line a little bit too oops yeah it's okay if i erase my line now because like i already drew the arch and everything so like it's it don't matter if that little line is there anymore y'all this is just such a awkward like oh wow this is nice now like look at that gliding on like tattoo ink too far too thick so y'all can see what i'm doing here cleaning up my line taking my time y'all don't rush this part okay y'all see me i've been doing i've been waxing my eyebrows for months now i can't tell you exactly how long cause i forgot when i actually started but y'all see me like i every wax sesh i take my time like make sure everything is perfect with this outlining part because like once you like slick the wax on there and you rip it off it's just it's just gone let's just go ahead and i wish i had a topic to talk about when you guys apply the wax you want to apply it in the direction that your hair grows close my eyes and i'm going to go okay yep it's not too hot do a little skin test try not to get too much wax like actually on your eyelid like i'm doing here um like i said y'all i'm just in the most awkwardest position like trying to sit in this chair and catch it on camera look in this tiny mirror like i be so up close in my bathroom standing up when i usually do this so i'm sorry i just want to make sure that you guys can see i'm holding my eyelid down and i am lying her oh i'm trying to get as much i'm trying to really get my wax on the tip of the stick so that is much easier for me oh gosh y'all if wax get on your eyelashes don't worry um wax easily comes off of hair believe it or not easily comes off of hair with nothing but oil i'm sorry y'all this is not a left wax right here i know y'all see the struggle there we go y'all see that i'm staying on the outside of that line y'all see that y'all do y'all see that now she's ready to be waxed off y'all this is so therapeutic for me like i really love waxing my eyebrows i'm gonna start from this part and then i'm gonna get the next part so okay i really love this like i live for the pain nice focus on the hairs focus on the hairs i don't know if y'all can see theirs i really hope that y'all can oh that was an epic fail right there oh yeah that felt more felt more painful i thought it was like four to five pieces of hair and i just i'm a little scared to see my brows because i just hope i didn't over wax anything but i don't feel like i did it's just like damn girl like what the oh gosh gosh i've been watching some people wax videos and it's like they scared to pull it off you again more hairs you're not supposed to wax the same area twice but this one is calling my name like it's just a little patch of hair right there that i want to get can i see that patch of hair right there that i want to get oh my cat is over there going crazy trying to break out of my room he's think scratching at the door is gonna like magically open it because i always open it for him when you scratch it at the door bash i'm in the middle of doing something important i can't open doors for you baby all right let me free my cat hey here go get out you're free bye i'm really scared with this one because my i'm just cool oh no i got a little bit of wax underneath here that i want to remove let's just no i mean at the um nail salon when they got like remainer wax on you just go like that pull it off oh my god i'm actually pulling off hairs  myself up with my eyebrow hairs and just oh i was i told myself i was going to use the the pre wax cleanser i did not use it i guess i will take the i'm taking the mineral oil and wiping it all off oh it's perfect as well are you serious are you serious are you i think this side is just a little oh so i i think i accidentally did a little bit like do y'all see that it's supposed to be like sure and then hairs okay okay so i did a little bit i did a little bit um i don't know if y'all can see what i see but i feel like it's supposed to be hairs like right here which i'm not completely tripping about especially because i tint my brows so like nobody would be able to tell and i know that those hairs will eventually grow back and this is just like let me see can y'all see that where am i sharpening is it even like this side is just like bomb but this side i feel like like right here i'm looking in the mirror um i'm going to go ahead and wash my face with my trenches organics um castile soap so to my website best soap ever sensitive skin friendly it's the best thing in the world okay y'all so i'm gonna wash my face with this um you know if you have wax and stuff on your hand use oil to loosen it up and then after you use the oil wash it with soap um i'm gonna go ahead and wash my face check out my brows and see if they're even like really get close to the mirror and then we're gonna do the tinting after washing my face off and checking my eyebrows out and honestly i think i did the damn thing okay i think they look pretty good next now that we got all that gunky wax and stuff off of it if you want to you can trim them with scissors i do not have any eyebrow scissors to trim my brows with but i honestly don't need to trim my brows when i go and get them done they kind of just like okay you're good when i'm doing my brows like i try to get them absolutely perfect i feel like this side is more boxed this side kind of curves instead of going like boxed but i don't think i did that i think that's just my brows this eyebrow is always just oh i hate this brow um we're gonna fix all of that though with some tint okay also y'all i was so worried about messing up my brows that i did not even wax my unibrow so before i put the tint on i am going to go ahead and wax the unibrow because i feel like that will make all the difference in the world apply it needs more oil damn i left my oil in there needs a little bit more oil on it it's doing the job getting no excess oh very harsh on my skin oh my god okay i got the oil off i'm like i remember as i was gonna use this i did not use this let's just see yeah like do you rinse this stuff off with water or lightly just literally yeah what is this what is this stuff putting on my skin i swear if i have breakouts in the morning i'll post i'm gonna post clean my brows for the for the um for the um tintin okay y'all i swear if that's not breaking my skin out it's gonna be me me in this company in a nasty email squirt equal amounts of both the just for men i'm sorry just for men beard dye this is the color base and this is the color developer so i'm going to do pea sizes of both because you don't need that much for your brows y'all see that hope y'all can reapply this is such a this is just such an all over the place the doorio is so all over the place okay once it really start drying like you can really see the shape that you're creating like i did not know i had all that let me go get another q-tip and i'm gonna clean this up off camera because i can't really like i don't want to mess up the tent part y'all cause if i have a tent that's like all over the place i'm gonna be really mad so i'm gonna i'm gonna go clean this up and then come back and finish up okay i'm back this is the final result um just go ahead i'm just kidding no so yeah i'm just gonna let this sit i remember one time oh i'm sorry let me just i'll be all over the place so yeah i'm just going to let this sit for about a good the longer you let it sit the better the results the longer they all last as well um so i'm just going to let mine sit for about let's say 30 minutes like this cucumber wants to be eating so bad like it's just right by my mouth like eat me so yeah i'm just gonna let this sit and then i'm gonna come back and we'll see how we're doing so let me i'ma wait a good 20 minutes 20 to 30 minutes and then i'm going to wash this off and then come back on camera so you guys can see the end result oh and disclaimer just like any other tinting service that you get eyebrow tinting surface that you get the first day you know it's like the darkest and like you kind of don't really like how dark it looks so like by that second day it's the perfect shade like same thing here so it is gonna be a little dark but i mean it's kind of just always like that when you first get your eyebrows scented so it's the same exact the same exact thing so yeah see you guys in like 30 minutes okay guys so i accidentally left my tin over too long but but it it's not gonna kill you i left it on for about a good 40 minutes like i started to edit this current video and so i kind of like just got sidetracked and just forgot like girl you did not even film the ending you still have the tint on your eyebrows so yeah i kind of but you know give it give it like a few more face washes and it's just going to be the perfect shade not too dark not too harsh i don't even think it looks that bad now but i just know it's

[Music] [Applause] I'm gonna just start out by saying this smells like that old-fashioned Jack Herer straight slap in the face these birds like very like with long orange hairs super long ways little hints of purple and it just seems covered and trichomes I can't deny you could just see it all the way from the bottom to the top to the tippy top of the necks so with that being said let's get her

one of these big with Nuggets here damn excuse my language but these nuts feel very light you could just see the own shares peeking through it almost just looks hairy in a way you could just see look at that one dangling right here that's crazy you rarely see this type of display from a nugget you can see them little purple hair is too deeply deeply just close to the line right next to all those trichomes like dang this is a cross we change a career I mean lemon Jack and grape pie let's grab another one here and just see comparison I think that's the only one that looked like that look at this all right here it's a smaller no but you can still see it's still similar to the one that we were just holding still simpler it's hairy all the way to the tippy top of the nug that is sensational oh it almost looks like the Christmas tree all reminds me like Goku like Super Saiyan right here you see this for everything looks like when it's a Super Saiyan like damn let me grab one of these and break and see you get a look at the inside grab this one it almost looks whoa did you just see that it almost looks like look like goes about to squeeze some juice out of it whoa like oh my gosh try

ready to go I'm not gonna lie as I was packing this and breaking this down this was the most colorful but I've ever seen you could just see the colors glistening on here it's caked with trichomes nice long orange hairs with the hints of purple that's so purple when it's combined with the orange hairs in the bag together it almost looked red like it almost looked the same color as the color on the bag below this and I was shocked you could just see how colorful it is so with that being said let's finally see how she tastes because she smelled very fruity citrus like and if you know jack a rare it smells just like that so with that being said now let's burn this fire we get my music ready you can have a session but our music and when I mean music I'm talking about beats hey this is the new grape hair string from jungle boys upon that first hit I can really taste that Jack that Jack is really overpowering in this one the birds felt lighter so I can tell it's gonna be more than sativa side as you can see burning nice and easy Mooney who is them from the sides mmm straight dripping that's what I like to see let's take it to the air oh yeah not too harsh neither very smooth you don't

grapes for the last week I've been making our watermelon lemonade's and making the like grape juice basically the color of our watermelon lemonade isn't from the watermelon it's actually from the grape skin so I'm going to show you guys what I would like to make some grape juice see how heaviness last week I had some really like dark deep purple grapes they were look like I was juicing beets almost it was crazy now all right we are right about at one pound you can leave the stem in there definitely give grapes a good soak in there pretty dirty I get asked this question a lot as far as what do we use for like soaking and washing veggies just use some organic vinegar apple cider vinegar especially for like watermelon rinds and grapes are a gross one Young Living also makes a veggie wash that's a central oil-based it's got things like clove and lemon this is what I was saying if you have a juicer at home a masticating juicer you can make this at home for your kids if they love grape juice and they can still get all the live enzymes that grocery store juicer it doesn't have because it's been pasteurized and you can also water this down and cut it as much as you want to your kids make it looks like we are gonna hit right about 16 ounces a normal package like this that you would buy at the grocery store will get you probably 40 to 60 4 ounces of grape juice if you wanted to make this at home I'm impressed so at a 1 pound of grapes expect to get around 16 [Music]", "EuqUUVbANE0": "what's up YouTube this is I start images back with another product review this one is platinum vapes it's a hybrid it's called Sunday driver one brand card 91.9% zero CBD stated production date was six 25:19 says it was tested on the second seven to nineteen effects happy relaxed giggly euphoric uplifted flavors diesel very great so I'm gonna assume I'm gonna get a lot of great flavoring out of this one the diesel will probably just be that that pungent taste it sits at the back here through yeah [ __ ] it let's give it a go everybody you know that's subscribed that watches my videos once again appreciate you guys thank you for coming out taking time out of your days to watch me [ __ ] about some give me some things I like Ben have you found any of this informational and helped you you know I you know I really appreciate it anytime I get any feedback I was said I'm gonna take that as a positive even if it's a negative one I think I had one subscriber leave and one come back a new one so it is what it is I understand how this stuff works but I got it loaded up in my palm battery let's give it a go that's tasty I like this one this one's real good I would have to say this is one of my favorites by far so far it's a real sweet taste like job as I said you do get that like aftertaste like that strong aftertaste so I'm assuming that's where the the diesel flavoring comes from very sweet very berry a little bit of the grape yeah let's say this is right up there with the purple champagne and the Galactic jacket yeah excuse me yes I also like the Incredible Hulk I thought that one tasted pretty pretty damn good but uh yeah if you guys haven't tried this one I'd strongly strongly suggested it is really really good say this is like a real good like sitting by like hanging out at the pool with your friends or whatever it's just got that taste like you see the girls or whoever drinking those fruity drinks or your your buddy likes those umbrella drinks you know you could be drinking one of those and hit this and it would I would almost guarantee it would complement the flavor like you're drinking like a fruit punch or something like that tropical punch you yeah strongly suggested so that was plantain babes Sunday driver 91.9% THC as I said it's a hybrid so it's in the pink box yeah if you're able to get out to your local disco do the four for 100 or I think there's one place running a deal but I think they're out at Dearborn here in Michigan it's running uh I think five for a hundred there's some other ones I think I want to try called Knitting extracts and I would like to get my hands on some Rove Rove is a brand that I heard about from another guy's channel real matty smokes if you don't know him go check him out watch interview some brains called Rove out in California so if I can ever get my hands on them like a legit one I'll definitely have a review on it I think I'm gonna try the mitten extracts next final hands on those whom I think they're running those five 400 right now with one of the disposed around here I've heard good things I've heard bad things but until I tried myself I can't go to speak on you know that's just me talking about my hats if you do as I said I've still got a little bit of wax from flight club extracts and strangely well than that you guys don't mind get that subscribe button smash that like button and comment below tell me what you think if you end up getting your hands on it you know try it comment below tell me what you liked about it you know I like hearing back I liked your channel you guys I appreciate you all without you I have no channel so peace out guys you have a great", "2ESuGJL96-8": "how're we doing everybody well we got a special treat for you went to sleeve o today and picked up and liras great pie and I've got 3/8 of this I'm going to press individually so we can see what the consistency is when you press these out into rosin they were all purchased on the same day they were packed on the same day according to the stickers this is an indica dominant hybrid and it is ringing in at twenty one point two seven percent THC big shout-out to Celilo over in Squirrel Hill so we're gonna press these one at a time now this is the first one and we see if I get this moved over just a little bit better so you can see it these have been rehydrating with spinach leaf okay spinach Leafs right there and we're gonna okay so take out the spinach leaf and here are the rehydrated buds and they are definitely ready to press okay or some more spinach leaf on the bottom and I'll even rehydrate it all that people kind of stick in there okay every last bit of this so this is press number one okay so here's a good look give you a nice nice look at it here it's got some purple got some purple looking sugar leaf in there he's got some really really nice-looking trichomes you can see them glistening and if you look at the overall stickiness here okay I mean it just sticks to your fingers it is moist they're trimming job could be a bit better take a look at this okay Tremayne is less than stellar but I think we're gonna get a really really good result so we're gonna get ourselves a mug Smasher 3 point 5 gram bag for our 8 and we've got the press warming up to 200 degrees this is right where we want it to be get our bag here okay we're gonna turn it inside out we're going to do this bottle textile with an inverted bag I prefer it it's a personal preference thing it works either way you don't have to do it this way but I find it a bit better for my uses to invert the bag unless it's giving me a problem that [ __ ] sometimes does ok here we go so turn that thing inside out and one or two of the corners usually is already kind of inverted so you can get it set up bottle textile and for those of you who are new bottle textile is a way to load this bag so that it comes down more or less in a circle on its own footprint okay so and get the bag set up like this the reason I turn the bags inside out is because this rib right along here if it's inside the bag it's hard to load the flour in there so I just started turning them inside out and it's worked very well for me thus far so here we go we got this thing pretty much set up for our flour load this thing up we're gonna get this in here while this stuff is so moist this spinach leaf really works it works in six hours that's how long we had this stuff in there six hours and it is super super sticky not at all like the Cheetos puff dryness that we saw when we opened it initially on getting it back from the dispensary so we're going to pack this down into the bottom it's best we can get all the rest of these little stragglers in there all of its medicine okay so we're gonna kind of try to form this bottom real flat so it comes down really easy in its footprint a little bit of finger hash going on here from from that now got the bag here we've got the plant material in here it's packed down as evenly as we can get it we're gonna cut it off right about here and we're gonna fall down well first of all let me get these little hairs that these little whiskers of thread that are on the inside of the bag normally now they're on the outside so I tried to trim them off that way we don't have to worry about any contamination fold in the corners well in these corners and now we have very compact slug ready to be pressed this is an 8 I'm gonna set this right under here to kind of station keep it well we get our paper together piece paper we're going to do a directional fold it's going to keep things neat inside the press now give us a really really good result now we're gonna trim this down a bit turn this side off just like that save this for checking our yield which we will be doing after this press and each one of these three presses are going to be separate videos so I'm going to press them all consecutively one right after the other and each one will be a separate video so you can see what each yield is and the consistency of the results so got our paper here we're going to get this fold it in like so take this side and now we've got a nice place to put that puck and we're gonna start extracting so I've got this I'm gonna move the camera up and try to recenter this so I can get a good shot of this for you get that lit up right there now I'm gonna put the paper in here got it right about there I'm going to now let's get everything in real close but you can see what I see now here's a bird's-eye view of what's going on now I will be adjusting the lighting giving you the best view possible so just please bear with me and take our puck and place it inside the press now I need to check make sure we fouled is closed and we're gonna start applying pressure until we reach our first stage of heat soak which will be when I'm not getting free fall from my weighted handle on here open this up as much as you can you never do know you think I'm sorry when it comes to your bra due to sloppy work with your paper but I am definitely not the most experienced lotta guys on YouTube ever hears about this stuff okay we're already seeing some activity going on here you see all the bubbling happening that's that's some good good good sign I did that's a real good sign we got that thing just I do see almost immediately once once we go through that first heats up I'm just gonna pin that right there until it starts to gush let's keep coming down until it gives us another indication that it's ready to slow down for a minute - and there we go that's our next rest along the way see if I get the light in there a little bit better for you let's try to get this there we go there you can see it see all that bubble so much activity I mean rehydration is absolutely the key to getting good yields from your pressing the housing make no mistake if you bring it home right from the dispensary the way it is you are never going to get an acceptable yield you just won't none of the dispensary re I mean none of the grower processors at all are putting out flour that's proper moisture content for pressing rosin now all that it took my god this thing is just introducing like crazy pressure still still right on where it needs to be it's self-regulating nicely it might it very well might you see how beautiful that looks on camera you can you can see a lot of that activity going on look at all that beautiful medicine being made here how cool is this you can take dispensary flour you can bring it home you can apply some heat and pressure to that and you can get some of the most amazing medicine from it just amazing continued pressure is still exactly where it needs to be still producing quite a bit of rosin here the color is just absolutely beautiful - it's not dark it's not getting that way it's it's looking super super nice that is you're bringing out the best out of this plan yeah it is gonna be excellent no idea what kind of a yield we're gonna get this is the first time I have pressed this particular strain but we're all gonna find out together I wanted to let everybody know also that if you're in the Pittsburgh area there's gonna be a lot of 4/20 events going on I haven't thus far been successful in attaching myself to one to do any pressing so if you don't hear an announcement to the contrary I am going to be having a press party for patients only only people with cards and dispensary flour but you come here and we will get some of this from your dispensary flower you need to rehydrate it for six hours with spinach leaf in order for it to be ready to be pressed you cannot bring me leaf that you just bought at the dispensary and expect to get these kind of results from it I promise you it will not happen okay so if you're not doing anything else on 4/20 and you're near Pittsburgh come to Penn Hills hit me up a messenger hit me up on Facebook and let's have a good time on 4/20 we don't need a bunch of vendors we don't need a bunch of money I just need to bring yourself bring some dispensary flour that you've rehydrated ahead of time we got some good conversation I've got some cards against humanity' we'll have some good grub it's gonna be a good time so if you just keep looking I mean this thing is still just popping bubbles and flowin like I can't believe right now this is amazing I'm giving it a little more aggression on the pressure just to see if we're at the end now you see that didn't really produce a lot right there I think just about ready to pull this because I'm not seeing a lot more bubbling happening here step yeah there we go that last little bit and that pressure still holding just study like it should but what I'm looking for is that color still looking really good but right on the corner right hand side here I'm starting to see a little bit of that like that indicator okay so let's see if there's any more bubbles happening see how much flow we're gonna get it still still coming a little bit just give it another round of pressure you learn something new with every single strain it's just it's wonderful to see what this plan is showing us here I just gave it one last push I think we're just about done take this off I'm gonna get ready to see what our magnets okay I'm ready for this all right so we're gonna bring this down with a cold plate readjust my lighting here so you can see what's going on and readjust my focus back out again there we go and we're gonna readjust so that you see what I see now I can show you right here there was no blowout okay that's not contamination that's that color change see that indicator right there were darkened a little bit in that circle right around the edge we pulled it just at the right time okay where I was seeing that was on the one side on this side over here I was catching a glimpse of that little bit of darkening going on and that's what prompted me to pull it see no blow out came down perfectly textbook press on this so we're going to give this a quick cool down on the cold plate here I'm gonna get too aggressive pulling it down one just gonna do it gently let's set up real nice and stained get up here like us bad just right at that tear it just came through a little bit I don't think it got the yeah I got the plate what right there on the corner I have to clean that up before the next press alright take my weapon of choice here picked one of these up at Glasgow Wow up in Monroeville and shout out to them and let's see what this is gonna do for us you're gonna pick up real nice and play there we go okay so let's see what we're doing here yeah let's start the pickup and it got a little sappy at one part that's okay as it cools it's gonna set up even more look at that lay that out Oh thing about this is you just gotta be patient I know it looks wonderful it's definitely gonna smoke wonderful but get too aggressive trying to gather it up then you end up ripping your paper and wasting your materials so you take your time you just run this on here a nice easy pressure that's somebody the other day it's the friends of mine that called me Bob rosin because I sound like Bob Ross what I'm talking about this process it truly does make me feel very peaceful and focused when I'm able to focus on making my medicine you get kind of Zen with it you know but I tell you the truth this is truly the one thing that I've done since I was in the army so we're talking 28 years that it's give", "8l5HL5BbMPY": "hello everyone and welcome to another episode of Bob's bomb bugs where we do videos on bomb bugs and other candidates related subjects on today's episode we have grape God another bomb bug to add to Bob Budd collection grape god is a cross between grapefruit and God bud it's an indica dominant hybrid being 60% indica 40% sativa it boasts an average THC range from about 20 to 25% it has an extremely fruity smell and taste you can really smell the sweetness of the grape flavor it's an extremely fruity flavored bud mmm fruity blood it reminds me of that Ludacris song blueberry yum yum especially when he says I would have never thought it could taste this good and thank God for the home and I put it in my hood it's a great song if you've never heard it check it out the balm buds of grapefruit are small and dense like blueberry strain this strain is best for treating insomnia stress migraines and PTSD well that's all for today's episode of Bob's balm buds if you like balm buds and videos like this please like and subscribe to my channel for more great Bose balm bugs content and remember stay lit friends", "j1uFvWmihGE": "what's up guys reaper here today we're gonna be talking about row of cartridges how to spot a fake one now this one is going to be one that is kind of simple but it is also going to be extremely extremely tricky and it's going to come down to really one or two things right first of all this is the road that I got I knew that it was pretty hot I knew that it was fake pretty much before I got it just because of the processing on it when my buddies hit me I was like bro I got some rosin Lanka oils I know you've been looking for some Walkers especially asking the cross hanging up the price I was like man [ __ ] I knew they were fake but I was like let me get him he's like I said they'd always says good ol never bought bad oil from this guy but came home that not well actually not that not the next night I didn't I have really didn't even test them out that much price tag on I'm the next not one of my subscribers sent me up on the Instagram asked me how I locked them as opposed to the pic on Instagram I say how Lachlan asked me ways the spot Romans and I was like did I really not even done any research you know so I did a little bit of research for him and within 30 seconds on him I was fake mine was fake for sure 100% the ones that he sent me seemed real but I did a little bit more research and this is where we're gonna get it this at right so the number one thing you want to look for on these boxes is right here there will be you want the California label you know the little California thing I'm just gonna see if it was back here but it's not you know what I'm talking about you need the California thing and then you want the THC percentage and stickers right on the box already it needs to be in stickers so don't let your guy tell you man they were on there they got pulled off blah blah blah all this [ __ ] no so that right there is it you wanted to have stickers that's how you're gonna tell right there if it's real or fake but here's the issue guys this is the car by the way 18 21 years or older smoke along with me if you are that age cheers guys great pull the flavor is amazing it tastes like sweet tarts it's not artificial it's a nice clean flavor the highest grade it lasts it does take about four or five hits to get a no let me tell you let me let me go into this right here if you just want to get a little if you need to like try to help your anxiety or you want to you know just get a little little relaxation calming feeling one two three puffs you're good but if you want to get a buzz if you want to get buzzed you want to get high you want to get smacked you need about four or five but the thing is guys the high with this is so clean and calm it's it's nice it's a nice calming feeling obviously it's it's supposed to be an indica but like I said it's fake so we don't even know if this is an indica in here it does have indica effects now could that be a placebo effect I don't know but you know it is what it is the only thing that I like I said though there's nothing to complain about the hot laughs the flavor is good the pull is good the oil is good in here and it is burning up quicker than I would lock though I've only had this for three days now and I've not been really heavy hitting it and it's going down quite a bit one more cheers guys so now we're going to get into the convoluted [ __ ] right they make fakes with stickers on them the newer fakes that are coming out have the stickers on them some made up amounts just put on there slept on there so now you're saying well how do I know if I'm getting one the trill unless you go in to a dispensary and buy yourself you don't know unless there is another way now this is what we're going to talk about unless you do that you're not going to know there is one other way there is called a store locator did they have for their side and will tell you every store and location did they sell them at that where they are sold and then even then even then you're like oh man I don't know about this or that or what if this happens or that happens no worries real rose now come with a QR code on their books so you just scan it on your phone on the app they have a rose reward app from what on the research I did and it comes on their pups up right then in there you know if it's real or not so Rove has I went into this like man they need to do something because like from what I can tell it's very hard to spot a fake aside just from those stickers in that store locator and then when you're getting deliveries and you're getting on this [ __ ] and you're getting shipments sent to you it's like man how can I tell for real how I mean it's like one of those things where it's like man but then I saw that QR code thing and I was like man props to them for doing that because you know like it you people don't want to throw money and [ __ ] that's not real like if I would have the price I paid for this I knew it was fake right and I'm happy with the price I paid but if I would have paid a price that would adjust the FIDE it being from the railroad company a dispensary price or a prostitute in an illegal state that a lot of these places these people will bump up and throw 5 10 15 even $20 tax on I would have been super mad so you know I can't that's why I'm doing this [ __ ] you guys hopefully this will help somebody but my final thoughts on this was whoever faked it did a good job like I said props to the guy if but I do think that people would just be better off buying their own all these people that have great skills and talent they're going on here week they're gonna put in a position to where they have to buy either these fake cards I mean the fake company carts you know what I mean by that I mean a real company they took real company that put fake cards from that company and then put all in it so and the sad thing is either they can one do that or to put them in stuff like exotics and Mario's Supremes off lights all that dumb stupid [ __ ] so what's the to base the options here can I put my good product in these shitty companies packs that nobody wants to buy or should I put my good product and these fake company packs so the logical choice is gonna be my product is good I can make you know my product shouldn't be put on these standards I want to put them here but now here's the issue is you're gonna [ __ ] people over unless you're doing it for this price right here to where people know like man there's no way that's real that's the only way it should be done but it'd be better off getting done with there should be like a I don't know man there's there has to be a better way than this but I guess as long as people know they hey these are fake those a lot of these TKOs are fake there's certain not just sticky Oh a lot everything's pretty much fake as [ __ ] right now unless you're walking into dispensary and getting it or you can get this [ __ ] super verified if you're in an illegal state or you're in a medical state you know like if you're in an illegal state fully legal recreational you you know preying on having problems but it's just uh it's just crazy out there I know guys unfortunately we're gonna have to wait it out we're gonna have to wait it out of here too until everything gets legal everything gets passed and then at that point you know it'll be on everyone but I'm gonna talk to you guys later thanks for watching subscribe if you're not gonna follow me on Instagram like the Reaper I'll link it down below I will link everything that I've put here down below that way you guys can go and research a little bit further yourself I hope you have a great rest here today", "HKOTsRw1eU0": "hello everyone welcome to another edition of wine wisdom today's topic is table grapes versus wine grapes for many I think people assume that the wind comes from grapes and there's not much the difference between the two but there is considerable difference and I want to explain to you today why wine grapes are so much better for making wine than table grapes not that you couldn't make wine from table grapes but there are so many things going for these berries that are different from these berries the first is obviously the size now the smaller berry size for wine grape leads to a more concentrated expression in the wine whereas a table grape here the majority of this berry is consisting of water it does not have the sugar content or the tannin or the flavors that a wine grape has and those are all the key ingredients to make a beverage that is going to be aged worthy and very interesting and nuanced on your palate so just to break it down a little bit more if I were to take a table grape here and cut this in half you're going to first notice that today's table grapes are really without seeds and the skin of the grape is very thin compared to the flesh of the fruit you want thin skin on a table grape so that you have that crunch and get right into the fresh aspect of a grape whereas with a wine grape the skin is much tougher harder to cut actually the skin is thicker but also you're going to notice the seeds and a lot of the tannin or the backbone of the line is coming from the seeds of the grape too so cross section shows you a quite a difference in these the flavors are very different the wine grape is more acidity more depth of flavor link to it the table grape it's all about crunchy refreshing aspects so they both serve a function and just to show you by demonstration the difference in the chemistry of the Apes refractometer is being used here I'm taking the juice of the grape placing it on the plate looking to the sky and I'm getting a Brix level or sugar content about 13% again a lot of this is mostly water whereas if I take a wine grape and if we get late in the season we're gonna see a much higher expression of bricks here the Brix of the wine grape here off the vine is about 1718 well on its way to hopefully getting over 22 bricks when we get to that level of sugar now we have the appropriate amount of sugar that when fermented is going to get to a wine it's about twelve percent alcohol which is kind of the goal for most table wines so again I invite you this time here to actually come to the vineyard and begin sampling these grapes as you walk the vineyard they are not quite ripe yet but as we get another two or three weeks along you're gonna notice the flavors really develop and you're gonna really I think enjoy the preview of what the wine is gonna taste like there aren't going to be like table grapes but it's still going to be an interesting expression for you to experience that so until next time Cheers", "JWtlQMvOE9k": "other people and welcome back for another edition of the education medicating top setting nickel oh we're

drops grapes these are made by grapery and they are supposedly outworldly now i have tasted a few i would say they are very very sweet and i give them a 9 out of 10. now they there's no hint of a seed they're very juicy and the skin is kind of mild i would say it's not very bitter or that kind of tannin vibe you get so i would say it's a very balanced and not overly sweet grape it definitely looks unique in shape and i did have one or two that were a little soft on this end so that's probably the point where it may soften as they are not as fresh or when they are not as fresh but either way it's an amazing grape mmm really crunchy delicious let's see how it brixes it's definitely not as sweet as the grapery or grapery black tape table seedless grapes that we had they're just table grapes those are wonderful and those bricks that in the 20s 25 or 26 so let's see how this one does so they're brixing in between about 18 to 19. so i'll go ahead and show you that here in a clip and wow definitely an awesome grape so give us a like and a subscribe and see if you can find yourself any grapes from drapery these moon drops are stunning really interesting shape and just a really delicious fruit not overly sweet very very enjoyable grape all right we found ours at sprouts in southern california or you can also also find them in trader joe's alright thanks for watching have a great [Music] day [Music] you", "YzFetAZFBk4": "okay so this episode of urban edibles what are we going to get grading look at me Wow great yeah what season is it what season is it day well grape day it's well grape season isn't it so you can find wild grapes oh okay just a moment grey let's walk over to the grapes you can find wild grapes pretty much all over the place the edges of fences a typical place for them maybe at the edge of a field that's what I meant to say not the edge of the fence and they climb their climbing vine they do look like other poisonous plants and in a moment when we get over there I'll explain the difference I won't be able to show you the difference because there's only wild grapes over here there aren't the poisonous plants that look like it but what I will do is crack open my trusty field guide there we go edible wild plants by Lee Alan Peterson and I will explain what the differences are to look for so that you're not going to potentially poison yourself so once it get a little closer we'll have a better look at the grapes so just as a side note while we're walking over the grapes just want to show you the field that's very close to our house grading an eye on Parker as well eventually when he gets little older we're very blessed to have this I mean right across the street from my house moved here last summer and I moved away from a house with that had a ravine and I thought I was going to miss the ravine and really was more of a swamp than ravine but I mean it was it was better than a parking lot let's say that and look what I have now available to me I do not miss that ravine whatsoever do this it's beautiful I don't know if that's translating well on camera and if there's wind noise I apologize for that guys only that stream every year I think it's true like three-foot trout run up this stream see right now it's full to the brim from all the rain we've been having so you can bet that's very steep graden watch your step son be careful it's great in there you can bet the great and I will be having n Parker will be having many many adventures in these acres and acres of forest right in the middle of the city here we are here The Grapes great in do you like grapes oh okay give me a moment I'll pick you a nice bunch so here they are they're very tiny see the largest might be a quarter inch they're quite sour your pits inside but I don't care I ate them whole the time to pick them when the ripe is in the fall right now it's October 4th and according to the field guide you can eat young grape leaves in the spring which admittedly I've never done and after I pick a bunch and give some the grading for him to chomp on I'll crack open that guide and we'll talk about the other plants that look like grapes but are not in our poisonous you want some grapes grey alright so a few things about wild grapes that I didn't mention and that's when they're green and unripe they actually have a lot of pectin in them which you can use for baking or cooking and canning and whatever else pectin might be use for and some people make drinks out of them I've never done that some people make jellies I've never done that we just eat them raw don't we great and I actually juice them as well I put them through my juicer all right so the other ants that look like grapes or resembled the grape plant are Canada moon seed Canada moon seed and bitter sweet nightshade and these these bitter sweet night shades they're everywhere around my house there are people's gardens they were in my garden I had to get rid of them all because graden was attracted to the red berries and he's too young to know any better the difference between wild grapes and Canada moon seed in the Canada moon seed looks very much like a wild grape is a wild grape that's edible has a forked tendril so here's a tendril here so you can see this is what a tendril is branches off from one of the the mains stems and it Forks you can see that Forks right there see if I can find yet in there another example okay here's a smaller example here's a tendril comes off the wild grape plant and its forked Canada moon seed will not have that the other difference is the seeds inside a wild grape has two seeds inside I believe if not more and Canada moon seed only has one a 1 a single crescent-shaped seed and from what I understand they are quite poisonous great so there we are like I said we just eat them raw if you are going to pick these please be very careful guys do some homework make sure it's got the forked tendrils if you really need to look inside to see if it has multiple seeds this one I can feel has two seeds in it whereas a Canada moon seed plant will only have a single crescent-shaped seed in it so stay away from that but by all means dig into the wild grapes something else I've heard but I know very little of maybe some of you guys know about this the white dust on grapes is actually yeast and can be used for brewing and for rising bread look at this an absolute abundance of beautiful grapes let me show you my favorite part of urban edibles now that I have children and that's passing it on and sharing it with them Oh miss your fingers gray let me see your face you like wild grapes what season is it well good day something else I've observed especially this season since I've been going to town on these some plants produce sweeter grapes and others this plant that I'm working on right now here this vine is not as nearly as good as the first one that was that I mean it's a market difference the first vine tasted like concord grapes almost an these are these are really quite bitter so if you do get out and find some wild grapes and you find they're not to your liking don't give up try another plant because try another grape plant that is because chances are you're going to find a sweeter plant somewhere and they are abundant there's probably 60 different vines or more around this 50 foot fence line so yeah don't give up bottom if you try them and they aren't to your liking", "5ytzG86kqAs": "[Music] no [Music] welcome to table graphs everyone today on table grapes we're gonna play a game yes the game is called what's in the box what's in the box so the basis of today what we're going to do is we're going to have five random objects each i'm going to have five keys to get five and we're each gonna put an object in said box now these objects can be anything from around the household we literally just found random stuff around the house so hopefully we're gonna trick each other and yeah there's gonna be a point system by the way at the end of the game of what's in the box the loser is going to have to take a really really sour lovely crafted shot so stay tuned it's gonna be fun

too by the way so uh going in at first now am i allowed to what am i allowed to do exactly just all my fingertips i'd say just fingertips just just fingertips just fingertips the nerves going first careful all right tapper top or bottom it's on the bottom that's in the bottom what what is this oh wow what this is what all right take your hand out you talking that yeah all right oh yes because you can't just keep touching it you know oh okay so all right here's the thing whatever's in this box this has like some sort of little spines or something on it like little like talons i'm trying to think of something that would be sharp like all over they know what it is i know what it is you don't know what it is any ideas what do you think it is i believe it is a succulent plant no all right all right so you're going to show me what's in the box now you want to do just one point for the scent let's do one point one point all right what's in the box a cheese grater cheese grater okay hear me out though any way that this would be laying it feels different so there's no way of actually knowing but now you understand why i said don't move fast a happy cheese grater check that out it's a good day to be a cheese grater this is a good day to be a cheater all right so uh you want to move on to the next one then so the first item that i'm putting in the box is a little overused bar of soap so let's see if he enjoys this do i get a hint for what's in this um yeah what i'm gonna tell you by the way guys we're gonna change the scoring up we're gonna have like golf rules person with the highest amount of points is actually the loser person with lowest amount of points so he has one point for not getting it right so currently i am losing yes okay so you want one hint you said one hand for your one hit i'm going to tell you that this object is something that you may encounter every day that's that's what i'm gonna tell you that's that's your hint and remember we gotta you gotta go in just fingertips just fingertips i'm gonna let you know what's in the center of the box and it's small so you have time to find it what you think it's a bar soap it is a bar itself how'd that feel felt like a slimy box my hands are clean all right guys this is what i got next it's just a little umbrella i don't know if we'll get it okay well i'm i'm actually not gonna ask for a hint this time because you got the first one right yes so that gives you the advantage yes so i'm just gonna dive right in and i'm gonna regret that i said that let's see see if you can guess what it is by my reaction is it be careful though be careful don't break oh just fingertips just fingertips yeah oh oh wait is it oh okay okay i think i know what it is what do you think it is is it an umbrella little umbrella even the even the score here even the score okay so all right because it's my turn to guess are you ready yeah let's do this so the second item that i'm gonna put in the box it's a it's a fake halloween wrap a decorative wrap all right so now for your second challenge okay would you like a hint you know what i don't i'm just gonna try to just gonna go right for it huh i mean i'm gonna try to just guess it and all right well let's see how it goes man let's see what it is just fingertips fingertips [Laughter] be careful it might bite you okay do you have a guess if you want to think about it for a minute maybe uh maybe phone a friend or somebody who's here in the studio with us you want to know honestly what i felt what's that i feel like it's a toy a toy okay i mean but like it's it's not so much a toy but it is down that line no no go ahead and think about it for me it feels like like a toy or something so i'm giving you guys like a little dinosaur toy or something is that your final answer yeah it is not a dinosaur toy it is a decorative rat boom halloween decorations on par see i felt the tail so i was thinking like stegosaurus or something yeah i was nervous to actually put the tail in the way that you would be feeling because i i figured if you grabbed that first you would know instantly he got me i honestly thought it was just a toy all right y'all but this is what i got the like the little you know it's funny already again it's time to put my hand in this box and i don't know what's in it it also worries me that we're on round three which means we're halfway through which means that you may have put something vulgar in this box i might have all right i'm all right way to be vague it's gonna be fun i'm just gonna tell you this again don't move fast don't move that's all i gotta say i'm trying to decide whether or not i wanna take a hit i want you guys to know that this game this is not easy this is not what you think you think you're you're putting your hand inside of a box and you don't know what's in there and you know that's that might be fine for some of you guys but we don't know if this thing's alive i don't know if there's a knife in there right now that's gonna cut me which would not surprise me uh it's not a knife no well no better time than the present that's what i say so i'm gonna i'm i'm gonna hold back off the hint from this round because i think if i need to hit i'm gonna go for round four around five maybe okay well put your hand in there and get ready get ready as if it's gonna seriously don't move fast though but pitter patter let's get at her oh uh uh i said what is that it's almost like a grip to my to my fingertips when i was trying to they do that they might do that okay so you know judging by how small this is you guys have already seen this yes so you know what i'm going through i have no clue what's in this box they know they know but it almost felt like like jacks if they were small and you know breakable and bendable so what's something that's like that is that your final answer no no no that's not my final answer no okay something like that what is something like jacks what's small is it is it is it a bundle of bread ties is that your family answer that's my final answer it is not oh no you ready to see what it is oh oh fake spiders just a bunch of fake spiders oh god i just started the halloween theme that you're just doing i may have a little bit of arachnophobia so that's that's ironic there it's a good choice i'm surprised i didn't get it if i had i known you know or had some inclination that it would have been regarding spiders i wouldn't have wanted to stuck my hand into that box to be honest i had more money i would put real spiders in there yeah unfortunately i know it would have been a great time all right so you want to take it out and go to round four yeah what's the points at uh i have two points nope i have one point i also have i have zero points because my last one i you didn't use a hint i didn't use it did hit dude no you have zero points it's still zero all right let's get to it so for my fourth item i have a clip-on bow tie because hopefully he will have no idea what is in this box though i'm kind of nervous for this one are you ready i'm kind of nervous not to that's a lie uh all right i'm gonna give you this all right you know you know never mind you know what you can you can ask me for a hint if you want him all i gotta say is if you don't get this then we're tied what you feeling in there be careful what you think i know it's fabric okay that i do know it might be fabric i know it's fabric i know it's a fabric i don't know like the question is what kind of fabric is it all right can i get a hint yes you can um [Music] this is something that you don't put on very often uh but when you do it's usually for something special so it is a it is a garment that you wear something that you put on is it a tie is that your final answer yeah is it a tie it is a bow tie a question should we give it to him or should we not or do we give him half a point maybe um i'll take half a point half a point all right okay all right where'd you get a bow tie i found it in my backpack man okay guys this is what i got it's just you know hopefully he doesn't know okay so honestly i really don't think you're gonna guess this one honestly i'm very afraid right now i really don't think you're gonna guess this one all right uh on a scale of one to ten how nervous should i be going into this round at least a nine oh no a nine maybe what did you put in there fukushima oh you gotta find it find what it is oh is it in the center of the box yeah it's all over the box isn't it maybe it might be okay so what's what's the score as it stands right now i believe half a point to one point or half a point to zero still no i think i believe i have a point half point to one point yeah are we at half point no um one point jade yes okay there you go yeah half point one point one point all right round five round five all right let's see which i actually i don't know if you can see i actually have sweat i'm so nervous on this round right now should be uh okay what about like a smell is that do we do points for smells you're not gonna smell it i'm not gonna smell it i don't think i really smell it so it's not cutie pie i don't think it's not the dog i'm not gonna put the dog all right is it dangerous i mean it depends is it depends maybe oh it's gooey oh what is that gooey oh all right there's no but you're not gonna what this this is the consistency of like the top of a pumpkin pie or a cheesecake but my thing is if he's a good man like i know he is he wouldn't ruin a cheesecake by let me put my fingers all over it maybe so i don't think it's a cheesecake i would also have things on my hand maybe it wasn't cold what do you think it is it was it was rather warm it's about room temperature i'd say room temperature what do you think it is it's very large my hands are my hands are clean i'm gonna say is it no you would smell a piece of chicken you would smell a piece of chicken or a pizza but it's not or something that's not a food item might be might be a food item i can't really give you that could be could not be this is this is for the game right here some people might eat it some people might eat it yeah i i don't i wouldn't but i bet someone does you know i'm gonna have to go with some kind of gelatin because i just the way that this feel without knowing what it is it's like it's like tapping the top of a jello is that your final answer i guess that's my final answer you were wrong what is it slime slime what it's oobleck oh it's just like like an actual like slime it has a bit of a scent actually oh my gosh okay so for my round five item i've chosen to fill the tub with these solely music tees [Applause] so let's hope that he has no idea what to think how do you feel about round five honestly now it's like the last round i feel like you're gonna put something crazy in there the thing is i know that one of us after this round is gonna have to do a nasty yeah nasty sour shot uh worth it though i don't know i kind of like sour stuff but this will be a lot so what we have for this punishment guys just a bunch of citrus and sour stuff honestly so it's not smart but for your enjoyment and partially mine or his depending on who wins or loses probably me as always wins or loses loses oh we'll find out this is the last round last round let's get to it let's get to it all right anything you want to tell me before i check out what's in this one so what i have to say to you is that you are very familiar with this item okay and i think i think that's all i can give because i think you have a good chance of guessing what it is i think you might have a good chance of guessing what it is i don't know but you're really fine around you want to have fingertips though final round you want to do like a five second feel five seconds well well i already went through final round so oh i saw one more item oh you have oh that's right we did fourth round i'm one round ahead all right yeah i say we do the five second feel then five second seconds five seconds five seconds yeah all right so you gotta you gotta start counting ready are you ready ready and going in go one two three four five okay so honestly it feels like a shirt maybe like something like it feels like if you were touching a design like a design on top of a shirt that's what it feels like i want you to be very specific with your answer as be as specific as you can be hmm i must say it's just a t-shirt with a design on it i don't know what it would be a t-shirt with a design on it you heard it here first folks that's that's honestly the only thing i could think of that's what it felt like it was just true yeah but like balled up or something you know i don't know that's what it felt like do you what do you think on this uh on this one for points you think that's point worthy he's interacting with this object a lot i am we have is it a pillow i need a final answer from you what i'll tell you is you were closer when you said a t-shirt with a design on so i have you guess what t-shirt it is not necessarily you should be able to get this right off the back is it multiple t-shirts because it feels like there's a lot in there maybe is it my dirty clothes is that the final [Music] [Laughter] there's an assortment of solely music keys because why not plug your own brand right i honestly thought he was like it felt like there was more than just one thing in there so i was like what could be more than one teeth like there has to be more than one t-shirt in there so i was like where's a lot of them and i was like my dirty clothes has to be i was trying to be you know very lenient because you were really close on there this is what it is hopefully i i don't think you'll guess this i mean be careful though don't don't move too fast well i can tell it's not moving around and that makes me more comfortable to stick my hand in the box it might be moving slow maybe okay final round five seconds ready so when you get ready all right one oh two three four uh five uh again i don't know if you've ever even it feels like a piece of glassware almost like like a vase or something [Laughter] they know they know you guys know what's in this box yeah you guys know exactly what's in there it felt like there was almost like a like a geode type texture to it a geo like it was rough and some of the spots like had like a crystal type texture almost or like a like a rougher pattern texture and then other parts of it were smooth like it was brass okay um so it had a rustic feel huh it did have a rustic feel okay so let's just say i i guess what's in this box because obviously i'm stalling to think right now yes which you should answer pretty soon though so i'm gonna go with what's your answer is it a bird bath a bird bath a bird bath it is not it's not a bird bath would you like to see what it is i would a lantern oh okay okay a little electric lantern it's funny because it it's almost as if okay this is what i was feeling that was rough did you hear me yeah my little clue when i said had a rustic feel yeah yeah rusty i didn't get it though i didn't get it okay so from my fifth and final object i chose an open container of ketchup so we'll see how he feels about this this is bound to get interesting okay so this one kind of scares me because it took an awfully long time for you to get it in the box whatever it is that's all i gotta say so i'm kind of like scared on what it is now all right should i be um what i can say is sometimes it's got a little bite to it but you should be safe okay you ready [Laughter] it's [Laughter] [Laughter] instantly i just as soon as i put my hand in there too it wasn't like touching around it was full on my fingers went straight into the ketchup perfect aim you got the aim for that ketchup man yeah oh that's great so that means it looks like i'm doing the punishment yeah as i predicted all right well let's uh i'll go grab the stuff all right let's get that going we'll set it up so you can get that punishment so here's the thing guys in future episodes of table grapes we want you to write down in the comments below the video and give us punishments for our games because i'm not gonna sit here and do a shot of really sour stuff every single episode because let's be real i don't hate my colon that much there's warheads lime juice lemon juice in this my hand smells like well you know what in spite of the irony that i couldn't catch up to you so we're going to get this speed not much though not much at all we still want it to be sour it's going to be very sour but uh really don't ever do this you should put one of the yellow ones and one of the yellow and one of the red ones okay yeah because the yellow ones are pretty sour so i got here's my i'm sorry you can't you can't quite see it there uh we can show it up here put it up here there we go right there beautiful so we're gonna do one of these lemon warheads open up your red one for you uh yeah please it'd be great now i've actually never had the warheads candy oh really i have never had the warheads candy you're missing out bud i don't think i'll be missing out very very soon here if you like sour candy like it's a good sour candy i'd say do a little bit of like uh it tells me a red one you want to give me like a maybe like a bag or something i think it's too cute my mouth my eyes are melted my mouth is just watering looking at all of that oh oh wait wait i got too much in there hold on hurry up get a little bit out that should be fine i should be fine oh wow that's already really sour we got like that much of the that much of the squirt we got two warheads in there and then we're gonna fill the rest up lemon lime oh this one's not open oh no i'll leave the rest in there for you then i need something to poke a hole in it oh my there you go oh no that would work better you're right yeah specific tool for opening lime juice here on table grapes it really is so all right oh no now i'm gonna attempt to kind of mix it in i wouldn't uh nope the warheads are stuck together yeah oh this is not going to be make sure you can get those oh yeah oh there we go get them off the glass a little bag or something all right oh well that'll hold vomit yeah for sure paper bag old school we should be good a testament to us doing anything for table grapes oh give me a tool oh you wanna do one two i just did oh this is good stuff thanks for watching everyone thank you for joining us our table great thank you join us next week where we're gonna do some more like this [Music] you", "rY8cfNFCyT8": "hi this is Debbie with relaxed sweats and we are going to talk about my favorite subject today which happens to be wax we're going to start with the cream wax our cream wax is a little different than other cream waxes there's microcrystalline in this wax and that's the ingredient that's in a hard wax that makes a hard wax card so it's kind of a hybrid between a hard and a soft wax which makes it extremely gentle on the skin so if you're going to use a soft wax on faces underarms bikini Brazilian baxford chests I would recommend that you use the cream wax it's just a little bit more gentle on the skin than the more traditional soft wax so when you're going to do this we are we've already prepped her we've already got her ready to go so we're going to use the cream wax I'm here to show you how nice this goes on you learn to twirl your wax you let your wax cool just a little bit and look how nice that goes off okay to take it off I'd like to be the waxer that doesn't hurt as much I'm the non-painful waxer my clients appreciate that so when you take this off I'm just going to take it off in small strips so we're going to take it off like this we're gonna take the wax off this is Bailey our model here is also my granddaughter and so what I'd like you to do is I want you to be honest I want you to put your hand on her arm out and feel your arm that you feel sticky or tacky or you know no not at all okay so we've got the wax off of her now with most waxes you would not do this but I'm going to show you a really cool thing about relax relax so now we have the wax on our strip and I can put and I don't have gloves on I mean I don't have oil on my gloves so I can still touch this wax and then I can reach over and I can touch her hair okay I wouldn't do that with too many other waxes our waxes only have limited ingredients and we use only chroma folio rosin so now what we're gonna do is we're going to go and we're going to use our pearl rose wax our firm Rose wax is more of a traditional soft wax so we're going to go over here on this part of your arm and we're going to learn to twirl because that way you're not going to spill your wax and if you allow to your wax to pool just a little bit on the skin before you pull it down you get so much more wax going in larger areas and you don't use as much wax it's not as thick so then we can do this and we can take off this again now look how thin these strips are that are coming off on her this is your best tool and your best guide your strips and you can see where it's darker right here that's going our ties that's actually just about the width that's just about the width of the stick okay and that's where a waxy doesn't hurt nearly as much okay so I'm gonna bring this up a little bit more here but I'm still making small strips and so again Bailey's going to touch your arm here and you can get all but once off of my arm does it feel sticky no 310 again you can put your hands in your wax and you can pet your clients okay and they're gonna don't do this with any other waxes we had a trade show one time when somebody came with their hands stuck on there so now you're going to calm the skin down after wax we're gonna put a little bit of no trouble mama okay just a little bit this would probably work better if it didn't have the seal on it I gotta grab the one without the see what I'm gonna ask you to do that because I have clothes on so we're going to put a little bit of nacho mama on her and this will take the redness out and calm it down you'll get sort of a new sort of cooling effect with this and then we'll get okay now we're going to show you what I use the other arm and we're going to show you about our our hard cuts so we're going to take this one we're going to be ten like that arm is a Brazilian wax okay so we're going to show you how to prep the skin for a Brazilian so the first thing you're gonna do is you're gonna the skin here you're going to take your clean sweep you're gonna put a little bit of clean sweep on this is an antibacterial cleanse so with it's a Brazilian you want to make sure you give it a really good cleanse you want to get into all the little nooks and crannies etc there so then we're gonna dry this off water and oil do not mix so you want to make sure that it's a dry surface okay so drying off my gloves a little bit and so what I'm going to do is we use a pre and post oil you do not need two products one pretty oil at one coastal just one is going to work we want to Orly your gloves because now your gloves are not going to stick to your client so we're going to put a little bit of oil on her you always use a oil with the hard wax and in until you get the right consistency down from how much oil to use then you can pretty much kind of blot it off and wipe it okay so now when you get into using your hard wax you're going to have this crust on top of your wax you just remove the crust back this is where it's a little bit cold in this room so our wax is a little crustier than music so we're gonna take this out again we're going to learn well and when you apply wax hard wax I want you to play this way try this your wax is cooled and it's going to go right down her arm so I put it on pretty gently the first time and now I'm going to go back through and I'm going to use a little bit more pressure and I'm going to build that pressure up a little bit you want to be able to have ridges all around so your wax is already dry your wax drives very very quickly almost around content and then you just pull it up and sometimes you have a bad pull so we're going to do this so we're going to take you did not need to real I might have had a little bit too much oil on that so we're going to redo we're gonna put our stick down we're going to bring our so we're going to know we're going to drive your wax is almost fried [Music] now one of the things that relaxing wax does that other waxes don't really do we have really is from a boolean Rosa our hard wax has only three natural ingredients from the folium rosin vegetable oil and microcrystalline so it's going to give it this nice stretch and nice pull it's not going to get as hard on you nearly as fast eventually all hard wax will get hard yes you sure of the game but it'll give you a little bit more time to work with it and go around those lips and crannies and they'll give okay", "fDPHupu5z2k": "here our table grape vineyard we have a different trellis system than you would typically see in a wine grape vineyard the trellis system is the metal structure and wires that hold up your vines and your in your crop so the difference here is that it's as big v that allows you to hang your whole crop out here in the open and this canopy will go up and over these centers and it supports this big vine which is different than a wine grape which is much smaller the rows are sometimes more narrow so it's a different system to harvest table grapes to get to market", "MUcQgc52dEM": "now it's gonna record the audio and it's going to record the presentation and that will be sent to you after the session so just to introduce myself I am Holly Hayes so don't let the accent for you yes I am Australian and yes I worked for Curran Lab Australia for many many years directly with Lillian Curran who you'll see on the screen here however I am based in North America now so I'm here to help you I am here to help you with any of your training needs anything to do with Curran lab or anything to do with waxing what we're gonna do today is go through this PowerPoint presentation then I'm going to give you guys some time at the end to ask me some questions ok so yes you can chat to me in the Q&A section but I would just like to proceed on and get through the presentation so that people that do have questions can speak to me at the end I will go through your questions I will get the full track current sorry chat transcript at the end of the session so I would love for you all to put in the Box where you're from where you're joining us from today what you're excited about any struggles that you're going through at the moment that you'd like me to address in future sessions perhaps so I am here for you the other thing at the end of the session I will be on Instagram so if you want to send me a direct message privately it's Curran lab underscore North America we can chat from there as well so that's basically what's going to be happening so I am going to go through the PowerPoint presentation I'm just gonna check quickly check the chat and then we'll get into it great okay so everyone understands hello to everyone thank you okay so we're going to be talking about facial waxing today so at the end of this session I am doing this via the PowerPoint because as you can appreciate at the moment it's been really difficult to get models to do hands-on training so I'm gonna go through the PowerPoint and share a lot with you about facial waxing in the follow-up email you're actually going to get our full on facial waxing videos so that will be a point of reference for you because definitely take this time to practice as much as you can to learn some new techniques while we do have this downtime and also during this session I'm going to talk to you about things and the side of wax and waxing that maybe you actually haven't been exposed to before maybe you've been too busy in the salon I'm going through the motions focusing on your clients which is what we should be doing to actually stop and think about some of these points that I wanted to bring up with you today so so first of all I'm just going to give you an overview let's talk about hard versus soft wax okay so one of the things I'll just give you a little bit more of my background story so working for Curran Lab as their head trainer for seven years in Australia that did allow me to travel the world and teach waxing in all parts of the world when I moved over to North America I actually was managing a salon for the first six months of being here and this is what inspired me to come back and spread the quran web word again because I saw so many things going wrong and clients telling me of dreadful experiences they had with waxing so the first thing we need to understand is hard wax versus soft wax and where they should be used okay so when we're talking about facial waxing in my opinion gone are the days of using soft wax on the face and that's what we're gonna be focusing on today and how we can avoid things going wrong in the waxing room so soft wax as we know should be used on large areas okay the hard wax is much better for sensitive delicate areas but as esthetician sometimes we do face challenges when it comes to hard wax and that's what I'm hoping I can share a little bit more with you today and make your life a little bit easier you'll also will get sent this full presentation at the end okay so you can refer back to anything any of the points on the slides so we are going to be talking about clear waxes versus cream waxes okay and we're also going to be talking about synthetic versus natural now shout out to my team if any of them are on the call today Traci and Renee they're always saying to me how much I should talk about synthetic versus natural in my presentation because them having been in the beauty industry and except aesthetics industry for many many years they found this so interesting when we first started working with Curran lab so I'd like to share a little more about synthetic versus natural so what does this mean naturally is not always better now I think you know when it comes to areas of skincare and other areas of beauty we are constantly bombarded with marketing that tells us natural is better but when it comes to waxing this is what I'd like you to understand natural resin is much cheaper in production it comes from a pine tree so what that means is that I can't guarantee to you that the wax you use today that comes from the pine tree will behave exactly the same way in three months time okay it's very inconsistent there is no quality assurance because you don't know what you're going to get you'll find that natural resins are normally found in waxes that are darker in color and they normally have a smell now when I say smell that could mean covered up in lots of fragrance to hide the fact that it's a bad resin or it could actually have a very burnt chemical smell to it so if you're noticing any of these things when you're working with waxes this is not a good thing this is not a good thing for you as the aesthetician because those type of waxes tend to go very brittle on the skin and break for the client it's also terrible and this is the feedback that I have been getting since I've been working hands on in North America they go to salons that use these natural residents that are really poor quality and they find it very painful this is also why people turn to soft wax more because if the wax is breaking on you and you'll have to you're constantly having to pick at it to get it off the clients skin that's very uncomfortable so the client actually demands of you please use the one with the paper strip it hurts less so if anyone can relate to that please give us a shout out as well this type of wax will also cause excessive redness it is designed to remove everything in its path that's why it has been around forever in a day when waxing first came into the mainstream it was all pine resin because it removes everything in its path which sounds great in terms of if it can just remove all the hairs but when I say anything in its path that means skin any obstacles that might be in the area very very uncomfortable for a client experience synthetic resin this is the people don't know much about okay Coran lab predominantly use high quality synthetic resins in all of their waxes you can tell this because the colors are very they're very light they're Pleasant there's not a lot of fragrance for example our brooms hard works it's the oh it's a white wax and that can only contain the highest quality synthetic resin because you wouldn't be able to cover up a bad resin and make the wax white it would be physically impossible the other thing synthetic resins do they reduce the redness they're really good for sensitive skin and from an operator point of view they are very pliable and flexible so what that means is you don't have that snapping midway through doing a Brazilian okay very very different experience I have put some resources here for you a video that will explain more about this and also an article and I will attach that article in your resources at the end of this session so it's basically just figuring out what's gonna work for you synthetic versus natural hard versus soft and why the good news is if you're using Curran lab or if you're interested in using Curran lab we do have a wax for everybody we have film high waxes we have hypoallergenic hard workers we have gel hard waxes introducing bravado which I'm very excited to introduce to you today we have we do have a clear natural wax if you're doing lots of leg waxing that's what you want on your station and I will go into more detail during my body waxing presentation with you guys about clear soft waxes versus cream software cases and again the natural versus synthetic and what you should have on your station I think it's just a matter of understanding that there's not one perfect wax that's going to be perfect for everybody in this day and age you have to think about how our skin has a change has changed over time how the environment has changed that's affecting our skin and that we need to adapt to the situations and what clients are doing at home so that's why we have so many different waxes and I'm gonna explain what each and every one is gonna do for you so this is the most interesting thing to me when I first moved over here last year and I was working with clients I had so many clients coming in the door telling me that they have sensitive skin also so many clients totally believing that they can not wax their face now the biggest way I change this is obviously when we're going around doing trade shows and things like that people approach the stand and they're like oh I love the look of your wax oh it smells nice oh it looks really pretty I'm like okay can I do a lip for you can I do your eyebrows for you oh no no no no no I can't works my face now obviously when I'm at trade shows I'm talking to professionals as well so quite scary for me to think that qualified estheticians think that they can not wax their face so how do you think the end consumer feels as well they feel they have sensitive skin and they believe this too so what happens when they have this belief so the reason they had this belief number one is because the market is flooded with cheap inferior waxes they hurt they cause redness people basically think it is normal that you go for a wax and that you are red and sore for four to five days after it people don't come in on their lunch break and get their face wax because they don't want to go back to work and they don't want to be excessively red they don't want to go to the grocery store after they've had a wax they plant they have to plan their whole day around this waxing experience and to me this is just so foreign because this is just not how it happens when they're using a synthetic resin on their face so outdated technology you cannot just have one type of wax in your salon anymore I really do not believe this to be true I don't believe that one type of wax can be used on every single person safely that walks through your door if you do have any feedback on this please I would love to read it in the chat later tell me what you think about this if it ain't broke why fix it so this is basically what I hear from estheticians a lot of the time well I've used this wax for the past 20 years so why would I do anything different the other thing to to consider there is that clients don't always tell you that they're having these experiences it might look okay to you when you've wax them on the bed and then they've gone home and they've not said anything it's these type of people that just stop waxing they then start to look for alternatives so threading has taken off sugaring has taken off because they are there thinking that they can not wax their face but the scenario is they've just been waxed with the wrong type wacks so this is why i wanted to really focus on this part of the presentation because this is time for you guys to do research to think about how you can move forwards and you can increase your waxing business overall because waxing still makes up so much about industry it's something that can be done you know in a small room it doesn't cost much to set it up you just need to get a wax pot and a few waxes to get started so I really I really would like to speak more about this I would love your feedback on this as well so in North America I have still found that is so popular that soft wax is used over the entire face and body and I really think that there's so much money to be made for people that can perfect their hard wax they can start using the synthetic resins can really get people talking about waxing again and saying wow this is how it should be how I put up with this for so many years as I mentioned before skins are becoming increasingly sensitive people are using more on their face let's think about what we do at home just ourselves are we doing skin peels are we using a chaise retinols people are on accutane all these sorts of things anything that we are doing to our face is going to affect us in the waxing room this is why I don't believe that just soft wax can be used anymore you need to have a wax that's going to protect sensitive skin the other thing I'd like to point out there a lot of here is a lot about clients saying that they can't wax because they've been burned by wax before this is a complete misconception if a therapist or aesthetician sorry has burnt your face with wax the wax would be unbearably hot what is happening is it's called skin lifting if you're using the wrong type of wax you're using a soft wax on a sensitive skin of course their skin is going to lift it's going to give it heals like a burn and this is why clients think that they have been burnt so skin lifting should never happen if you're using the right type of wax or the right type of client it will never happen sorry my question to you guys hard wax why are so many esthetician still scared of using it we have come a long way since the first the first hard wax was ever made that did do break and crumble and going to a million pieces there's so many options these days I don't understand why people are so scared of them if you have a wax it grows brittle it breaks and snaps this is going to damage your confidence now when I go into schools I hear this a lot and I know some of my educators that I've met in the past are on on this call so you know shout out to you guys as well it's very difficult for anyone to do their job if you're not using a wax that's not going to help you and a wax that breaks and crumbles makes your job very very difficult the other thing that happens is they go very tacky and they take a long time to dry so this is why people turn away from hard wax because time is money you don't have time to be building up your hard wax which you're going to use more product and waiting for it to dry soft wax has always been the quicker option because you put it on and you rip it off straight away but the point is if we have the right type of hard wax you won't have any of these issues obviously having an inferior hard wax is going to cost you more money because you're going to be using more product if it doesn't work and it breaks into a moon pieces how are you going to get it off you have to build it up soft wax use less cost less so this is the thing that we hear about all the time because everyone's worried about their bottom line yes we do want to be using waxes that save us money but is soft wax really saving your money if you're compromising the skin and then the client is not coming back for waxing so we need to stand up and think about this if we have the right type of hard wax and this will not be happening and it won't be costing you anymore as I mentioned earlier cell flex is said to have more grip it does attach to everything in its path for sensitive skin thin skin that's really scary that's really really scary for me because that means the skin could come off as we're spoken about so to think that the the skin underneath the eye area can handle soft wax it's the most delicate skin on our whole entire body so this is why I can't understand why people can still be using this safely without having to reach for a hard wax the other thing that happens that scares estheticians away from hard wax is it's incorrect temperature so this leads to not all hairs being removed you get frustrated I understand I feel you so today we're gonna work out how to have none of these things happening so you can improve your confidence and you're no longer scared of hard whacks okay sorry we have something new and exciting for you guys it's called bravado if you follow us on social media you would have seen heard about it all the distributors have it in stock now it's almost actually sold out when it launched on the 1st of March it only took about a week to sellout in key locations it is amazing so what is it so it's a gel wax and I'm just gonna show you I'm just gonna skip along and show you with the brows how amazing is this you can sculpt those brows with a gel wax getting really close to that brow line and because it's not drippy like a like a traditional hard wax it's gonna stay in place the other fun thing you can do is you'll see you can actually use the strip over the top of the wax if that's what you want to do now we designed it like this because we know a lot of people use soft wax for eyebrow waxing so that could be your security blanket that's how you're used to operating if you want put the bra Votto on put the strip over the top like you usually would and use it like a soft wax just keep in mind it does dry quite fast so when you get confident with it you can use it like I'm using it on the left here just as our traditional hard wax it's gonna dry really quickly and you're going to remove all the hairs the great thing about this wax is it removes all the fuss the fluffy and vellus fine hairs it is amazing if you've used it please share your feedback because this wax is like no other now I just want to show you the consistency of this wax because if you are used to crud like wax as you will find that it's a little bit different so you will see when the bravados in the pot it needs to be completely liquid okay there is no hard core you can turn the pot up as high as you want this is a low-temperature wax so it's not going to feel hot on the skin it can be completely liquid no core it does contain the high quality synthetic resin so it is great for facial waxing that's what it's designed for the skin underneath the brows the most sensitive part of the body it is amazing great for shaping great for all over facial waxing it is like no other it's a clear wax so what that means c3 waxes have more grip cream waxes are designed to protect the skin but if you are a brow artist or you're doing lots of facial waxing and you're dealing with people with that fine fluffy hair you probably don't like traditional hard wax because you probably don't find it picks up everything this will I can guarantee it so I just want to show you the lip waxing now don't worry you're getting the full version of the videos to watch at home it'll be better quality than we're playing it through zoom I just want to skip along and show you what I'm doing here what I am doing is using the q-tip to roll up the face did you notice this client she had a pimple I should probably not have gone over that pimple but I was experimenting with this wax because I wanted to see what it could do and when I pulled the wax off it actually did not disrupt that pimple and look at all those baby baby hairs this was a very blond client I was shocked to see what I got off her face in one pull using the q-tip and rolling up against that valise here you'll see when you watch the full video is the best technique that I can share with you for lip waxing if you encapsulate all those hairs into the hard wax instead of combing them flat and sitting them down on the skin you will pick up more hairs with Coran waxes you can use them with or against the hair growth you can do this anywhere on the body so whether it's facial waxing brazilian waxing it gives you options it saves you it means that if you make a mistake and you pulled it on where you're like oh damn I only got out about 10 hairs go back again and pull the opposite way you will be amazed what you can get out these waxes are designed to make your job easier and make the client experience much more comfortable male facial waxing okay so I also do specialize in male waxing that's man zillion Brazilian facial waxing for them all sorts of manscaping okay men make up 50% of the population there's no point scared about treating them because they love this pampering and as we know male waxing is on the rise I loved using bravado for male waxing I just want to show you here with the the nostril waxing it was amazing you can see in this image here because the wax isn't drippy so it doesn't want to drip down the face like a traditional hard wax would it just went in there its sat in position it made my job so easy so if you find nostril waxing a little bit nerve-racking or ear wax ting a little bit nerve-wracking because you're obviously going into that mucous membrane it can be scary when you've got wax that's wants to roll down the face this made it so easy so for a beginner I think this is great wax to start with because it just sits in place so we got really great results on this client with the nose waxing and we also do a little bit of brow sculpting on that day too so it was it's great so as you can see I've got my very very blonde client with fine hair that it worked great on and I've also got my darker male client that it worked great on as well so it is all round for any type of client it's a great works that's gonna save you this is one of my favorite favorite video is this actually shocked me when I was first playing around with bravado beard line I was a little bit nervous to even wax here because you can see how like stubborn his hairs are here so what I actually did cause he normally shaves his face obviously I went against the grow so I really combed these hairs against the growth with the bravado and you can see look they're stuck in the wax it's great it's a clear wax because you can see through it you can see that the hairs are stuck in the wax so if you use a technique where you're sticking the hairs into the wax they have to come out they have nowhere else to go so this is why I want to talk to you more about working with and against the hair growth and how you can get the smoothest result with hard wax it will be as smooth as a soft wax result you just need to know how to manipulate the situation so this was quite amazing so there we go so it did get out a lot of those terminal thick dark shaved stubborn hairs on the first go and I went back and did it a few times because remember a synthetic resin is designed to be worked over the area a few times without damaging the skin so you can see he's looking great here it's looking really quite smooth much better than what we began with so really it's great for anything so bravado is something that you might want to add to your station because it's an all-round great wax okay so now I want to talk a little bit more about hyper sensitive skin so as I said clients estheticians everyone alike in North America is telling me I can't likes my face I'm sensitive or then I get told I'm hyper sensitive so I'm I'm I'm reactive to wax now again misconception so let's talk about hyper sensitive skin for a moment what is hyper sensitive skin it's defined as a skin that is hyper reactive or excessively sensitive to different products all factors that are well tolerated by a normal skin so a normal skin could come into the waxing salon and could be waxing in particular any of our waxes and not have a reaction however we are becoming increasingly sensitive as a nation think about environmental factors think about what you're using on your skin it's going to make you more sensitive to wax it could even just make you heat sensitive so the heat from the wax could even cause a reaction like this but that's why you need to have a hard wax on your station that is designed to reduce the redness to work on skins like this that react basically just from touch or heat or anything like that this type of the skin even if it's not hyper sensitive even if it's just a slightly sensitive skin it will go visibly red like this it's irritated rushy and you can get a histamine like reaction the histamine like reaction is from the pine resin resin makes up 75% of the finished product so when people say I'm allergic to your wax it's nine times out of ten they're allergic to the resin so all we need to do is change the resin and we can start waxing phases again so we can bring people back into the waxing room we don't need to go to threading we don't need to go to sugaring sugaring can also cause a histamine like reaction because it's not natural for us to put sugar lemon juice on our face so it can cause that histamine reaction as well basically from this type of client who has the reaction like this to waxing they're going to say I can't wax and they never come back to waxing again so it damages our industry when they are having experiences like this so this is why I wanted to take the time to talk to you about hard wax and high-quality synthetic resin because those words will never come out of your clients mouth if you pick up the right wax at the right time so how do we stop reactions like this from occurring if you're dealing with a skin like that then if you know us at all you will know that we are famous for making brilliance hard wax it did win the derma scoped award in 2019 for best sensitive wax if you're dealing with the skin like that obviously they're scared about waxing their face they're not going to just automatically gain your trust back and try it again you need to have this wax on your station this is the wax that I pick up at the trade show when they come to my stand and they say I'd love to try your wax but I can't wax my face I can wax their face with confidence with this wax because I know when they saying those comments to me they've had soft wax used on their face and all the pine resin this is neither this is high-quality hard wax with the synthetic resin we also add the titanium dioxide it actively reduces skin redness so you won't get that look this look of red irritated skin that sometimes takes three to four days to grow down with brilliance the redness goes down instantly I can wax your face then do your Brazilian by the time I finished your Brazilian your face doesn't look like it's been wax and you can go straight back to work or straight to the grocery store no one is going to be staring at you you're not going to be flashing red this is an experience that clients want to repeat this is what you need on the station to deal with these sensitive type of skins the other thing it doesn't go brittle it's brilliant it's not brittle it doesn't snap it doesn't break it's ultra pliable you can use it on the most sensitive of areas it is designed for brazilian waxing I am doing the live brazilian waxing demo on Thursday evening if you didn't get a spot in that class do not worry I can send you the recording just simply sign up for my Q&A session that will happen on the following Monday you will get sent the recording over the weekend you can watch it I want to hear your questions I want to hear your feedback I want to hear what's working for you what's not working for you because this wax changes everything when people see it in action it really makes people stand up and think about why have I not found this sooner so if you're dealing with hyper sensitive skin this is the wax you want on your station it's unrivaled results so easy when you know how as I said a lot of estheticians are still afraid of the hard wax so I would just like to show you this is different because it has a lower melting point it does not melt down completely you actually need to have a hard core in the center you can see me here with the spatula and banging on the hard core in the center this should never be melted down what you want to have is runny wax on the outside hard core in the middle and when you lift up the wax you want to be constantly twirling your hand constantly twirling your hand this wax is a little bit droopier so it's different to the bravado gel wax it needs to have movement in it to be the ideal temperature to lift all the hairs off so if you've tried this wax in the past and it didn't work for you consider your temperature was it like this was it runny did you also constantly twirl your hand until you got to the clients body you can't just hover over the client keep twirling and then let the wax dry it dries really fast it's designed to keep you efficient in the waxing room so you need to pull it out of the pot put it on the clients skin and remove it straight away it doesn't take much time to dry you can also use it very thin any of our synthetic resin waxes you can use thin because you're not overcompensating for the fact that they're going to break and go brittle so you use less product in the end it's just a matter of getting this temperature right the difference is because pine resin holds heat if you use pine resin really runny like brilliance or bravado sorry bravado is not runny brilliance if you use pine resin really runny like brilliance it would feel very very hot on the clients skin and this is why we've all been conditioned to wait for the wax to stop dripping to put it onto the skin because we know the pine resin holds the heat synthetic resin releases the heat as soon as it's out of the pot as you can see here in this image this is drying time so I don't have time to waste I need my client really close to me so I can drop it straight on the skin at this temperature and if you use it like that I guarantee you'll be surprised at how many hairs it pulls out the first time okay so the other thing I wanted to touch on today is our unique and professional wax heater so we just won the award again for derma Skopje so 2019 we want the best sensitive hard wax this year we won for best wax heater so really really exciting now if you do stay to the end of the session today actually I should mention this at the beginning we are giving away mystery prizes so I will tell you how you can enter to win one of these pots or a bag of wax so please stay tuned to the very end and I will tell you how you can potentially win one of these to try out so what makes our wax heater so good it has Triscuits as you can see this the white skirt here for your hard wax setup no metal bar because guess what we hate cleaning we want to reduce your cleaning time so if you're using hard wax and it dries on the metal bar it dries hard then that's going to be obviously a nightmare to try and clean off so when you're setting up for hard wax just use your hard wax skirt when you're setting up for soft wax use your soft wax skirt this will allow you to wipe the spatula on the metal bar get your soft wax as thin as possible the other thing that these wax heater is known for and famous for is its wide temperature range it will hold constant heat I cannot stress enough you cannot do your job properly if your wax is not at the right temperature if you have a heater that you are constantly battling with you're constantly turning the dial throughout the day it makes it very very difficult as we pointed out brilliance is very dependent on temperature if you don't have brilliance in a good heater where it's got that hard core and running wax on the outside you're going to really struggle with it so we are here to make your job very very easy so we decide everything from an estheticians point of view to save cleaning time to save you time and money in the wax room and this heater definitely fits in with that as well so if you want to if you want to know anything more about our heater please contact me and we are going to be giving away a heater at the end of these webinar presentations so I'll tell you how you can enter to win one okay so in summary when we're talking about hard wax which hard wax is right for you so now you might be a bit confused thinking well I love to sound a bravado but also I really want to get going with brilliance again because now you've made it sound a lot easier to use the point is both are correct for you as we said we had to look at our waxing game a little bit differently skins are becoming sensitive however we still need to get all the hairs out because that's what people are paying for so bravado it's a sculpting gel hard wax yes it is still good for sensitive skin because yes it does contain the high quality synthetic resin it also does contain mica so that's the beautiful shimmer that you see that helps to reduce the skin redness this is going to be great for really getting that crisp line with brow shaping and taking off the vellus hairs when you're dealing with peach fuzz on the face basically brilliance what is the difference this is a hypoallergenic formula it is designed for that person with the most sensitive skin that says I cannot wax so really do you think you can just have one wax on your station these days it's not as common anymore we need to have options so that we know we can pick up a wax with confidence it's going to do the job it's going to make the client happy it's going to give them an experience they want to repeat okay so

had any questions for me please put them in the Q&A for me now so I can go through them we don't have to actually jump on call I can just read them out okay got some people interested in Brevard oh that's awesome because you are going to get some some further information sent to your inbox on bravado including full instructional videos on how to use the product okay doesn't look like there's any other questions oh here we go can you use bravado I'm Brazilian yes you can you can use bravado anywhere it is like a traditional hard wax it has just been designed for the face to pick up the fine fluffy peach fuzz but I did a full Brazilian in it and it worked amazing particularly on a shaved Brazilian because it is designed to pick up all those hairs okay got another one so traditionally with waxing you can't do clients that are on accutane or retinal does that apply with bravado as well very good question so no you still should not be waxing clients that are on accutane or retinal my point is a lot of people are using retinol and things like that without even realizing what they're really putting on their face so in that situation if it's a client that you haven't waxed before or it's a client that you're unsure about that appears that they could be a little bit sensitive you would want to pick up brilliance in that situation okay another question does the pots fit in other heaters what is microwave to pot okay so microwave to pot is that the brilliance hard wax and I'll go back to that slide and show you guys any of our hard wax errs that come in the microwave to pot and here we go this slide here okay so these microwave to pot containers here that you see you can put them in the microwave for three minutes or two three minutes depending on your microwave and you can either pour them directly into your traditional wax heater so if you've kept an empty tin you can pour them in or you can microwave our container and put it into the entire wax heater so with the metal insert you can insert it in to the heater you do not want to shove our containers into your other wax heater because I cannot guarantee what temperature they are so it could melt down the container so the point is if you have a different wax heater yes you can try our waxes just microwave them first and put them into your empty tin okay when you are changing resin does that mean you change the product just in case of allergies so what I'm talking about the resin is that we have synthetic or natural resins natural resins are the ones that people tend to be more allergic to so by having a high quality synthetic resin on your station like brilliants hard wax if someone came in and said oh I haven't waxed before or yes I've waxed in the past and I had that bad reaction that's when you would pick up brilliance every single time you wouldn't risk it with any other wax because it is designed for those people that say I can't wax I'm allergic to wax the chances are they're not allergic to wax they probably just had a skin lift from inferior wax so what I'm saying is always keep the high quality synthetic resin on your station like the brilliant and it will get you out of situations where you're worried that the client is going to react okay what else have we got here how can I get certified with your wax okay so we are going to be doing in person training classes we are also going to be doing more online training so in our feedback form I need you to tick the box yes you are interested in in attending more of our trainings so that I have your details as soon as I have my calendar of where I'm going to be traveling for the rest of the year doing in-person training you can come and do a training class with us at one of our distributors and you will get certified you will get our full training manual and you will get certified with current lab should we have more than one warmer for each type of wax yes so it's the point of the microwave to pop concept is that you can swap and change waxes so if you had brilliance to hard wax in the microwave container I could be using that I could then quickly swap out and put in my soft wax into the container just by using the microwave however if you're a busy waxing so that's not ideal so you would want to have multiple warmers with your favorite wax in them so that you can pick up the right wax for that client so for example today we're talking about bravado and brilliance so if you wanted to have both of those waxes on your station you should have them both ready in the pot because you don't know who's gonna walk through the door you don't know what the scenario is gonna be you don't know what they're gonna tick on their on their consultation form as to what they've been using on their skin so if in doubt you would always go for the brilliance if it's someone that you've wax forever in a day with soft wax but you're wanting to move too hard works obviously bravado is going to be your next best option so you should have a couple of wax pots my advice would be having three wax pots I would have brilliant hard wax for anyone who's super sensitive or any situation that I wasn't sure about their skin I would have bravado for my brow shaping for that client that has had soft wax used on their skin for my blond clients that I can't pick up all the fluff that's what I'd be using bravado for and then my third one would be my favorite soft wax which is what you're going to find out more about tomorrow in our soft wax our body waxing presentation so we'll give you all the options for body waxing so probably three I think anything more than like four waxes is getting a little bit out of hand because if you can't find three waxes that basically work on every skin type perhaps you are using the wrong type of wax okay I think I got all the questions guys thank you for your great questions oh we have some more here hang on okay I've overheated in the microwave and put it outside to cool does the inconsistent temperature change the wax okay so if you overheated your wax that's more than fine just get it into the heater or sit it out on the bench and let it let it cool the good thing is about the synthetic resin you can heat it reheat it turn it on turn it off as many times as you like any of our waxes and that does include the natural one as well they're not going to go off they're not gonna disintegrate they're not going to crystallized for example if you are sugar I you would know that if air gets your sugar paste or if you if you do overheat your sugar paste it's ruined its crystallized wax doesn't work like that at all so it doesn't matter if you've overheated it under heated it turned it on and off 20 times in that day it will always be consistent you just have to get it to the right temperature yes okay so I recall somewhat that once you had once you add wax from the bag it is no longer microwavable so the beater the beaded waxes you do not want to mix with your microwave to pot concept any of these 800 gram containers here that you see are microwavable the beads are not microwavable so if you like beads and you're not using the microwave by the bag of beads throw it straight into the metal insert and just constantly keep topping up throughout the day then you don't need to use the microwave if you want to go mobile if you're a mobile aesthetician and you're wanting to use the microwave because you don't want to get to your clients house early and wait for the wax to melt down you can just stick with the microwave to pot jars that means you can use their microwave put it into the wax pot wax that client put the lid back on go to the next client and use their microwave so just don't mix beads with microwave to pop concept and you'll never have a problem they are the same formula but they are just designed differently one melts down in the microwave one does not so if you're a serious busy waxing salon you want the beads probably will be the easiest option and you won't need to use the microwave okay is there a specific direction when removing the waxes with or against the direction of hair growth when you receive the collection of videos you will see that you can use hard wax with or against what this means is it saves you it means that you can go with the hair grows on the first application if you're dealing with really stubborn short shaved hairs you want to go against you really want to comb when you look at that beard waxing video again where I'm straightening up his beard line you will really combing against the growth against and when I remove I remove against as well so you will get the best result by working with or against and a lot of waxes on the market don't allow you to do that they are very rigid in the way that they are made that they will only work when you apply with and remove agates because they do have the tendency to snap hairs our waxes will not snap the hairs that synthetic resin is designed to be manipulated in both ways okay some great questions here guys can you burn this wax I have been using a hard wax and if it overheats it changes color and looks but Wow okay no you will not burn this wax okay so that's definitely um that would definitely be a pine resin that you're working with and I dare say an inferior pine resin you can not burn this wax so even if you did turn the wax pot on high and you left it on for a couple of hours obviously when you come back and you open the lid it's gonna be very very runny and that's gonna indicate to you okay this is too hot to put on my clients skin all you need to do is just turn the wax pot down give it some time to cool and then go about waxing your client so the answer is no you can never burn this wax okay not a question but I just wanted to say thank you I've learnt a lot and you've made me excited to try this wax oh thank you so much Alexis I'm excited to share all the resources with you and touch base with everyone after this training okay now the question did you remove the skin on the blemish of the lip wax great question when you watch that video you've been very excited to see that no it did not damage the skin on that blemish and that's why I was just experimenting with the wax to be honest with you but I wanted to share that video because it was so amazing on that blemish on that blonde that blonde hair that peach peach fuzz on the face it was amazing amazing results so I'm so excited for you guys to see the full videos of this and really tell me what you think about this works okay

questions so we'll just wait and see here's another one okay might be strange to ask but I'd love to see how you set up your wax car that's a great question Jeana okay we'll definitely note that one damn waxed cart set up and actually set up is so important because this is when I do do in-person training and if you have attended my in-person training thank you for coming to see me again um I do go through the full cart setup and this is so important again I want to spend this time while we all have downtime to be going over the simple things that as business owners or estheticians or

high quality wine grapes come from the family of Vitis vinifera so you think chardonnay think merlot think of that family in the late 1800s there was a scourge a root louse falaka that came and decimated pretty much the vineyards all around the world and especially the vanilla a grape at one point there was a hope that we could in fact grow grapes without this little root louse killing the plants from the from the bottom up and folks began to cross the traditional I'll say European varietals with grapes that were native to the US that maybe wine wasn't being made from the hybrids were a little more resistant to falak Syrah so they didn't have the issue and the the hybrid grapes still exist today in the Ohio River Valley there's a lot of hybrid grapes that exist here because they grow well here the climate is right for them to do well New York has a lot of hybrid grapes there's hybrid grapes pretty much all across the US and some of them make really wonderful wines it's just not exactly the same as Vitis vinifera so one's not better or worse they're just different you", "NVdBpWquAVs": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 I don't know what that was this is a medical marijuana review for those over the eighteen and medical patients all right guys you know the deal if you haven't subscribed hit that button leave me a thumbs up like say hi to everybody out there all right we got where do we go so Tara soft wax Mike have native to review we also got a flower haul from true leave we'll do that at the end and there's a new product coming out and some new I guess you say prices on some flowers in other places so make sure you stay tuned to the end for those mmm you guys can see that it takes um that let's roll some out first yeah we've got dirtied abdill's let's clean that one up all right cools off y'all Miller wax up you back for now alright let's give a little hop out there and we'll spread it on the paper you guys can see that it is kind of orange like punkin orange or something I wanted to focus on their real good to spread some on the paper and roll some up and talk about it get up here where I can see it get a little more glob on there so how's everybody doing out there where you got smoking on tonight it's a rain in here so it's a crappy night hopefully clears up so I can get some work done tomorrow or we'll stay at home and shoot some videos one of the two all right we got some of that roll down there you can see that a little better but it is got an orange look to it now I've been doing a lot of research on this one and trust me it took a minute to figure it out well not really to figure it out figured it out pretty quick but to get confirmation that I was correct they advertise this as soft wax and if you looked on their website it even showed a picture in the picture they showed was more of a I don't know like a butter consistency you couldn't even see through it this stuff is got a clearer consistency you can kind of see through it a little bit all right got one twist it up you can see the wax in there a little bit out spider this up all right so this is the my active native was coming at 69 percent THC almost 70 69 and a half that's about all it says on there now from looking at it and I've been tricked once or twice before I kind of knew something wasn't quite right it wasn't you know wax wax and I called the call center a couple times and I will say something you can sit in a parking lot at the store see nobody in the store called a number from the store and they'll say we're helping in-store customers and they'll switch you to the call center but option for on the call centers if you have a problem with the product hit for when you get four it says something about our products are on the on line and the hang up on you so the customer service isn't the best for that I called the call center probably three or four times and asked different questions on it and kind of got to run around each time but finally when I got in the store again you picked up some of the Tillamook strawberry we'll do a quick review on that here for the end to the girl did in it this is this distillate the same thing rides and bike ran tried to put in the chart and tell us there was something different now I will say because I'm not a dis little to fan at all I think it has a waxy taste to it when you try to dab it and just not a fan out this I will say is the tastiest distillate I've had so far like I said I tried true leaves when I first started out you know because people's refilling the vape carts with those I didn't care for it it was too hard to draw on and then you know by decaying got me with their honey well they said kept saying was a honey consistency which ended up being distillate in the jar and then Rises terpene nectar or turkey soup whatever it was was just a little of flavoring but that's what this is it's gonna be a distillate we do have our banger nice and clean up so we'll take a little dab it is very quick it is just just a little with turf flavors in it and it terpenes like I said it does taste good it spreads good it works well on the paper for me crap so if you're using it to spread it in a joint this stuff works pretty good it is a little distant a different consistency as what your true clear would be this is a little thicker and not quite as you know true clear is a little runny and drip you kind of like thick syrup this is more like and it kind of looks like caramel in there but it's more the consistency I'd say like butter so it does spread good let's do a little dab of it and see what it tastes like I got my little dollar tree timer here so we're gonna heat this up for a minute now the Maya cat native said it was a sativa dominant hybrid I found it to be a pretty you know balanced hybrid in my opinion at least how it works for me but like I said when I first got this and brought it home and opened it up you know if you can't see it in the store and like I said if you go on the ceteris website and look at it and it's like to the side it'll show another picture worth a jar open and it has like a it looks more like a butter it's more yellowish sort of mine's more orange so like I said it had different consistency than what looked like what I got so that was a little bit upsetting and I didn't try it for a few days because you know I don't care for distillate wasn't that cool for a minute but then I kept getting the runaround you know I kept calling the call center and I'm like you know cuz a good thing to check for if it's dis Liz ask him if you can eat it if you can eat it it's definitely distillate because shatters and waxes aren't D carved and they're like well you can but you won't get the effects you're not supposed to this and that well like I said when I finally got into the store the girl in there is like yeah it's distillate that should be cool enough we'll see if we can get that in there and get a hit on it yeah I'm not a fan of dabbing that oh yeah then we add it Terps just don't dive right my opinion oh yeah I'll keep putting that in joints I have a spicy taste when you dab it and maybe a little soapy yeah well something I don't care for that like I said it's good in the joint though damn glide it and dab that the first time cuz I'll probably put that back out oh so that one oh man I can't get that taste that one out sorry it just join again that's one I would say get at your own risk it is distillate if you like distillate and you like to dab distillate give it a shot if you want something that's gonna be easy to roll up in a joint that's gonna work too if you're looking for something for flavor I wouldn't pick that one maybe they the strains might taste a little different I've never had this on the flour the flour they did have in was like 12% into my echo that's my passed on it yeah sorry guys spitting in the trashcan don't order target that taste out yeah I'm not care for that but like I said teachers home you might like it you might not everybody's got different flavors out there or different taste buds and all that like I said we did grab some flour at true leaf they had I stopped in there on Monday after work I don't know what is it today Tuesday the only thing they had left was the gorilla grapes which was surprising cuz he said this was the highest THC coming at 23.8 do you think the highest stuff woulda went first you guys know I'm not a fan of the taste of the gorilla grapes really I don't really like to grow a glues at all this is better than the grow of glue it doesn't have that strong rubber glue taste I did pick up two of them you know 27 bucks you can't really beat it nice looking bud nice whole track thumbs on there this stuff does give me I think we've already did a review on it before so it gives me a little bit worse cottonmouth the grape flavor is a little dry to me but grapes in general you know if I eat grapes I'm thirsty grapes kind of give me a dry mouth and then I did have 10% off for my rewards that you want to get like 500 truly points you get 10% off so they had some of the skunk ape a few you guys said it was good so we're gonna give it a shot they're like a dumbass I didn't ask the THC count on it and it's 15.8 so we haven't even opened this one yet don't know if you guys was was 15 that said was good but hopefully it was the mines good they're sparkly I don't know if you can see that look dry just a little bit on the outside but I can feel a little inner little craft a little moisture packing these and these aren't the minis these are the full size so this was 43 well like I said you can see the little shine on the hairpin there I think it ended up being 38 with my discount breaking these open hmm it's got a different smell to it so yeah well freshen that one up we'll do a review on it so let's see we got some new products and some new price structures grow healthy has got a new price structure well I guess not a new price structure they got minis or popcorn whatever you want to call them now they sent me an email a day or two ago hang on a second nose is still running you know saying they was gonna have smalls or popcorn whatever they call them the eighth was gonna be 30% off so it made them $35 and ate 50% off when you bought a hat so a half pounds cuz they're 50 our ate said grow healthy so 50% off the half is $100 for half ounce which isn't a bad deal makes it a little bit cheaper than true leave if you buy it by the half ounce if you don't you're paying $35 so you're back up to you know like Rises price but they haven't had any in yet I don't know why they drop that knowledge and we'll get to the second one here in a second and then not have that product in I called the last couple days and they're like still nothing I don't know why they did that now fluent which was formerly Knox they're gonna come out with no I say come out with the sit an email out so it could be six months down the road we never know if you remember truly said months ago they was going to have snow I think it was and sauce in there blue river rosin wine we started see not yet so don't get your hopes up too much yet but it could be out in the next couple days you never know I'm hoping maybe on Friday or something but they're going to come out with the Oh what was it well it looks like bubble hash they're calling it a melt but it's an ice extract this is what the packaging said because that's all I send you as a picture of the packaging it's was an ice water extract so on the guess in the melt is going to be like a bubble hash and inner Oz and it's going to be pretty much impressed bubble hash so I don't know if that will consist of if it'll be live browsing or if they're going to use it from dried flower so it'll be but it's something different or at least a different process of getting the rosin the bubble hash will definitely be new but like I said it bitten pests that specify in there if it was going to be from dried flower or fresh green buds so I guess that makes a little different to what the end product will turn out to be but they have released a price or anything like that on it yet also you guys if you had noticed we're doing a collab video it's me le k Celtic tech and me t69 me 269 already put her video out you guys can go check it out I plan on getting mine out here before Christmas I think Celtic tech is gonna try to get hers out before Christmas or right after she's not feeling good right now so and then I'm not sure I think Ellie K is gonna get hers out in the next day or so I'm not real sure on that one but make sure you check out all three of the other girls if you haven't subscribed to them subscribe to them I'll leave a link in my video when I posted here the next day or two I might have a chance to do it tomorrow if there that's right and now so my works outside tomorrow so cos rain holds up I'll be holed up in the garage again so mmm and I think I said everybody else is still doing you know some discounts for the holidays true leaves running through their 12 days of Christmas sometimes in their um your leaf is doing something different every day too but you have to show the email is what it says or you have to show the text or whatever so you just can't go in there and say I've seen it on Facebook or something like that so if you haven't signed up for their emails and text alerts you might want to go ahead and do that also when you do that they send you a coupon that you have to show that text to I guess and they get you a flat flower price of 39 bucks and I believe that was till the end of the year I thought it was just a one-time thing but I thought I've seen somewhere else that was till the end of the year that flat flower price but that doesn't work with any other discounts or anything like that but even if you get a discount that flat flower price on some of their $53 strains still might be a better deal I think that's it not too many people is doing a lot of discounts it seemed like it was just truly a purely if invite a can is the ones I see doing a daily deal I guess move is to but there's or just seems like they're not every single day it's like the deal last a day or two long and then they have another one the last two days long if you can just have to go their website and look I don't get notifications from them either for some reason and that's about all I see I didn't see a lot of other ones I haven't seen anything really from grow healthy except for the the littles coming out and like I said that was two days ago this doesn't bid any littles so terror doesn't really do discounts at all I don't believe that much I really haven't seen anything from them all we gots our flour from now we didn't show that we talked about the one day but I don't even think I ever showed it got one little nugget in here now this was the Tillamook strawberry which I was kind of excited about you know because I'm a flavor guy so the strawberry was calling my name this come in at 16% now I would like to add something here because I see a lot of people you know I'm around on Facebook all that crap and like say the northern hash plate come out on Monday everybody will show it that from any dispensary wherever it come from they're all going to be 19.7 across the board I don't see any fluctuation in the same batch that comes out no in ceteris I've seen people I just watched Lake I think it's l.a yke he's a new medical marijuana here in Florida he had this today and this was 14% and they're the same you know batch numbers they only had one batch to come out so far so I believe cetera is really testing a lot more to where other ones aren't so - whereas this might say 20 or 19 it might actually be 17 you know if they talk they're just testing the top buds on the plant and not the bottom ones or the biggest best-looking playing how the whole guard and not the little scraggly ones but it seems like sorter is doing a little bit more testing because their THC is a little bit more all over the place and you're not seeing that in other dispensaries so that's one good thing I will say you're actually I believe you're getting exactly what they say you're getting here now this wasn't bad you know it's got some little crystals on there there's a nice tight bud structure Teva dominant for me and it wasn't a bad strain it wasn't a bad high but the flavors wasn't quite there was supposed to be like you know a strawberry field in the middle of a gas station or something like that it had like a berry taste to it but I wouldn't go as far as to say it was strawberry um and it had a little fuelie taste but I wouldn't go as far as to say twas diesel II I would say it was more of like a very fuel and it was supposed to be more diesel e strawberries so I'd say that flavors was definitely not quite to where they should be on that like I said it should have more of a robust strawberry taste and a you know with a diesel taste to it and it didn't it taste it more like I don't want to go as far as I say a blueberry but maybe like a blueberry with a mixed berry in it you was little blueberry in theirs but more of a fuel than a diesel taste you know I mean I don't if that makes sense to you guys I don't know that it's best way I can explain it but I don't like I said I don't think the taste was quite where it should be it on that better than that it wasn't bad it was thirty bucks I'd probably get him again I'll probably give him a couple a little bit see if they get their act together a little better and plus the only thing they had here was that my akan native which was down like 12 or said I'm not a fan of the granddaddy purple and that was their indica the Jackie girl was pretty good but it was a little bit probably more sativa than I like so I probably wouldn't get that one again I probably get the strawberry again I like the effects on it we just hope the flavor would come out a little better next time but like I said if you want something a little more sativa a little more energetic Jackie girl wasn't bad I was cutting the Jackie girl with some of the decorator wasn't bad you never know I probably get that when he gave it anyways it wasn't like I said a bad one was a little energetic I do like an energetic sativa all right guys that's gonna be it if I hear wind fluent is gonna come out I tried to make a few phone calls today and nobody just knew it nothing there like we all know what you get that a lot in this industry I hear this nobody knows anything that's going on and they don't communicate with their staff very well put it that way but like I said as soon as I find out when it's gonna be released I'm definitely gonna take a drive and try it out because I've had never had bubble hash or ice water hash or whatever you want to call it so we'll definitely see what they're like and I guess that's it guys hopefully you took it on something good out there hopefully you're subscribed to me and like I said if you haven't seen meet these videos meet you 69 check her out like I said I will leave a link I'll put a video up here in the next couple days I don't know quite well in the title I think it's going to be the top strain for 2019 or something like that or something but that's gonna be the collab video like so she put hers out yeah but I will leave a link to her video and a link to Ellie's channel if you guys don't know who she is I don't know where you've been living um and then Celtic Tech she's on here all the time you guys know her I think that's it guys like said make sure you subscribe if you haven't checked out those other guys check them out check out lake - I'll leave a couple link to his channel in one of my videos here coming up soon I got a kind of special video I got a couple special videos coming out I think you guys will enjoy hopefully you enjoy all of them but these are going to be something a little different little fun I just got to get my button here but if we get too many more rainy days that gives me a bunch of time so like said the guys that'll be it until next time keep on talking my friend", "IWjQbwTmZ-Q": "a peace and love for 25 we got some more most of today mana sativa dominant

"GZ88BuPLCF0": "hi I'm Jamie Militello a fifth-generation grape grower from Forestville New York my family and I grow two hundred and seventy-five acres of Concord and I grew grapes for the national grape cooperative through our cooperative membership we are one of 1,000 family farmer owners of Welch's Welch's makes many delicious and healthy products from our dreams let's take a quick look but the farmers of Welch's do in the vineyard to bring quality products to your grocery store welcome to Militello farms growing grapes is a year-round job in the winter one of the most important jobs we complete is grapevine pruning pruning controls the number of buds left per vine which in turn controls the size of the crop the crop size is important because if it is too large it may not ripen properly and fail to meet the strict quality standards of Welch's if the crop is too small the vineyard will not produce enough grapes to pay the expense of operating the vineyard many growers use a pre pruning machine like this this machine cuts many of the Canes to length eliminating about 1/2 the hand labor to prune the vine a worker follows the machine to adjust the bud number to the proper amount to ensure our grapes will meet the quality standard the work in the vineyard doesn't end with pruning throughout the spring farmers are fixing trellises and workers are tying up vines as they begin to grow we continue to monitor their vines progress as the new clusters of grapes enter into bloom in the summer the grapes have already taken form and we continue to maintain the crop using sustainable practices all of our hard work is always aimed at producing the highest quality grapes for Welch's finally as late summer arrives sodas for Asian for Asian is the time when the greats begin to turn color and develop their natural sweetness we farmers monitor the sweetness for the optimum time to begin harvesting we use a mechanical grape Harvester to pick our grapes in a short period of time we are required to have the grapes at the Welch's plant within eight hours of having been harvested our harvest season lasts about five weeks and we deliver 320 ton loads of grapes a day every day rain or shine or even snow there's nothing like tasting a bunch of concord or niagara grapes right out of the vine if you want to experience that same great taste try one of these great tasting Welch products they truly are the fruit of my labor thank you for watching my video and I hope you enjoyed it you", "cFwbDq2HIT8": "yo what up YouTube this is the mr.

and it is I think it's two and a half inch or two inch that's two inches and you can even a got a little little thicker if you want to but that's two inches wide and I don't really know how long it is maybe maybe maybe about two feet long all you do is you get a cap right there put the cap on and with some little purpose glue and then you want to drill an eight inch hole through there and that's how you have yourself a wax cannon now all you gotta do is put your screen on the end of that gun I'll use zip ties you'll see that happen and the process happen here after I've done way in this house so that we keep everything on the up and up here and show you with a really blowing 420 grams [ __ ] high-grade with this little marijuana into [ __ ] wax today and that's just how we do it over here at the mr. t HD channel so for anybody that is new to the channel hit subscribe if you liked the video hit thumbs up I do appreciate the thumbs up if you have a comment you feel free to leave a comment in the comment section check out my other videos I got a bunch of videos up and we're going to be running contests actually with something called the mr. THC 420 miss three parks which is going to be a giveaway that we're doing we just gotta make sure that we could clear it with YouTube because they took my last video down when I did it for some reason they you know said we were you know promoting drug use although that's not what the channel is about again we're not here promoting this is simply for information purposes I'm not telling you to use cannabis that is on your own free will and that should be your choice and not the government's choice and over all the channels merci about legalization I hope that you guys support legalization like I do and the most important thing is to end this senseless war on this prohibition against marijuana too many people are losing their lives too many [ __ ] infringement upon our constitutional rights are happening like you know [ __ ] freedom of speech and shape like you know there should be no reason that YouTube you know these videos downs that have to do with marijuana again we're not telling you to use marijuana we're just telling you how we do it and this is for my own personal benefit here and again I am a medication and I don't recommend that anybody does marijuana it is your own free will to do it if you do it I think we have a young white dying here so want to check that out maybe turn it down but let's see let's get oh okay so that's a little bit over that's four forty three you're going to get or look it back that's basically a pound so let's take someone [ __ ] out of here right now cuz this is a little bit over I said we're trying to do 420 grams so let's take a little bit out take a look at the front of this again this skill come get a shot of that and then we'll just take some heat full time until we've reached the 420 mark 432 and again remember guys we tared the bag so the bag has been compensated in the weight almost there there's the magic number 2019 so close there that's vacant but boom it happens 420 there we go 420 420 grams this [ __ ] so now what I'm gonna do right here again this is the gorilla cookies and I'm just gonna like sit my guest cuz they're gonna pack wheat in here and we're gonna just pack this fool then guys the best wax comes from [ __ ] bugs I mean you could use [ __ ] you know you're trimming stuff I mean that's fine I've done that but if you want to primo primo wax the secret is to use straight [ __ ] buddy's brother that's to prove that's the secret you straight but it honestly I'm gonna have a video coming out here real soon that's gonna teach you how to [ __ ] blow 90% plus pure wax and I have some [ __ ] I blew and San Diego had it lab tested at SC labs and it tested over 96% THC so again I got 25 years in his industry so I [ __ ] know what's up in here make yourself comfortable you know roll a joint hit a bomb you know smoke meat whatever roll up light make yourself comfortable pull up a chair relax on your couch this video is gonna be a little bit a little bit of time the preparation is the most of it see I'm just kind of packing everything in here no you don't want to like grind this butt down that would be a complete mistake anybody that owes you guys is wrong so like don't grind your butt down Zuse whole buttons and pack them in here don't grind the button down my life's gonna die but that's okay I think we'll still be fine and this stuff has a real good floral smell it's definitely gonna blow some [ __ ] Remo wax today and it's really not day I'm on the East Coast right now what time is it Vic's 1:15 in the morning and go shoot the clock show everybody what time it is I got Pookie on the camera again just throw in there so and I end up like filling this tube up we'll have to do a second run I definitely feel like the tubes pretty freakin getting pretty full right now and it appears that I don't even have like probably like about halfway on the bud I'm gonna try to talk it down a little further I don't want to pack it down to two four because then it can be a pain in the ass to get out later so just put about another helping in there and we're definitely gonna have to run a second run there's no doubt about that there's a lot of bum buddy alright so I'm going to pick some of this [ __ ] that I've dropped here throw it back in the bag just a little remnants here so we still know that we have the right amount agreements beginning guys yeah they hit the strike hit subscribe and we're going to take this 73 micron little bag right here right over here like this and now we got this guy right here and we're gonna pull it tight this is just a zip tie this is just you can buy these at Home Depot this is the brand I like right here if you're using like big tubes this is a good brand you want them to be at least about 18 if you're using a two to two-and-a-half inch tube and then I think one on the bottom I do so you do one at the top make it nice and tight like that little slot another one over you could like reuse these they're nice these black ones you can reuse then I'll tighten up the bottom just right pull out here all right now I'm ready to go you can see there's my screen my shit's [ __ ] packed full look so they have a little bit of weed over my over my hole now so cleaned it off expose the hole then our you continue with it now some people they do a hot plating overall form a cup of water or or something like a pan or big pot of water I have using a ceramic cooktop and I have two burners on since I have a square apparatus I'm gonna put my square pyrex dish right on top of there you would never want to do that with gas butane is highly flammable and it stinks so right now I mean we don't want to like breathe in you ters so I'm just gonna the window like that and now to let some fresh air and even when I'm blowing it and while it's on there cooking hot lady but again don't try this at home I am a professional I have over 20 years experience doing this type of stuff I am not advising you to do this you are watching this for information purposes only and this is very dangerous and you can people actually have caught on fire blowing up never use a gas stove if you do decide that you want to try this on your own even though I don't recommend it outright you know person helping you it has experience doing this but I would just be very careful and again I'm not advising you to do this but if you do decide to try this at home do not use a gas stove guys will catch your [ __ ] on fire and [ __ ] you up butane is [ __ ] highly flammable don't like no [ __ ] matches around the [ __ ] no lighters try not to smoke weed around it like it's [ __ ] believable as [ __ ] and when you're blowing huge rels like this you're gonna have a lot of butane present put two three maybe four cancer here there's gonna be a lot of butane in that ditch butane is very cold don't get it on your skin you'll freeze your [ __ ] skin so you want to use gloves when you're [ __ ] with this [ __ ] so I use these work gloves like this these leather gloves right here and um and I don't get it on your skin that's the most important thing do not use it around fire like I said don't be summit lighting cigarettes make sure nobody next you slanging anything you don't have no [ __ ] candles around that's weak don't [ __ ] you're trying to cook your plates on a [ __ ] gas stove make sure to use a ceramic cooktop that's what we're using here electric and that's how you cook this [ __ ] alright so now we don't exactly know what's in this - that's where it let's weigh this real quick and see what we have here we remember that the bag weighed 20 grams let's check let's get one more shot in this real quick here let's see what's left in here so we know I'm like here we go can we get a shot of that real quick there's 213 grams left I think - the 20 so that would be 193 that'd be one ninety three so hundred and ninety-three grams left in there there was a total of 420 that leaves about 200 well I'm pretty [ __ ] stoned right now I think there's 200 about 230 grams in this [ __ ] tube right now there's 193 left there was 420 you take the 420 you - 193 that's what's in this - I think there's about 230 so two grams in this - 227 grams or something like that I think that's about right something like that but so we're gonna have to do is in two runs again this is one another white we're using a 73 micron screen and we're gonna use this beauty right here this whip-it butane these are the double XL freakin bottles again I'm gonna run this through here try to get a good freakin solid run out of this with these guys and you're just gonna make sure that you get the right head to fit in your [ __ ] so you're all prepared to go no this looks like it may work right here I'm just going to pull it off and test it real quick and I made sure we're good to go to eat that one may be a little too thin let's get this one to senior fence or care no one looks like it's a little she's thick that's a little too thick there's one let me see I think maybe this one will be what one right here I'll try this one third times always a charm that one seems like it's a little seems like this one's gonna be perfect right here so I'm going to use this guy right here I'm going to put this right on the top here like this get this ready I'm gonna put my gloves on and now this is blowing 420 grams of Girl Scout cookies cross a girl I'm going to grill I cook raw like cookies here we go I'm not sure you got a good move maybe we're trying to go underneath this light so we've got a lot more light no no here we go and Jenna had the kitchen ventilated it's gonna take a couple tubes of this [ __ ] before it starts flood there's you know getting almost 230 grams of marijuana in this tube so that's over a quarter pound and a quarter pounds one twelve to twenty four would be a half a pound there's over a half a pound in this tube so do them and a half pound almost all right when I got the double XL cans I spent a little extra money but that's what she wants you night out of the frickin swap-out cans every two seconds this is a huge tube I could still hear the gas pushing through so I know there's more I'm getting anything yet but we will just about connect backhand some have to get another can now like I said yo-yo eat up a bunch of cans so you wanna make sure you get the the larger kids and I would recommend freaking whip it or Newport those guys have like no like zero impurities they're really highly refined in well my butane okay so I'm gonna get this other can no just set this guy down right here for a second get another can and then try cones are so freaking frozen right now and bring anybody who wants to know like they can't what's going on is you're freezing the try cut that's what's happening we're freezing the try comes off of the lead the THC crystals glands freezing those guys off like I said we may start to see it come through on this this bottle if not I don't be you take a third bottle for it to actually start coming through there's 73 Michael it's a lot of wheat in here so there cuz there it's coming you can see how nice and golden coming out that's nice and yellow Wow look at that that's real nice in gold again I'm gonna have to run more cancer this is such a huge to viki's covered or nose breathing their butane and you know guys you you can make this tube for under ten bucks you know what I mean and with the with the screams and everything I mean you're into $50 can you hold that right there grab me go another can't because there's a lot more in there that's just the tip of the iceberg well guys you don't need a tube this big if you do decide to try this I mean you can do this with smaller tubes I made this too big because I made a video about it and I wanted to run a lot of product at once but you know for this to work you don't need to run [ __ ] 230 grams at once you can run you know one or two you know Alice's a once you can even run you make smaller tubes you could run an eighth at once I mean all depends you know what what you're looking to do that is [ __ ] gold well probably one one more can through this and they call it and then I'll do my hot plating but you could tell that the Gold's got a little darker after this can the first second can was like super light if you were trying to make it like really potent and you know really hey you wouldn't want to run the you know less cans I'm trying to get more product right now I'm trying to balance um so I'm gonna run like I said by 4kids Serena this is my third Kimble run one more candy and this is still going to be testing in the nineties and like I said this is this is the dangerous part of this guys and girls this this should very [ __ ] flammable so you want to want to like drop a match on this [ __ ] right now or you know have a lighter and you want to stay ventilated too because you know butane is a gas so that's why I got the window and they don't ventilated again I'm not even like recommending that you try this at home I mean but I know some of you crazy bastards will and obviously I eat nor anyone else can control that so hopefully you follow this video and this is the safe way to do things and I'm still getting a lot of flow out of there so even though my bottle is done I'm just gonna keep the bottle on I still pushing for a bit of air through there and pressure which is pushing liquid through those string and like I said guys I'm gonna run a fourth tube on here and you know this is almost 230 greens and again if you wanted this it like super pudding you probably want to run like two tubes this is still gonna be out of this world [ __ ] and that's gonna be my last to die all right guys I really want to try to get as much track home freezing off as possible and you can see how nice and cool that is and again I'm using a 73 micron screen to filter my oil through and I'm using whip-it butane Pyrex for sure I think we're gonna have a really nice you know my next step is a hot plating and again that's the really dangerous part cuz I'm gonna put this on top of the stove yeah you definitely don't want to use gas let make sure that you have electric you can just look at that looks like be almost nice and gold and we'll probably follow this up with another video of the smoke report I don't think I'm going to cram everything into the one video I mean it's gonna be a long enough video with just you know doing a 420 grand run we may even split it up it it all part two because I mean you know we don't want to bore you guys too much you could definitely see that coming through still nice flow guys like another disclaimer not only is this [ __ ] [ __ ] dangerous but in some states it's hi ve eagle to do like it's like me and you factoring so check your local laws make sure you know you're good you don't want to [ __ ] it and screw around and then dump in jobs oh it's not a fun place I've been there plenty of times all over weed and marijuana prohibition so right the governor of your state let's try to get this marijuana legalization a reality by 2020 and we're just about ready to hotplate this it's coming to a slow drizzle and again you want to have good ventilation when you do this all right hello look at that hat looks good huh all right the best finito just gotta like this trip a little bit here and then we're gonna come over here and hot plate it on the stove", "PGbvpGCcq3Y": "so it's june 17th and um these are my hemrod grapes um they're quite abundant full i've thinned the branches out i've been the fruit out a month ago i kept doing it so let's show you how to thin some of my cluster so i have to pick some of these clusters to take off this is a little too productive and so i really like this beauty cluster and i'm gonna take off some like that one yeah i did it folks i'm chewing my cluster of grapes people probably think i'm crazy but uh you know sometimes you gotta do it i can't see it and it's so hard to do with one hand extremely hard to uh to what should i owe here yep i did it i'll do it again this seems like a cute i can only bear to do that much hoping i can do more every day i keep coming out to do more thinning off of my tree here is my other tree quite productive i have a hard time thinning it out but i will if i had to like here's one i would love to than now bye bye it can become a fertilizer for the tree hmm what else can i pin out oh my god what a beauty the hidden one right over there but you know i think i can only do that much thinning today i don't think i can do more unless i see something i really want to do one more one more okay yeah i did it crazy i did it maybe this one okay i think i did like five today that's good so it is hard to thin out this cluster uh but you should um these ones they have great sunlight no shading there's no disease but each of the vine can support a certain amount of grape clusters so if you do want the best sizing and flavor you should thin out them a little bit um so they can be healthier um and not compete for sunlight in that sense you can see it's very very healthy looking great", "16XL1JSrshQ": "[Music] hello everybody and welcome to class in class I want to thank you all so much for joining me here today while we take a look at these girls I've been sitting underneath this frog for less than a week so I think they're acclimated enough for us to do step 2 of the scrubbing process which is to remove everything that's underneath the canopy that's not gonna make it towards the top it's only about 20% to 30% of the plant so your plant should not feel the shock if you do it properly at the same time giving you more energy focused where it matters the most of course on top of the plant for us growers that are growing inside we need to get the most out of our lights with whatever light we're using now guys as you can see my canopy is a little uneven because some plants were bigger some plants were smaller as you can see on some parts there is a little bit more concentration of branches no in order to resolve that I would like to show you here on the blue diesel plane we first start by removing everything that is underneath the plant that's not gonna make it to the top this plant has been sitting here a little bit longer so she had a little bit more time to get acclimated so she is ready to get the second sprocket or trellis niche put on top of them once we do that then we have a little bit more control over a canopy what we want to do is grab those taller branches that were more dominant than the smaller branches and you we will or at worst Supercop them in order for them to share the space with the less dominant branches once we do that then it will allow the whole plant to grow together and all of the nodes to have a even chance for them to flower and to get the most out of your light now it does take a little bit longer so I think it's a give and take what do you guys think is that really worth it to go through all this troubles for the maybe getting the same result at the end if I wasn't to do it I'm not sure being that into this so I would like to have you guys this feedback so yeah guys I hope you enjoyed the video and as always give it a thumbs up if you liked it or if you just want to say hi just go ahead and drop a comment and I would also like to take this moment and remind you guys that the giveaway it is still going on but if you haven't I think that I'll go ahead and check out the giveaway video and now I would like to show you guys some pictures from the flowers to leave you and as always guys put some love on your growth ease [Music]", "6p3Ab-OOuoc": "oh you guys what a big dinner over here coming match it yeah and we got a unit

want to get that off so soaking one about then I like to get a food mill I put the food mill over a pot to collect everything that comes out and it's super easy let's take these guys pick the berries off and I'll do a couple I'll do a couple for you here because I want to show you the byproduct that comes from these is really really useful and it's something that a lot of people just throw away but when I was experimenting in the restaurant a couple years ago we had these really really awesome grapes come in there were these big Concord and I wanted to I knew that there was going to be flavor left over in the skin and the pits because I know sometimes they make they make a booze and stuff like grappa is made from the pits which is an Italian spirit and it's really something that people don't talk about a lot I really like wild grapes too because it's not like I kind of think of berry picking berry picking is kind of laborious whereas picking stuff like wild grapes see that's a rock you don't want that picking something like wild grapes you really get a high yield for a minimal amount of effort I mean I'm not saying I'm lazy but I like to get more bang for my buck don't get me wrong I'll be going out to pick black chokeberries tomorrow gonna make some mean chuck berry jam but wild grapes are just so plentiful that it's really easy and cheap and the flavor of these things will just absolutely blow your mind you will never think about a grape that you buy in the store again you see they don't look like regular grapes they kind of they don't come in big huge clumps and clusters because they're wild so I will pick off a bunch here you don't want to overcrowd your food mill especially if it has a spring-loaded mechanism like this one does this is this is a Roz Lee just a Swedish brand all-clad makes a really nice one too make sure it's all in there and then now use the scraping method and turn it turn it the other way and that's gonna release all the seeds and you can go you can go at it again really get that juice out now use the scraper again and now all this stuff is gonna get released so what I want to do is I like to save this and you can save it and put in the freezer just like this and you could make a wine from this is well let's take this stuff and you can fill it a quarter way you could fill it half of the way and then you top it off with vinegar and then you let it sit for a couple months you can just do that in the fridge and what's gonna happen is you're going to have this wonderful super dark purple vinegar and that vinegar can then be combined with sugar and cook down and made into a syrup and then you can pour that on anything you can even add that to meat stock and then reduce it and whip in some butter and it really is just a great use of a byproduct from extracting the juice from wild grapes and that's how to process wild grapes", "RdWWLj8JgCs": "yeah this is like so like painful like it's just cuz of her hair falls alike where the hair is what's okay back with another video alright just today y'all already know by the title of this video already know what's going on today yeah I'm kind of like nervous

and eat them we put this buying down about four years I think and pruned it back a few times and this year right before we started pruning it again I saw some flower beds so I was like no more pruning weave we have flowers so hopefully we're going to have fruits this year and so here they are they are so delightful they are just drops of heaven I really love the way you know seeing starting from that green and changing to purple it's got that iridescent frosty color it's so Angelica you know it's so beautiful hmm oh just a perfect amount of sweetness I love when I bite into it this in and the flesh just separates and then the blush it's so kind of chewy and I like jelly like they just taste like candy they're just so good they taste like gummy bears that's like made with real fruit juice oh by the way you guys know that you know they say that red wine is good for you well it's actually in the grape skin that's beneficial to you who knew right I mean instead of drinking wine or for someone who's not supposed to have alcohol you can just have some grapes or 100% grape juice or if that has too much sugar you can you know just eat the skin of the grains I thought that was really interesting right you know I heard that the other day so good since this is my first time growing grapes I haven't done much research and whether I'm supposed to be cutting them back or anything like that after they're finished so if you guys have any tips for me please leave them in the comments below and if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe for more and I'll see you guys soon you", "TyuAC616qCM": "[Music] how's it going YouTube I'm always placing here back with another video today is going to be a strain review and for review today we actually have some wedding cake so without further ado as you guys can see I'm in nature here actually just in a little forest near my house so hopefully you guys enjoyed the scenery today but anyways let's get right into the review it is wedding cake so obviously we're gonna give you the genetics of wedding cake which is Girl Scout cookies crossed with a cherry pie so that's what makes a wedding cake and let's jump right into this review basically wedding cake was bred by cookie fam genetics they bred all those famous hype strains like Girl Scout cookies gelato and a bunch of other stuff so yeah without further ado I can't give you guys the looks of these buds because I don't have a nut I will show a lot of pictures at the end of the video so I'll give you the smell of this wedding cake which is something very very unique it has like a very just dank doughy vanilla cookie scent in my opinion it's like really really really good it's very hard to describe when you crack open the jar it's kind of like a doughy vanilla just dank muskiness that just hits your nose it almost smells like when you're baking cookies or like croissants or something like it's really crazy but yeah so I'm gonna give you guys basically the looks on the looks of these buds were just dense frosty just rock-hard just amazing beautiful nugs I'm gonna show you guys all the screen shot at the end of the video a quick tip for you guys if you guys want to learn how to light a joint properly this is my way of doing it you obviously want to get the end lit get a cherry going and then just spark it up all right so as you guys can see this joint is burning nice and white the ash this cannabis was flushed very well the grower is actually fat farm craft cannabis Co I'll put the link in the description and you guys can check out his Instagram an amazing amazing grower he actually grew this zombie curse that I reviewed not too long ago but let's get back to the review for the wedding cake so as soon as you pull this it has like thick dense milky smoke but the flavor is like I said it's a doughy vanilla kind of cushiness like it's it's very unique I've never had a strain that tastes like this or smells like this it almost has like like a baked goods kind of reminiscent taste that just coats your mouth like I said very vanilla a very musky dankey cookie just overall an amazing amazing strain another thing I want to let you guys know as you guys can see I'm wearing my portugal jersey let me know who you guys are going for in the World Cup it's been an amazing tournament so far and I can't wait to see who wins I have a feeling it's gonna be an underdog team but we'll see but yeah good luck to your team in World Cup as well let me know who you guys are cheering for in the comments as you guys can see nice white ash beautiful color nice resin ring going right around the joint it won't be able to focus sorry guys I'm using the front-facing camera I actually have my phone lodged on a like a broken tree branch right now so that's how I'm filming this going woo but for the effects of wedding-cake it is a very very very nice hybrid strain it's an indica dominant hybrid I would probably say an 80/20 75 15 or 75 25 kind of like something like that very very heavy just hit you right behind the eyes you just start getting very relaxed and mellow and just stress-free and it's just an amazing amazing full body relaxation no pain in your body like I said if you had any depression or anxiety it would just completely wipe it away and just coat you with an amazing feeling of just being uplifted and happy and just in a good mood and like you know an overall good enjoyable high but at the same time like you're stoned - it's really nice Wow another person's walking by right now so just might see a dog or something in the video yeah I'm kind of in like it's kind of like a ravine kind of path or bike path kind of thing it's not really like a forest or like a park it's kind of a weird area but either way who gives a [ __ ] I'm just smoking a joint anyways if you guys didn't know kind of Canada actually legalized cannabis and it's going to be coming October 17 2018 so go canada baby so I'm gonna get into the ratings out of ten for this wedding cake for the looks out of ten this is a very very nice-looking bud big frosty dense nugs I would have to say out of ten I would say in 8.5 out of 10 very beautiful nugs frosty dense smelly sticky so that's for the looks the smell the smell is also an eight and a half out of ten it's not the best smelling strain in the world but it's very unique and it's almost kind of like one of those dessert kind of strains that you smoke after dinner right before you hit bed or you know just when you're chilling watching a movie it's kind of like a treat when you smoke a joint of wedding cake like how it makes you feel it's so amazing so that's for the looks for the smell is also an 8.5 out of 10 look smell taste the taste comes through exactly like the smell it has that vanilla doughy cushion muskiness that just coats your mouth and just sits there I would have to say it's pretty unique there's not a lot of strains that taste like this there's a few maybe cookie strains that might have that dough anus in there so for the taste I would also have to give it an 8.5 out of 10 what else can I say look smell taste the effects the effects of wedding cake are in my opinion really really really good for an indica dominant hybrid it's exactly what I want I'm clear-headed I'm able to speak properly without stuttering without feeling foggy but at the same time I'm very relaxed and like very stoned and you know very mellow right so it's an amazing feeling I don't think you can really get better than that for indica hybrid effects in my opinion a great daytime smoke and nighttime smoke whenever you want you can even wake and bake if you actually want to I won't really put you right to bed but yeah overall for wedding cake I'm gonna have to give it a solid 8.5 out of 10 it's just that a really well-balanced strain it hits all the marks looks smell tasting effects it's really dank you know the Terps are there so in my opinion it's a very solid strain make sure you guys can get a verified cut of wedding cake if you guys are looking to pick this up so yeah this has been I'm always blazing's review of wedding cake hopefully you guys enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in the next video have a bake day guys [Music] [Music]", "3HRbycUnX0c": "grapes that ripen with care as the farmers sweat under the Sun delicious and nutritious

Suns you grace you", "pxYCCmlUxVA": "[Music] hey guys today I want to make a video about the differences between wine grapes and table grapes so I've got a couple of both right here first one here is a Cabernet Sauvignon which is a pretty good representation of a wine grape what you see here would be a lot like what you'd see in a merlot a Malbec some of the bigger popular red wine varieties and then here I've got a table grape and these usually aren't labeled I think this might be a ruby seed list but it's really anybody's guess what this is so visually you'll obviously see there's some differences table grapes are almost always going to be a lot larger than wine grapes wine grapes are usually smaller they're more concentrated and you know if it's a red wine it's actually a lot darker than the table grape so it's like a blue-black instead of just like a you know cranberry colored skin the one thing you'll notice about wine grapes it's really obvious is that they have a really really thick skin so these are actually called a slip skin so I'm gonna squeeze it pop it out here and kind of let the pulp out and you can see the pulp here is green even though it's a red grape so all the skin you're gonna get from this is gonna come from that that or all the color you're gonna get from this is going to come from the skin so I don't know if I squeeze it really hard if I'll get any color here but normally you would or pretty much always you would ferment a red wine on the skins and let all that color kind of suck out of those blue black skins on that grape the seedless grape the table grape is pretty much exactly what you know as a kid eating there's a seed usually in there but it doesn't have the crunch like if I were to crunch on these wine grapes the seeds are pretty pretty intense they're pretty bitter they're pretty astringent where if I eat this grape I can't even really tell there's seeds in there I don't know if the Thompson seedless if there even is a seed there and that does bring a question well how do you grow a grape if it's seedless well pretty much all grape vines are propagated from grape vine cuttings so they're usually even referred to as a clone number so if you go up a whole row of grapes it's not only going to be the same grape variety it's gonna be genetically identical to every other grape in that row and that kind of keeps you know if you find a grape that vine that's really working well you don't have to worry about any weird cross-pollination that could happen on the future generations of that grape vine if you were propagating by seed the other big difference between these is you'll notice that the wine grapes are really really sweet the store-bought grapes are sweet they're usually 14 to 16 percent sugar but these red wine grapes are closer to 24 to 26 percent sugar usually so just a lot more sugar additionally they're gonna be a little bit higher acid and all that really helps to give you this big intense full-bodied wine with you know the acid the tannin all that sugar gets mostly converted to alcohol if this is gonna be a dry red wine so really just makes for a really good good wine I'm only talking about red grapes in this but the white grapes are gonna be the same you're still gonna have the slip skin you're gonna have high higher sugars higher acids generally white grapes are a little bit lower in sugar so instead of 24 to 26 percent you might be you know 19 to 23 percent sugar but all still the same family vidis vinifera would be the genus as vidis the strain to be or the species I guess would be Vanna Farah and then from there you have each strain so you know all your wine grapes so those are really the key differences between like I said slip skin big crunchy seeds higher acid higher sugar those are gonna be your biggest differences between a table grape and a wine grape and that's why you don't really see wine grapes sold for eating even well you could eat them but people probably just don't really want to chew on that big skin and they also don't want to crunch on those really bitter seeds so they're just not as you know maybe commercializable from an edible standpoint even though they taste delicious if you like these types of videos make sure you click Subscribe below and I'll put a follow-up article on my website smart winemaking com so make sure to check that out thanks for watching you", "nEHRymKCAPM": "hey guys it's Melanie happy Sunday today I actually have a vendor wax haul to share with you guys I'm in full disclosure waxy dude did

past because he has a dupe for and he tossed some in here for me where is it nutmeg and spice from Bath and Body Works where is it I was snooping through the box so I'll have to find it but yeah he has an incredible dupe for Bath & Body Works nutmeg and spice so if you are like me and you hate Bath & Body Works for never bringing that back sorry did you guys hear my dog sneeze if you miss that fragrance I'm telling you he does an incredible dupe of it his has a little bit more cinnamon than the Bath & Body Works version but it's so so similar anyway let's talk about the code that he provided for you guys so he sent me a nice little sheet of paper um so if you guys use the code Melanie so mal anie all capital letters you can get 15% off any order so whatever you guys have in your cart 15% off with that code which is awesome and it's not like Commission thing like I don't I don't get anything if you order it you know I'm very thankful that he sent me this stuff to try but I don't like get anything else so you guys know the promo will expire at 11:59 p.m. on Monday April 30th so make sure that you guys order in the next few weeks if you're interested in trying anything from waxy dude I'm also follow him on Instagram I will link his Instagram and down below and let's get into my way I'm so excited ma I've already sniffed a little bit okay so here we have cardamom and teak so this is one of his clam shells here and I did knock this box around a little bit while I was moving so some of the lake little designs and stuff got broken but that was totally my fault oh you guys this is a really beautiful scent this is not something that I will probably keep I think this one and there's a couple other ones that I know that my brother would absolutely love they're much more manly sense and cardamom and teak is a very masculine scent it's beautiful and if you are looking for just a really romantic slightly more masculine like bathroom type scent this would be amazing you guys I really get that like woody teak note and I also get a little bit of that cardamom um I will of course be melting these over the next few weeks and be sharing with you guys my thoughts in my weekly home fragrance roundup so do stay tuned for some reviews of these next is oriental tobacco which is another one that I think my brother would love tobacco scents are usually not my favorite this one is lighter it is a much lighter scent I also pick up a little bit of citrus in this one for some reason but there's also that like earthy like spicy type of note as well which is what I'm guessing that like oriental note is in here it's really nice but it's definitely a dude scent it is very much a dude sense so there's that frosted lemon squares I'm excited about this um it's so fresh and you know what I actually get a crust in this like a graham-cracker type of crust no but the lemon is not a lemon pledge cleaner scent at all it is very like fresh-squeezed sugary lemon it's really nice I cannot wait to warm this in fact I think this one is probably gonna be one of the first downstairs now I do want to cure these for just a couple more weeks before I actually start melting them but I'm gonna like start designating them to like their rooms where they're gonna melt and then in like another week or so I'm going to cuz these are like all pretty fresh pours so this one is he says melt after four or five so he may have actually already cured this I'm gonna try it if it's not strong enough for me I'll cure it for another couple weeks and then I'll come back to it um this one was poured 3 to 18 so this one's probably good this one's over a month old ooh this is downy April fresh just going in my laundry room this smells exactly like downy like the original downy oh that's good that's totally going in my laundry room so excited about that this is southern sheets this is another laundry scent that I loved when I open this I was like oh this is more of like a line dried fresh cotton type of scent this one's beautiful you guys and I love I love this type of bar where like you have to like chunk it up yourself I think it's nice to have these like individual serving sizes but I also kind of like the bars where you have to chunk them up yourself I just think it's fun to do that um so here's the nutmeg and spice here it is okay he totally tossed a couple of these in here for me because he knows that I love it you guys it's so it's so almost dead on it is so close the only thing is that there's just that hint of cinnamon that is it's almost just a touch too much cinnamon but it's so incredibly close I actually just went through all my candles and organized them and I found my remaining two nutmeg and spice and I compared it by side it's incredibly close to you guys so here I have Hawaiian pink hibiscus and then Jen's lavender caramels I haven't opened this one I want to have your caramel this smells mostly just like caramel to me no there's some lavender there totally is a little bit there is just that like tiny hint of lavender but it's more caramel and it's like a rich like creamy caramel that's actually pretty nice I don't normally like caramel too much that's this smells like Hawaii this smells like a tropical flower it's beautiful that's the name pink hibiscus right that's beautiful I really really like that one that's a nice floral so let's take a look at some of these different formats here so these are like kind of a larger scent shot so this one here is cotton candy mmm about this this one's it's cup it's pretty light but it does very much smell like a clean cotton kit like like a blue raspberry cotton candy not like the pink cotton candy like the blue raspberry I think I'm gonna keep this one for this room this one is blue cotton candy so funny I think that this once more smells like the blue raspberry cotton candy than this one does I take it out of here this one doesn't really smell like cotton candy to me it just smells like sweetness like sugary kind of generic sugary sweetness not like generic bad but just sugary sweetness I guess that cotton candy is fun shudder so there's that but anyway we have so many more to go through are there any other format okay how about the cute little shapes all of these little funnies they're so cute mom's peanut butter cookies yes totally smells like peanut butter cookies you guys that's good okay that's staying with me my brother's not getting that one oh that's good that's going in my kitchen uh tropical cake this smells like pina colada I don't get cake I smell pina colada I smell pineapple and I smell like coconut cream it's nice but I hope I get some cake when I'm warming it so that's going in the kitchen oh my he packed this box fool you guys this was super generous of him um peachy keen rose I don't know that I'm gonna have time to go through all these because this video is gonna be so long but peach and Rose that's amazing I would never think to put those two together oh you guys should try this okay if you place an order you need to try this that is phenomenal it's not old lady rose it's like fresh garden rose and like fresh juicy ripe peach one more blackberry Moss that's different that it's slightly masculine with that like green earthy moss eerie note and then there is a fruity it's a fruity berry note I don't know that it's blackberry

"KTnYW5mLgXM": "[Music] and lo everybody and welcome to grassing class and I just wanted to do this real quick video on when should I harvest my indoor cannabis because it was recently brought to my attention that I might have harvested a little bit sooner on my last run so I wanted to take this video just to make sure I'm doing it a little bit better this time being that I am a new grower so okay here we have the this is us a team of dominant plant it's a ninety one orange so this is how I determined last time when to cut my plants you see that little those little hairs on top of the bud they're kind of like transparent or translucent kind of like that little blonde looking hairs so those correct me if I'm wrong guys but those I believe they're immature or pistols that I'm not form or receded or change colors so therefore it's immature so when you see those on your bud it means that the but it's not ready correct me if I'm wrong guys so then again this plant as we can see she is not ready sativa I know she wasn't gonna be ready but as we take a look here this is our Sunday driver and guys you could use your phones to look at the trichomes and stuff on the plant but then again this is how I did it last time looking at the hairs and how swollen the bud is so okay here we have less of those transparent hairs they're starting to become a little bit more orange but still this but has not swollen to its full potential and I could tell because there's still couple of hairs and are the blonde and you can see the but still is not swollen up on all the parts other plants you'll see more mature bud for example this one here having more of the orange hairs or whatnot but again looking at the try come in if you get in there with the flown nice and tight and steady you'll see that there's not too many amber trichomes in there and here's what I like to see when I'm looking for a trichomes I like ten percent clear ten percent amber and 80% of the trichomes to be cloudy and then after we can see this is a blackberry Kush she is I think she's a little bit more mature than the Sunday driver the buds are a little bit like thicker and you can tell she's like swelling up really nice changing the colors right away so I would like to just say I would not cut my plants unless it has gone through that change or a color that drastic color change on the lease letting me know that the plant is starving and it's using all of the nutrients within the plant very very important for you to see the color change even in the bud you should start seeing the buddy like get purple or orange juice but still these here are not ready to be harvested yet I'm looking at the trichomes and I still don't see any amber trichomes but it was a perfect start to the flood the by this time you should already be in the flush they should start to turn color because you are gonna have about like another week or so before you cut them down and I believe two weeks on those would be good and then again same thing for this ones you see the blonde hairs not mature at all and then all these plants here from seed we have the Cinderella 99 from seed also as you can see she's definitely not ready and the rest of the plans even more so we have this beautiful skittles glue growing here these smallest plant in the room but definitely the biggest buttons and I have to say that I love this plant there's only like a couple of leaves in the bud and then it's just one massive solid color that's something that I really like on on the phenotype on a plant that I would grow again and again and again which would be that solid bud with just a few leaves here and there not too leafy kind of like the blackberry coach or whatnot but definitely beautiful phenotype will be growing that again and I got her also from Canucks True North Sea Bank same with the Cinderella 99 they were both from seed from canoes so yeah guys those are definitely not ready but over here the one that is the most further along would be my purple punch she has been flushing for almost two weeks and again this plant here the majority even I would have thought hey you know what this this might be ready to be chopped down but I want to get you guys his opinion on this because I don't think she is quite ready I might let her go a little bit longer listen to the majority of you guys that's been telling me let your plants go for a little bit longer and it will definitely pay off as all that you know what happens when you cut a plant down prematurely you are gonna lose a lot of weight that you could have had just by waiting a little bit and again beautiful colors letting me know that the plant it is starting to pretty much starve of those nutrients within her which is good you want that you want to get a really smooth smoking bud white ash by flushing your plants and taking the time to flush your plants problem so here we have a plant that's been flushing for close to two weeks if not a little over two weeks already beautiful just covered and trichomes everywhere but as you can see there's not too many amber tri comes in there but here you go guys this is how I determine when my plants are ready once they start looking like this I would also start to consider to chop them down anything other than this in discoloration on the plant I personally would not chop it down wait for them to mature and start looking like this according to the trichome of course that is your base lead as the trichomes when those are done and your plant is looking like this then go ahead and chop her down but until then just go ahead and keep on flushing her she'll turn beautiful colors blacks purples whatever and you would enjoy it and thank you guys so much for the love and support and as always please hit a like leave a comment if you haven't already and let me know what you think about this strategy of knowing of course when to flush your plants but yeah guys thank you so much much love and as always put some grow on your love guys peace", "8bnaBpCCoNM": "YouTube what up what up we are trying this wax liquidizer I'm gonna try to make some cartridges today this is where I all started on

so today we're gonna talk about one of LA's best cultivators and it's the jungle boys and their dispensary TLC dispensary is in Boyle Heights and I ran down there because a lot of people were asking about jungle boys flower and I grabbed six strings they really didn't have that much flour in there and I grabbed the ones all the ones they recommend it and today I'm going to order them in the order that I like them and I think it makes a difference if you've got limited funds and you're looking to buy the best jungle boys flowers and you're going down all the way to Boyle Heights people should know what to buy and I would say I'm very educated so you know if you follow these videos and you've tried some of the flowers you know I'm in the know so what about the jungle boys so I got six strings when I was down there and my least favorite was something called Mac and I've tried a lot of Mac's it's a really good flower but for the jungle boys this was my least favorite flower this flower has 27.6% THC and it says it's a mix of alien cookies Colombian gold and Starfighter and it's 80 percent indica and 20 percent sativa not that this flower is not good but if you're gonna compare it to something like an IO GMAC one or even a core of a Mac one this flowers not as good but it's not bad but it was my least favorite of all the jungle boys flowers which is really surprising so that's number six on the list and we're gonna move up to the next one that I thought was a little bit better than that next up we have mimosa number 14 and you can see this is all in the jungle boys packaging with the seal and most of number 14 is Clementine 30% indica and 70 percent purple punch and I like purple punch but this flower was very citrusy and the feeling was actually good but the flavor was so heavy citrus I put it to the bottom of the list I'm a daily daily vapor daily I'm looking for daily drivers and this is not it but the feeling was good so mimosa number 14 is number 5 and we're moving on up and at number 4 we have an indica hybrid grape head and this flower is grape pie and lemon jacket 70% indica and 30% sativa and this flower has flavor through the roof just fantastic I like this flower this is where it starts to get a little better for me this flower comes in at number 4 grape ed by jungle boys so we're gonna stick a straw of the winter into the vapor cup and we're gonna do this at the end congratulating the jungle boys for their great flower and it's just so wonderful in LA you have all these great cultivators you can try their flowers and we can all be judges of which one's the best number 3 so we're moving on up is something called wedding cake and if you can imagine it this flowers an indica hybrid and this flower has 35 percent THC and you can imagine that it even at 35 percent THC it didn't win it's not about the THC it's a way it's it's about how all these THC CBD the terpenes everything works together to make the great feeling the wonderful feeling and this flower wedding cake came in at number three but we're gonna move up and at number two we have an indica with 25 percent THC called Sunday driver and when I true when I tried this it was Sunday morning and I'm telling you it was great I was cruising it was perfect for a Sunday morning I love a Sunday driver I thought this was a really good flower and Sunday driver is Fruity Pebbles great pie it's 80% Fruity Pebbles 20% great pie and that makes it a indica dominant and indica dominant hybrid and I like this flower if you get a chance to see jungle boys now you're getting into the ones that are really good flowers Sunday driver by jungle boys there's a very good flower boy now we're going to number one of all six of the jungle boy strains it was easy to pick which one I liked the best wedding cake is sweet sunny driver sweet jungle cake is the sweet and this flower has 30% THC it's an indica and this was the winner of all the flowers I tried from the jungle boys jungle cake was the best so if you're going down there and you're looking for the best one of these six for sure this is the best one so we've already loaded up the vapor cup you can see I've got this set to 340 I've got vape in the straw so congratulations jungle boys you really have great flowers I only review flowers I really like so let's enjoy a little jungle cake out of the vapor Cup at 3:40 did you see all that paper I'm telling if you haven't tried the vapor cuff this thing anyone who gets it it's a life-changing item I'm not kidding you really don't stink and I would say that people that have it use half the flour that used to really heard that from bud tenders down at dr. green thumbs because I they've tried this item and I would say that jungle cake vapor cup together what a winner is the doctor if you like the videos please subscribe if you want to see vapor Cup it's available on vapor cup com this item is just fantastic buy it for yourself you'll never be disappointed thanks for watching the videos party all my friends [Music]", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "8DVA8ZJaiVc": "[Music] what's up guys p2 peeps and continuing our uh you know fake cartridge exploration we're going to be taking a look at some real fake cartridges so um background on these i have tried these before i have tried uh two of them before and now when the time i tried them uh they were definitely a really cheap price and i was thinking to myself like yeah dude i trust my plug these you know looks great oil looks like a good color and um you know it hits okay and i'm getting i'm getting loaded so it's whatever you know 15 a gram it's cool but uh now that i'm older and wiser i know that's kind of dumb like sure you could trust your plug but dude if you're not actually getting the lab results or anything that's really scanned or verified or you don't or like you know if you know or you don't know i mean if you don't know uh what is inside of the cartridge like you didn't see the person fill it up um then don't trust it that's just the rule of thumb here guys like when it comes to concentrates and um cartridges and things like that you might be thinking no one's got time to fake any of that stuff or whatever whatever but honestly they do got the time people make a killing off of these cartridges off of killing people so just be careful what you put into your body and if you're buying cartridges off the street please make sure that is not any any dank vape stuff or any of those weird you know cartoon graphics on the the box just because someone's got a box that's got like a graphic on it doesn't mean anything so guys um i'll show you guys first the worst looking cartridge of them so this is the uh container they came in this is a clear kings i'm not sure if anyone's ever had a real clear kings or anything like that but if you guys have please let me know down know down below in the comments and you know let me know how that was for you so it says here on the front store at room temperature exposure to direct sunlight may cause cartridge to leak or oil to discolor that's something that i thought was going on with this guys this is the cartridge we're working with you see those black splotches and stuff all around it that's that's not supposed to be there you know we see that the black spot just here down there and um you know let's just take a look at a thickness test i'm just going to turn this to the side look how fast just look how fast that oil is traveling that's not that's not natural for your regular oils yeah grab my cart right here real bear lab stuff look at that nothing it's barely moving on this one but look at that it's already almost separated entirely to the bottom see nothing's moving still from this nothing yet and yet in only about 10 to 15 seconds this is already dripping to the bottom so that's another thing that threw me off about the cartridge you know the color and um how fast it was you know moving down and things like that but when i first got it guys it was not this color it was not this color it was like a golden color so let's read a little bit more here on the label and packaging i'm not sure guys if this brand is exactly like a fake brand or not you know i don't want to call them out because for all i know this could be a real brand that's just uh you know getting getting under fire um or getting copied but yeah see this whole thing has you know all these uh labels and websites and you know warnings and things like that but those are really easy to print on to just about anything nowadays so you can't always trust your plug stuff just because it's got a label like i was saying the ingredients here let's see it says distillate and fractionated coconut oil uh on the ingredients there so um yeah that kind of threw me off so when i was first hitting these their flavor was uh the thing that really stood out to me i definitely tasted that little coconutty flavor so that's why i when i first had these i was thinking these are all right you know these aren't too bad i wish they could have better dirt flavors but you know for a small cart brand this isn't that bad 20 15 a gram that's that's way too cheap you know at the time of course i didn't really think about that so yeah this is definitely not good oil definitely not you want your oil to be thick if your oil is moving around this fast it is not all oil this has definitely been cut with something else and that's why it is super liquidy you know another reason why a cartridge may be super liquidy and move around fast is because it's it might be you know surrounded by a lot of heat things like that but in this case it's about room temperature in here guys i've been keeping this in a drawer this is not this one specifically has not seen any sunlight at all so the fact that it has turned this color is definitely alarming so that was this cartridge this uh wedding cake one and so now we'll take a look at the next cartridge we have from the same brand and uh i'm sure same source this one is a runts cartridge so like i said before it's the same same brand and all that stuff so it should have the same ingredients etcetera etcetera but the surprising thing about this one is i've had these for just about the same time and this one still retains its golden color uh it still looks pretty decent you know um one thing i'll also say guys about uh fake cartridges is the rod size so uh here let's actually do another direct comparison between this one and the bear labs car so as you guys can see this cartridge on the left here is a lot thicker in the rod the middle portion than the cartridge on the right here see the rod on this cartridge right there it it's a lot thinner you know it gets thick to the bottom base here but for the most part your cartridges from the dispensary or legal sources are going to have that a lot skinnier rod and you can see here it's just thick all the way down through there it doesn't really get too big towards the bottom there uh when you see the bottom you know what i mean it gets a little bit wider but not by a bit like by too much where as if you look to here the size of it gets a lot bigger towards the bottom so yeah if you see um cartridges with just rods that are way too big down and you know the ones in the middle that's another sign that you could be dealing with a fake cartridge so these rods uh the thicker rods here allow for less product to be placed in so typically you see these on the street because uh street plugs can just short you easily they can just give you like .75 in a cartridge that's supposed to hold a gram and it'll still look full because uh you know the rod's bigger now one thing i'll say is that sometimes uh oil gets stuck in the wick so when you do buy from dispensaries if something looks like it's a little a little under it's definitely just some stuff that is stuck in the wick of the cartridge so yeah this is the same exact thing you know same exact cartridge except for the oil now let's do the liquidy test here and as you can as you guys can see it's a little bit thicker than the previous one but still that bubble is moving way too fast guys way too fast so if if you're if your oils are doing something like this in just the span of like five to ten seconds i highly suggest you put that [ __ ] down because you have just no idea what's going on with that anymore um so yeah look i know there's some people out there who uh your plug might be your only cartridge source or um you know you might be in a legal state so it's just a lot harder to get legit things but um i just have to encourage you guys to please be safe these could these can like you know fake cartridges can literally kill you or destroy your lungs if you don't want it you know if you don't care whether you smoke more or you know like every day pretty much for the next 20 years then go ahead and smoke more fake cartridges it's definitely gonna bust up your lungs like i said guys i tried two of these i thought it was okay but on my second one i knew something was fishy because my throat was getting scratchy i was coughing on hits like that were not supposed to make me cough you know i was taking small baby hits of a regular flower and that [ __ ] was making me cough my throat was itchy and scratchy for days i wasn't breathing right for a little bit and that was just off a few puffs of a second cartridge so you know i'm one you know wondering what would have happened if i had continued to smoke that cartridge all the way down to the to the end you know some people will smoke their fake carts and feel totally fine and just keep going with it and for those people i mean do you you know i'm just encouraging people to to smoke safe and be safe because at the end of the day when it comes to concentrates people can put whatever they want in it man i'm not saying stay off it's just like you know stop popping off your plug when it comes to you know your meds or whatever do whatever you want um you know flour can be overpriced at the dispensary but when it comes to cartridges and concentrates guys please please try to make sure you know what's getting put in it and you know what where it's being sourced from all that stuff you know you want to know as much as possible about these concentrates because pesticides can slip in there pines i've heard people slipping pine sole into cartridges you know actual cleaner that's like pledges and stuff like that like that's that's crazy that's you know like i said it's poison so once again guys let's take a a final look here the one on the left has all those little weird black splotches and things like that the one on the right still looks totally fine um but again guys the way those bubbles move way too fast so we can do let's do a quick little comparison of the bubbles here um obviously the one on the left is uh traveling a little bit faster because i think the bubble is bigger you know there's less product in there and um another thing is i hit it a bit so maybe it's been heated up a bit and whatever was liquefying uh or you know was liquefied in there is a lot like more uh i don't know the word i'm forgetting it but a lot more movable but yeah i'm definitely not going to be trying any of these guys i'm really only holding onto these for reference so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a like comment subscribe and i'll be you know talking more about fake cartridges as time goes along answering questions uh dropping more knowledge that i know about them and things like that but uh yeah this was a good thing for i guess people who would want to know from an eye test how to tell if their cartridge is uh fake or at least how to know if i should be a little suspicious about it so yeah thanks everyone for watching if you enjoyed as always please leave a like comment and subscribe p2 out peace you", "25lwxS3U4VU": "what's up everybody did you miss me oh yeah it's the goodest I'm back with another exotic stream review don't forget to subscribe so you can see all the new exotic strains first today we have something special it's Monday so you know we had to start the week off right this is the new Fuji og strain from jungle boys you see it it's official with the scratch here from TLC $60 8th it's a cross between coral fantasy and Larry og testing at 26% or actually 27 percent THC now you guys know all her stats let's finally see how she looks I hope you guys are ready for this [Music] we let me start off by saying and going over this bag of pill the buds on here are very very crystal II covered in trichomes the color is on the darker green side with hints of a dark purple and dark orange and the smells this like a true OG like I can't even explain the fact of just how gassy is truly smelling like you know those guests that gasp that'd be like spanking up the car reeking up the house you gotta keep it and closed yeah that's what I'm smelling so with that being said let's get her out the bag and see how she truly looks [Applause] [Music] all righty then so since you guys and gals got to see how she look what she'd similar at home let's see how she looked when she comes out all righty shout out to jungle boys for soon that's a three point six seven and a three point five grand bank close and personal and see how she looks grab his big mega dear Wow I have to say these buds feel very different like soft but like dance around the edges you see trichomes deeply embed it all the way through the vine and it really smells like that oh gee gassy skunk type of smell now as far as kirpa fantasy goes you know it one High Times Cannabis Cup in 2012 you know it's an indica so and this is a hybrid cross so you know it's about to be very strong that's why you see your little deep hues of purple here that's like right on the edges which makes the flower looks even more exotic this is a new flavor nobody knew was coming out you just seen it if you got it you got it and if you don't you're don't let's see we grab another one here I'm very excited about it it's a hybrid but you can see that the deep hue is a purple that's like coated on the edge of the bud and the trichomes are just it's almost like it's glitter Wow I have to say I'm very surprised and speechless if they just these boats came out looking wonderful almost scrumptious in a way like man oh man let me see him crack one open for you guys oh yeah here we go let's set it break this one open here oh you see it you see it like I said trichomes are deeply embedded on this strain here it's a cross between carpal fantasy and Larry oh gee testing that 27 percent THC I'm very excited about this one I know you guys are excited about this one let's let's do one more just because wow look at this one you see that it has to like color of the carpel fantasy but almost seems like the same structure of the Larry og which makes this even more baffling it's just wow so with that being said let's break her down get her to the ball and find me find out how she truly tastes yeah yeah yeah you see it's official everything is brokedown packed and ready to go and let me say as I was packing this this train is very sticky beware it was it was so damn sticky I couldn't even get it into the ball and if you think I'm lying yeah that part right there this is why we choose quality over quantity that exact reason we don't play no games around here this is the new Fuji og strain from jungle boys oh let me get a little closer yeah with that being said now let's burn this fire I don't know what happened to my lighter in between time of doing this so I gotta use with whatever I got [Applause] well Wow Wow Wow very tasteful I think I finally figured out what that smell was and it is it's reminding me of a grape that really tastes like some grape like jam or my kool-aid or I just taste great that was very surprising well well very smooth very smooth and they taste on this is unbelievable I can't even stress how tasteful this tree really is right now like we don't be lying when we talk about flavors y'all it's like I'm just a real flavor right here just a while stop getting them boo boo $20 you know $25 man I'm basically done with the bow and I haven't felt the high yet so I know is gonna be a creeper which makes it even more exciting [Applause] damn they so good I don't want it to end this is rare why I feel like I almost want to pack another bone it's that damn good oh yeah you see it you said white ash only this is why we choose quality over quantity with that being said as far as the Fuji og experience I'm giving them a ten out of ten you guys really did your thing like comment and subscribe more flavors coming and tell us what flavors should we try next see you guys later", "Uk03Au60gXo": "now we're a lot all right so we're live we got some legal concentrates from the legal shop and this one's banana punch may be

THC collectors check it out shrink gas and we got some double mint straight yes got some this one is apple fritter yes this is one quick side wellness and then we have another one from Creekside wellness and this is oh man this is the animal mints yes Oh taking everything out comes in a nice little box get out so this right here cost for tax it was 36 bucks so let's let's show you guys how much it cost let's go to ease we like this from ease and um the only thing I did in that hurry just put let's see if they have it first so we're gonna go all the way down to concentrate and we picked up a gram of hybrid 36 bucks all right so this is how much it comes out to 59-42 the the tax is $15 and delivery was $8 but we had a coupon at stable 20 bucks so well drop the room George what it's um we had a coupon so we saved 20 bucks and I believe it came out to like 40 bucks so not bad um we're gonna take a dab of this one out here and see what's all about so let me go to rig right here and um let's get off set up but um a little windy outside today so we're gonna get this all set up but we got lots of good concentrates right here on the table we have some banana punch yeah skittles double mint animal mints apple fritter I've not tried this banana punch we just got it in right now brought it right over so we're like you know let's make a video on it and try it out my name is going live I've been really busy working a lot so I'm not working I'm just trying to relax enjoy my time off they've worked so much but we're still gonna make a great contact and grab some amazing concentrates and trade some good brand show so let's see every time I'm outside I cannot take a good gab cuz I like mine L never heats up she's like the temperature I need to be a foam inside it's like [ __ ] working perfect so pretty much take 40 bucks and Grandpa's banana pine too much for me okay it's heated up I think I dislike about the char it just comes off so easily it's not childproof it's just oh yes it is but see look here it's popped right off so let's get some sugar so we're gonna take a nice little dab started to clean my dabber but apparently it's not clean it's like 6:30 that's good we need the carb cap sorry everything wrapped up I've been haven't been using it as much as I usually do all right surest absconders take dab and try this out Cheers banana taste a punch um oh man has a good taste it just tastes like some punch have I got punchy taste banana taste really good not bad um um I never tried oh I've had love packed back in the day but I haven't had him recently but says it's a beautiful day in California oh yes it is some live resin sugar I believe it um but is it worth 40 bucks a gram well is it worth 60 bucks a gram my bad because that's how much the retail price was towards it in attacks and everything um I can see it being worth that much yes and though I could see it being worth how much you not be able to find good concentrates in your area and you're going to the stash and use getting [ __ ] over left and right but I say some good stuff up a session um I see stuff just like this or even better I goes for a better deal look if I went to sesh and picked up off my people let's say half man cuz they always got some good Turk flip it was like this and um I would pay on nicely for a good gram like this at most 35 bucks at most maybe 40 maybe 40 maybe 40 but that's no tax mega would play tax something like 60 so it's like a twin of charge it smells good um you see it's my present if you look at this one and this one at all this one looks darker than this one so I'm gonna try and talk [ __ ] but I never look at this one BAM we're gonna dab some of this don't worry but imma saying what I'm just looking at when I go to the shop or when I buy um cuz yeah it looks good smells good but when you buy it from the shop you're buying this this is what you're gonna my honestly buying I don't care anyone stays this is what you're buying you look at this box that's all you buy give this button the packaging because you're not get to look inside and go oh I can smell it I notice the shops that you smell the flower they have the little thing in the flower but when it comes to concentrates you don't um get to look at them you get to see a photo of almost like oh it's this train so I've tested this much ok but laughs Chester that much but I want to know what it smells like whatever like kind of looks like sometimes different ones look different yeah not talking [ __ ] download packed it's a great product not talking [ __ ] on anything is just talking with this legal market how you cannot look at stuff you want to buy like so you cannot look at this when I buy it online especially on ease they just told me you didn't get it indica sativa hybrid no shrinks some micro cable which they don't let me get so I'm like you know I'll pick a hybrid I got a banana punch let's get straight up I like that a punch I'm gonna complain um we think we should go we should we do have this animal mints we have the Apple flutter needles I sure it up myself there was chatter sugared about myself then I'm staying some heat we got the double man looks like a wet one might be a little oil gas and we got this skittles skill smells good and looks [ __ ] good I don't know what we should have we should just we got to have one of these for you know what having dabbed this animal mint since that sugared up it smells [ __ ] amazing this is from Creekside wellness just look at that such a good I love wax that sugars up the taste has a better taste better everything smelling it's better I already have my with stuff sugared up um heat it up and smoke it car by low tech low tech comm always says it ingredients is cannabis oil and that's always for CNA you know this was packaged on the 17th of January so the beginning of the year so this wax is kind of old sound like old old well you know it's it's been stood on the Shelf probably why I like we're in June so six six months ago six months ago this whack its packet so yeah it's best by next year and I kind of in against him it's good it's not bad but what I would i buyed every time no I um I buy them once in a while all right you know I'll get that discount codes I'll put my discount code below well I did this so below if you go check that out what do you go to my East video and you can say 20 bucks so you live in California Denver I believe Washington actually has it too does it feel to see if I need that he'd have it I would check it out he's just wonderful

you're like it is blowing don't eat this up with a nice day so we're kind of outside all right we gotta go in now perfect um I'd a broom look at some gaps it up right here it's all sugared up it's it's hard everything it's it I'm some heat I didn't whip it this time I just let it sit just to get that nice sugary look and this right here was 20 bucks a gram so you could I'm not gonna bring this one out but 20 bucks a gram for this one quick side wellness so we [ __ ] with a lot of the companies you know this is that 600 so okay let's go good um comment below while you're smoking on cuz we right now we're smoking on animal minutes we're gonna smoke another one right now put some skittles so we're dabbing on the animal mints right now what are you guys smoking on we are smoking on that fire dad I'm some gas and Criseyde wellness just dab some loud pack banana punch actually really good but is it worth buying it from the shop and paying the tax mmm we got the money to spend on it [ __ ] it just do it but in my opinion if you have a good plug that could hook you up buy off him support him none of these legal shops have some good stuff and sicko many have this net but I haven't been blown out of the water by anything illegal everything's a psycho you know I get that like it's a chore for my buddy for like cheaper but that's the legal concentrates yeah looks good nothing wrong with it has a good look good smell but in my opinion I don't think it's worth that's worth 60 bucks oh like that's a tax but I'm this open like oh I paid 60 bucks before taxes with tax I don't I don't get stuff like this for 20 bucks a gram so that like 20 bucks you want some more ahead of your stuff I don't was going for but forgot this one's my favorite that's good old gas gas at this rate is the gas um I go saying I don't I don't think it's worth it like yeah maybe if you're like say if you're at a state and you come to California and you're like hey I want to try some like stuff I've seen people smoke on yeah like yeah it's cool we cool to try it out but despite all the time farts now like I go to the shop like I went the other day I bought that voxi I'm Penn and you know like oh [ __ ] like the pinna like 35 bucks plus tax was I paid for two back pins two cartridges pods and that was taken with a 70 bucks plus tax and I bought a battery for $1 this is a promo and it came out like 91 bucks what the Mexican that I don't had a dollar for a bag so that's a lot of [ __ ] money why this were that's 24 a gram cartridge like like I don't know in my opinion I remember back in the day I work at a shop so I know it's a prices and I remember like we give brass knuckle heavy hitters and they're going like 50 bucks a gram 55 and that was just like they were good stuff but like this was half half where am i people each background that much sounds like it's something to try out in this test now I'll post that video later I have it on my phone I just haven't posted it I should post it today though I will post it today to see I can check it out the S [ __ ] I got it for work though it works really good I'm not gonna lie against you [ __ ] high but I only have sex I like when I went they already out of like everything W had blueberry raspberry sounds like oh man but I got it and I hit it um most I just use it for work it's nice it's not bad got some CBD in have some CBG so it's nice and does a job alright we're gonna smoke some of the skittles we have this Regal set up and the skills is gas I [ __ ] with THC collectors so much like his [ __ ] always on point I don't [ __ ] with a lot of like someone I could just buy like all the time and I know it's gonna be good the only few people like you like oh man I want that works again cool dime all right there 600 my god that's such a good wax it's Soter P as like a good like sweet really sweet fruity like I don't know it's like a skittle taste like that that Roma of skittles I guess you'll say it's a kind of fruity but I don't know like I think it's more like fruity in a way like as I can't interpret asus2 it like it just has a good taste I have a cushy taste as a sweet taste as a earthy taste woody taste I got has like all these taste is just like popping up Oh ma'am like I'm gonna give you guys my rating on this banana punch that bad I had a really good taste honestly it is not not a bad tastes nothing like that is this I I don't know it's good what I would give it though honestly is like a okay like a like a 4.4 it's actually really good tastes really good has a good taste I get the punch taste to it it has like that punch the banana is there then that punches like punches you on it like this takes over the Vaness like taste it's good I like it I recommend it but if you're gonna go to the legal shop and you're gonna buy something I'll try a log pack out they have some good prices on their flour I don't you ever go to legal shops I believe they're flour users like 30 bucks and starts at so you know you want to try something out I love pack out they got that and they even got sauce cartridges or disposable pans or 25 bucks for 0.3 so you are paying like you'd understand I could attack some [ __ ] that's the thing about California that [ __ ] tax cuz everyone wanted it legal weed and analyze a [ __ ] tax is gonna be like 30 something dollars and you're [ __ ] [ __ ] and you gotta pay 30 some well 30 percent my dad naturally dollars but 30 percent it's like 32 to 35 percent I believe then you add that to your total and then the other pay that [ __ ] it is [ __ ] in my grams but if you're gonna try it out I try it out I pay it sometimes just cuz you know I do put the channel you know like to try different things out you know it's not bad I've tried other legal concentrates out and I think this one is probably the best when I have tried out it's legal it's a lot of packing now I I lied about that what am I in right this wait before tea wait that's it'll just wait this animal mints from Creekside wellness and this one I here's [ __ ] gasp sorry it's one's [ __ ] gas and then all yeah say what this one it's one such a good taste sorry I'll break this one a 4.5 it's

to the I smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today I'm gonna be talking about this kind of restrain in front of me this is skittles with a Z at the start and at the ends and we're gonna talk about it in a bit of detail right here on the ice smoker Channel let's talk about the background of the skills cannabis train this is a really popular one for gem family and Terk hogs all involved with the creation of this strain it combines Grape Ape with grapefruit to mix those flavor profiles and it really does deliver a unique strong delicious sweet and fruity flavor the tagline for skittles is taste the rainbow and you get that with a flavor of the skills bud but also with the appearance as it's growing if it gets cold just before flowering it develops these nice purples it's just super popular from what I can see looking online doesn't it like you can get the seeds or the feminized seeds so clone only virgin family gifting Terp hogs one of the cuts of skills and the legend was born all right so I know there's gonna be a lot of searches for skittle so this is probably going to be quite a popular strain review I'll refer you to my research sources in the description in a video but it's places like wiki leave seed finder and several other sources just to try and get a background of this strain this particular batch of the skittles is some of the best I've come across this is organically grown in living soil using the no-till method of growing big up to Roadrunner really really nice skills this and I'm looking forward to covering it in more detail let's talk about the appearance of this cannabis strain so we've got the skit was here let's ever look at it I like the brand in I like that skittles sticker there taste the strain bro opening up the glass jar to look at the skills contained within yeah well not as many colors on the but as I was expecting actually I've got our flower from this grower that has plenty of purples and plenty of different colors on the bud this is more of a single green color right it's got the green sort of loosely stacked calyx a lighter color Asian dusty Huai comes the pistols are visible for troodon from flower as well let's get another nug out and just to see what the rest of them are looking like what singular colors you know so when I was reading about it was talking about how it it's got all these different colors but I would say that that isn't showing in this bit of flower nice trim job the buds been presented well I'm impressed with a look I wouldn't say it's as complex looking as some of the other strains I wouldn't say that it is jumping out at me as wowza this deserves its complete reputation based on look a low but well presented organically grown sort of buds got their own unique structure and shape it looks good but how does it smell I like to open a jar and just get a whiff of that gr smell and this is where the true skittles flavor really starts to come through the aroma is so identifiably skittles that you can just tell as soon as that hit my nostrils and that is what gives it its distinguished ability amongst the other leading strains out there you can smell it and know what you're smelling where is love a stranger might be like oh it could be this could be this this is skittles and you're gonna know their skills when you smell it what does that smell Intel it is a mixed sweet fruitiness that combines the grapefruit and the grape together it kind of comes across like a sweet sour citrus kind of combo which starts in the aroma as like a bag of sweets but then as you inhale deeply you start to get the citrus notes like creeping in it's a real pleasure to to smell this one so really really nice smell guys ten out of ten in terms of the smell I've smelt a fair bit of Skittles this is some of the nicest smelling skills that I've tried I could literally just stand like this for an hour just smelling this and just enjoying the sensation wowza one hour later excellent excellent expression of the skills of Roma in this grow we're gonna break this up and just see what smells are released inside here we go Oh exactly the same but with a wolf that comes from pungency that wasn't as available before so you're still getting the sweet you're still getting a mixture of those fruity flavors it's got an American smell like a Cali inspired sort of smell to it but it's very kind of natural and pungent that kind of skunk enos just coming through right at the end as you do a deep inhalation let's move on to the taste section of the review I've got my bong here we're gonna smoke some bombs of the skittles and see how it treats us I should also get a vaporizer we rounding up some of this skills to enjoy I have been smoking this really a while so I've tried it in every consumption method I really like it through the bong I really like it in a joint as well it's a nice smoking to join the skills this section of the video is all about that flavor if you are joining me for this one get yourselves ready get those joints rolled bongs really de briques heated up we're about to smoke and vape some of the skills cannabis strain but my vaporizers are heating up so that is going to give us a brilliant idea of that vaping flavor in the meantime let's smoke our bowl of the skills and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] I was so smooth and light I didn't even do the ball [Music] Wow what did come through was that it was flavor and actually I reckon it is down to the method of growing that organic no-till method of growing delivers such a nice smooth smoke and a strong flavor profile and this is one of the nicest sort of no-till grows that I think I've tried to they really enjoyed that flavor no need to cough no sort of acridity by in the chest just tasted them really really nice we're gonna do another one in a minute first of all we're gonna try the mighty vaporizer let's get an idea of how it bakes really skills e on the exhale or still now like the roof of my tongue is getting this skills flavor coming through like super strong super super strong [Music] that is in my top five will vapor straight away straight away Wow again I've got shout out the no-till method of growing Wow's our paint so top marks for flavor as well let's talk about the effects of the skills skittles is an indica dominant strain it's a hybrid obviously you've got a sativa of the grapefruit in there as well but it's listed as an indica dominant strain it doesn't mean it just sits you down and relaxes you straight away now first it brings you up and you get an almost sort of creative Drive something you could literally clean the house with but this doesn't last a long time if you don't catch it and start being active in those first few minutes as you start to experience the higher then the next stage settles in and it will take away that drive because it is a relaxation it's a heaviness it's a suit ly to that afternoon and even in tire smoke and it's something that actually for me is very very strong but also makes you feel a little bit chatty and a little bit sort of lifted as well how am I feeling right now it's time to kick in nice and fast I mean the vapors got a really high absorption rate clocks in between 15 and 23 percent THC there's not as strong of those super strong ones but I said it isn't everything sometimes it's the mixture the cannabinoids the terpenoids the flavonoids everything feels really really strong despite it sitting around the sort of 20 ish percent mark and yeah on the indica side but feel nice in the mind as where you know is that the hybrids do they combine the good effects on both ends of the spectrum I can feel the waves kicking in I've only had one bong and a vape of it and it is in odd I can feel a lot of tightness in my like around my eyes I kind of like headband but more around my eyes let's sum things up today I've been enjoying the skills cannabis Train organic no-till big up road run up we're about to smoke another bong of it right here on a channel join me for this one and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] taste me it really comes fruit and I'm really late the flavor of that appearance-wise it looks nice maybe didn't bring out the Purple's because the stable temperature is a nice looking bit flower smell wise fantastic 10 out of 10 it's a really really nice smell it's like sweet notes there's like sour notes you know it's really complex flavor-wise the smell carries right through into the flavor vaping it is absolutely fantastic smoking it tastes great as well when it's a really smooth smoking experience I put a lot of that down to how well this particular batch has been grown and effects wise it's a lovely heavy stone for that afternoon even in time something that I will be enjoying when I'm sitting down playing video games or watching something on Netflix for example and yeah I'll write it very

probably been waiting for another one but patience is good you know the doctor has a lot of patience anyway doctors been traveling so I apologize for uh you know not putting up enough strain reviews and you know satisfying your need to find some good weed I'll just use my special getting half hours one more time anyway today we're lighting up the purple alien OG this [ __ ] is supposedly on some other planetary ship somewhere out in the universe somebody went and grew some [ __ ] and it's called purple alien og heavy indica body hi cush aroma and the flavor you know it's very reminiscent of some some OG but it's mixed with something and it gives it a slightly different flavor you know not necessarily sweeter and not any less just sort of sort of right in the middle it's very neutral you know like Switzerland there's something [Music] anyway um it's got big crystals on the buds very fat huge [ __ ] very sticky on the break up you'll need a grinder or some scissors and [ __ ] you don't want to be breaking it up what you think is you know I'm saying but you know you will have green tips if you do break it up with your fingers it's all good anyway uh the THC levels on 23% reminds me of some Bubba you know what I mean but you know that's just awful smell and looking at the bag you know I'm gonna light this [ __ ] up and tell you how I really feel and you know you can get your feelings hurt or not who knows there's no demons in this building not in the smoke here but I'll tell you what this is a good smoke right here it's not quite like five thumbs but definitely a four thumbs stretch right here forgive them for this purple alien og it's got a nice little expansion got a nice little you know sweet flavor to it you know what more can you ask for I mean you know hey we've smoked many 5s here you know rarely do we smoke threes and fours but this is a good floor right here it didn't quite reach the five range but I think maybe because the cross you know I don't know sometimes the cross gives it a different flavor maybe too much of one plant not enough of the other you know who the [ __ ] knows it's all science [Music] anyway like I said this is for thumbs up right here for please thumbs with the doctor as you can see I'm in a better boat because we're the better wearing a new building so we'll be cranking out some more strain reviews we urge you to leave comments subscribe to the channel we also urge you to go [ __ ] yourself [Music]", "6EoL-4IQE3Q": "This is the High Density Espalier Gardener And I am going to be showing you An update on my little Mini-Vineyard The last time I had shown this little area That I put together I had 10 different kinds of Grape vines Now I have 14 And on the last video I didn't say what the dimensions were On this one I would like for you to see How much I have planted in a small area I say High Density because I am putting a lot of different plants In a very small area And that will be true for all Of the videos that I post Here at the end... By the way Its important to note that The Grapes come out at different times So that you don't have All of the Grapes all at once You have actually a nice long Season of Grapes If you get a good mix Here on the end I have a Perlette And the dimensions are From this post To this post From the top all the way across It is about 10 feet And from here, this post, All the way to the end Is about 20 feet I am going to be planting 3 more Grapes That I have on the end And they are potted still At that point The total area will be 10 by maybe 25 or 26 feet I have the Perlette here I have a Cabernet And by the way Of the 14 I have a really nice mix Of table Grapes and wine Grapes And since I have no plans of making wine We are going to have just a lot of table grapes Some seedless and some with seeds Here I have what is called A Blueberry Grape It has very strong hints of Blueberry in it Its actually a patented vine And very hard to find But soooooo worth it They are delicious Grapes Next I have a Merlot And by the way All of these are Trained in the Cordon style Meaning that For example Just like I showed you With some of the other videos That I have The vine grows up And then directly across And that is considered The Cordon style Of Espalier And Cordon style of Grape vine training And all of them As you can see all the way across All of them are trained in that same style What I am doing though I am doing a slight modification In that I am doing from the base I am doing one row of Cordon Then I am training it To have a second row of Cordon as well And then for example I have nothing going this way yet But this one once it starts to grow out nice I will let it come up here And then I will start to train it Along this wire Ok so next to the Merlot I have a Black Monukka And the Black Monukka is A purplish Grape delicious delicious Grape Everything that I ended up getting I am really happy with Cause they are very very sweet Very nice Grapes Here I have a Zinfandel And then I have a Summer Muscat And then a Red Flame Seedless And this one... There are several that still are not Throwing out little buds but For example on this one They are already starting to come out This one is a Himrod And by the way Many of these Grape vines I found at Lowes or Home Depot They are like $25 a piece And for the amount of money That I have spent on these I have already made my money back With the Grapes that I have picked This is a Thompson's Seedless here And this is a Venus Seedless And the ones that I still have to plant Are a... I have a Concord Grape This one is.. Oh that one... This one I am really looking forward To seeing how it gives off Grapes We haven't gotten Grapes From these little ones yet But this is called a Midgley's Purple And once they really get going The bunches are like 12 to 18 inches long They are super big And then this one is an Autumn Royal And what I am trying to do Is these little buds coming out I am going to let them grow up I will choose the strongest Like I did with this one here And then I will let that one grow up high And I will do with that What I did with these For example here From the very bottom I started training out the branches but Once they start to grow up Then you take and put it up To a certain point like that Then you start to train it Then you can let the next stage Grow up and then when they start to come out Then you start to train from there as well Ok one thing that's really important I had a little bit of trouble The first year Because I was under the impression That you had to leave a lot of the leaves But as it turns out when you are doing High Density planting Especially for Grapes You HAVE to trim out A lot of the greenery Otherwise you start to get Problems with white downy mold And rust spots Its just not nice You can combat those With different things like Neem oil and copper sprays That they have at Home Depot Or Lowes but The best thing to do is just To prevent the problems From coming up So what I am doing now is I let the vines grow out Like this I let them grow Up to a certain point And then I take a look To see which ones have Grapes And which ones don't The ones that have Grapes I leave those And the ones that don't I trim them off Because the point is You have to let the air flow You have to have a good amount Of sunlight and if there is too much Overhang or if there are too many Vines with the leaves on them and no Grapes Then it starts to block off the sun And then you have problems And its.. the Grapes are too Delicious and too nice To let something like that happen So all of that stuff gets trimmed away And I will post an updated video To show you again Once the greenery is out And they start to grow out Grapes So you can see what I mean Why I keep them actually rather thinned", "ZlyM6wXLdIA": "hey guys how you doing welcome to Dan's Buddha bodega today we're gonna be going over a cool shatter from pts the strain on it is champion city chocolate and then I am going to tell you how you can win a free rig just like this one so if you stay to the end I will let you know how to win that so what do you say we just get right into it [Music] alright folks first thing on the docket today is this shatter by pts now the strain on it is champion city chocolate it's a cool hybrid even though I mean it's technically a hybrid but it is very heavy on the indica side so might as well just call it an indica it's parentage is true G and Ja glittering I like that anyway - really good strains by themselves now I've had the flower version of champion city chocolate and you know what it is almost cheesy like it's very strange to explain it's like cinnamon sugar you know that they put on cinnamon toast crunch on top of a slice of American cheese and then washed it down with a milkshake made of mulch so it was interesting to say the least [Music] so I was wondering how is that gonna transfer over into the shatter so what do you say we just cut the BS and take a day [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right well we've give it a little bit of time to take effect and you know what it's not bad I don't know if I'd say that it's like really good but you know fir first chatter it is decent it is very effective and you know relax relaxing you know relaxation if you're medicating to you know fight anxiety or just you know available [ __ ] this is a perfect strength for you personally I was a little upset just because when I had the flower version you know it was had this weird greasy kind of pungent taste to it and and it didn't transfer into the shatter like I was hoping but you know what booty cool it still was very effective at treating headache and my head my headaches and yeah so altogether you know what it's not a bad product all

quinn cassidy [Music] i got this deal of groupon of getting my legs waxed both legs so there was this option where you could choose one leg for 20 or two legs for 40 or something like that i'm like okay i'm gonna choose two legs but it was cheap so i'm like okay i think the original price was maybe 100 or 85 i'm not sure what it was but i'm gonna put everything down below because i never like ordered anything from groupon so i'm really curious how this is gonna play out if they're gonna treat me different because i got a deal from groupon or something so i'm going to take you guys with me see how it goes hopefully she lets me film if she doesn't i'm so sorry but um i'm super excited so let's go so i just got out of the train i'm walking there now i'm so nervous because i don't like brooklyn and i'm like afraid to get robbed last time i went to brooklyn this cop just like swerved and stopped me because because they thought i was a prostitute but this was like years ago but still that's not cute i know it's so loud i'm so sorry but bear with me it's like a lot of people i mean the area don't look too bad but i'm still kind of nervous like six minutes away okay i think it's very actually very nice here you see that bothy it's pretty i hope i don't look bad because it's like so much sun and i'm not i hate sun but let's see what happens i'm super excited but i never had wax done before so i'm like a little bit nervous so guys i think i'm approaching the place yep i am i think this is it right here [Music] blossom browse she let me record myself so that's good it's my first time and now she put this heat thing on and it's like super hot oh that should hurt that burned i think i just saw jesus pick them into my brows i think i need them done so so okay guys so i just got out you know what's so crazy something that i noticed you know how in groupons they tell you like all like things are cheaper and stuff like that i noticed when like after she was done with everything i went on the of the treatments and all the stuff that she does come to find out it was the same price like it was 40 i'm going to um insert that here like a little clip i had to record it because i could have sworn that one leg was 20 and then both legs was 41 or something like that and pretty much she like that wasn't really like a coupon groupon you know what i mean like i noticed that she charged me the same price and usually my groupon is supposed to be cheaper and plus also on groupon um you know how when it says the original price which will which would be like 80 or something and then they'll put a lower price for like 40 or 35 that's how it was but when you go into the place it was the same price so i just thought that was crazy i should have got it for like 20 dollars guys i'm pretty much i'm here waiting it's so [ __ ] red itching like crazy like my skin is super sensitive so right now if i show you guys how my skin looks i'm going to show you right now you can see like these little dots already look at oh my goodness i look like i have the chicken pop look at them oh my goodness and they might stay like that for like a few days or something because i'm super sensitive okay guys i'm back home now my legs are not looking like i have chicken pox no more i think they're much better they're smooth they feel amazing to be honest um i love the result and everything however i still feel a little bit of prickle like like like some pricks a little bit for my hairs in the middle of my um leg um it's not super like noticeable like it's not noticeable at all but you can feel a little bit but it's not too too too bad but um i might go back to her i'm not sure i just wish that she didn't lie on her on the groupon thing about the prices and stuff like that how it was eighty dollars but but um she's charging 40 like i feel like that was like so fake because the the freaking sign says 40 dollars for full leg waxing so but other than that i like the result and stay tuned for more content and thank you guys so much for watching", "BiaH2mz9Ivk": "what's going on guys it's Tim Walker thank you for joining me today we have an interesting episode of our normal stream reviews I had to pick this weed up off of my alternate link this time which basically means that I was gonna get lower grade weed but for a bit better price what I ended up picking up was supposedly the great bait but I refuse to call this the great bait strategy because what I got was not impressive and this strain review is going to tell you exactly why [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so when you first look at this week it has a pretty nice bag appeal I mean to look at it through the bag the nugs are pretty hard like nice solid solid plant and it looks pretty crystal II from the outside but once you open up the bag you really start to get a [ __ ] like a really heavy plant II smell smells a lot like chlorophyll which is as we all know from watching the Magic School Bus the plant uses the chlorophyll in the leaves to process light and physically achieve photosynthesis so when that's still left in the bud that points to a few things that might have went wrong one of which being that it was either not dried properly or more than likely not cured properly so as I said once you start to look a little bit closer at this weed you start to notice a few things that that aren't quite on point and it pretty much starts right at the initial finger to bud touch the nubs feel almost moist and not in a good way they feel kind of they have like a wet feel I've had this bag of weed for about a week now so since I've had it I've been keeping it in this jar here trying to cure it up and get some of the smells to come out and get it to dry up a little bit more because I was really worried about the mole coming up so when you do break out the nugs the biggest nug right in the center you do get a little bit of a terpene kind of smell of like almost like a lemony kind of smell but the problem is that it's almost completely overpowered by the chlorophyll pure plant II smell that that it just doesn't smell good at all so I was like kind of hay or grass in a bag now another big problem with not carrying the weed properly means that the moisture is still stuck in the middle of the stems that run through the nubs so without releasing that you're gonna get a lot of that horrible smell which is the main issue with that but you can also see the the stems are supposed to pop when you go to break them and you can see that these ones they don't pop so much as sort of splinter and peel apart and that further proves to me that this weed was not cured properly so the other big take it on the [ __ ] list for this weed right when i got it i was combing through the bag of nerves and i found one that had been light burnt so it had like a crispy brown leaf on it still the nug on top actually had like a little bit of a black mark like it was actually burnt with fire but if you ever see that it sort of looks like another that's been lightly baked you'll definitely be able to tell right away and don't smoke that nut because it's pretty much just plant material there's very little THC on that anyways I guess we can get the smoke in CinemaScope we're just gonna throw a little bit of weed here we do the bomb here and get to talking about what it tastes like and we're smoking it I can tell you right now it's not great but I really want you guys to learn the difference between not just good and great weed but between bad and good weed so as I mentioned in my last straight review the name of the weed is important and especially in this case even though it's called the Grape Ape and it has very few traits of any of the Grape Ape that I have seen the fact that it's named Grape Ape and it has this list of things that's wrong with it pretty much guarantees you that it is great big or but the person who drew it really didn't give two shits about how it came no they're just kind of pushing it out the door as quick as possible they probably didn't cure it for the recommended four weeks just like two weeks or something right normally you're supposed to bring it down to bring the relative humidity inside the cure jar down to sixty percent then further bring it down just fifty percent it's likely they didn't do that to just push it up the door for sale that's really where you can tell the difference between say quadruple and triple A's and you know even lower grains of Bud which I would really give this [ __ ] a b-grade it's still decent I guess but really barely worth revealing anyways packed up a little ball get here we'll get this thing fired up and talk about that [Music] that was clearly a pretty big hit and it's not that I'm not feeling anything off of it it's just at the highest very weak compared to what I'm used to I hit that size would have put me back on my ass and I would have had to start off on a new take so it's not that you can't get high off of this weed it's that it really does take a lot more to achieve a real moderate effect especially compared to actual Grape Ape or or something like the mint dollar number one or something like that where it's a real strong strain and and the effect of it is very pronounced this is very all across the board sort of level high if you were to break one of the nubs open you almost get like a lemon tinged smell but it's very very faint so like I was saying the Grape Ape is supposed to be very fruity and this is very not for me it tastes very plant e and it makes your mouth taste horrible you'll notice that my bong is not exactly the cleanest right now but does make a big difference when you're smoking this week compared to something that you're looking for the seedy mango tastes or anything like that anybody's huge ball yet number two I guess [Music] yeah it's pretty hard again I don't think it was flush very well even when I scorched the [ __ ] out of it the ash is like a dark kind of color and it looks really crispy yeah not a great batch of the gray bait but like I always say that doesn't mean you shouldn't try out the great bait in fact if you have tried the great babe I would love for you guys to comment below let me know what you guys think of it and whether or not you agree with me that this is probably not anywhere near to great bait when you look at this weed under a magnifying glass you would expect to see a lot of amber crystals but what you end up seeing is actually just a lot of clear freckled heads which means they didn't even wait for the trichomes to develop into the milky stage which is when you should start considering when you're gonna [ __ ] harvest them they right as soon as it was a week's ban cut down the plants so they are clearly in a rush with this weed and they lose points because of that so I'm gonna give this weed like five out of ten because it is half decent I've smoked much worse weed over the years and the price was right it's not like I had to pay up the ass for it but it does have a lot of traits that I am skeptical of in weed when I grab it as I mentioned the mold being an issue and the weed is practically still wet but that's the score it's getting five out of ten anyways guys thanks for stopping by and learning about what you don't want in your read as well as what you do want in your weed I believe in pot education and responsible consumption so make sure that if you guys are smoking you smoking safely don't forget to Like comment share subscribe send it to a friend eat your vegetables all that good [ __ ] and I guess I'll talk to you guys later smoking up inhale exhale [Applause] [Music]", "wrYjBzwjgWY": "seedless grapes are now on sale at thai thai only

so [Music] do welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing some corova extracts so corofa has um unrivaled they say which i can actually agree with unrivaled is their little tagline and they have a reputation they have a reputation for sure um particularly in california i think they just moved operations up to oregon um i haven't seen kerogen stuff around here very for very long at all but um in california they have quite the reputation primarily for their edibles that's actually their website just corroborateedibles.com even though they make more than edibles but they're known for doing 1 000 milligram edibles and i've heard someone say two thousand milligram edibles as well don't know if that's true but either way that's crazy um i would love that because i really like edibles but all the edibles here are 50 milligrams that's maximum so i it's just too little for me so i end up having to just eat raw oil or capsule it or something and that's never fun or it's not nearly as fun as eating a brownie or a cookie so these people can make some seriously good edibles um we'll see if they make some good extracts i saw some of their pre-packed flour and i've seen pictures of the same stuff from california it looks great and um a lot of the strains that i saw on the flower they have the exact strains in this x-factor i'm thinking that it's cured resin um i gave you a close-up of all of it and it looks great it smells great it's really exciting and i managed to get this for super super cheap it's i want to say rec price is normally like 18 to 20 bucks but i might just combine a couple sales which usually don't let you do but i don't think i was supposed to be able to or whatever but i managed to get it for 11 67 a gram each so it's like 45 46 something like that 46 bucks or something like that for all four grams um yeah it says 1667 here right um regular so that comes out to 20 rec so that's my um talking on corolla really interesting brand i'm glad they moved up here excited to try it out which they have edibles up here as well but just not the same because they make 50 milligram edibles up here to comply with our laws and now that california has um dose limits i think corova has also had to drop their doses in california as well so that's kind of a bummer anywho um i wanted to start i'm going to try and do two in these in this video because i got four strains here that would be too long of the video um i want to do two one that i know and then one that i want to try wedding cake is one that i know this is a very classic you'll see that i have a couple wedding cake videos on my channel already and i've tried it a couple times even before i started making videos really great um middle i call it a middle of the ground string because it has a lot of just basic terpenes but it exemplifies them very well let's see if this seems to be a good take of um what am i trying to say a good example of wedding cake here we go okay so yeah that smells just like i remember that's very like cardio filling i want to say cardiophiline dominant just from the smell but i don't quite remember it might be miracin but it really does just have a good combo of those two i think limiting as well it's a really good combo of all three of those and they don't nothing stands out too much it's just a very good mixture of these let's see taste wise the extract itself looks nice handles nice this one comes in i didn't even read the cannabinoids but i showed them to you um so you should if you want you can go to the beginning of the video and pause and check out how much txt and cbd each have but i'm pretty sure this one has i want to say like 71 i can see right here actually 71 point 13 um 13 and there's little tags on the side but i tore most of them off because you need to just open them and i i don't know how much cbd it was but none of them have too much cbd there's nothing see me like no cbd heavy streams it's got i think two percent it says oh yeah it tastes just like it smells a bit stronger oh i burned my nose with it don't exhale dabs out your nose that tastes so good though holy crap all right i'm just going for taste so i'll call it quits there's excuse me that's my first dab for the day and so that effect is also very good man it's not lacking an effect or anything that was just like my preliminary let's see if they're getting their strains right and whatnot and it seems like they're probably just um extracting this it looks like it says on here um letterman ltr mn or something like that which is a company out here they're probably having letterman extracts their the flour that they also prepack or something like that but i mean it looks the flour looked really good and this is definitely tasty and the effect is very good so all right so let's try out a stream that i haven't tried let's see if we can get some interesting flavors in here there's mango rose and golden pineapple that are speaking to me mango rose being big bud crossed with white widow golden pineapple being golden goat with pineapple kush so i'm going to go with one of those i'm going to look into both them real quick while i cut the camera and clean this and i'll come back with one that sounds like it'll taste interesting but that one was a very very good example of wedding cake that's how it should taste so they're doing everything right that's the first thing i'll say and that's great all right let's move on all right um so i've actually done this twice now two other times and something's happened two times in a row so both of the times after i've already heated up the dab so i'm taking both dabs because i'm not going to waste it some good ass concentrate and then i got distracted and did my laundry and i i don't know i'm just hoping it works this time and my video doesn't get screwed up cause i'm violently high okay all right so um i chose mango rose couldn't find much about this strain and um the other one uh well to be fair i guess this is citrus so i was going to say the other one is like mostly like i said here seeing cardio filling but also has some limonene in it and that's kind of what gives it some of that tang so i didn't want to go for something that's probably just going to be heavy and lemony and this one also will just mix it up so i've tasted it a couple times now but i'll try and pretend this is my first time um so it works from mango rose as well pineapple the pineapple strain was very similar in consistency to wedding cake um and this one is much more saucy so i figure that's uh that gives you or gives me as well an idea of what both types of consistent both ranges of the consistency are oh man yeah so this one really is so good it's very interesting when i got this originally um i got one of each strain to be fair so i wasn't really picking and choosing but mango rose i assumed it was like mango and rose and wine that's i'm pretty sure that's what rose is but that really really does just smell like um like lemony rose it smells a lot like sticking your nose in a rose so um that's very interesting let's i don't know what terpenes are involved in that but it smells very good very fresh and clean as well all right so i'm going to stick you know no i'm going bigger going home doing a normal size dab again let's be gone but yeah so well i already showed you a close up this is a lot more saucy like just nice like it reminds me of applesauce it's like that perfect consistency where the other one was a little more like um i don't know what you you kind of saw it i guess uh a little more chunky but um it's still solid so yeah i'm not sure what it's what i would call the other um consistency so let's see let's get some notes on the taste here this is truly one of the better concentrates i've had in a while so it amazes me how cheap i've gotten it and to be fair i've been buying a lot of budget concentrates so it's a low bar to break but it definitely broke the bar oh yeah right right off the bat getting citrus notes that's really good that's like um what is that i mean that's like straight um lemonade and pining which is a very interesting combo man that's good though that that smell and taste is actually really nostalgic back to just like christmas it's like faintly piney so you definitely get like that pine tree smell but um man that lemon and i feel like there's something else that's maybe terpene because it's just so good um i don't know if i'd quite say yeah i guess i could see some mango but it's closer to some type of citrus mixed with pine and that's like that might be one of my favorite strains which i've never heard of this string and i swear this is one they made themselves a big bud crossed with white widow making mango rose oh yeah lemonade and piney that is a great combo i suggest you all look for that i'm very excited to see what i have in store and the other two strains i haven't tried then because that one's really really good and the other one i knew what to expect because i'm familiar with that and they pulled it off well so corova well done i see why your reputation is high or highly regarded or whatever however you should word that um it will stay the same here i imagine um in oregon so thanks for bringing the business here um to everybody who watched it i recommend you try it out for sure um edibles or extracts or flour really it all looked pretty good and i've only tried the extracts but i'm assuming it was made from their flour so that says something about their flour so to everyone viewing thanks for watching like and subscribe stay tuned for more videos and keep talking have a great day", "bHx8rk85d8g": "[Music] do any talking right

a brazilian yeah girlies you know what i mean you've always been curious or maybe you've been there done that and you just want to hear about other girls the story so i'm here to talk about it all right first things first my mother freaking hot girls if you saw my tech talks i had a lot of questions about my pearl necklace i was wearing a different one but my mom got me that and she has no clue where she got me that i've had that for years but i found another great company that's super affordable because i've been on the lookout for you babies and this is one by planet jewels it is so cute it has a little angel charm on it and it's a nice little pro bun super affordable i will link their instagram and all that information below so my hot girls can be looking cute and bald on a budget first thing you should know that when you get a wax is your girl does not care about your kuchi uchi okay or your underwear or whatever styles going on and she knows it's a mess that's why you've come to her that's her job or his job so don't be too stressed about like having to take off your underwear the first time so you walk into the room and she's just like all right like i'll give you a couple moments and i'll be back in a minute just bring clothing in that corner so you simply just you know get kind of bare you slip off the pantyline so you take off your panties take off your pants you put them on the table and then you just like pop up on this little table that they usually have maybe there's like aromatherapy music playing maybe you'll see like some nice like diffuser i don't know i don't know what place you go to many of them are different they have their own like calming styles or if you're at like a more like chain like european wax center it's a little more like just boring plain room but you know still great you get up and you're just like laying there and she walks in you're like hi like you now there are two types of waxes there's soft wax and hard wax now soft wax is typically used on the face it's a lot gentler but it's also not as good for getting out like super stubborn tough hairs down there ladies and that is why usually hard wax is used for the coochie gobbler area so that is a more tough wax it's really good at pulling out those deep hairs but it's a little bit more painful not painful but just a little tougher on your skin now here's the thing though i have had one lady who used soft wax and it was absolutely amazing i am so sad she was at this location when i lived in san jose going to college and then she moved up to oakland which was a bit farther i think it was like two hours or something and i was couldn't go but me and my roommate both went to her her skill was absolutely amazing woman was just like a mother had her son or whatever used to work out benefit in san francisco back in the day but then she's just working in like other town but she was absolutely amazing the soft wax no pain she was so great so quick the trick is is if it's a good lady she won't even like have you thinking about it like she would quickly just lay it on oh yeah would you put it ripped your heart out but then you didn't even feel it it was so soft and gentle and then the next secret is a good waxer so these are things to look out for is after they rip it off put pressure when you are in a lot of pain for some reason that pressure like stops you feeling like all that pain and hurt and like oh so she would quickly rip it off oh yeah would you ever dinner pretty squish that real quicky and you didn't feel it so those are some things to look out for when you want to find a good waxer how many years of experience does she have i know this seems like uh not a big deal honestly though it is this lady that i've been to the dolph soft wax which is a very difficult wax to work with on the coochie area she had been doing it for i think like 35 years absolutely amazing great at it quick smooth easy go and been there done that nothing she's going to see that's going to surprise her amazing and then she left so then i had to experiment and find new women well i found another lady and she was younger and she'd only been doing it for a year um i didn't think that was gonna be a problem i was still new you know i was like still trying to find the right waxer so i gave gave her a chance and um biggest forget i'm not even to say where it was who it was honestly i don't even remember her name because it was really bad i tried to burn it out of my memory i went to the new lady she only had like one year of experience and she used soft and hard wax and i was like okay that's good she uses both and she's like yeah like you're blonde i'm gonna use a soft wax and i was like okay like let's use a soft wax it's gonna be gentler less pain and i just had the lady right before that the older experienced lady who had used soft wax for years and killed it at the time though i didn't realize how difficult soft wax was to use down there i go in there and i'm like heck gosh like your blonde blonde hair is to be you know softer down there easier to work with and i'm like cool cool she puts on me you know she's like okay you haven't you know had something done in a while i was like yep i know i know and she's like all right we're gonna go for a little trimming trim first so she gets on her little scissors snap yeah we're to the wise ladies you want to make sure it's long but not too long if it's i think like so i'm gonna show you real good so this right here is about an inch from this little line to here so you want to make sure it's not this long like if your hair is long that's pretty long but make sure it's about in the middle right there i'd say that's a good length to work with anything past that is going to be difficult because if it's too long like it's going to yank it's not going to go well but if it's too short then like the wax can't pick it up so you need that good in between anyways i had not gone in a while she had to give it a little trimming trim so already we're off to a little bit of a tricky start because i just i think i was like i was like kind of like in the middle i was like i don't know if it's like enough to work with once again i was still getting new to waxing so i wasn't sure like what the proper hair length was so you kind of want that middle ground not too much of a bush you know give a little pre-work before as well and a little tip is to another little tip beforehand it's also to exfoliate exfoliation on that little you know top shield area before it's gonna help you so much when it comes to the actual day of getting the wax it just prepares your skin gets rid of dead skin makes it a lot easier when that new wax comes on to rip it so prep the hair and prep it with exfoliation anyways she trims it and she's like all right go down smooth back smoothly waxing am i cool cool with chit chat and i'm trying to keep the conversation going you know because the more they the less talking they do the more distracted you get and the more you're like thinking about what's going on down there she was doing like decent talking but every time she had to like rip or actually do it she had to pause which is a problem because when they're mid-rip and then every time once you realize that every time she rips she pauses then you just expect it like you know now what to expect which a good wax lady doesn't pause she just whoop what'd you say baby girl like oh yeah i know you know she keeps it going she was not keeping it going she was pausing giving me time to think and that wasn't even the big problem the big problem is that when she went to pull that soft wax my love oh well let's just say sometimes when you pull back it's nice and clean one big whip this one broke so they like ripped like to the middle and then she had to like rip it again and then it still wasn't all the way off so she had to rip it again and at this point my coochie is on fire that hurt okay we're breathing we breathing oh in and out in and out because if you don't breathe actually your hair follicles tighten who would a freaking thought the more tense you are the more tight your follicles get so i try to make sure my little follicles are nice and open but they weren't opening they were very tight at this point no matter how much breathing i was doing was like oh like your hair is like a little bit um thicker than i expected a little stronger root and i was like okay yeah and she was like i actually you know what it's okay it's probably just this dense spot you know that top little triangle so she's like let's try it again let's try it again i'm like okay yes yes i'm insane but yes so she goes again soft wax once again another freaking miss rip it did not come all the way off she had to triple rip that shiz and then she had to put on another soft wax because we still weren't gonna give up on the soft wax yet and rip it again so that was like three rips on one part which is very painful and usually not a normal thing to do so i wasn't very much pain she's like you know what let's just do the hard wax and i was like yes good idea i don't know why it took us like three attempts to figure that one out but we're gonna go with it so then she starts with the hard rocks and once again i'm like okay it's hard wax it's better we're good to go no no it wasn't better because she just wasn't that experienced she went back with the hard wax once again she was ripping i don't even know if it's too slow or she was just like pausing either way she was pausing giving me time to think about it so i was thinking about it so i was getting tense and then she was getting a little tense because like the first you know couple rips we were not off to a good start so that was a little bit difficult and then we got past like that little top triangle tough area and she's like you know what let's go back in with the soft wax why don't we why don't we so we go back in the soft wax now remind you i'm just laying there like oh okay it's fine everything's fine it's a soft box it's a gentler area i think you know you're getting more into that lippy lip area not a big deal so she goes back in with the soft wax the liberty lip area and i'm like all right it's gonna be easy easy breezy beautiful down there no no it wasn't it wasn't it was another three times rips it was another multiple tears it was another painful moment so then we were like all right you know what let's just i was like let me maybe we should stick to the hard wax you know i have thicker hair okay baby we can't be messing with this anymore i'm gonna lose my cookies we switch to the hard wax again so we're going you know it's a couple of difficult tears and then we finally we finally made it to the butt area the butt area is typically the last area and this one this one's a fun one because each wax lady has their own type of flare they like to do on this part and by that i mean position you're gonna be in a little position on the butt area there are multiple ways some people i'll demonstrate they like you to kind of be like the one where you hug your knees you know like this and then it's nice and open and they use that or sometimes they're like all right this post so you're just up there on the table like oh all right i guess i'm here or even i've had one lady who liked me to like like pretty much like make like you know like crisscross applesauce but crisscross applesauce in the air so there are quite a couple of poses they might get you into there or or there's actually really another one too is where you just flip over on your stomach and you're just like planking there like hi so there's multiple forms they might take for you let me remind you to sometimes if they do do the old just flip and lay on your stomach baby they make you spread those cheeky cheeks yeah so you're gonna be like hi great thing about the butt area for some reason it's actually the least painful area at least for myself and from like people i've asked you know why the butt area she's just tougher she's stronger she's a whole nother breed and usually i'm like all right this is the end this is this is where it gets better no no no she tried to soft wax again again i literally thought we talked i thought we were like okay only hard work and she was like you know what soft wax i don't know if it was a mistake i don't know if she just made a command decision right there that wasn't involved with my thinking but we did it again we went back for the soft wax on my butt area and when i tell you my butt wet because i was painful it was painful she finally ripped off again multiple rips the soft wax and was like oh that's not really working let's do the hard work so then she puts hard wax where she just put wax so that was that moment right the butt was very painful which is usually a happy moment for me it's usually not that painful it's usually you don't even really feel it and it means it's the end of it but no no it wasn't the end because when i you know did a little a look-see look-see at what was going on i was like there was a bunch of like hairs like not like a bush but there was like like a little salt and pepper of hair still and i was like usually when i walk out when i look down it's usually like you know nice and smooth baby maybe there's like one two stray hairs that got a little tough but not that much of a little salt and pepper everywhere and i was like what what so she's like oh don't worry sweetie like we're just gonna go in and we're just gonna get those tweezers and i was like hold on i have had the tweezers so sometimes ladies when you get a normal wax there's maybe like one two hairs maybe around the areas you know they look around that just you know the wax can get up and you don't want to go with another wax because that's painful typically laying more than three waxing on one spot is painful and not usually done but i already done that multiple times with this lady and we were still gonna go in with a little tweezer action so she whips out those little tweezers good lord when i tell you my skin was mad mad not happy it was not happy at that point so when she pulled out the tweezers and individually plucked all those little babies up i was literally on the point of like it's okay i can kind of cancel it'll be like cool i've never been on the bridge of like almost tears while waxing usually it's not that bad if you have a good experienced waxer it's a little tight you know you jump like noises while she rips certain parts but it's not that bad well finally she is done and we we closed the appointment i tipped her ten dollars um i i tried i was you know i'm never not gonna tip somebody even though it wasn't the best experience there are some key things i learned first of all check the experience second of all check what type of wax they use third of all always take advil or something else to help you relax and the pain even if it's just a regular wax equipment try to do something like that even if it's an experienced lady it will help you tremendously and if she does use a soft wax on you and it doesn't work out the first time don't try the second third fourth fifth sixth time give up on it just use the hard wax okay and another thing if you're blonde it doesn't always mean your hair is like you know nice and light down there it might mean you just have deep roots baby apparently i was a good little shocker there so watch out my blondes they're like oh you're blonde yeah soft wax no baby be careful there be careful there as well when i walked out of that appointment ladies and i did a little quick checky check on my situation because i said i had to go pee real quick guys i have never had this happen ever in my experience of getting a wax but when i look down there she i mean she's always usually a little red you know afterwards as it is but she was red and there was blood droplets like i mean and there was bumps you know like when you get razor burn i had bumps now when you get a wax you usually don't get razor burn like those type of bumps and i had little blood dots and i was like oh i literally walked out there like there was like a stick up my booty because i was like oh my gosh this hurts like wobbling out there i did not take any advil i forgot and then my stupidness i broke a golden rule of waxing which is after you get a wax you're not supposed to do something that do some thing i didn't because my boyfriend was in town he was waiting in the car for me because we went to separate colleges meaning that we only had three days that together that weekend so obviously i wasn't gonna waste an opportunity but the issue was i couldn't book it any other day that was the only day i could book it was that friday that the availability that i had and that she had come back into my car where he is waiting for me i am like holy shiz that was the worst wax of my life and i still decide to break the golden rule of nothing nothing of what you're supposed to do after a wax you're not supposed to do that thing and i did it i thought we'd be gentle i thought you know what it's not that big of a deal it's not gonna hurt that much no no well let me tell you this it didn't hurt during no there was no pain during but afterwards afterwards it was like a fire kind of irritation the amount of redness that was already there just after the wax and then the amount of irritation after i decided to break the golden rule of waxing that you're not supposed to do after a wax until 24 hours but i learned a lot of things there i learned a lot of things there please please look up the girl look up the reviews think about your hair type make sure the type of wax they're using is appropriate make sure you take your advil make sure to not break the golden rule of not doing something after your appointment for another 24 hours okay let's just do it but let me tell you something when you do get a nice good wax it is not that painful it's not that horrific it is very normal it is very easy and once you are finished with your wax and you want to make sure you don't get any ingrown hairs or any like irritation or scratchiness i have a good product that i use this is the smooth me ingrown hair serum by european wax center so this is the baby i use this it helps so much it is like pretty much a moisturizer and i'm sorry i was just looking at how much this is like a moisturizer before your couchier yet so afterwards this definitely helps it prevents that scratchy scratch i definitely recommend you put it on after your wax and then maybe a couple of days continuously post wax all right guys that is the video i hope you guys learned some things and not the hard way like i did about waxing and especially that brazilian wax go follow all my socials down below i got my instagram me thick talking and also if you want a little sneak peeks or some of these youtube videos i'm making check out my tik tok a lot of a new thing i'm going to be doing is making a little quick short

hey hey hey you ever had your taste buds go crazy like that mine just did let's get one more flavor on this one more flavor one more taste that is definitely a nice taste okay we're back okay on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best of the flavor critique of this sunday driver aka sunday driver we would give this wow i have to get this one eight this is a really nice flavor and this isn't even dispensary gray look at the bag it came it's not even dispensary grade it's just a regular everyday bag just something dude put it in but he had it in a in a big pound baggie that said sunday drive across that bench but uh it doesn't taste like um dispensary grade i've told you guys this a million times dispensary grade for me really pops pops i haven't been to a dispensary yet in the united states that was worse than this street street grade now sometimes you run across street great as just as good as dispensary grade sometimes better you might have a homeboy on the cuts that grow the best [ __ ] i'm not saying that you don't but for me every time i go to the dispensary every dispenser i've been to colorado uh california uh dc uh there's a couple more all the ones that i've been to the dispensary grade has always well in florida the spencer grade has always been better except for one place i forgot [ __ ] in florida florida is you know what florida makes me think that the government is making this dirt weed because it's kind of like how do you make a weed that doesn't have a flavor or smell i i it baffles me but i've never ever until i got to florida smelt a weed that had no smell or tasted a weed that had zero taste no taste i mean you can't even taste the smoke [ __ ] i mean nothing nothing what kind of [ __ ] is that if i got here with that [ __ ] so i'll give this a 8 for flavor y'all let's get back in here real quick i'll tell you one thing though i'm starting to feel real pretty i think i'm feeling pretty i'm feeling quite sexy indeed one of them warnings y'all this butt is nice y'all remember that um have baked this weed is fantastic [ __ ] lord of mercy okay i'm here to see samson anyway y'all who y'all can tell i'm hot i am hot speak i'm high y'all this is a really good island it's a really good odd it's kind of one of those this is like being in a taking off in a lambo or something you know it's got that some weed just like you know gradually get you up there and [ __ ] this weed was like [ __ ] doing a a burnout in a a spike 1918 spider or some [ __ ] man this was like so i went straight to high do not pass gold [ __ ] but i'm gonna leave my 200 dollars anyway y'all know none about that y'all probably too y'all to know about board games oh my goodness i'm high as gash oh look at my eyes look at my eyes this is a good one well this was a pleasant surprise good morning sunday driving good morning to you all [ __ ] too i hope y'all feeling as well as i am because i feel fan [ __ ] tastic yes i am not disappointed with that flavor critique of eight not at all a strong eighth i could tell this was going to be a good heart by that first hit when i almost passed out when i was [ __ ] like yeah that one i could tell it's gonna be some good stuff this is good this is white air pasty i'm just playing y'all don't they don't get excited karen don't call the police no need to get excited there's a black man over here banging this later against the table get the [ __ ] out of here i'm just playing y'all i'm just playing i just like having a good time i hope you guys are having an awesome morning thus far or i hope you've had an awesome day if you catch this video late uh so yesterday i was thinking about buying new glass but as you guys know this [ __ ] is not cheap not cheap not cheap although i got this one at a discounted price because that day it was half off if i remember correctly but was that the last bomb that may have been the last one i anyway one bomb was half off maybe this one may not have been this one you decide i'm just playing y'all let go again oh would i recommend sunday driver to my friends hey y'all if you get a chance to run across some sunday driver grab that [ __ ] roll that [ __ ] and smoke that [ __ ] that [ __ ] is tasty and delicious y'all this is the stuff to make your eye go like that you know when sometimes you get hot your eyes just get low but you get some good weed to go out like this i'm not gonna say anything but you know they go out like this and [ __ ] that's where my eyes are feeling right now i'm feeling quite philosophical i'm feeling scientific indeed [ __ ] out of here wow wow i looked at it like a proud father i caught just caught myself when i looked up at the camera i was like like a proud father like so beautiful this is such a delicious tasty wig oh you gotta [ __ ] out of here okay y'all so uh we'll take one more hit and then we'll give you the hard critique perhaps would you look at that there's another blood on the table i may have to smoke that too so i'm singing back y'all back in my when i used to do drugs day y'all know we ain't drugs back in the day like it was a long time ago like 30 years ago or some [ __ ] man when i used to sniff cocaine so me and my boy went to this cocaine dealer tyrone on the corner wherever the [ __ ] it was we bought a lot of cocaine man we brought probably like a half ounce of cocaine so we're like yeah we pull over real quick and we dump it all on the dashboard he's got a prelude you remember the preludes the old preludes how deep the dashboard was so we dumped it on the dashboard i'm like yeah sir i'm finna get up in there with my straw or my dollar bill whatever i had to smoke what i'm finna get up and then get down but then my knees are cramping a little bit let me open up the car door turn sideways and then i can get a good little sniff with this nostril here you're done y'all see what i'm saying so yeah sir i popped the door open as soon as i popped the door open he opened his door wind just went straight through and blew all that [ __ ] on the floor that was the day that i stopped sniffing cocaine i was like you know what i'm not even mad i i can't even be mad all we did was close the door bless the russian [ __ ] off the counter just left man wasted a lot of money that day but we learned a valuable lesson that cocaine was not for me it's not for you neither cocaine is for a whole different breed of people and it ain't us because if it ain't green [ __ ] i do not want it i don't want it that includes money and weed it ain't green don't give it to me well it could be purple or you know a little blue still smoke oh my god y'all know how i feel about stem smoke wow i hate it with a passion oh that just [ __ ] my whole little whatever was going on up wow y'all know how to steal smokers how deep that coffee is oh yeah i'm back all right talk that [ __ ] off of me anyway we're back all right thank you and once again we're back to [ __ ] again okay so on a scale of one to ten one being the worst and ten being the best of the high quality of this sunday driver aka sunday driver oh the reason why i say sunday driver is because it's sunday driver s-u-n-d-a-y or sunday driver s-u-n-d-a-e as an ice cream sundae you know see what they did there they played a little fancy thing on words anyway get the [ __ ] out of here with that

beautiful i hope you guys have a truly legendary one of a kind day and i hope this ain't the only one of a kind day which would make it the first one of a kind day let's have more one of a kind days

breath men don't breath look at the bud and my hands are actually again it's from washing them too much so there's Mendel breath Mendel breath is an interesting mix of OG Kush breath which is the supposed patriarch in the cookies fan of genetics and Mendel and Mendel montage their forces combined made it's frosty buds that reeked of sweet vanilla and caramel but no matter how good this smells save it for the saving for afterward this stumper can pivot your entire day's plans with its powerful body built high ok let's give it a shot guys so yeah the bombs kind of dirty again we're going to get that cleaned out and we got another packed bowl right here for that so if you're new to the channel thank you for subscribe to the channel if you haven't subscribed to channel go ahead subscribe to the channel hit that post notification bell so you don't miss any of these fires videos you don't know what I'm saying hey also maybe tell you guys that I have another Facebook page besides booth I'll be walking my other Facebook pages but it literally you guessed it wake-and-bake only it's not waiting big Inc this is just waking bait on Facebook that's my other um Facebook page you go in there and see I've been there been on that for years you haven't go there and see all the all the delicious but I used to have way back in the day like 5-10 years ago I had some buds boy telling y'all let's go he could just ice up in here once again you guys loving and appreciating the comments so yesterday I had to go to them I didn't have to go to office for lunches I wanted to get some awesome cream for this rash that I got on my arm anyway so before I get there I'm walking up there and I see the woman sitting outside the building with a chair a table and she got this mask on she's got this thing in her hand and I'm walking up looking at it like I hope that your doesn't think that I'm gonna get a vaccination today I hope you don't think that I'm gonna get any type of shots today I'm not doing no flu shots I'm not you know what I heard yesterday if you did the flu shot if you took a flu shot then you've been injected with Kovac 19 do you know that all animals have a corona all animals so that's why they don't test animals it's a normal thing that's like it's something new it's an animal disease the hell there is a pause you guys for a second okay I'm back so if you're into finding out all the information you can about the k\u00f6ppen 19 like I am there's a video called the hidden agenda behind Cobra 19 then it says p1 endemic I don't know if you guys can see that right here but here's what the videos the front of its gonna look like like two people walking so you guys watch that man and it tells you so much information about about Koba 19 man it's ridiculous I mean it's ridiculous the things that they're doing this up this one doctor had figured out how to cure AIDS and he disappeared quick on this woman she was um they arrested her because she had a cure for AIDS too they arrested her kept her in jail and then they told her that you can you can't speak they gave her a gag order for five years you can't say [ __ ] about this if you say something about this we're gonna make up another [ __ ] charge and lock your ass back up so she waiting her whole five years and yesterday was when I first seen the beat up she came out naming names telling all the [ __ ] the she even had some doctors on there doctors were talking about how [ __ ] up this cover 19 is and how [ __ ] up the process is of what they're making us do the process of washing your hands 20 30 times a day do you know that's actually introducing the virus to you because our bodies supposed to have a certain amount of virus and bacteria in it to make our immune system strong and if you're costing washing your hands washing the viruses away from you it doesn't give you a meal system a chance to strengthen so it keeps it weak its weakening and weakening and making it more weak because we're keeping ourselves clean so when they do open up the country again it's gonna be full of diseases watch what I tell you that's not that's not my words that's what one of the doctors say anyway let's get - this min dobreff y'all I got sidetracked let's go stomp lay waiting big baby oh no did you guys ever had that happen to you you keep your light in your pocket and you get a big ball - living it and then it doesn't light here we go a little bit because I was admiring the flavor so much it was like street living in my mouth - tastes like that tasted pretty damn good man oh wait what I did knows I shouldn't try to hold it try to hold it smoking and busting my lung damn man uh-huh let me go and get some air you guys yes sir you already know what I'm saying about last night I slept like a frickin King last night I'll tell you guys I tell you guys this just about every day because I honestly and truly sleep like the king I don't know if it's the meditation music I listen to at night or that badass tempur-pedic I'm going cuz you can't go wrong with the tempur-pedic tell me I'm wrong y'all we're almost at 800 by the timer but it's on the end of the day is we should be at 800 subscribers I'm gonna need a thousand guys actually honestly I need 10,000 but let's work on a thousand first man y'all go tell you homies there's a new kid on the block waiting baking go tell your friends that tell your friends to tell a friends and so on and so forth y'all come on man and subscribe to the channel hit me up I still have that lemony taste in my mouth is this supposed to change lemony I don't know let me see let me see it says nothing about lemons doesn't know he said vanilla and called caramels I don't know about that but I taste some goddamn limit of bliss [ __ ] oh I have a slight burn on the back of my throat I feel the buzz coming right behind my eyes in the top of my forehead it's making me feel it feels weird but it's making me feel light like like I can you know I'm saying and it made me feel pretty good when there's a job I do say so myself then it's really tasty oh I can't put my my taste buds on every taste that's coming through here but I definitely taste some real slight of vanilla it's real slight I taste more lemon in anything or citrus you can say but it's actually more lemony this tastes like I've had Mendel breath that takes it like this but it was Mendel breath in something else hmm obviously this is not dispensary great it is really good though it's mellow it's not like dis pension rate in my lungs is kind of modeled like it doesn't like boom I'll be smoking boom Minda breath is not exotic it's just some fire as sweet and I love the name um because y'all know where I'm from well from I'm from California but what part of California mindo I'm from Mendocino County Oh middle breath hi oh yeah Oh Macarena oh my goodness I don't know what's going on with this Florida weather again I always tell y'all that this one is bipolar s ma look day before yesterday yesterday day before yesterday day before that it was like 93 degrees out there [ __ ] day before yesterday it was like sixty degrees in the morning now since the degrees in Chicago it ain't cold 60 degrees in Chicago they wearing short sleeves and shorts they try to go to the swimming pool in Chicago but 60 degrees in Florida [ __ ] I got on a puff jacket I got on thigh high boots and boots come all the way up to here man didn't strap over my shoulder like you're fishing Charles man I got first rounder [ __ ] man I got this big-ass cat that got fur around his [ __ ] he got goose ass around in this [ __ ] man telling you man [ __ ] be wearing some [ __ ] man I got Oh ostrich booty gloves no shits is the [ __ ] though y'all Austria booty I'll never ever had ostrich booty man is better than gator keep your warm up take that much yeah sir okay it's getting kind of weak that burnt up really quick didn't help that I was burning it up with the freaking no lighters but you know what you guys I think we got time for some more let's go ahead and get some more up in here and see how that does it's kind of dry it's crumbly but that makes it better for me to smoke on it up in the bowl then when I got to put it in a grinder I hate putting [ __ ] and grind it cuz you got to know that you're losing some of the some of the goodness out of your bird I eat Keith off your bud the crystals when you use a grinder it's just like if you break your bud now to fajn with your hands you know that most that shit's getting on your hands so I try to keep my [ __ ] intact as much as I can I don't like smashing bugs I hate when if I go to somebody like one of the vendors and I buy somebody from them and their buds are all smooshed up and [ __ ] like they don't pack it down in a jar something nagamma that [ __ ] man all your [ __ ] is the best [ __ ] you got man I don't want this [ __ ] you guys disrespecting the bud my nephew used to do that [ __ ] man you know the jars a whole like maybe two hours or something you want to push like trying to push a pound in there dude what do you know on man there's 32 jars over there what the [ __ ] okay on a scale of one to ten one being worse ten being the best of the flavor critique of this mindo breath it's really tasty it's really tasty that burden on the back of my throat is adding to that lemony taste I don't know how it's doing it but it's like making lemons open up in my throat anyway so on a flavor critique of this mindo breath I would have to give this the person over that popped in my mom was nine but I'm not gonna give it a nine I'm gonna give it a eight because I'm sure the flavors could pop a little more than this the the other the reason why I didn't give it a 9 or a 10 as far as flavor goes is because there's got to be room for dispensary grade this is not dispenser grade so it's not primo in my experience every every dispensary that I've been to has had primo weed except for Florida in my experience they've had better weed than the streets except for Florida so let's get back in here you know no wait we're gonna give it an 8 we gave it a 8 and it's a high eight this is quite flavorful you guys guys if what I recommend this to my friends perhaps perhaps the dispensary greater than I would I would recommend this right here to friends - because I'm actually pretty hot but yes I would recommend Mendel breath to friends now you guys know that I'm wearing a habit of of recommending exotics so it's kind of stepping back for me to uh to of recommend some just plain ol ow and that's what this is just playing allowed this doesn't fall under the exotic mark so but it is it is tasty and the high is it can be compared to some exotics men because it is a nice it's a nice even high it's not a jagged high like I'm sporadic with it it's a nice mellow I'm gonna sit back and listen to some jazz while smoking another blunt type hard you're on to do what I'm saying man it's one of them has it maybe you want to jump in the car and go catch the Sun some rods over by the water you know I'm saying to sit back and smoke another blunt you know some [ __ ] like that anyway let's let's get back in here I recommend this to y'all two months real I got all serious and [ __ ] [Music] my poor he got a little hot there I almost called the papers almost but he did raise that higher blow but I'll tell you that much with the smoky smoky chili y'all I think heart is gasps oh my gosh I everytime I breathe out my nose I taste this it's just [ __ ] just limit all in my throat it's like lemon and vanilla it's like gum Oh ballooning LaBella or limited vanilla I am high I am pleasantly hi guys let's get back in here oh ha and gasps really damn did I snort y'all remember call oh [ __ ]

told them what's up and they hooked me up with real ones these look nothing like the ones that i brought to the lab you could tell they're [ __ ] different today guys i brought the man himself peter from plug play yes the guy you see on plug plays instagram all the time i brought peter he's gonna actually sit down with me show me and show me how i can tell everything's fake how to tell their bad how to go through all the packaging the seals everything because honestly guys i mean i got played so i have no knowledge in this but let's get started so guys here's the investigator dopaziola again my homie has somebody i told him i was doing this video and he says oh i have a homie that makes fake plug plays and i go hey man can you get me the guy's [ __ ] number so i could talk to him and see

thousand plug play cards i want to show you guys right now look at i'm in my house and i could have ordered a thousand fake plug play cards just like that here's your phone back thank you so much yeah that never calls you back block it this is what's going on today while i'm doing this right now peter's on his way over here with the plug play team he's at a trap spot buying fake plug play cards yes the guy that you see does plug play is going investigator 2 to go buy fake ones he's gonna buy real ones and fake one every question you ever had today guys is going to be answered how to spot fake cards let's get this [ __ ] started all right here's peter right here hello here oh oh i see the car you know we had to make it official oh my god thank you brother get this side real quick just real quick you're rolling around in this to drop drop off orders and [ __ ] yeah it's a moving billboard all right guys here we are this is peter from plug play i'm sure you guys have seen them online what's up everybody so please do me a favor just tell everybody what plug play is about would you guys start and just the whole get down of it so we're a group of homies started the company three years ago came from the streets hustled our way became compliant became legal and now we're trying to build this as big as we can possibly do it but most importantly have fun with what we do you guys know this is the most asked for thing on my channel of all time for um for of all time the second i ever did a vape video people just asked all day like yo these are the best ones you guys gotta [ __ ] try it out i'm glad i'm sorry that it's uh that the first time i ever showed you guys on my channel it was a [ __ ] fake ass car i'm sorry about it i saw that [ __ ] man i saw that and i was like wait a minute to school me on what the [ __ ] happening bro it's a headache for not only us but everybody in this industry right now we're all battling it and most importantly it's up to our community to make sure that everybody stays aware of you know what the [ __ ] is happening they see your car however much they cost and then they see the ones i get two for 20. yeah but it's poisonous you don't know what it is and people are choosing like i want the brand name but i don't want the brand name as far as legalization and and the point that we're in right now it's just a very crazy difficult challenging time for the industry itself because this wasn't legal before and now it is with that change there also comes this area where we have to learn how to adapt to what's about to happen there was a time where nobody was compliant three years ago because there were no licenses there was none of that so it was like literally the wild wild [ __ ] out right it was just trapped but there was a code during those yeah it's bad because now it's the everyone jumped in because they saw money here to me so the people that really cared are getting pushed aside because they don't got money like that i feel like right now it it's eventually gonna find this perfect median to where everyone's happy the taxes are cool um i hope things are just different the black market that it's all trash products because there are some there's some bran there there are some good ones that have really clean products true are trying to make a name for themselves because everybody started off as a trash product and got legal yeah it doesn't mean that this was bad before it was legal they're entrepreneurs and they want to get into this space they want to do it right but the the industry is holding them back to to do it the right way never really thought about it that way because i mean i'm already in this [ __ ] i never thought about what it'd be like i'm trying to get it as a legal company as a compliant company that sells safe products we're very big on quality and making sure that there is absolutely nothing that gets through for everyone that that does [ __ ] with plug play this [ __ ] smacks right and smacks for a reason we focus on quality we focus on opponents he put that into our device i'm gonna be honest bro i do those blinkers i just don't wanna ding ready go [ __ ] i gotta take it again yo shout out to the plug play fam because everybody's been doing an amazing [ __ ] job with like banging on like unlicensed retailers right what we've come to find out is like we started calling around and a lot of these spots that that had been reported they no longer had them so it was actually it was actually pretty challenging for us to find a spot that had the fake ones all this [ __ ] that's getting sent out of state right where nobody's really informed they just see one what they want to see here busy brand here but this video today is going to show you how to never get it again i sent david in go go check it out and sure enough you know like they were fake he ended up buying a bunch of different products just so we can kind of [ __ ] around and look at it and yeah see uh what you can see what it is this is the bag that they give it to give you a paper bag it's a paper bag this is my wig at least staples this paper bag for me this is a shop this is a shop oh my god that's not good that's not a good look all right oh no that's trim look look what fell out that's trim automatic i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell everybody why when i look at this it like freaks me the [ __ ] out what is it yo it says springfield cards that has bart literally guys do you think the simpsons licensed this no that's why you could tell it's automatically [ __ ] fake this this can fool some people so how can you tell that these are fake because this is the same looking one that i got but they've even made copies of these with the compliance package and the stippling and the sticker they can knock the sticker off yeah they knocked everything off the only way you can tell really is the way that the letters are printed so the difference for like the the fake ones that i've seen they don't have these plastic tabs on the side the ones that i've seen they have older batch numbers we sell out a product pretty quickly so if it's two months old you know it's probably fake let me talk about this specific one if you look at the difference in the actual sticker that's on here this is a completely different sticker i want you to compare it you see him oh [ __ ] it's not even that it says one gram on here and this doesn't have a shine watch so yeah point them out yeah look at it apple slushy looks identical dude except there's yours is outlined there's isn't yeah like such small details if you look at it even the color of the blue it's different yeah it's a little bit it's just different and then right there look at the exotics is a different color yeah and there's knockoff says but look at this this is the scary part look at their oil it's like clear just like yours clearer than ours oh [ __ ] but that doesn't mean there's this actual oil exactly it could be something else it could be something else all right which one's fake what do you [ __ ] learn so far there one gram automatic fake basically look on your instagram and see what the updated logos are too this is scary show us what is that this is tangy bang we don't even have a tangy bang flavor how can this can somebody go to like a website and see that what flavors you have your ig huh yeah just follow their ig guys so you can stay up on what flavors for sure it says packaged last month yeah this one this is this is ten this one's real that's the one you brought also this is scary this is scary too this oil might not be oil and say it is say it's [ __ ] great say it's [ __ ] bomb oil it's not tested well if these guys are doing such a great job at making this type of quality if it is good quality i'm not gonna chance it if they're doing that type of quality like go compliant right that or stop knocking off my brand and make your own [ __ ] brand for that damn good we have a responsibility to make sure that like we take care of our community so if anybody sends us a dm about a fake car or a concern about a fake car we gotta look at it that's your [ __ ] if someone were to get hurt i did i didn't answer dm and then that person had gotten hurt that's not like i don't want that it really is on you though that's the worst part about it i never really thought about it it's the stress yeah yeah it's so stressful the water building up i have like a body high now you're right oh yeah oh man i'm pretty big you're gonna get high as [ __ ] at the end oh my god no no i'm doing that i'll put my sunglasses back on have you ever seen the [ __ ] on the news where these [ __ ] vape pen batteries explode yeah and basically it's shrapnel to your eyes yeah i don't want that did you know people knock off plug play batteries everyone's batteries i didn't know that these can explode i got one right here he brought a fake battery they're knocking off these the batteries and it looks the [ __ ] it looks better than ours what you smoke a lot i do but not this extreme real plug plays real ones will [ __ ] you up apparently he's definitely not hitting the fake ones hell yeah yeah he's getting he's gonna be good jesus jesus christ just wait till the end we're about to get oh my goodness thumbnail right there i gotta go lay down your time oh my god my video came out try and hold on there as long as possible [Music] i had a pause for a moment because it got way too lit and needed to take a quick nap on this table they bought a fake plug plate uh battery also remember if they could blow up in your [ __ ] face how can you tell that they're fake well the thing is though with the box you couldn't even tell right i couldn't tell where the box was out of the box it's like boom like just look at the print so right off the bat the fake ones have white is this plays in white right yeah plays in white for the fake ones two months from now they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna catch on to this they'll catch up when you guys update your [ __ ] so it makes you guys on your toes all the time huh that packaging's dead on the same oh guys when you see the packaging look look at the [ __ ] barcodes they got it down they wouldn't bought a real one copied your barcode that's crazy right peter yeah almost there why is the big deal buying a fake uh battery there's a protection chip in there so when it's being charged and it's like fully charged it stops pushing energy into it yours yeah what's the big deal those could they could burn your house down they could blow up in your face anything they blow up right there because the chip they don't have a chip so it keeps pumping energy into it so it like overloads it too much basically the fake ones don't have the protection chip because that costs extra money exactly they're trying to pay pitch everyone's trying to get into the market right now corners like i said cutting corners man [ __ ] people up you back to life slowly that's because you're dope as yola bro i smoke a lot of weed i'm pretty much an alien when it comes to weed tolerances oh it's like a box all they don't hit they don't do [ __ ] to me that's what we does i'm high but i mean i'm here it just goes to show and proves you smoke he smokes these every day every day he took a couple blinkers and he's done that's how strong these are so i'm going to let peter get out of here so you can go take a damn nap peter thank you so much for stopping by i'll see you soon so thank you so much peter for stopping by these are right in front of me and i could still not tell they had the same barcodes so like peter said they can get this packed this is the knock-off box this is the real box they can knock it off they can make the same sticker everything guys they're getting so good with it how can you tell you're not going to get some fake stuff that could poison it could poison you so make sure you pay attention to this stuff this doesn't say one gram this does say one gram is outlined apple slushy on the fake one is not outlined those little things matter you literally have to be like antique roadshow [ __ ] to be able to go well you see this is here that's how you have to be right now those counterfeiters are following me too they're going to watch it they're going to watch us go damn all right we got to switch it up guys plug play you everybody all big companies they update their packaging often for counterfeiters this is the reason why counterfeiters are they're good they make fake gucci they make fake nikes and you couldn't even tell i'm sure somebody one of you has bought fake jordans once you guys can get dupes so don't get duped on shoes that's cool don't get duped on things you put in your lungs you guys heard it earlier i talked to that [ __ ] on the phone that means he's packaging these making them for probably five dollars five dollars there's no way that's thc real fake if you have any questions come back refer to this video and make sure you have the real ones real quick guys before we get out of here these right here they said they got for free for coming to the dispensary can we get a close-up i want to rip this open they gave him six free joints for coming in no no what is that why is it brown and yellow you see it there's yellow chunks in here why oh it's dead leaves oh it's trim oh this is true so guys this past month has been pretty wild we did exposing fake cards which led us to this because you guys asked so much how to spot fake cards how do you know if your cards fake how to spot fake packaging i'm so sorry i got you so high man but that's just that's what happens sometimes over here peter thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to first off go to the trap spot and get all these fake ones and then bring some real ones just to show us it was super informational dude even like i said even i got played i had no idea how to spot these because they look so [ __ ] real this has been how to spot fake carts with plug play thank you so much guys for watching pass this information along thank you guys so much for watching i'm dobaziola have a dope ass day oh [ __ ] damn i", "AVVtgzfVoSc": "[Music] everybody so I just took my niece to get her eyebrows threader for the first time and previously before that we took her to get her eyebrows waxed for the first time I'm gonna go ahead and upload the video so you guys can see both of them and see how she reacted to her getting her eyebrows waxed and threaded for the first time relax it looks good already looks good stop it looks really good it looks good she's gonna be your lifelong customer after this it looks good Wow looks good now it's done no more burning it only burns one this is what you really wanted the middle the middle the middle no now you're gonna have to a rose no relax [Music] [Laughter] [Music] so she's a 12 year old she just recently got promoted from sixth grade and so what was your experience with threading and waxing which wouldn't hurt the most well both of them were the same but I like threading better because it didn't leave a mark on your eyebrow and what she's referring to what she's thinking of is because when she got him waxed it left like a little bit of like white skin underneath well why was it white what do you think goes way because different color when they waxed it so basically we think that with since it was our first time getting a waxed it needed a little bit of Sun to get some color butter that they linked pretty sharp that looked good about the last time how long do you think it took for you to get your eyebrows done total like when they set you in there they did the eyebrows to in 10 to 20 minutes okay and what about the eyebrow threading well how did that feel today I felt okay would you say it's not that painful after you do it once okay okay so she's trying to be a diva we're gonna go ahead and try to help her become a diva and what would be your advice to young girls thinking about getting their eyebrows done what do you think when do you think it's the right time for a girl to get her eyebrows done I got him doing my my when I was 12 so whenever you guys want to do them it's fine but you guys have to make sure to ask you guys as parents and you guys should only do them if you want to okay if you want to if you want to get them done check with your parents and if you want to get them done don't listen to anybody else that's telling you that you got a free that got low eyebrow or you got one unibrow yes whenever you want to get them done if you want to get them done if not embrace your unibrow and briefs your Frida you know but she wanted to get them done and how do you feel do you feel fantastic yeah do you feel like Beyonce do you feel like Rihanna what about Selena Gomez what okay one more question what were your classmates saying after you got your eyebrows done if I was wearing makeup on my eyebrows okay but it's no makeup for her she's a natural beauty this is my niece she's a natural beauty she don't need any makeup you know she's just a natural girl we're trying to keep it natural

did and I do I feel great when I wake a man and I think it's because their music this is such a beautiful lime green color Wow and if you guys get a good visual on that that's such a beautiful long dreams Oh got me gasp upon it no sir but we got it okay we got the ice in there we told the old subscribe to the channel we ready gorilla glue forward all that let's go alright see I'm already a big fan of the cakes all the cakes are good man I even love cake in I'm just played all the cakes are good I haven't had a good cake strand yet and you guys know about gorilla glue gorilla glue is just it has its own its own specific special taste oh but does but gorilla glue kind of reminds me of like Sour Diesel it has its own taste in somebody somebody wrote you a J of some perp or whatever they put in it and then they put some sour diesel on top of that [ __ ] and you smokes and I guarantee you'll pick up that Sour Diesel it's the same way with Gorilla Glue grill man if you smoke Gorilla Glue you'll know oh you'll know skipper there it is alright yes that's definitely beautiful Tate I'm struggling to find something that matches the taste of that deck head knock you know because you guys know that hit knock around always keep talking about it then hit knock I got a 10 out of 10 yeah that didn't knocked off everything knocked off all the boxes so grows blue by itself could probably get a 10 flavor from me but gorilla gluing cakes neither one of them diminishes each the other one but I still couldn't give it a Tim because then head knocker was now you guys know if you go back I don't even know how many videos it was 20 30 videos ago maybe a little more when I did the head knocker I still carry that flavor with me man I still carry that hog with me if I could run across that again and I don't even think that was dispensary gradings just like this uh this uh blue case I believe is dispensary great y'all seen the lawn greenie of the lime green so like I told you yesterday after I hit those moon rock when the video was over man I was so I I was so big but I'll tell you what it got that [ __ ] hangover off me that's all I was looking for you know what's weird it's like when you have a hangover you know you feel like [ __ ] see place do do like your head might be swimming your body just feels like your body feels like you can around weights and [ __ ] you're [ __ ] ready to throw up in any goddamn second man and the only thing you can think of is how to get this [ __ ] hangover off me so you smoked that works for your head but your body still feels like [ __ ] you can't figure out what the [ __ ] it is then you eat and then she cancels all that out my point is that the but really it it's a cure for um for uh for hangin and the button makes you forget about that hangover that's what that's what [ __ ] me up because the next day like today oh I remember the hangover but I don't remember all of it when I drink again in Asia I was drinking again yesterday but you know how you feel when you had the Hangul reflate oh oh oh my god but sometimes she goes wait you're like you wanna do a shot do you come on out why do we do that to ourselves man that stuff is crazy excuse me that stuff is crazy I can't believe we do that to ourselves man and have you ever drank and you got to the point to where you was just like I'll never drink again man I qamishlo Oh Lord just let me make it through this I'll never drink again II damned if you ain't drinking again anyway y'all let's go ahead and get in on this yeah I think a little on that time cuz I wanted to taste it I wouldn't try to kill myself okay on the flavor critique of these glue cakes on a scale from one to ten one being the worst ten being the best the flavor critique of blue cakes I would have to give this a you know I can't even give it a nine I wanted to give it a nine but I can taste the flavors with it they don't pop they don't have sharp edges if you know what I mean so uh I'll have to give it an eight I'll give it a high eight lo9 yeah yeah and the buzz is there but it's it's not intense the buzz is not like here the buzz is right behind my eyes like where I feel the hybrids at I I told you all my clinicians are weird but this I explained exactly how I feel and where I feel it out I feel like a slight pressure behind my eyes that's why I usually feel my hybrid dad you know if I got a regular good buds up here so sometimes in between but yeah I can feel my eyes starting to get a little this is uh it's a nice mellow heart say excuse me see ten fifteen minutes really isn't long enough to critique a good high you have to sit back and smoke a couple bowls maybe a half hour maybe our ninja Bango you some hard [ __ ] no sales not I mean this really is tasty though but that's all I get for me is alone i hi bug you don't get none freakin mosquitoes many mosquitos are bad I think they released some mosquito you know what that would be a damn good way to get a virus realm maybe I shouldn't say it because what folks are probably doing if they haven't already done it the best way to get a [ __ ] virus around is a damn mosquito you know what I don't understand I know that all insects bugs animals people and whatever help the ecosystem but what in the hell is a mosquito here for if we figured how to get rid of them yet I know we don't figure out how to get rid of them we got so much technology we know how to kill people from a million miles away we can kill people with one little strand of something in a little cup kill a million people but we can't get rid of a damn mosquito I know they didn't know everybody why can't we get rid of them bees I can understand why they're here flies I even understand why they're here they're annoying this [ __ ] and bees make me [ __ ] mad but I know why they're here mosquitoes it's time for y'all to pack your [ __ ] and get the [ __ ] on cuz mosquitoes even love weed man every time I saw smoke [ __ ] around me man sorry element on the side right there to the side trip okay sorry yes for some reason where I get like this I don't know felt like the hi just hit me all of us like buddy Omega UI I was like you know what I am am I go clap de clap no I'm not getting so love it you know nothing gets gay folks not for me anyway I don't want to take that trip let's get off that subject okay yeah so feel quite animated this morning isn't that weird don't seem a little move Oh leave me alone man yours comments why I feel like I'm talking to my best room when I'm dancing y'all's comments and reading your comments I think I say the rule like oh oh that was good oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah did every once in a while you get people don't wanna talk [ __ ] you know like oh I said I wasn't gonna give anybody clout but if I can give somebody some cloud here take some cloud if I haven't need to give you take some cloud so like the person yesterday I can't give you enough cloud ticket to recall your name but he said that bill had me rolling man cuz you got robbed man their package ain't even real the package isn't real it's only my weed let me ask you a question if the package isn't real that means that I couldn't see it touch it taste it or smell it just like this bag here is this bag real it's a real bag and furthermore you guys you guys gotta understand man I am NOT I repeat I am NOT smoking the packages I'm not smoking I don't care what y'all say I am not smoking that paper so whatever package whatever package I'll show you guys that is what's in the bag now who made the [ __ ] I can't tell you but I'm not smoking the package of smoking the contents of the package do you get me do you understand me can you smell what the Nicki is cookin I'm just playin y'all okay so I'm happy to win motel I was Gary get hot forty but wait a minute there's more for $9.99 this place opens thought events but wait if you order now with 1995 you get the second label for free that just we don't for just a little bit a little bit more of here so I'm really gonna good here and just kind of like you know coming bust along you know what I'm saying okay on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best of the flavor critique of glue Kate I'm sorry yo take two on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best of the high pratik of his glue cakes hmm I would have to give it up just a hard decision one moment please let's see I'm gonna have to give it up just a couple more seconds I'll figure it out oh I'd have to give the equal amount of the flavor I will give it a low nine high eight perhaps where I should start doing is stop trying to compare everything to the head knocker like the head knock is the holy grill that's what I've been doing what I need to grade these cannabis is on their own merit so given that I would still have to give it the same for this particular strain the glue case I would definitely have to give it a low nine high eight for the flavor low not high eight for the high when i recommend it to my friends abso-freakin'-lutely I would absolutely recommend this to my friends this is a good cannabis a nice round of cannabis this is the type of bud that you pack your favorite flavor hung me up in a roller blunt and go to the beach dance with this now you can't go to the beach grown wise that's some [ __ ] in it but anyway well maybe you can go to the beach in your area it doesn't really matter we have critique the weed so you guys if you guys have to go to work I hope you have a truly legendary beautiful blessed awesome day at work I hope today is better than your yesterday and I hope tomorrow it's even better than today y'all be blessed you already know i'ma say man you ain't gotta go home but you gotta get the [ __ ] out of here man and stay back", "ioPN9UGAems": "it is a complicated process to figure out when the grapes are ripe and ready to be harvested there's there are scientific methods that you can test the sugar there's a refractometer that you can look and see but most high quality producers are actually having their wine makers in vineyard managers are walking through the vineyards and doing the good old fashioned taste test they're tasting the grapes and making sure all the phenolic ripeness is there so not only are the grapes ripe and sweet and juicy but the seeds have also hit ripeness to which eliminates a lot of the bitter the bitter flavors and green or stringent flavors that come in wine sometimes so it's not only just the scientific ripeness but it also has to be the complete ripeness of all the aspects of the great so it is a it is a complicated process mother nature has been getting her way for many years and climate have changed there's erratic weather and strange things that are happening but for the most part you have a pretty good understanding of what a microclimate of a vineyard is and historic data of when you're going to harvest so right now for example the Napa Valley is harvesting about four weeks earlier than they were 35 years ago and that's been that way for the the last the last ten years or so which is kind of a fascinating proposition so things change an altar but the vineyard managers will know best what happens in the grapes so it's a matter at this point of day-to-day testing and tasting and knowing what the grapes taste like and are they ready to go

know if that means mine is fake or if this company just just uses AI crusher for their carts like I'm not really sure if you have any if you have any additional info that'd be great I definitely get

it is a Girl Scout cookie and the other end of it is a because it smells like pine and earth something a cowboy might smell sleeping out under the stars that's where the name comes from from what I

I will not try and [ __ ] fool you into thinking that is on concentrate expert cuz I'm not I ain't consumer you need my honest opinion of this product I like what I see so far the price was awesome when it prompted me to tip for five dollars it was 35 bucks in RAM and leaves on Sixth Avenue count me out awesome use it by manufactured on the 21st of december and 2015 and it has to be used by the same date in 2016 month and that is a weird 54 new year shelf life boy here is not the time just fine 5345 and how do that and double nah what I need 153 she's gotta add three years 35 to 65 ft nine

go do I look high cuz I feel like I look really high and thus the reviews to say that is has pine and earth smell it very much does very earthy very not anything fruity it's not fruity at all it's very plenty and earthy yeah a body high kind of warm from the chest we haven't done psychedelic mushrooms just a tangle of that isn't that funny not to always going on and you forgot you took them

purchasing grapes from multiple growers have a real challenge on their hands because they they're not out in the field in front of the winery there's many different places they have to coordinate when the grapes are going to be ripe with their vineyard managers and the folks that are actually farming those vineyards so it does become a challenge because of the transportation issue and harvesting in each different area that that that winery wants to use they have to get the grapes there so it is definitely a challenge you'll see a lot of large large trucks moving through the Napa Valley at least this time of year and other wine regions but it is a pretty big challenge if you imagine having to go to you know 15 different grocery stores to get your your food each week it is a logistical challenge so fortunately we get to consume it after it's all that hard works been done but pretty much it's it is a logistical challenge because they ripen in different parts of wine regions at different times too so it all depends on the space that the winery has and how quickly they get them even there when they're harvesting for for grapes they have contracts with they're generally starting to be made within within 24 hours of harvest", "dMtW79dUAB4": "[Music] [Music] [Music] yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today i do got a weed review it's coming to you by tyson ranch i have done a few strain reviews for him in the past if you want to see them go ahead and go check them out but today this train that we will be reviewing is the sunday driver and i did get this at blue fire dispensary in merced california it is going to run you around 37 for the eight and sunday driver is a hybrid it's more like a 50 50 hybrid it's right in the middle and this is coming to you at a 25 and a half percent on the thc 0 on the cbd for a total cannabinoids of 29 and a half percent there's a bud as you can see there and like always if you want to see an up-close picture of the product check it out [Music] as you can see there it looks really good it's got a sweet smell to it and sunday driver is fruity pebbles crossed with grape pie so that would give you a pretty fruity smell uh the buds are dense but they were very dry on this batch i'm not gonna lie to you guys so uh let's get a hit of it in and see what it's all about the tyson ranch sunday driver it looks good it smells good it was a bit dry from my liking so let's get a hit and see what it's all about cheers everybody oh okay first initial thought it don't have a bad flavor it's not the best i can't really pinpoint the flavor on it it's uh it wants to be fruity but it's not like really popping out there i have reviewed some other sunday drivers in the past by other companies so we're gonna test this one out it was smooth it didn't have like a a funky it didn't [ __ ] up my throat or have a funky aftertaste the high it doesn't pack a huge punch it's more um it's in the middle it's mellow but like everybody knows two for the review get the second one in and see what it does yeah like i said when i was breaking it up it was kind of dry used to the tyson ranch used to be like 50 something bucks out the door i see now that they dropped down to 37 so i don't know why they're dropping in the price like that i mean i'm glad they are because they're more affordable now but i have reviewed the ko kush and a few other strains from him and i want to say those packed a harder punch than the sunday driver so far we do have to get the second hit in and everybody remember to smile [Music] we got the uh disco ninja if you guys seen the review the other day you guys seen i was drinking one of these we'll get a [ __ ] mug a little mug pour into this [ __ ] this is a north eastern what is it northeast style hazy ipa [ __ ] is [ __ ] strong as hell what do we got today whoa we got jackpot jackpot it's [ __ ] dope okay set this aside for a second let's get the second hit in see what the shit's all about sunday driver by tyson ranch and you can get this at blue fire dispensary in merced california cheers everybody hope you guys are smoking on something good and i know [ __ ] the bongo got stuck for a minute wasn't getting no air pool almost ruined my hit but i got it okay okay off that one a bit of the same i'm not like super super uh blown away by the flavor it's not the most flavorful strain that i've ever had yeah i've had some better sunday drivers and i've had some better strains by tyson ranch so personally i think that they they kind of dropped the ball on this one it's not the worst i've ever had but it definitely isn't the best um when it comes to tyson ranch or sunday driver this isn't the big winner for me it has it has a funky little like taste it doesn't pack that hard of a punch and it was really dry i'm not gonna lie to you it was just too dry for my liking it wasn't sticky um it just kind of like crumbled you know it's just a [ __ ] dry ass bud they need to put one of those those packs or something in here because it's too dry listen to me tyson you're [ __ ] up man your weed was way too [ __ ] dry i know that you could knock me out but man you gotta get better at that okay let's calculate it price at blue fire dispensary in merced california it's gonna run you thirty seven dollars for the eight uh that's not a bad price that's actually really tree or a tree cherry it's very cheap the look and the smell the look is good the smell yeah it's not you know i don't know it's not the best thing or nothing it's not that great of a smell it doesn't blow you out of the water um it was too dry the smoothness was there didn't [ __ ] up my throat the high the flavor is nothing to write home about and the high is definitely in the middle of the pack it you could i feel like i got high but i'm not like super loaded or nothing so i'm definitely not going to recommend this one if you guys want to try tyson ranch try one of the other strains do not try the sunday driver i think it's a [ __ ] bust it's a fail so overall for the sunday driver by tyson ranch i'm giving it the even seven it's [ __ ] there's a lot of wackness to it it is still dispensary weed so it's not bad to get you loaded but it's nothing to write home about i say skip this one i'm giving it to seven that was my review i hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town out [Music]", "6Fv7M3Wiy6A": "what's good everybody

actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "ITYWOdn4sLY": "hey everyone Susan here in you're watching dank Network and in partnership with leaf Viacom we're here to bring you the latest in cannabis news now if you're new to the marijuana world and you're looking for a place to start well keep in mind that there are several factors that you should be aware of before you try your first puff on the other hand if you've consumed marijuana before but you have a lot a low tolerance you should also educate yourself and tread lightly marijuana is a powerful beneficial and helpful plant that can deliver all sorts of physical mental and psychological relief however if you use a marijuana strain that's too strong and doesn't suit your specific needs and once then the experience could be disappointing and are upsetting therefore it's crucial to be aware of the marijuana strain you'll use and the content of CBD and THC within that strain and it's important to understand that you're looking to get out what you're looking to get out of using marijuana so here's what beginners and low tolerant smokers should know before they blow alright now the first difference between CBD and THC that's very important to know and be aware of the percentage of each compound within the product you're looking to buy when first using marijuana strains start off with with strains that contain a high level of CBD rather than THC CBD is a non psychoactive compound that mayor in the mayor of the marijuana plant and it's highly recommended to begin using a marijuana strain that's high in CBD because it relaxes the brain while delivering other medical benefits for those who have a low tolerance for marijuana it's essential to tread lightly when consuming marijuana strains that have medium to high levels of THC in general when there's a high amount of THC in a marijuana strain more intense psychoactive effects will occur which get the brain cerebrally high those who have a low tolerance to marijuana and those who are beginners should look into marijuana strains that have a lower THC content and work up from there then it's easier to gauge what your body and mind can handle now occasionally people can feel paranoid dizzy and/or anxious if they consume too much of a marijuana strain that's high in THC and/or if too high of a dosage is taken it's also important to know the difference between indica sativa and hybrid

this one yo thanks for following us and stay lit [Music]", "ho7sGV86-jk": "[Music] [Music] hey guys what's up welcome back so here we are today back in the 3x3 tent filled with symbiotic genetics Tofino zack OB Tofino is a purple punch and today we are 56 days past the 12:12 flip mark meaning we are a full 8 weeks into flower and guys let me just tell you right now this run has been done for about a week more or less just kind of pushing them long for the feeding schedule and flush schedule that I kind of have predetermined for them but overall trichomes are Amber across-the-board everywhere both beautiful top colors that have just been pelted by high high amounts of photon from the blue from high-energy blue to a good amount of 660 photons as well all the way down if we go through the canopy let's see if we can get maybe that bud right there in the back two buds down below like so are doing just fine so this run was veg maybe three and a half weeks or so kind of shoved into this tent so that we could see the pheno typical expressions of these phenotypes since we haven't ran these and this run was delayed for so long that these aren't even the seed plants these are clones of seedlings taken out but this is our first look at them and right away honestly pretty much every one of them is a is a winner you would be just thrilled to have these in your garden but as we kind of talked about last time and if you've been following me on instagram at at green jeans garden or a tad I guess it's just a green juice garden anyway you've seen some beautiful flower shots and trichome shots and you can just see the development of this crop here and it's been like I said ready to pull for about a week or so but just holding it off ever so slightly because honestly we didn't start flush till day 42 or 44 somewhere in there and this like I said this crop probably could have been already at like day 50 so that just was not quite enough flushing time so here we are down the road looking good see if we can get you in here a little bit and as you can see the whole canopy is just purple doubt in the back we have some calcium deficiencies showing up as well as across the board and that's the one thing I will say if I could note about the purple punch which is this right side of the tent here both front and back but specifically my beaten beef you know in the back very very calcium hungry plants here I have them in veg and these will show calcium deficiencies quite quickly kind of tough to see up here on the front Fino but you can just see the rust spots in the back as well as kind of on the sort on the serrations the outer tips the Kobe's a little more showing there indica dominance in the sense that they kind of seem to take what you can throw at them have a really good a really good bulking phase here from both the Kobe's and though Kobe number 8 up here in front is based on just look appearance growing without smoking or anything is my winner the number what I'm deeming the number 24 the second one to show female in the back is actually so close to what the village has as his cutter what I kind of the first cut of Kobe I saw when I was like yeah we're gonna want it this it's kind of purple with a little bits of yellow underside I cannot wait to trim that as where the Kobe number 8 is definitely a true purple Fino both black leaf style and the actual buds themselves are quite colorful and I hope you guys enjoyed that little bit of close-up macro early on show you guys some of the trichomes and as well as this picture right here you can see the trichomes this is from the Kobe right here this is a bud that I cut off from here was kind of poking up here and so those truck try comes you just looked at right here came from this area of the canopy on the outer middle shelf I'm so just just imagine how much more amber developed and borer line starting to turn into CBN there are those trichomes so this tent should be harvested probably tomorrow maybe the next day but it is time to come down and I wasn't quite sure if we were gonna get over here and be able to get you guys a another one last look here but glad I got to stop by this phyno of purple punch here doesn't have the nose of this the front purple punch but it has just almost like blackberry in the sense of kind of like hypnotic trichome so they're probably just a lot of big stalks and not so much head heads on them but just beautiful and just very noticeable and this female has definitely some resin rails a little more so than the other this front Fino though is by far above and beyond the most terpene dominant Fino you know LA Confidential cross is here you're gonna expect a little bit of mellow cush and that's kind of what I'm getting across the board we'll see how they cure out there they're coming out a little stronger in the end here but the purple punch being Larry OG and then some granddaddy perps you're kind of up in the air and that an f2 Fino or f2 has some very very wide phenotypic expressions so that's what you're gonna get here anyway we have some really that the back one's almost mint and this one is it's like fruit it's like I'll call it fruit punch I mean that's it really is that is what lives up to it that's not exactly the Alpha cut or The Villages mother cut I know what his I know the terpenes on that because I've actually have gotten the the derived hurt the cannabis derived terpenes from his strain as well as smoked his flowers and it's killer but it's not quite the same profile so cool to see what's coming out in the f2 expressions so I don't actually have this cut high root is possibly the only one to have it or just in joints if he still has cuts but he said something about I think losing the punch or something in a reset or so I don't know so high rate you might be the only one with this cut right now if you gave it to Lemmy I don't know anyway hold on to it I might want it back la dee da dee da so this like I said guys is where we stand we are a full eight weeks down the road into this little I don't want to call it a fee no hunting but a fee no showing tent under the prototype not really pro it's an old prototype that will not go into production of the PLC six it's a four hundred and eighty watt model up there running out about four hundred and twenty four and fifty watts just a touch below 100% and those aren't CEO bees or cobs in there those are actually xpg threes and Cree Photo Reds in a little prototype custom red enhance spectrum and as you guys can see and some of you have commented and said definitely think it's a spectrum I've always said that when introducing red photons into the light diet or into the light recipe you kind of get a reflection in the plants and I used to call it the Apache fade back in the day when I was with Apache but what it really is is just kind of it's an influence those red those red photons are influencing the pigments in the plants and it just causes them to express themselves just so much more vividly and if you saw my Instagram post today it was the one I said feeling the vibes or something like that but it was kind of a shot from up under here looking up into these beautiful leaves and you can see the reds and the colors and for you people who don't think it's it's it's flushed by the way this leaf is black as can be here and I've picked off a bunch more black as can be let's go up to the light little bits of green but you can see it's listen to that watch it's just crumbling it's dried up it's done it's ready it's not going to turn yellow this is a purple strain these aren't going to fade the yellow yeah there might be a little bit of expressions here and there some lightening up but as the chlorophyll basically loses its dominance kind of gets burned through more or less the the other pigments take over as part of the flush as part of the final phase here and that's what you guys are seeing so yes it's a short flush here we're on like 11 12 days on the flush by the time I harvest but they're fully flushed and we're showing that by my leaves falling in decaying as well as even prime prime top leaves starting to well I can't think of it cannibalize there we go I'm starting to cannibalize themselves and flush it out so guys that is going to do it from the 3x3 tent I hate to say it but this is the last run in this 3x3 he's getting rid of the tent moving a bunch of things but we'll probably mean some upgrades in the future as things like that usually do but all those you all of for all of you guys who have been following my channel for so long you know the last year has kind of just been a joke about jumping around remodel my house getting my rooms back up and running to a full scale so just things like this or to get ready for that with fee nose and hunt and you know getting plants ready and whatnot but also just keeping head stash full we don't want to run out of medicine that's that's the whole goal here you know we don't have to be excessive about it we can do really really well in some small situations but the whole goal is to get back up to our full-size garden where we can produce a good amount of medicine that we can actually extract purify and use properly and get enough of it so that's kind of the end goal but anyway like subscribe just cuz this is done and whatnot we got like I said it's coming more contents come in plus the nutrient videos a few things I'm working with some companies and a lot of content to come on the channel plus plc has a few things up their sleeve that are just a couple months out from release that's really gonna rock it's their game changers they one of them is if if it's it's a freaking game-changer I cannot wait and then some other ones are just gonna fill some niches very very nicely and always like PLC's goal is to help on the price while providing some top-notch components and fixtures so thanks again guys like and subscribe and I will see you guys next time", "TNCn-L9tg7Y": "what's up so got some white rats tastes good the broken shock load of work I had a block rule I

"[Music] hey y'all my name is LMC and if you're interested in the cannabis industry regarding business politics finance investment marketing branding entrepreneurship all that good stuff to make sure that's dry but now below I would very much appreciate it and today we are gonna talk about Mike Tyson and his cannabis resort we're referencing an article done by Leif desk and Darren Parkin is a little bit of an older article written back in July 27th 2019 so if you've never heard of Mike Tyson obviously a lot of people have a very famous boxer you know has become a popular culture icon in a lot of different ways very unique very famous talks are obviously a really good boxer but he obviously has a very strong connection with cannabis and he has his own cannabis brand now this resort that he announced I think a couple of years ago I'm not exactly sure on that this resort is extreme is an extremely interesting case study that we're gonna be able to analyze in you know once it really opens I think it opens very soon obviously things are kind of crazy right now with the current pandemic going on so you know we don't know exactly when this will be open I'm not exactly sure I think it might have opened last month but anyway well dive in this article and then we'll talk about kind of how this is super interesting case study to look at so he has a ranch I was in California obviously undisputed and former heavyweight champion of the world and his experience huge success in the cannabis of this cannabis company Tyson ballistics and so his 53 year old table plans for his 407 eco resort which includes a hotel spas lodges a glamping park and the world's longest lazy river snaking its way around into the entire park as a means of getting around that's pretty interesting remember so a lot of different aspects here but really overall you know great cannabis tourism resort in a lot of different ways the ambitious plans also containing the events area to host annual marijuana music festivals as well as Tyson University which is the ex boxers hopes to dedicate to degree style courses on teaching agriculture into perspective cannabis farmers okay so that's super interesting so this is a lot of ways a you know multi-faceted cannabis endeavor you know it's a you know not only learn there but they're gonna music festivals it's a resort right so Tyson current leads the race for research into growing it's an improving cannabis something he has been taking over yearly and so here we can see you know we'll scroll down here in a sec but this is the overall map of the of his Parker he's rich pretty massive right you see that windy River right there Wow very very interesting and yeah so this is gonna be super interesting so you know this is a little interview this is this aspect of the of the article with Mike Tyson you know he's been fighting for over 20 years and my body has a lot of wear and tear that's why he this is a interview that cannabis and tackle magazine did so that's kind of you know here's that's kind of the why behind why you know obviously Mike Tyson is in this industry you know I think it's a great message and branding wise I think it's I think it's super smart if you haven't seen online you know he's a podcast now which is I think smoke or it's like box they're hot boxing with Mike Tyson so there's you know obviously reference to his you know boxing days and the cannabis aspect do it with hot boxing zone smart there anyway he's got a media aspect going he's building which is smart he's got his own you know cannabis company and then now they have this resort which i think is a you know gonna be a really interesting case study it could be really smart or it could be a money pit that ends up hurting him in the long run his company I don't think that's gonna happen but we will have to see so in a lot of ways it's super interesting too because this park this you know it brings in a lot of fun aspects tourism education you know all these different things so here's an artist's impression of of the Tyson Ranch Resort so you can see here pool just a beautiful and you know got some upon the water gazebos hanging out it's a really cool really luxury that's just obviously the resort aspect of the resort I mean that's the luxury aspect of the resort you know where people hang out in the shell now that's definitely you know as long as you know people are coming for I think you can draw people there from the tourism aspect from the education aspect but also you know if they're gonna have music festivals there too I think that that also could bring in a lot of viewers you know a lot of different people you know trying out the resort and then potentially coming back if the experience is good but what I think this is super interesting to look at is this resort not only going to offer potentially education so you have that aspect you're sending people out you're making money but you're also sending people that were trained by you know the Tyson ranch you know teachers however they're gonna go about that that'll be interesting but I think it's also interesting too because Tyson ranch and Tyson resort this is kind of one of the first you know real examples of somebody creating a fully controlled experience by a company that owns it could cam at this print so is it going to pay dividends to let's say people a bunch of people come to this resort because there is a music festival or cannabis music festival and you know they stay there and they have a good experience is that going to drive people to purchase the Tyson cannabis brand now that is really the telltale sign of whether or not this is not to say that it's gonna be unsuccessful but the fact that it it can show that it has you know pays dividends across the board not only are you making money on the actual resort and the actual you know tourism aspect and potentially the educational aspect but is that also helping residually helping you know sell the cannabis brand you know in different states in in the state of California where this is I believe that's really what I'm very interested to see whether or not that is the case cannabis tourism isn't really been you know cannabis experiences cannabis tourism as a whole hasn't really been tapped into fully especially by a major cannabis brand you know we've seen cannabis - or some companies but have we seen a cannabis brand create a tourist or inter or like a weekend long experience for potential consumers and then have that translate into the brand we haven't really seen that completely we're going to see that right we're gonna see a full you know a full approach like where for example with high times high time is gonna have their festivals and now they're gonna have you know their own retail spots they don't have their own brands but you know you get what I'm trying to say here it's just we're starting to see more money come into the industry and we're starting to see new potential strategies that can truly build brand equity like I said the very interesting case study like the question that we need to ask is will this resort will Tyson title the Tyson ranch resort create brand equity create growth for the Tyson ranch brand right for the cannabis company and you know that's just gonna be super into see you know hopefully that this gets off the ground ground I am very you know I definitely think I'm gonna go visit you know once it opens I think it opens very soon I like I said a don't I don't know the exact date I think they might have announced it recently but obviously it's a little crazy because the times were in right now is pandemic but like I said all my cannabis entrepreneurs cannabis marketing branding you know all anybody that's interested in industry let's look at this and let's see how this cannabis resort does because you know if this does well we're gonna see a lot more of them and and like I said these are the questions to ask isn't gonna help affect potentially the brand equity of the cannabis brand who knows we will see super interesting stuff I'm very excited to see this I definitely going to visit when I when it's possible for myself anyways if you liked the video make sure the subscribe button that like but hope everyone is staying super safe and sound hope you all have an amazing amazing day peace", "4H-mtUZ_sbA": "hey guys what is going on today we're looking at another cartridge this time we're looking at space candy by Glo extracts oh this company has been doing pretty good lately like I know recently they announced they're gonna be releasing edibles and pre-rolls so if I can get my hands on those I'll definitely grab one and review it but this is a great company one thing I do like is every box has a QR code to scan so it's you know guaranteed to know if they're real or not don't leave any of that if you're interested but this space candy I'm big these carts have such a like a wide range of flavors like like I know some companies it's like they have a lot of flavors but they all kind of just taste the same this this one the flavor profiles are just crazy like this one space candy it definitely tastes like it tastes like some sort of candy I can't quite you know know what it is I can't figure it out but it tastes exactly like candy it's also like potent it's not just some filler flavor that they're adding like it seems like they actually know what they're doing can take a look at the cart you do the bottom believe it oh no it's just to see so that's good you know you wanna make sure it has that the main way to know if you're getting fake ones or not is that QR code and if you're not getting if there's no QR code on the box not a good sign man you should definitely find some other source but also on these they all have different stats and this isn't all of them there's like creativity there's a bunch of different ones on each different cartridge but any any of them that I've tried so far were very flavorful very potent I'm a big fan they're definitely doing big things soon you can tell they're growing nicely if you see one of these definitely pick one up if you like videos like this once the other cards check out my channel", "3VZZKHOjywQ": "hey what's going on guys welcome to episode 5 of reefer Rogen's reviews today I'm going to be talking about two products and two promise I'm not happy with I'm not after that all this is a buyer beware video it's gonna be a short one two products Pennsylvania medical marijuana do not purchase I don't know what's going on first let's just jump right into the first of all there are so many products out there and all this stuff is behind the counter so you can't even really see it and hold it and touch it or whatever I mean everything sealed up they'll show you things but I mean what I've noticed it's it's a crapshoot seeing if you're gonna get what you want or I mean you're definitely not getting what you paid for because this stuff is ridiculously expensive alright so first thing doesn't work and don't buy is this this is a capsule 20 capsules in here five milligrams each I took the whole bottle yesterday and it feel anything and I'm not like a crazy junkie or whatever you want to call who just you know takes as much as I can so I can't I took two pills five milligrams each so 10 nothing took another one nothing took two more nothing nothing it's a waste don't buy it I don't know what's going on here is on line they say that 50 50 milligrams will send you to the moon some people say that's not true I didn't feel anything and that was under milligrams so either that's a dud or the internet and everybody's lying about the milligrams so that's

therapy quit it cut it out nobody wants to 13% CHC nobody wants you know pills that you're gonna spend $30 on and do nothing and this right here how much I have left of this crap this is that Rando Calrissian it looks it looks decent it's dry no smell there's like there's no there's no smell and that was $42 when I've got an amazing ace folks hairpin and I love them but this one sucks don't buy it don't buy it on a positive note I will grab one thing that I got that I enjoyed and I think that you should pick up if you're into this and this is one of the only things that I've been able to really enjoy at the Pennsylvanian medical marijuana shops and that is be a vapor and I feel like I get the best hit invest hi my vapor and I've been going through a bunch of batteries don't buy the stick batteries don't buy that crap and get this thing it's $25 and alehrer at Plymouth Meeting which is like 20 minutes outside of Philly alright this guy it is a eleaf mini ice thick it's got variable temperature changer it's got a little mod so you could put on a bigger tank here five times is a really cool LED adjusted temperature it's not picking that up at all anyway so this was cool when I was hitting off the vape cartridge with the pen I was getting a big really big throat hit and I just couldn't stop coughing so then I sat the bubba kush cart down and waited until i decided on what battery i wanted to her maybe what exactly you know the problem was and how to fix it so I got a new battery set it at 3.3 volts put my bubba kush cart in there from GT I let her rip and then cough that much I don't lot of smoke but I definitely felt it and it was good and this was when I was a waiting for these pills to kick in two hours three hours nothing so don't buy remedy from Cresco do wait cause I want to buy any of the capsules from any of these places yet I mean wait wait till we get the cheap of chews and the edibles from from over out west cuz this crap I feel like people in Pennsylvania the manufacturers don't know what they're doing or just take advantage of a desperate market so anyway that's a quick quick video review about things not to buy because there's a plenty of crap out there it's like yeah unbelievable but anyway for this videos entertainment recommendation Hardy bucks netflix crazy bunch of Irish folks you know blaze up to that enjoy it's funny as hell alright take care guys", "iLAHvvGRRWA": "this is supposed to represent a joint of marijuana pot right but it's actually just paper towel sorry to burst your bubble you thought half was gonna smoke dope on a video finally you knew I got high right well hang on because today we're gonna talk about it I'm a little nervous about this video because from the beginning I've tried to steer away from controversial topics like religion politics and how to dress up Under Armour one of the reasons is because a personal pet peeve of mine is when you have these people in the media or celebrities who have an audience and they think that just because they've got an audience or a following that they are justified in basically expressing their views on religion politics everything under the Sun and life it's like they're in movies people run up to them ask them for their autograph and they think that their opinion actually matters it's like your 8th grade education is going to outweigh all the scientific research evidence all that stuff yeah really uh-huh well you guys know that I don't need any help sounding uneducated or dumb the other reason is that I have worked way too hard to develop a brand and for me to go and talk about something super controversial just because I may feel something and totally alienate a large portion of the population would be brand and alpha em suicide I just want to talk about shoes and how to eliminate swamp-ass all of this just to save it today I'm going against my better judgment to address a question that I recently got asked the question was alpha what are your thoughts on weed the follow-up question was do you have any experience with it do I have any experience with it that is just the most diplomatic way of asking me if I ever have smoked pot and so with all the debate surrounding the legalization of marijuana and the fact that I'm sure some of you are curious as to my views on recreational marijuana use I figure why not give my experience and opinion please note this is just my opinion and nothing else also note that alpha and its affiliates do not endorse the views expressed by its owner okay so the first question have I ever smoked pot and the answer is yes I have and I inhaled I first smoked pot in high school my senior year a lot of my friends were recreational stoners and I thought hey let me give it a try and see what all the fuss is about so I tried it nothing happened so I tried it again and I got high throughout high school my senior year I smoked it occasionally when I went to college my frequency essentially stayed the same I don't need any help being anymore paranoid I also didn't have money I grew up broke I went to college I was broke I had to work and so I never had money to spend on weed it just wasn't that important for me or to me god I'm so high right now so my sophomore year I'm living with four other guys there's five of us in this house well the other four of them really like tweet me not so much they were smoking it all the time they were also starting to grow it now back then I didn't know much but I did know that it was illegal and I knew that prison was not somewhere where where alpha M would flourish I would be popular but I wouldn't do well for these reasons my junior year I decided I needed to leave them and go and live by myself so I went and got a one-bedroom apartment and really that was about the end of my recreational marijuana use um side note I graduated in four years my friends took him six years to get their forestry degree but they made it so whoever said smoking pot will lead to not doing things it just might take you a little longer I liked college you know I graduated with like a 3.2 I didn't really apply myself all that much once I got into the business courses in my later college years when I got into my major that was more interesting to me but I was excited to get out of college I saw it sort of as a necessary transition to me getting out and actually doing stuff that I was passionate about and so I wanted to get done as quick as possible so I did fast forward to today I've been out of college for a while and I do not smoke marijuana I haven't touched the stuff in probably about twelve years and there are a few reasons why reason number one is I don't like the feeling of being high the older that I get the more I like being in control of my mind and in control of my actions that's the other reason why I don't drink that much anymore is because you know same sort of thing I like feeling the way that I do sober for me I'm not saying that it's bit I'm just saying for me I don't need it I don't want it I prefer being sober reason number two is I've got too much to do and I'm not saying this in a bad way I'm saying this in a good way I've got a lot to do on passion I'm excited every day I get up and I'm excited to do what I'm about to do sometimes I don't know what it is but smoking pot isn't something that's going to help me do what I need to do in my experiences when I would smoke pot I would just get lazy I just sit around watch TV and eat leading to reason number three my vanity alright I work way too hard staying in shape and taking care of my body physically and smoking pot when I do it I'm not saying that smoking pot is bad for you or that it's going to you know cause you to actually it does reduce your motivation a bit but for me it made me eat like crazy right I got the munchies super bad and so I already have a tough time not a tough time but I've got a watch where I eat or else I'm gonna balloon up to 180 pounds and so marijuana another thing where I just don't want to eat all the crappy food that would come along with it reason number four it's just not something that I care to do I think when I was younger I did it for a few different reasons one was because it was like something different you know as you're growing up as you mature you're starting to test limits and and try different things and I think for me it was part of the you know sort of the rebellion the youth rebellion where I was like ooh this is bad it's dangerous all my friends are doing it let me try because there was some peer pressure involved as well growing up I didn't I wasn't hugely influenced I say I'm not I wasn't hugely influenced I'm sure that I was to a degree influenced by my peers but you know even back in high school and beyond beyond pretty like I said I should have smoked that bomb I'm sure there was a dash of peer pressure in there all boredom sometimes when you're bored when you're idle when you're not working on something you're like what can I do now well today and where I'm at in my life and in my career I don't feel the need to you know occupy my time with destructive behaviors so to answer your question do I have an experience with pot yes I've got limited experience with pot I've never grown it I've never smoked in an abundance I've tried it it was recreational is it something for me now where I am today no is it somewhere where in five years 10 years and now I'm gonna be like give me a joint and I'm just gonna go on some stoner road trip it's possible I'm not ruling it out bringing us to the question what is my thought and what is my opinion on marijuana am i opposed to it no some of my dearest friends most successful friends do smoke the occasional bowl from now on or from time to time but it's not something that I do for me do I think it's dangerous really I think alcohol is more dangerous in the grand scheme of things way more people go drink too much get behind the wheel and then kill somebody or damage yourself or develop a dependency on alcohol versus marijuana I also know that there are amazing benefits to it medicinally you know I feel that marijuana absolutely should be legalized because you could tax the crap out of it I know that people the critics through legalizing marijuana are alike you know oh my god if you legalize it everybody's gonna be smoked and you're gonna it's gonna be anarchy well here's the deal I also believe in personal responsibility and accountability alright just because it's not legal doesn't mean that people can't get it really it's about taking control of your life if you just want to sit around and smoke bowls all day I do it alright you're less competition for me in my life succeeding you know marijuana when abused and used in excess is definitely going to affect your motivation and your success if it's something you want to do recreational I'm not gonna say not to do it I would be the biggest hypocrite in the world because I have done it but I'm saying that you need to put it in perspective you also need to be responsible you know I don't think it's the worst thing in the world there are a lot worse drugs out there that in my opinion once again everything I say is my opinion please don't take this as me saying go out and smoke pot or don't use it as an excuse of alpha smoke pot let me tell you something I was super dumb when I was young don't do as I did do as I say I am having like anxiety now thinking that I should have done this video but who knows hopefully I don't even know what is the point of this video you guys wanted that you there's like five people out there laters what smoking pot watching my videos are like wonder if alpha smokes I know sometimes I probably act stoned I am NOT however I am high on life and that is the best place to be", "FRrRPTl1-oo": "[Music] yo what's good YouTube I hope you guys are having an amazing day man I just want to record a little backward session for you guys because currently I'm at school right now and you know there's nothing better than having a good backward to yourself before class man so I went through this I've actually had this bud for a couple of days already to be honest and I've just been waiting for the right time to smoke it to you know just enjoy it because it is a special pick-up I did end up going to jungle boys and picking up some fire ash but dude you guys already know the deal when I whenever I smoke but I like to smoke gas dude so right here we got the TK lotto I'm not sure if it's focusing and hopefully it is so we got the 1/8 of TK lotto from jungle boys then I won't be doing a close-up for you guys real quick so this is the packaging so playing with fire TK lotto as you could see right here if it focuses up which is probably not going to you hold on you see I still have to fiddle with the camera and stuff dude all right so as you can see here packaging day it was a 227 19 and then Best Buy to 27 20 dude so it was just a couple of days ago it was actually like the first the first or the second when I got this so it was just barely packaged in all right so we're gonna be rolling up we're gonna be rolling up a nice little wood for you guys we got just a regular original back wood for you guys and man I'm excited we we're kind of short on time because there was a lot of traffic today so I'm hoping that we can even make this video because I got class its 8:36 I got class in exactly pretty much like an hour so I have like 30 minutes to roll this up and ooh big nugs boys they gave you some big nags in here yes so I'll be putting a close-up with my phone cuz I don't want to keep having to grab them see I don't want to keep having to grab my frickin camera and messing up the setup so I think right now that the cameras already said my stuff ready so we're gonna hopefully that's set up very quick but I'll be recording on my iPhone and then I'm just gonna be putting a little video for you guys this is recording in 60 P anyways so shouldn't be too bad give you guys a close-up of the bud how it looks like very very nice man so like this is the biggest nugget that I got and man this thing smells amazing dude let's just break open a little piece see the inside super crystals dude super crystals in there that is amazing dude I cannot wait to roll this up and smoke it wow dude amazing so we're gonna we're gonna talk a little bit and while I break this up and then you can roll this up so yeah man so jungle boys honestly has to have some of the best weed up ever I've ever tired tried because like honestly when it comes to bud I'm so damn picky like you guys don't even understand how picky I am when it comes to this because like obviously anybody can grow but anybody in the world right so why are you gonna settle for something you could get around the corner like some cheap stuff that kits probably contaminated with pesticides not really clean well or anything and when you or you can go to jungle boys or like cookies something like that you know something very well very well known from and I [ __ ] with young boys also because they're their local dude their local Los Angeles I'm from Los Angeles how can you not how can you not mess with like your local natives right am i am i right and there's people just staring at me I'm not even sure why but they probably just concerned that like oh these guys need to kill us right now but I'm chillin bro I'm just trying to smoke my smoke my good weed my very nicely cured and growing weed some older ladies I'm not even sure if you guys probably see him passed by but I'm currently out of park around school like I said and they're just staring at me they're like this kid here comes these little hooligans alright so I'm probably gonna cut this out right now because I don't want to be talking over the whole thing because it is gonna take me a while to break up but I'm gonna try to be fast cuz I only have like 20 minutes I have to go to school and still find a parking you guys know the demon on my other video the what was it the wax pickup dude oh my gosh dude the the trying to find parking is so horrible like it's not only one of the worst things but i'ma finish breaking this up and then I'm Eve you guys a little close up real quick with the camera if it focuses up if for now I'm gonna just cut it out so it smells so good though dude it smells so amazing yeah it's probably not gonna focus up let me see hopefully there you go somewhat [ __ ] is that so it's a very nice but I'm not sure how much I'm gonna try to roll like three grams in this maybe two who knows I don't know I'm not really trying to get super stoned but we're gonna do with what we got you know what's good YouTube I want to show you guys this real quick this is the new verification seal that they have on the on their new flower because they had counterfeit products and so this is just to verify that it is legit so here you can see TK lotto number 13 3.5 grams it's 1/8 and it was activated on February 28th one view as a first person so that's pretty sick hmm all right so I actually didn't even have enough time guys before school started so I was like I've rolled this up and then I had a dip out quick to go find parking because it was it was hell trying to find parking dude like again it took me like 20 minutes to find parking and I had to walk like another 10 minutes to get to class and I was just like wow so we found a cool little spot right and then there's no there's actually no wind so this should be a pretty chill sesh dude I'm actually gonna end up opening this just in case I don't want any smoke getting in the car I'm trying to be smell free but we did end up rolling a nice little a nice little backward right here man so we're gonna spark this up and see how let's see how the flavor is I actually don't know if I'm gonna keep this open because there's more win with it so Danny with the music started and everything so when you light this up and then get to smoke and see how this thing tastes man [Music] let's go boys so yeah I just got done with school and man it's like one of those times where everything is just so difficult it feels like the class is gonna be very very difficult and the criteria that they're giving us is just kind of like damn and it's hard it's hard so this thing's hitting Oh baby nice has a kind of like a very gelato tastes you could taste the gelato in there for sure amazing player on this channel we don't really focus on them we don't really focus on that much bud but when we do we get that we try to get as much fire as we can nice thing to hit in bro I Loki I hate backwards honestly only because they never seal properly dude like you honestly do I'm gonna have to end up for us so the smoke is just gonna linger in here that's whatever though so [Music] man I just love being able to enjoy days like this you know just being able to purchase some nice fine weed puffing on it after school it makes it ten times more enjoyable only because you're done doing the hard work you know you're you you can be able to satisfy yourself with something you know like if like RC that's what that's one thing that I love about smoke is like when you can set it like pretty much enjoy yourself with a nice little blunt a nice little [ __ ] bowl of wax anything dude like this is my gratification to myself I don't go out and buy myself crazy [ __ ] i buy myself good weed ain't good concentrate if you guys want to see more videos like this make sure you guys let me know man these jungle boys hitting it's currently 1243 by to go eat some food after this upload this video for you guys quick little sesh man nah this isn't this is gonna be one of those short videos like I was saying there's gonna be one of those random videos I have other two videos that are supposed to be more on a better setting and stuff like that so I love the woods man this thing another thing about the woods man is that sometimes if you don't really pro lit up perfectly into nice little cylinder you got you start getting it to run on the other side it's whatever there we're just gonna enjoy this it's gonna burn how it wants to burn I'm not gonna complain about it who cares if we goes to waste man you can always buy more you can always buy more guys but flavor profile I've never tried triangle cush so I can't really define what that tastes like but but gelato is definitely there jungleboy gelato is a hundred percent different than cookies gelato gelato 41 the [ __ ] that burner makes that shit's completely different so don't think when you're smoking this you're gonna get that that cookies gelato because that's not the case at all bro whoo how do you fix this up real quick putting a little excess paper off that should be better so a little motivation for you guys for this week man stick through it anything that you guys set your guys mind to anything is possible man I'm right now I'm going to school I'm taking on college while working full time full time college student full-time working well taking care of my family you know anything is possible you got to set your mind to it and then I'm still working on this YouTube thing you know it's been kind of slow on my part but or just the overall general aspect of YouTube I feel like the views have been slowing out but it's whatever I feel like everyone has to overcome a little hump you know this is just a hump for me they're not gonna lie though I'm just like recently I've been like man this thing is like this YouTube thing is kind of boring slow but you know you just got to stick through it man with anything I just had to remind you you just have to remind yourself when things are going so when things are going bad that you just have to give it time and not everything is gonna go a hundred percent all the time yeah look chunk of [ __ ] butter right there I have to just put that out because this thing's not even hitting you're like dude one thing I want to learn how to do and we're gonna progress together on this channel guys who's rolling woods cuz I can

throw it and end the video here whoa get that water you guys already knows man I don't see though that was enjoyable like as of late I've been feeling as if like I've been smoking too much concentrate

review and reviewing these glow cards today we got the gang Sinatra heard this glow extracts heard this is a new brand it seems pretty legit I mean I could definitely see how this is a filler or something though Mike yeah I'm sure this is a filler but uh this is like really good I guess knockoff oil but I mean in reality it's just this is just DISA lit you know it's just this lit as you guys can see you can see the bubble move but I was just in the car and I hit this at least like three or four times again it's moving really slow I know it looks like it's moving kind of fast because honestly I've had dank vapes before that move slows [ __ ] like way slower and that like doesn't even move type [ __ ] but honestly guys just because the bubble doesn't move like quick at all like I would be more sketch to that because you can add so many different things so that will just to boil and just make it stick or whatever see how I definitely be kind of skeptical of that I didn't cop a pack of these like like the 10 pack or whatever it's kind of similar to TKOs these are it's a seesaw with a white tip on it looks kind of like a fake supreme it's kind of what it reminded me of but not like the hit it's so Jupiter ring see so this is a clear ring it almost looks kind of white from the flash but I promise you guys it is clear so I know that these cards are mass-produced but do I know if they're coming from like a legit company out of California or something I don't know but I mean I'm basically just reviewing the court it so so let's go ahead and get straight into it me hitting it off see so palm and yeah that's why it's bubbly because I hit it like multiple times in the car before I made this video yeah so let's go ahead and pop it on okay and let's go ahead and hit this thing Cheers yes guys right off the bat this dank Sinatra it almost has like at the end of it I was like a berry taste to it the terpenes aren't overdid at all so it's gonna be a smooth consistent hit it's taste really good it's really good and my cats currently like beating on the [ __ ] door so that's why I kind of stopped talking consistently but uh yeah this it gets you high if you're someone that's like really used to basically fake car it's like if you're someone that's used to like terpene filled Danks or whatever then you might not like these just cuz of how smooth they hit you might feel like you're not getting high or whatever just cuz the smooth hit but I promise to you you know I was in the car and I had hit this right when I got it or whatever and I'd already hit cars from earlier but it was about like an hour and a half after I hit a cart previously and the [ __ ] crept up on me quick as [ __ ] guys like not even alive like I knew is some legit this way and I mean honestly if you look like caught on us I wish you could see it in real life I swear you can tell there's like we'll do a will in there guys yeah see the bubbles moving but it's still moving so slow like I've definitely had carts the bubble like just hasn't even moved type should like you couldn't leave it there come back 20 minutes and it's like not even moved half an inch but it really doesn't matter guys it you know it could easily added just a little bit more of something and it definitely could have made this bubble move a lot slower so that means that these are most likely just pure I definitely don't get that much Terps from this which is good but the tert Terps are there though so yeah guys just let me know if you guys want me review anything else thank these go cards damn cool once again thanks an ultra hybrid relaxation depression really a pain relief happiness giggly peace", "Qu8sV5B8Lc8": "yo its Where's Waldo from Chicago back again with another cart review not
