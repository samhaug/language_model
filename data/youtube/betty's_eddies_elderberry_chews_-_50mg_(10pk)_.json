{"yTANu5Hcl1A": "hey everybody welcome back as you can see just some natural lighting today and that is because I feel like I'm often talking about my cycle but it is because I have endometriosis so the pain excuse me for my voice but the pain can be just really bad so I didn't even feel like setting up my lighting today so I just set it up like this so welcome back but I am currently in a lot of pain so I'm gonna talk a little bit about edibles the first thing you should know is that if you've never done adipose before you need to find something that's very low dose okay your liver transforms TCA into 11 hydroxy THC which is a much more potent format of THC and it is very intoxicating so that's why oftentimes people will have like really bad trips on edibles because they think that they're taking like these small doses that dosages they think like Oh 10 milligrams whatever and then it hits like 30 so you have to be very careful if you've never done edibles before if your tolerance for edibles is really low outside of that apples are incredible for pain and that's why I'm choosing to go with them today because like I said I'm in a lot of pain and I like to be really honest with you guys so that's what I'm working with today I have some babies Eddie these are medicated shoes there are five choose each one of one flavor and each Jew has 20 milligrams of THC I'm not going to lie that's pretty strong even for me like I don't have a very high tolerance for edibles but I chose Betty studies because as you saw on the package it's vegan it's gluten-free it's dairy feet free and it's made with real fruits and veggies so like I thought that that was pretty cool that they were still taking in so many people's like dietary restrictions I do like that it's childproof I think that's important to do you have children in the home I know of course you want your stash to be somewhere secluded but it's also nice to know that it has that childproof lock on it as well so looks like I did get one of each flavor okay oh my god this smells so good I believe that this is the flavor very good thing very good things that's right cute so the papers kind of stick into it you know that's okay had a lot of practice with now and laters so it don't bother you too much I think that they need to get better paper because it's sort of like stuff to it you know I think that they could do a little bit of treatment to the paper or more treatment to the paper get just like a higher quality wax paper that is really delicious oh my god okay y'all need to sell that in popsicle form that one's really good it's a little hard to chew it definitely does have a tacky texture to it it's kind of getting stuck to my teeth for me that's a little inconvenient it's just only a little bit it's not yeah I'll only dog like half a point lemon tastes like any other lemon candy you know sourness and her bitterness which doesn't really bother me that much it is not as good as the berry very good team River so this one's called my little lemon heaven that's cute what's next next up is orange beautiful aren't you beautiful maybe a little bit a little bit the orange one does not mask the taste of the teach the at all I definitely taste cannabis it's not nasty it just has that like earthiness that you don't really expect when when you have a really well-made edible so the last one that I'll be testing is lime a good person I'm a good person are you that's disgusting okay it's this good it is disgusting and it's really sour I don't know II love lime flavor like I like limes ooh that's nasty who does next I'm not gonna spit it out because I need my medication but oh that's nasty it tastes like expired spray was consumed by a STONER pissed out and then repackaged as some new health to drink I don't like it at all it's nasty would s gross I thought the women was gonna be the worst flavor the line is hate it hate it so what I'm gonna do is take about just half more of the very good things because it was very very delicious I really really liked the flavor on this one like I said only thing that I don't really care for is the texture I do think that yes it's taffy I think it's supposed to be a little bit more fun cute recreational but it's really hard to get off the roof or your mother or your teeth Cheers oh right now my pain level is right now my pain level is actually not that bad it's maybe had a 5 out of 10 a 5 out of 10 so it's manageable earlier it was much higher like around 7 or 8 and that's why I decided let me just go ahead and try and get dress into this video but right now it's kind of cool down I think because I was moving around I keeping my mind off of it I think this will be really really helpful so yeah I'm gonna watch some Doctor Who and report that then maybe like our so that [ __ ] hey if they're dead late I still feel my cramps but there may be like like a 2 or a 3 they're still manageable the high for me it's a little bit more heady it's also like kind of sitting in my chest I noticed like the first sign that it was starting to hit with that my heartbeat started going a little bit faster for whatever reason it's odd it didn't cause anxiety or anything but that's just the first effect that I noticed and oh and then after that I just started to feel like scattered I went from not wanting to do anything today at all to feeling like ok I can manage the pain I might do a little bit of yoga so I mean I think that's dope like I could see a change already especially also a change in mood it's not necessarily that I feel productive it's just that I am in a place where it's like oh I can finally kind of take care of myself because yoga does help it wasn't heavy yoga or anything nothing fast or sweaty just kind of moving my body in a way that felt natural and in a way it I guess it was intuitive type of movement so so far I'm really appreciating it like I said I think my pain level is more like at a 3 now I think it's only about like 3540 minutes later my metabolism is really fast so edibles to hit me pretty fast I am gonna eat some food real quick as well I have the munchies so bad like edibles always do that to me like I get crazy munchies with edibles so I have the munchies really really bad so I'm gonna eat some food and watch more TV and if there's an update I'll check in later I'll see you guys soon continues to lesson because I can't function I'm trying I'm Jack I'm here present okay so I just forced myself to get up so I could check in with y'all I'm very smacked I'm very much enjoying it probably still gonna do with some more because it does feel really really good I don't want to go over the edge I am still gonna wait a little bit longer it's been about 20 minutes since my last check-in so I think that's almost an hour and almost up there it feels really good I feel like I'm gonna take a nap and I really I need to eat and I'm probably gonna go to sleep but I'm gonna say that my final score for Betty's daddy's is gonna be um I think a 4 out of 5 4 out of 5 and I am really happy with the end result again and result being I'm pain-free which was the main reason why I was using today you know so anyways thanks guys for tuning in I appreciate you supporting me if you want to support support oh if you would like to support me further you can follow me on instagram at Sahab so Lani otherwise I will see you in the next video take care and please medicate responsibly", "gwOllzEeJ7c": "how's it going everyone back again on the way back home from the dyspo walking

"-mTbsyC0-xg": "so you've decided to lose some weight and get healthier that's excellent i'm really happy for you what i don't want to happen is for you to get confused and given the wrong information and wind up losing just a little bit of weight than gaining it back or just not losing any at all and giving up in this video i'm going to tell you the 13 the unlucky 13 high sugar fruits that you need to avoid if you really want to lose a meaningful amount of weight and keep it off i'm dr ken berry a family physician with 20 years of clinical experience and i want you to lose weight and keep it off and you need to avoid these unlucky 13 fruits but wait you say there's research that shows that eating lots of fruit helps you lose weight i read an article in a health magazine or saw a television show all about this here's the problem with that all of that research that they're quoting is observational research it doesn't prove anything it just so it shows a possible correlation so when somebody says that research has proven that eating lots of fruit promotes weight loss it doesn't show that at all it doesn't show any causation whatsoever it shows a possible association there's never been a single study done on the planet earth by nutrition researchers that proves that eating lots of fruit promotes weight loss it's just a lie to help you understand why this is we're going to have a quick biochemistry lesson and i promise it's not going to be bad hang on just a second so first let's look at the sugar molecules contained in a jelly donut here they are fructose glucose and sucrose take a good look at the chemical structure now i'm going to show you the chemical structures of the fructose glucose and sucrose contained in fruit look carefully can you spot the differences no that was a trick that's the same image so not only can you not spot the difference but your body can't spot the difference either because they're the same exact molecule there's no difference and i know that there are health gurus out there that tell you that the sugar in fruit is somehow magically different magically nutritious i'm sorry that's just not true so let's go back to my jelly doughnut it looked pretty good didn't it what if because the argument is oh well fruit has magical phytonutrients and polyphenols and and antioxidants what if i took this delicious looking jelly donut and i added some polyphenols and a few vitamins and minerals and some magical phytonutrients would this jelly donut then be a health food because this jelly donut has about the same amount of sugar as a serving of many of the fruits that i'm about to tell you about in the unlucky 13 list you've probably already figured out that if you want to lose weight and keep it off you just got to cut the sugar intake the sugar that goes into your mouth every day and that's true you need to cut out the sugar that comes from jelly donuts and other crap like that but also you've got to cut back on the sugar that comes from fruit as well if you want to lose weight in a meaningfully rapid manner if you are going to eat some fruit please do it only occasionally and eat the the entire whole raw fruit okay the worst way to get your fruit is from the worst of all being fruit juices the next worst being dried fruit and then the third worst being a fruit smoothie where you grind up the entire fruit because you're still getting that magical fiber in a fruit smoothie but you're also you've broken up that fiber and so you're going to have a much higher spike in your blood sugar level from a fruit smoothie from fruit juices or from dried fruit so i would avoid those completely and eat an occasional serving of raw fresh fruit maybe in season like nature intended when the fruit's ripe you have a serving of fruit so let's dive into our unlucky 13 list of high sugar fruits number 13 on the list is nectarines and peaches are about the same they have 11.3 grams of sugar per cup and we're going to talk about all these fruits as a cup because that's what most of us would eat number 12 is apples and pears they have about 13 grams of sugar per cup number 11 on this list is oranges and oranges are probably the least bad of the citrus uh grapefruits are actually worse which i'll talk about in a second tangerines and cuties and all these uh genetically messed with citrus are much higher in sugar that's why they taste so sweet but an orange has 14 grams of sugar per cup number 10 on this list is grapes grapes are a terrible terrible fruit to eat they have 15 grams of sugar per cup and do you just eat one cup of grapes because back in the day when i used to be morbidly obese i ate more than a cup at a time number nine is grapefruit and so this is a good lesson that just because something doesn't taste tastes sweet it doesn't mean that it's not loaded with sugar a cup of grapefruit has 15.9 grams of sugar number eight on this list is kiwi i love kiwis and yes they're full of vitamin c what if i put some vitamin c in that jelly doughnut then would it be a health food no so kiwi for a one cup serving has 16.2 grams of sugar number seven on the list is pineapple i know i know it's got bromelain and all those other magical phytonutrients but it's full of sugar one cup's gonna have 16.3 grams of sugar number six on this list is cherries yes they have fat magical phytonutrients but a cup of cherries has 17.7 grams of sugar number five on this list is bananas bananas are not a health food every health guru out there will tell you to have your bananas every day for potassium this is terrible advice a cup of bananas has 18.3 grams of sugar number four on this list is tangerines remember i said earlier tangerines have 20.6 grams of sugar per cup number three on this list is mangoes yes they're delicious but one cup has 22.3 grams of sugar number two on this list is is a fruit that you've heard so much magical nutrition uh revelations about and that's pomegranate a cup of pomegranate seeds has 20 no 23.8 grams of sugar more sugar than a mango tangerine or a banana so yeah pomegranates have some vitamins and minerals but you can get those better elsewhere number one on this list of the unlucky 13 is figs raw fresh figs have 29.3 grams of sugar per cup and i love figs but i'm gonna eat more than a cup if i sit down and eat some so that's your list of 13. if you avoid these you are going to not only not miss out on any vitamins or minerals or anything else your body needs because you're going to get those from other real whole foods that i talked about in my other videos on this youtube channel you've got to cut the sugar if you want to meaningfully burn up the fat and get rid of it and keep it going forever if you'd like to get more videos like this where i

introduce you guys to our uh brand new product which are delta eight um 50 milligrams per gummy uh edibles these are some delta eight gummies that we just brought out um they're assorted fruit flavors right now you can get a in a thousand milligrams so 20 in a pack or if you've never tried um delta 8 and you want to try it but you don't want to buy a whole bunch this is a nice little 250 milligram sample pack you get five gummies in there um so far all of our feedback on the gummies has been pretty positive uh flavor-wise they taste almost like candy um and just to give you an idea i went here into our little company stash so you can kind of see the size of them and they're uh definitely got some sugar on them and uh they're they're really fairly tasty for a delta eight gummy you'll find a lot of them are a little bit bitter um these don't tend to be they're made from a really high grade delta 8 distillate that's infused into them if you're new to gummies be careful because edibles tend to be a little bit uh different than smoking so if you take a gummy it can take a good 30 minutes on the low side to 90 minutes on the high side until you get the full effects uh just so be aware of that so you don't overload and take too much so and the other thing with your uh delta eight products is if you're experienced with edibles from a marijuana perspective basically uh the the delta eight is like half the potency so you know if you're used to taking a 10 milligram uh thc9 gummy then you need a 20 of these and so on so you know you're used to taking 20 milligrams and you need 40 milligrams so we came up with these 50s they're they're potent they're they're strong um but you can easily just cut one in half and uh and get half the dosage all right if you have any questions um any comments um we're always here to help as well as listen to your feedback uh get in touch with us at the website and we'll talk to you soon you", "2xbWaBe-_hk": "i'm emily osterberg founder of baking betty's here at the mall of america in bloomington minnesota and we use premier's new edible ink printer eddie for printing all our logo cookies baking buddies i started it in california i love to bake growing up and i just i would bring cookies to work and i thought hey what a great idea i should start a business doing cookies even though i've never worked in food before so i started doing wholesale and stuff like that and i started out with one cookie flavor now we have 26 different flavors and i moved back to minnesota a year ago and opened at the mall of america where we are today so we were getting a ton of requests to do custom logo cookies custom images on cookies prior to using the eddie we used these edible frosting sheets where you had to print individually and you had to peel them off one by one i was trying to you know research different products and try different products to you know find the the best solution for us with the eddie it just is a better quality product it saves us a ton of time because you're actually printing right to the cookie the turnaround time to package is just it's huge for us it definitely helps that it's nsf certified because we're supposed to only use nsf certified products with food it's very important that it's a stainless steel a food grade printer just it's very easy to use so you can just pop the cookies right onto the eddy take them off it's easy to clean it's just a very seamless process it just prints i mean it looks like literally it just printed off of a printer you would never be able to tell that this is you know printed on an edible you know with edible ink on a cookie like it just the quality of it is just so amazing recently we did a project for 800 of the logo cookies and we used eddie for the first time with that large of a project and it went super smooth such an amazing process every single cookie all 800 looked exactly the same the images were crisp and perfect the eddie has been amazing for us with these large orders i feel like anybody could learn how to use the eddie printer in a matter of like a day so it was very very easy seamless process i think the biggest thing was just adjusting like the cookie size and making sure you have the icing right and once you got that down i think it's pretty quick and easy so it just creates an all-around better product for the customer and saves us a lot of time", "g0gEYgeIVbE": "[Music] what's up youtube what's right dumb dumb coming back at you again what's up my life is here [Music] going justin belmont 66. they've got these in bed now 66.

to be trying some edibles and I know this is crazy because we don't really review edibles much on this channel now really quick before we get into this let me kind of explain why I don't really do a whole lot of edibles and it's not because I don't like edibles I love edibles okay the reason that you guys don't see a whole lot of edibles on this channel is mainly for the fact that here in the state of Oregon edibles is limited to 50 milligrams for recreational so anybody 21 and up you are limited here in the state of Oregon to only 50 milligrams now you can buy multiple you can buy multiple but that can get rather expensive okay that can get rather expensive especially when some of these edibles are like 15 20 25 bucks okay so 50 milligrams that's weak sauce I agree with you I know what anybody's gonna say in the comments section on this video they're gonna be like 50 milligrams that's [ __ ] that's weak sauce blah blah blah blah blah blah don't take it out on me please that is just what the state limits us and I can't really help that okay medical gets a hundred milligrams so if you're a medical marijuana patient you got your medical card you can get access to a hundred milligrams but that's still not much better okay because a few years ago before 2015 you could get like thousand milligram if not more you know like I had a 16 a hundred milligram edible lollipop once and it was phenomenal okay so before that before the legalization happened we used to be able to get all different kinds of stuff and they were very well priced so without further ado let's get into this edible review alright so for this review I have here this awesome rice krispie treats all right they are bite-size as you guys can see I rice krispie treats now I'm multiple because they're 50 milligrams each I have three here they were about six dollars for wreck or a recreational a little bit cheaper for medical of course so I bought three of them that's about a hundred and fifty milligrams total I still know that that's not a whole lot okay I know there's tons of us out there that'd be like like $500,000 but but I mean like he's not bad right not bad I could have just got one and been like hey guys here's my 50 milligrams it's gonna be great all right no but I got all three so I can at least feel something another reason why you don't see me do a lot of edible refuses because 50 milligrams 100 milligrams for me stuff like that it's not I'm not gonna feel it okay I have a high extremely high tolerance okay so I need those like four or five six hundred milligram edibles in order to really really feel it that's um I believe there was a person who wants to comment in my last edible video I did a long time ago and they said something like oh he got so high he forgot to come back and tell us how it was which is not true because the truth is is I kind of felt it a tiny bit a little bit so you know what I mean like for somebody who has a low tolerance for somebody who doesn't smoke a lot or doesn't take a lot of edibles stuff like that 50 milligrams is gonna is going to be right where you need okay 50 milligrams is gonna do the job if you're like a beginner or if you're somebody who has extremely low tolerance 50 milligrams is all you need but for us like me who dab all day long and smoke and all that kind of [ __ ] I have a high tolerance I have to at least get three of these even to feel like the slightest bit of a buzz okay so here we go we're gonna go ahead and get into these now these are the can of Krispies cannabis treats bite size 50 milligrams they take it says it takes about 60 minutes for activation that kind of ranges depending on the person depending on your body size stuff like that that could range that could be 30 minutes all the way up to an hour and a half of edibles to kick in anywhere in between there right I love that these are bite-size because I'm not one of those people that like to eat a whole [ __ ] [ __ ] ton of sweets just to get especially a small little milligram as 50 milligrams okay so I like that their bike size I really do if they would have not been bite size if it would have been like a big-ass chunk for only 50 milligrams I would have complained I would already instantly be downing this this review but the fact that their bite size is even better oh you can chase the canvas not much it's not like a strong taste but you can faintly taste it you can faintly taste it mmm all right let's get the rest these [Music] [Music] oh all right so I've eaten all three all right it's gonna take a little bit to kind of feel them if if I feel it because again it's only 150 milligrams which I should feel something right like you should feel something even if you do have a high tolerance should feel a little bit of something you know what I mean yeah that's just my opinion in my thoughts these were good they tasted great they're Bitesize I love it the fact that they're only six dollars to me they could be a little less than that that's the only kind of complaint that I have here with this product is the fact that six dollars for bite size little edible fifty milligrams it's alright it's alright it's a little push in it but it's alright it's still affordable okay Joe only because I remember back in the day you used to be able to get fifty milligrams for five dollars or less okay you know you know 100 milligrams ten bucks or less you know and so on so forth you know but not bad a taste great tastes like a good rice krispies it's got a little bit of an aftertaste to it you could definitely kind of taste the lead on the aftertaste like right now I can still kind of taste it a little bit like I could tell that it wasn't all just rice krispies hi if I was somebody who never had cannabis before I'd be like did you use something different in this recipe kind of tastes a little odd you know little little tinge maybe yeah you know that would be my reaction to because like I said the aftertaste you can taste a little bit however it's not a super strong pungent weed taste it's not one of those edibles that you'll eat and go oh you know what I mean it faintly tasted it's very mild okay overall it's a good edible it's definitely something I'll give a thumbs up for I will if it affects me if if I can feel a good high off of it if I can feel any kind of a high off of it really I will come back and do kind of like a follow-up for this if not then just know that I pretty much just did this review for the taste and you know the overall just checking it out you know what I mean it's not so much of the high alright because I like I said like I explained early in the video I need a little bit more than that for me personally and again this is just for me personally okay others it might not need that much and then other people might need a lot more so it depends on you depends on your tolerance and it depends on you know where you're at with your cannabis usage all right so much love guys I hope this video is somewhat entertaining and informational if you guys like this channel if you guys like this video if you like me hey remember to give it a big thumbs up smash that like button support this channel and please guys please please please consider subscribing to my channel right here at the Andrew lamb the one and only and much love guys I hope you guys all have a very blessed very positive day or night wherever you're viewing this video from and until next time alright so it's been about an hour and 45 minutes and I'm feeling a little Spacey feeling it very mildly it's kind of a little relaxing it's a little creeping up if you will but I thought hey hey what's up the stakes a little bit all right shall we shall we up the milligrams now really quick let me just apologize for this being kind of an extra long video I'm sorry about that I will try my best to fast-forward through the parts of me eating so we'll kind of shorten the length now but anyway I got three more here now these are the cocoa ones okay so they have the regular ones these are the cocoa ones Cocoa Krispies and I got another three so it's another 150 for a grand total of 300 milligrams which some people might be like I am that's nothing that's that's weak sauce ba ba ba ba ba which yeah you know it is but whatever what we're gonna do it hmm so alright first one up here we go now again the same company this is the same company these are just the cocoa ones 50 milligrams each bite-sized edibles all right and you got to make sure that you get like all of them I'm sure all the little chunks and pieces don't let anything little pieces go [Music] you [Music] all right so there it is 300 milligrams I'm gonna come back in another hour hour and a half or so and I'll let you guys know how the effects are which should be a lot greater shouldn't be like super high it's not gonna be like uh like a Drunken level of high you know where I must like oh I'm so uh you know it's not gonna be like that however it should be you know I should be able to feel it pretty good should get a good you know nice feel from it so we will be back with you guys here at about an hour yeah about an hour hour and a half and we will see how this works all right so it's been about another hour and a half and feeling all right feeling all right a little a little more Spacey a lot more relaxed to feel nice and relaxed I could definitely fall asleep right now I could tell you that right now edibles are great for that in my opinion if you ever need something to help you fall asleep just load up on some edibles don't don't take too much okay don't take too much know your limits okay know what works best for you but I do love edibles I do love hi milligram edibles I should say and they're all all right there all right it sucks see if it takes so many just to get you know the milligrams that I took or more like that's crazy that you have to eat so much like if you're somebody who's just taking edibles you're not even smoking you're not even dabbing you're not even doing any of that other stuff and you're just taking edibles like this you're probably gonna be diabetic after the first like eight to 12 months okay I'm just saying just saying with how many you have to buy to get the correct milligrams that you need that's crazy okay anyway I hope you guys found this video entertaining much love please smash that like button show that support and hey if you'd like to see more content just like this thing consider subscribing to my channel right here at the Andrew lamb

them [ __ ] go hey are we salad clouds around", "uVrVyKUO5_c": "[Music] what's up friends welcome back today we have a little bit different video than you guys are used to so instead of giving you guys a exact follow the steps instructions this is gonna be more like you guys come along with me when i experiment so i like to try out different ways um that we can make different treats and a lot of times it turns out sometimes it doesn't um but i kind of just go with the flow and see what will happen i feel like no matter what you can always salvage your treats into something it may not be what you intended it to be but it'll always be delicious so for an example my intentions with this video was to create infused jolly ranchers and for them to be hard candy now that did not work out they ended up being a soft candy so i just kind of went with it and i thought it might be cool for you guys if you want to see my thought process and how i kind of decide to go with things when they go wrong so please let me know if you guys enjoyed this type of video or if you'd rather it be um here is like the guaranteed results from this step-by-step process [Music] all right let's get started here's what you're going to need some jolly ranchers or any hard candy that you enjoy some coconut oil or tincture citric acid and some infused sugar or regular sugar unwrap your jolly ranchers and then separate them into colors that you think would mix well once melted together i'm doing blue and green and the purple and reds now i'm setting up my double boiler and adding in my pink and red jolly ranchers they're mostly pink and i am using a total of 20 jolly ranchers now i'm adding in some lecithin and i'm just using my spatula because it is really hard to get off a spoon and then putting that back in and mixing it up now because i'm just doing a little experiment i decided that chamoy would taste really good with this jolly rancher mix since it's mostly all watermelon so i'm adding in two tablespoons of chamoy and then two tablespoons of infused sugar of course you could use regular sugar or you don't have to use chamoy i mean this is totally very flexible you can kind of flavor this to how you want you can put whatever creation you can come up with in there pretty much now i'm just waiting for this to melt over the double boiler it does take a long time i probably took about a half an hour to get to this point now that it's mostly melted i'm going to add in my coconut oil so i decided to add in three tablespoons there wasn't an exact reason for why i chose this amount it's just kind of like i said an experiment to see how it goes so we're going to mix that in and the oil is pretty tricky to combine with the mixture so i am going to use a whisk and just whisk that up really good just do it for a few minutes and it will come together very nicely and there is no problems getting this to emulsify just be persistent with stirring it until everything is nice and smooth like this so at this point it's pretty much ready to be refrigerated and like i said you guys can add whatever you like so if you want them to be very sour add some citric acid if you want them to have any sort of other flavor you know add it in anything is probably going to be just fine so then i now that this is all mixed together i'm going to pour it into a little dish because this is a smaller amount i'm just using a smaller dish so that i can get them to be thicker instead of very thin if they were spread out along a larger container this container had some grooves so i just filled it with some tinfoil so i could get the bottom to be flat and then place some wax paper inside of there um i had some issues with the wax paper if i was to do this again i would use parchment paper i just didn't have any on hand so then i'm going to pour this mixture into my little lined container and then i'm going to put it in the fridge to set i also just popped the little bubbles with a toothpick and then kind of just dropped it a bit to release any air bubbles um in the end because this turned out to be more like a starburst i didn't need to do that because i could have just squished it or molded it down with my finger okay so here it is after being in the fridge for probably about a half an hour and i was ready to score it because i was wanting these to be hard candy and you need to score these earlier on in the process so i'm just measuring it out and attempting to score it but it doesn't really hold my shape so i put it back in the fridge for another half an hour or so and then took it back out to score again and then i also sprayed my knife with some cooking spray so that it wouldn't stick now it's very malleable like i can reshape it really well and cutting it was fine but this was when i realized that this probably was no longer going to be a hard candy and it was going to be a soft candy so i cut all these shapes and then put them back in the fridge but they were kind of like they kept on molding back together so point being is that it needs to stay in the fridge a lot longer so i put them back in and then worked on making a coating for them so for these i thought they'd be absolutely delicious with a tahini coating so i started with one tablespoon of icing sugar one tablespoon of infused sugar and one tablespoon of tahini and then i tasted that and i felt like it needed more sugar so i added in some more sugar as well as some citric acid to make it more sour and then i tasted it again and it still felt like i wanted it to be quite a bit sweeter so i just added in the rest of my sugar and you guys there's no like exact measurements you just do this to what you think tastes good more sugar less sugar whatever you like and then i'm also going to grind this down in a food processor just to make it a little bit finer to coat my candies and then i poured it back into my container now these have been in the fridge for over an hour and while they were in there i'd go in with my knife and kind of just cut them so you can see they're still very squishy and like a soft candy nothing like a hard candy so that's a texture we're working with here now i'm just peeling them all off of this wax paper and you can see that it's stuck to the back of them quite a bit it was easy for me to get off but if i had used parchment paper there wouldn't have been that issue anyway so if you were to do this use parchment paper and not wax paper and then i separated them all and then put them into my tahin sour sugar coating and shook them all up then i put them back into the container as i was taking them out i could tell that they were very soft so i knew that these weren't going to be the type of gummies that were going to hold or not gummies the soft candies that were going to hold their shape outside of the fridge now that i've made these i've realized that in order to keep them out of the fridge we're going to need to add gelatin so let me know if you guys would like to see me do a recipe like that um but they look so good and of course i had to try one and they were so tasty like the watermelon jolly rancher chewiness with the sour sugary tahin coating and then the chamoy and the watermelon like i don't even know how i can explain how delicious that was but like so good now we're gonna do our batch of blue and greens using our tincture um these take forever to melt oh my goodness so yeah i left them on here for probably like a half an hour and then they finally were melting and make sure you guys are checking on the water in your double boiler i found that my water was going down fast and i constantly had to re-add it so just make sure you have enough water in there all the time okay so now after this has melted quite a bit i'm going to add in my tincture so we're doing one two three tablespoons and then to compensate for the extra liquid we're adding in three tablespoons of sugar i'm just using regular sugar because i don't know why i think i ran out of infused sugar anyways we're mixing that in and now we're going to add in some lecithin and i'm going to use my whisk to get that since we need to whisk this all together to get everything to emulsify so just stir that all up and get it to mix together and then i want these to be really sour because sour blue raspberry green apple like that's a good combination am i right okay so citric acid mix that in i had the candy thermometer in here because i was trying to make hard candy so we had to bring it to a certain temperature to allow that to happen um but in the end i realized it was not going to reach that temperature so i decided these are also going to be soft juice um which means i'm going to also add in some coconut oil so i'm just doing one tablespoon of this i could probably have added more but i just wanted to try using a little bit less since the three in the last recipe was a little bit soft now i'm adding in even more citric acid because i want these to be super sour like i've said before these recipes are extremely flexible if you're just making these for yourself it's not going to hurt if it's not exactly perfect every time if you're making these for other people then that's a different story but it's always fun to experiment um this is my favorite part of making all these treats okay now that we have the coconut oil in there we're mixing that all together and it's coming together very very nicely we just have to keep whisking it to make sure it's all mixed together you can see it looks nice and smooth and now we're pouring it into the same type of system the little container with the wax paper again because i don't have any parchment paper and then i'm putting it in the fridge i had intended to come back for this an hour or so later but it ended up sitting in the fridge for a couple of days because i got too busy to continue with them so now here we are with our refrigerated mixture slab i took it out of the fridge and then i let it sit for about 20 minutes to kind of soften it up so you can obviously tell the fact that it softens up at a warmer temperature means these need to stay in the fridge again it would u uh we would need to use gelatin to make them stay stable at um or to hold their shape at room temperature and if you guys are interested in me doing a video like that let me know this is just an experiment like i said a few times already so anyways so i just cut them up into these little shapes and then i put them in a container with some sugar and a little sprinkle of citric acid shook them up and then i put them back in the fridge so that was all we needed to make both of those and they were so good now let's talk about how they turned out taste wise okay so i'm just eating them while i'm talking so i can explain so first of all don't put them in the freezer because they'll get kind of wet on the outside just keep them in the fridge this green one it's sour green apple and blue raspberry the flavor is literally amazing they go so well together and the sourness is perfect [Music] that is really really good like i really like that it is very soft though it's not as chewy as like a starburst it's much much softer like very like your teeth just like go right into it so i mean maybe if you eat them in the fridge it'd be a little bit chewier but i let mine sit out um so i could see how well they would do i think it's about 24 degrees in my apartment so if the air conditioning was on i probably could get away with keeping them out of the fridge okay now we're going to try the watermelon cherry chun way one so it definitely is mostly watermelon only a little bit of cherry and we can really taste the watermelon chamois which one is really good i think the only thing i would change to the watermelon one is to do more of a sugar coating like i did for the green one um i just kind of want that like really like sour sugar to contrast the sweetness of the watermelon chamois um it is pretty oily but only on your fingers you can't really like taste the oiliness overall i rate the watermelon choi one seven out of ten and then the green one i would literally rate like a nine point five out of ten it was like so so so good i think it's gonna put some citric acid in it as well but both of them are good if i could do anything different aside from the sugar i would also add gelatin so they could be shelf stable but i don't mind keeping in the fridge anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did

our compounds out of.  Here is a plant in front of us that is known in Central America by the Spanish speaking Indian they call the Sauco, is a plant that in the berries we find that the mineral of iron is found, iron phosphate iron phosphate is found in these berries and these berries are responsible for us reversing a lot of diseases that sits in the blood they contain iron phosphate. This plant the Sauco when it sends its roots into the ground it converts that oxide mineral into a liquid digestible substance, known,  the process is known as iontopherosis or the conversion from a solid to a liquid and here Mother Nature has converted iron which is solid into a berry for you to enjoy. And over here we find now that the flower, unlike the berries that contain iron phosphate the flower now is a different chemistry here we have potassium phosphate when the children here in Central America has fever rest assured that the mother would come here and ask me to give them some of the flower of the Sauco to remove the fever because it means that inflammation is sitting some place in the body and this is extremely effective because of its high content of iron and potassium phosphate the SAUCO  ", "KAycqbqNaes": "[Music] thanks for coming back to my channel my name is Karen a and

during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings

had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven

gummies from the company creating better days and i gotta say the name that they chose for this line better delight is great because it definitely delivers there now for those of you who don't know as of the recording of this video delta 8 thc is a fully legal form of thc that is derived from hemp it's about one third to one half the potency of delta 9 thc which is its close cousin that's founded marijuana and the experience that you should have with it when used appropriately is purely relaxing it kind of strips away the potential for the paranoia or whimsical type of high that you can find with delta 9. also no munchies there's none of that insatiable appetite boost that you get with delta 9 a lot of times now it can have a little bit of an appetite stimulating effect but it's really nowhere near what people would define as the munchies i've just found myself getting slightly more snacky sometimes when i use delta 8. now i always like to give kudos to companies that can put out a product with excellent design and packaging and these guys definitely deliver on that as well it just looks so clean and professional and trustworthy that's the big thing because this industry there's so much out there that is not trustworthy in the hemp and cannabis industry these guys i have been carrying them here in lovely leaf naturals for a long time before they even made delta eight gummies carrying their gummies carrying some of their other products and i have never seen anything but absolute professionalism from creating better days and this product is no exception these are 10 milligram gummies so each gummy is going to have 10 milligrams of delta 8 thc in it their blue raspberry as i mentioned before and then there's 60 of them in the big jar they're also doing a 30 count jar but yeah full transparency i do carry creating better days in my shop and on the website so i've been carrying them for a while and they've never given me a reason to doubt them so you can get these over at the lovely leaf naturals website loveleafnaturals.com i'll put a link down in the description they're 49.99 for the 60 count jar we don't have the 30 count jars in just yet i don't know what those will be going for i think either 30 or 35 once we actually get them in the shop but yeah you can get these right now but stick around until the end of the video and i'm going to give you guys a discount code to get 15 off your first order of these so the first thing you're going to see whenever you open these up is that there is a seal across the top it's a tamper resistant seal that makes sure that you know if anybody has opened this jar before you it also says potent use responsibly and we will talk a little bit more about that in a minute but when you open it up you are going to see these square blue raspberry gummies they've got a sugar coating and they are delicious and i'm going to try one right now and yeah they're so yummy i hate that i can only eat a couple of them i kind of want to eat the whole jar now the consistency of them is a little gooier than i generally like my gummies but honestly this is not supposed to be eaten like candy so when people get into the flavor or the the consistency of gummies like this that always kind of bothers me i know i just talked about how good they are i mean it's not a bad thing for them to taste good but honestly you shouldn't worry too much about that because this is more like you're taking a vitamin than you're sitting down to have a snack for example the gummies that we manufactured under our brand name friendly hemp here in the store they taste extremely hempy because there's about 40 milligrams of full spectrum hemp extract in each of our little tiny gummies there's not much room for anything else so we don't overload them with sugar we just let them taste hempy but that's not me knocking these guys at all these gummies are amazing i wouldn't change a thing i'm just making the point that when it comes to somebody buying gummies in the cbd space or the delta 8 space or even the delta 9 space don't worry so much about the consistency or the flavor because you're probably just gonna be eating one maybe two and then you're not gonna eat anymore for a good long time now getting back to the subject of using this responsibly i always tell people start low and go slow whether they're here in my shop or they're asking me questions personally about cbd and delta 8. delta 8 you really really really want to start at the lowest dose i would recommend only taking one of these gummies if it's your first time using it waiting several several hours just to see what it's going to do and then maybe upping the dosage next time you want to take it i would not crank down two three of these the first time you've ever taken it now just to give a personal anecdote about this the first time i ever tried delta eight i was woefully ignorant of the potency of this stuff i was using an oil tincture instead of the gummies but i took about 30 milligrams equivalent to about three of these gummies 30 milligrams waited about four hours nothing happened i have a really really slow metabolism that was a big contributing factor to this but then i decided okay well i feel nothing i'll take another 30 milligrams see what happens about an hour hour and a half later is when it all decided to hit at once i was in the shop at that point and i ended up having to close down the shop an hour early i was laid out on our couch i threw up three times in the bathroom and i was just a mess i called my wife and i said you have to come get me because i cannot drive home and i was fully there mentally but my body just gave up on me so i tell people that as a cautionary tale start low and go slow whether you're taking it in a gummy form like this using a vape using an oil tinger using flour whatever you're doing start low and go slow and then just like every other cannabis product that we carry here in

they also sent a [ __ ] snack for the munchies right there you know that there is this week's order from grass cheese when I was showing you guys the gummy is there that you know when I showed you the front that I turned it around to show you the back I didn't realize you guys weren't seeing how much THC is in there but if you turn it one more time you looked out at the very bottom there not so much THC is in there got some spaghetti some Parmesan cheese some salad with some French salad dressing wash that down with a cold Molson Canadian and that's supper oh my flock off to wash my meat cigarette I'm gonna try one of these [ __ ] thingamabobs that came out of the grass chief order so it'll be broken up because I dropped it on the basement floor okay and you severe hurt you know then it's okay would there's a billion better things for the munchies in this [ __ ] smoking weed and the end of all like dry you know this isn't gonna [ __ ] help anything it's only gonna make matters worse came with two in the pack I'll save the other one for Dona she went to take Charlie for a walk I'm pretty sure she said she was going to what you call it drink one of those hot chocolates the 50 milligrams 50 milligrams of THC usually she only does I think 25 milligrams per night like over edibles at so 50 milligrams let's double what she's used to we'll see what happens Canada Post is working again they're finally [ __ ] moving so I decided today to order up that external piece for the GoPro and [ __ ] Donna found some little microphone on line for me there looks like it'll go nice so order that up too but Canada Post is pretty backed up I bet so I don't know how long it's going to take to get here so yeah yeah okay the water is boiled dollars gonna pour it into the cup which doesn't fly all over the floor do you want any milk or anything okay we'll let that cool down a little bit and then we'll come back to us tastes the weed you mean the THC you teach you can taste the THC in there in just a little bit don't know what else right now but yeah it's good well we'll come back in a little while when the when the effects start to uh why well there's a first time for everything isn't it hey we'll we'll come back when the wind starts to kick in [ __ ] you have for that house it asked you how you feel but I already know I think everybody watching those could you were laughing already I wonder what the [ __ ] you're laughing at that's how long you're laughing you were looking over here laughing and I was one yeah the whole time we'll even look at the tape later we're not the tape the video you know people just want to know how you feel after taking that I think they can tell it you're happy if somebody who's having aches and pains and it took that if you having a good maybe having a good old time what you can hurt yourself more sure if your wrist was broken and it wasn't a lot of pain and then you have like a lot and the people away so you start like using your wrist for that's probably not a good thing if you have a broken wrist and you just start using it I think if you had a sore wrist you would know that your wrist had problems [ __ ] you just [ __ ] insect [ __ ] you or something [ __ ] right in view there you wouldn't feel the pain because if it landed on you slapping it off and running it wouldn't get a chance to bite yeah I know how you are edibles make you want to sit and not move around too much the tuna ate I think the guys that smoked it either be going anywhere I think everybody get pretty lazy yeah sit by the [ __ ]

there there's nobody to get around over here's like like what the [ __ ] what maybe the person that put it in the microwave I think it depends on the voltage and wattage or whatever of your microwave I don't think it's two minutes for every microwave obviously not our microwave so probably didn't need the whole two minutes hope we don't break a [ __ ] - is chewy chewy alright whoa that little soft

review i have with me a can of nitro iced macchiato from southern tier brewing company lakewood new york this is an imperial white milk stout and comes at 10 abv as you all know i love these southern tier brewing companies blackwater series i've never seen this one this one is new to me i had the creme brulee i've had the hot chocolate i've had the s'mores i need this one and i found this one so i was really excited shout out to blue ice he does beer reviews too on youtube and that is the first place i saw this one and i think he's the first one and the only one that i've seen do it so i'm pretty excited about it his review is good this review is probably going to be pretty good i'm excited i can't i can't help it i'm sorry i'm getting lost in my thoughts because i just can't wait to try this beer can art on this beer is actually the exact opposite it's like parallel universe right it's kind of simple kind of like the rest of southern tier stuff only everything's flipped right it's just the exact opposite it's still nothing crazy or fancy just basic just it's a lighter color the other ones are black with a little bit of light in it this one's all light with a little bit of black in it that's enough the can art now you know what it's time for we're gonna crack this open so i can tip it upside down and pour it look at it watch the bubbles cascade which is so awesome and smell it taste it and get you your rating there's that gurgle huh i love this i love these nitro pores i can already smell the coffee look at that that's big and watch the beer rise in it this is such a cool thing to watch i love this man that coffee is so strong i can just smell it now this actually isn't going as fast as i thought it's kind of slowed down right anyway let's get a smell on this let's see what we got here yeah this just smells like starbucks right i'm not a huge coffee person i'll get an americano or drink black coffee and the occasional frappuccino when i'm feeling like i deserve a treat or a reward but yeah this smells like big b or starbucks i've never had a macchiato or at least i don't think i have but yeah this just smells like coffee i'm actually pretty excited about it let's give it a taste as always on half ass beer review we go little drink big drink cheers everybody man this is awesome super creamy strong coffee afterthought on your taste all while still being creamy or foam you know that foam that creaminess a little bit of caramel in here man this is good this is very good i'm gonna take another drink and give you a rating very good might be an understatement yeah this beer is great southern tier doesn't let down with this black water series all of them are just phenomenal sure some are better than the others this might be close to one of my favorite ones just just because of how much of a coffee flavor there is to it i love coffee just coffee in general i love the smell of coffee love the taste of it i got a new beard oil with coffee scent to it yeah this beer is great i'm giving this one a 5.6 just an absolutely great nitro beer like a nitro what stout yeah milk stout i mean just everything about this is great uh just the smell of it and the taste they just line up perfectly and just knock it out of the park actually i'm not surprised because southern tier does this with all their nitro stout and most of their beers it's actually a really solid brewery whenever you see something from them you should probably pick it up just to try it and you'll probably like it but that's going to do it for this episode of half ass

thank you guys bye", "hhTPYdjGxP0": "oh my god you guys all wanna be in my video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys for watching do not forget to Like comment and subscribe but okay but yeah let me show you guys what my sister's doing because it looks so fun oh so good were the beers oh goodness she's looking at

Cheers", "FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah

can whirlpools suck ships boats or even barges in or do they pose a danger only for human beings who fall into them in these shots you can see how the rafter Steve Fisher got sucked in by a powerful current that the athlete had the bad luck to encounter when descending the Congo River as part of a red bull sponsored competition Fisher a world-class athlete had a run-in with the mighty rapids of this African River yet this was not among the most dangerous whirlpools that exist on our planet and far from the most dangerous whirlpools and that are theoretically possible don't try at home what one of the world's top drafting pros barely managed to escape from and that was even with the help of others there are whirlpools much more dangerous than along the Congo River some of these vortexes in the water pose a threat not only to people would even heavier objects a boat a yacht a ship a barge even giant vessels can face destruction if any of them separately or together are sucked into one of these real aquatic monsters but let's start by taking a look at whirlpools themselves at what they are how they arise and what real danger and destructive force they pose no not like that whirlpools are not specially stirred up by anyone rather they form in their own due to internal processes currents in a body of water collide and merge and thereby they create circular flows that are made stronger by the turbulence as if the waters being turned inward if there is a deep hole under the water and above this hole tons of water are flowing from opposite directions towards each other a vortex is created and this is what a world actually is let's try to helpfully illustrate this principle with oddly enough a clockwork mechanism as we explained you'll understand why we chose precisely this as an example you can see how the tirelessness appears in a clockwork mechanism drive one another on by rotating as they constantly grip on one another with their teeth each of these gears rotates only because the entire ensemble of rotates together they never slowed down by friction against one another but rather they work together in mutual movement now imagine that these are not little gears at all but water currents the flow of water when there is turbulence and currents moving towards each other will rotate from the impact just like these gears the principle of torque is basically analogous only water unlike the gears in a clockwork mechanism there's more than just rotate and if there's the necessary turbulence it'll form a funnel that sucks things in thus for a whirlpool to arise in nature we need the following a sufficient mass of moving water the presence of currents moving in opposite directions within this mass and a pit that's deep enough to generate a flow that swells inward generally the fastest whirlpools are those of mountain rivers that can sometimes reach speeds of several miles per hour however mountain rivers do not have an amount of water sufficient to suck truly large objects in people and animals often perish in these currents but larger objects for example ships are just too big for mountain rivers to affect for those big objects you need to bring out the heavy artillery the salt Stroman whirlpool norway today is perhaps the world's most powerful naturally forming well pool it arises four times per day precisely every six hours in a straight that is one point eight six miles long and 492 feet wide and connects to salt Jordan and the skier stat fought with the Barents Sea in this hellish funnel there are gigantic volumes of water that move at unimaginable speeds over a single cycle the salt straw Manuel pulled circulates billions of cubic feet of liquid all in a speed of up to 23 miles per hour if a person fell into such a whirlpool then sadly the chances for survive aslim and even if a whole boat fell in it's believed that the salt straw and whirlpool does not pose a risk to large vessels but to avoid any tragedy traffic in the Strait is scheduled to avoid the times when the dangerous Norwegian whirlpool comes to life the Maelstrom a well pulled famous from Edgar Allan Poe's short story a descent into the Maelstrom similar whirlpools are found in Norwegian waters in the Norwegian Sea these are less brutal than the salt Stroman whirlpool but much more unpredictable and sneaky and so they are no less dangerous indeed they can be even more dangerous Maelstrom flotation barely ever exceeds eight miles per hour but these whirlpools are dangerous because of how sudden they can appear the rocks the currents everything here is set up in a way that makes it impossible to predict when the vortex will arise and how fast it will spin and when water will begin to be sucked into it maelstroms just like the salt storm and whirlpool can form several times per day but there's no rhyme or reason to their formation they might appear two or three times a day they might appear five or six times in such cases are known infamously people have been killed or severely injured in maelstroms on a number of occasions maelstroms are capable of overturning even small fishing boats and such incidences have happened today ships prefer to give these Norwegian monsters a wide berth in order to avoid tragedy the Naruto whirlpools these come in at number three in their danger to life and limb and are rightly called the Japanese wonder nowhere else in the world is there such a large number of powerful whirlpools in such close vicinity to one another it's practically impossible to escape them if you break free from one you immediately fall into another these vortexes spend only in the Naruto Strait under a bridge close to the city of Naruto three or four whirlpools conform at the same time on average every six hours the average diameter of each of the Naruto whirlpools is 50 feet but the diameter constantly changes depending on the frequency and intensity of the Evan flow in the Strait the peak activity of the Naruto well pulls occurs during the spring flood at that time these whirlpools grow to a diameter of 65 feet in the speed at which they rotate reaches as high as 13 miles per hour the Naruto whirlpools are a magnificent sight but only at a safe distance getting up close and personal with these wonders of nature is not recommended the salt Stroman well pool maelstroms the Naruto whirlpools these are gigantic vortexes that exist under natural conditions but let's imagine how big a whirlpool can grow that's created artificially through technological means for this we need to make the strongest current that already exists on our planet and make it spin through powerful turbulence causing the current to become even more deadly the world's most powerful current is the Antarctic circumpolar current also known as the west wind drift it flows around Antarctica and is approximately three times more powerful than the Gulf Stream the length of the west wind drift is over eighteen thousand six hundred miles and its maximum width is around one thousand five hundred and fifty three miles over one second this monster of a current moves 200 million tons of water along and over just one minute 12 billion tons this unimaginably fast amount of water dozens or hundreds of thousands of billions of tons is swept along at a speed of 190 feet per second now if we exploded say a few 20 to 30 Megaton atomic bombs around the perimeter of the west wind drift under the tectonic plates then due to the holes that are formed in the oceanic crust a whirlpool will be created with five to ten times faster than the raging river current that swept Steve Fisher alone imagine that rushing at you with the speed of a car is an entire ocean this is what our artificially created whirlpool would be like with the amount of water that would be involved hundreds of billions of tons of only would ships yachts boats and barges disappear and so would entire fleets of many thousands of vessels oil rigs and any other structure that's in the path of this wild Antarctic current in addition as a result of such a catastrophic development currents and even the sea level could change all over the globe will return to artificially created whirlpool shortly but for now let's turn away from these horror stories and back to reality and to our champion athlete Steve Fisher do you see how hard this was on the extreme athlete Fisher later says that he nearly drowned and that it was a miracle that he's still among the living he was saved by the fact that he had an air cylinder with him underwater Fisher was able to continue breathing with it for about a minute and then he was pulled ashore fish's many years of experience in the sport and high level of qualification was still not enough to save him from a run-in with this fast-moving River current even a whirlpool that's not among the world's strongest and nevertheless be a mortal danger and now here's a real example of an artificially created giant whirlpool that turned out to be thousands of times more dangerous than that one in the Congo 7 a.m. on Friday November the 21st 1980 at eeeem of drillers from Wilson brothers corporation was prospecting for oil underneath the bottom of Louisiana's Lake Pena however under the lake bed was an old salt mine and the drillers did not take this minor detail into account during the drilling a hole was punched into a shaft in the old mine at a depth of around 1,300 feet what happened is something that no one could have imagined the water plunged down into the space that had opened up instantly demolishing the walls vaulting and supports of the mine shaft on the surface an enormous whirlpool formed 180 feet in diameter and it destroyed a tugboat a drilling rig 11 barges a whole island with a Botanical Garden on it dozens of trucks and even several houses luckily not a single human life was lost a whirlpool of such immense power could easily pull the legendary Titanic to the bottom as that ship's mass was several times smaller than the total mass that the artificially created Lake Pina well pool sucked in the most surprising thing about this incident is that the video of it has got a lot of likes on the internet and only because luckily not a single human life was lost is there any chance that a person aboard a ship could survive after being sucked into such a mega whirlpool to make it out alive you'd need a seriously strong capsule that could withstand the water pressure of many tons and in addition that'd have to be a large amount of air in the capsule take for example what happened when the tugboat Jass gone for was crushed the tug boat capsized and sank off Nigeria on May the 26th 2013 everyone on board died except the ship's cook Harrison Okene he was fortunate enough to lock himself in an airtight cabin and survived underwater for three days before being rescued when rescuers bought akkanee up to the surface it turned out that an air pocket formed in the space where the cooker sought refuge and that's why Harrison Okene was not crushed however the chance is that any other person on a sinking ship would be so lucky a slim so to survive a mega well pool you need to be in a capsule which is a hermetically sealed air bubble and of course rescuers have to arrive quickly as you might soon run out of oxygen otherwise if there is no hermetically sealed compartment with an air pocket then the many tons of water around you will do their work they will instantly crush the space itself and everyone inside of it secondly such a powerful whirlpool always forms when the depths reach hundreds of feet and it's impossible to escape from such a depth just on your own although if the depth is not great not 13 to 1,700 feet but just 50 to 65 feet the chances are still slim a person would have to have an incredible level of physical fitness to swim up from under fifty or sixty five feet of water for an ordinary person already at a depth of ten feet due to the water pressure the diaphragm is unable to expand enough for the lungs to fully fill with air all-in-all whirlpools are no joke it's best to avoid them even the smallest ones even gentle little whirlpools can grow stronger at any moment leaving even experienced pros unable to get out of them that's all for today we hope you liked the video don't forget to tell us your suggestions for future topics in the comments if we choose your suggestion we'll mention you in a future video thanks for watching [Music] you", "yW0GEEAbhn8": "I already did my intro I did like five intros for this I have forgot to hit record the intro is bit [ __ ] intro this is the intro we're eating edibles three edibles this is the intro always remember to hit record edible day edible day to edible day second try what we have we're just gonna do it again for a like foreplay this is edible gum it's a soft - that's what I was going for gum is soft these are soft it's a soft - peach mango flavored and you can see it's open because I opened it on take one before I realized I wasn't recording so that's why that's open but I never ate it yet that's number one you can see here - soft chews five milligrams per - and then we have a package date of February 10th 2020 that's good that's cool their gummies not a big deal what's in them ingredients sugar water but they're gummies - all the gummy ingredients we have Edison bites this is a chocolate truffle check it out down here chocolate truffle dark chocolate 112 gram unit 12 gram unit my unit is a much bigger 10 milligrams in the unit the unit goes in your mouth you can just let it sit and melt and then swallow the unit to the unit and spit it out we're talking about recreational cannabis let's have some fun next up or or drift this is spearmint chocolate ah spirit chocolate mental check out down here read for yourself I can't speak spearmint chillers 5 units total of 10 milligrams two ten milligrams so five minutes two milligrams each all right so I'm opening this one again I actually did just open this like two minutes ago but I forgot to hit record Oh price we always forget that right I don't have impressionist this he's given to me from a friend who said [ __ ] try this out do a review let's get them oh let's see they are two little candies and a silica gel so I'm gonna try gummy mmm really soft tastes like a peach mango juice more peachy than mango there's a little bit of sugar on the outside a little gritty but there's a slight cannabis taste in there too I'm gonna save a gummy for a little later because I'm gonna try this Edison chocolate truffle dark chocolate drop a couple topic I'm interested let's crack this little sealy here Celie cracked there it is this is a ball of chocolate that's what it is that's what it is oh there's a little design there's a little weed leaf sciency design on there for Edison as you can see that's their design their logo Edison like smart people like smart stuff doing doing science see smart stuff and now our logo is science C and we D that's what's going on there cool I don't care about the logo I care about the chocolate okay it's just it's splitting in half so I'm just gonna open it in half for you to show you oh look at that I'm just gonna eat half so you can actually split that in half and take a 5 milligram dose if you like [ __ ] yeah that is a delicious dark chocolate truffle Oh price everybody wants to know the price the dark truffle for $7.99 ten milligram dark chocolate or $7.99 dark chocolate is delicious that's a good soft chocolate that just melts in your mouth it's creamy and it's not too rich you know that Rick stuff where you're like oh I only need one glows well it's not this I need all of that and then some that was fantastic the benefit to the chocolate is it just melts in your mouth and fills your mouth and then your whole entire mouth is just absorbing the THC and when it does that it you get high faster your body's like yeah all right third item third item Aurora drift spearmint chillers Aurora drift spearmint chillers these are mint I presume they're mints there is five units there is two milligrams in each unit marks twelve package date no expiry date that's its MCT oil so this is all the ingredients that make up the candy but it does not say what type of cannabis extract is in it I'm going to presume it's distillates that's it that's all we can do is presume at this point because they don't give us the information we want somebody should change that write a letter that's sealed and there's also this plastic seal this sticker is harder to get off than anything I'm worse than the childproof tabs here's the childproof tabs we'll squeeze these in and if there's two of you if there's two kids both of you grab onto one of these is push in and then you get to pull this out like that's not childproof all right we're all I can smell them smelling spearmint there they are they're ease cool this should be hard to [ __ ] up so if this tastes bad don't make candies anymore Aurora now it's experiment hard candy you got to really love spearmint candies too want to be able to take in your tea see this way the benefit to this though is this candy sits in your mouth for a longer period of time I don't really want to chew it but if you suck on this the THC gets absorbed in the blood vessels in your mouth quicker so you're hi come come on a little quicker you know so it just tastes like candy there's no cannabis taste in there gonna taste spearmint it's not even candy it's a [ __ ] Mick it tastes like experiment hard little sucky thing hard little sucky I'm just gonna eat all three of these then I need to I'm gonna eat all four I'm a big loss for moe this one's kind of a myth in terms of recreational fun Ness this one's a rat all right Aurora drift spearmint mint hard candies not too sure those are probably for old people in my experience hard candies never were a big seller when I came to edibles I don't know I I'm not gonna recommend these Aurora has a couple different products that are better the spearmint Aurora drift mints are gonna come in at a four point eight next up the for a candy gummy I have one left each is five milligrams it's immediately soft I like it five milligram candies you know this will be a flat seven you know yay triumphs and then the Edison byte truffle [ __ ] a that's a good chunk up as a delicious that's gonna come in in 8.3 because it's so delicious I would continue to eat those chocolates if they are lined up non-stop something I would want after I'm high that's how good it tastes Edison Bates the best ones eight point two or three eight point three eight point two not sure what I'd said earlier by them us

for you guys so tonight we thought given that it's saint patrick's day we would maybe go ahead and do something green we're not very festive tonight callie yeah or not no well your shirt says happy oh my bracelet and your your bracelet's green your sweater this morning was green but i'm not very festive with my red and my black but that's okay we're making sure we are we are going to make a green shamrock shake because we love shamrock shakes we used to love shamrock shakes at mcdonald's mcdonald's when we used to eat mcdonald's we don't eat mcdonald's very often anymore now but we love their shamrock shake so we're gonna make the healthier version of the shamrock shake tonight for st patrick's day and then we also thought we would do another fun one we've been looking and eyeballing this recipe for a while yeah because cali she loves a good chewy candy she really does and she loves starbursts so we came across a strawberry it's supposed to be lemonade starburst fruit a super fruit super fruit food chew that is a tongue twister kelly can you say it better than i can starting lemonade limeade superfood chews hot you did better than me so we're going to make a couple of things for you and we're going to get started so kelly should we get started on the shake first do you want to shake first we'll do our green saint patty stay shamrock shake first i'll get some you want to grab the blender okay callie's going to get the blender just just the top no just the top yep yep okay bring it on over we can always go over there mix all righty so miss kelly you want to grab the ice i think we'll put the ice in the there's a bottom full in there yep so we've had this shamrock shake a few different ways sometimes we add chocolate and make it chocolate mint but tonight we're just gonna stick with the traditional shamrock shake i can't see any hold on let's see if we can get our comments nope we can't see any comments and it's not really showing us anything tonight so we don't know if we're having a technical glitch or not but can you say hello just so we know that our comments are working we're going to do six ice here should we double this recipe do you think we should share with your brothers and your dad okay okay so let's maybe double it these shakes are always huge i think doubling it will still give us lots so say a quick hello if you can hear us because we can't seem to see the comments right now i'm not sure it doesn't seem to be working well so yeah let's do 12. let's do 12 cubes so we're doubling the recipe for the sandbox shake so this shamrock shake is the low carb mint milkshake from brianna thomas so you can find it on her website and we will um post a link in the card somewhere oh the comments are working hello nice to see you thanks for commenting three four five six seven and we're being very precise tonight eight okay i'm gonna get your spinach ready okay so we're gonna put in a whole bunch of spinach to make a green you're daydreaming while you're doing that do you have a tough day long day at school maybe zoning out all right so we are gonna get the spinach ready hi julia um so we are going to put in so it's supposed to be one cup of loosely packed spinach but we're going to put in enough for two so two cups do you want to grab a measuring cup i'll grab a measuring cup you throw the ice away how's that done oh dear okay so we're gonna do some loosely packed we get a little generous on our spinach and our cheeks we really like having spinach on our shakes like you don't even notice you don't even know what's there right we had a chocolate hazelnut shake last night with supper it was kind of a strange color because of the spinach but that's all right we didn't mind right oh no okay two cups of spinach callie do you want to grab the almond milk yep yeah grab it grab the open one yeah that sounds good is this a open one nope i got it how much do i need you're gonna need we're gonna double again so you're gonna need it says half a cup so you're gonna need one cold cup you wanna just use this one that we've got out you might as well keep rolling with it [Music] can't join um what's that we gotta use until we can't anymore did you give it a shake good job i shook the other one oh you shook this one i think you're gonna need both i think you need both we kind of have a weird angle going here tonight yeah there we go until we get the tripod how is everybody doing on this st patrick's day anybody having green food our kids had green lunches they had uh spinach in their waffles for their school lunch so they had green waffles and they had micro greens and they had celery and green peppers was a real green lunch for school today any more this one's really fully let me give you a hand yes okay so how much did i say we were going to need one cup right once it's pretty like much like three quarters it's pretty close we might have to add some more depending on how thick this ends up okay cali next up the cottage cheese cheese you want to grab that yep all right callie's getting the cottage cheese i love the cottage cheese in these shakes because it is the perfect way to imitate ice cream in this shake so this is like a milkshake this one so you need the cottage cheese the traditional shamrock shake is actually ice cream based if you look at like ones that are not tma to thm they are actually ice cream based usually so i'll need a cup of this are you gonna need a cup actually that says a third so you're gonna need two thirds of a cup sweetie okay all right you got it oh i'll get you a tablespoon it smells interesting so it smells interesting does it smell like cottage cheese hopefully it's not smelling funky okay so you're going to need two for this side if it smells like cottage cheese we're doing the smell test it smells perfectly like cottage cheese to me i don't know what you're smelling but so we're using low fat cottage cheese just because that's what i tend to have in the house did it really callie read further into the recipe than i did apparently well it called for the low fat but this is an s shake so you could go full fat if you have it but i think we just don't want to get too crazy on our calories here with this shake no no need for it we like this one this one um again we've mentioned before we are in canada and we have some phenomenal cottage cheese if you buy the land one percent it tastes excellent if you buy the other one percent brands they're terrible so this is the one that we go with sitter probably be generous we like the cottage cheese in there you want me to hold it up so you can scrape it in get this in view so people can see you in action [Music] how's everybody's wednesday going it's hump day we're almost through the halfway point it is hump day right oh yeah yeah it is wednesday oh boy it's been a long week it's been a long long week one tablespoon mm-hmm keep going all right i'm gonna get the next ingredient ready we're gonna need some heavy cream and we are gonna need again we're doubling the recipe so we're gonna need four tablespoons of the heavy whipping cream you're getting close we're getting it all over the counter i don't care keep going keep it up good it's like the whole container is it pretty much the whole container oh not quite not quite that's looking good okay how about i take this from you and you can scrape that in i'm gonna grab the lid go all right we're going to get this put away [Music] maybe i'm going to wipe up your counter there too uh i'll just put this over here yeah you might need it again we'll find out okay so we're going to need to put in some cream and then do you want to grab the next day you're going to call us oh there we go yeah it's gone that's okay we can't take a call right now anyway next ingredient i'm gonna do the whipping cream so why don't you do the collagen okay okay so going back to this we are gonna need four tablespoons of our heavy cream to give it that nice ice creamy taste you got that that's really a big thing of collagen we love to get that huge thing of collagen at costco sometimes it goes on sale for a really good deal and it's it's really nice i like this one because it dissolves completely whether you put it in hot or cold it's really good at dissolving [Music] it's the organica yeah it's a really good one so i need a two tablespoon you need two tablespoons see if i can find one we need to get some more measuring spoons i feel like every time we do a video we're like we need to get that we need to get that we need to make a list just what we need to do we need to make a profit i think we needed scoops in one video we need measuring spoons there's a few things our kitchen is kind of lacking or some things are just showing their age because they were wedding gifts almost 15 years ago my husband and i all right the kitchen stuff kind of got put on the back burner right replacing all of our gadgets okay it doesn't have to be super precise in a shake you don't have to be quite as precise when you're baking you got to be pretty pretty particular but in a shake it's more forgiving so don't worry too much all right where's everybody watching from tonight yeah we are yeah we want to know this is your first video watching us we are in saskatchewan canada and it's a beautiful day we finally have less temperatures that are significantly on the plus side the snow is almost all melted four teaspoons of this it's awesome today four teaspoons okay we're gonna use this super sweet do you say four teaspoons okay kelly's gonna measure in the fourth because it's normally two teaspoons i'm gonna go ahead with the extracts so we are gonna need vanilla extract and we're also gonna need now it did call this recipe actually calls for dried mint but we don't have dried mint in the house and we don't have a garden going yet in the backyard for fresh mint so we are going to go ahead and just use the pure peppermint extract too bad we didn't have like any mint leaves i know we've done mint before in our pots on our back deck and it's been awesome we did mojito mint the one time and we used that for our kombucha and it was so good newport richly oh nice from florida i bet the weather in florida is nice okay kelly i'm gonna go ahead with this and i'm just gonna i'm gonna do we're gonna start with two capfuls we'll see if that's pepperminty enough and if it's not minty enough for our shamrock shake then we'll increase it we can always increase it but i find the mint is pretty powerful can't take it away you can always put more in and i just got it all over myself it's a good thing it smells good okay i'm gonna wash my hands i'll keep this out because we'll need it do we need it again oh this is the super sweet maybe if it's not sweet enough i guess but i don't like i'm pretty sure we don't need it for our other recipe it's just for this one okay so then we're going to add some vanilla and we're going to go through the dash so we're going to add we're going to be generous i love it okay don't worry about that one right now kelly let's just do this one okay so do you want to do the salt it says pinch so maybe do a cup of cranks like i'm gonna do like one crank well it says a pinch so that would be like one pinch and you're doubling it right perfect okay now we have to add the glucky but we have to do it while it's whirling because otherwise we might get it lumpy this stuff as soon as it hits the anything moist anything wet um it clumps up so badly so we are gonna do that over the thing maybe i should bring it over and we can blend it right up here how's that sound okay okay you guys should check out our youtube channel oh you think everyone should go to youtube yes we do have a youtube channel now and we would love if you go over and you go ahead tell them what it's what it's called i'll get the blender donut and okra donut okra yeah and let's grab this people say ogre's a vegetable and it shows it's seeds so i wonder if it's like a frenchy a fruit or a veggie a fredjie as frenchy as a fruit and a veggie oh you mean because okra has seeds in the inside and cucumbers are a fruit because they have seeds on the inside i don't know we might have to google this whether okra is truly a vegetable or whether okra is a fruit or a veggie is it freddy a true thing yeah i figured this is a made up kelly thing a frenchie a thread or a vegetable whatever it is we love it you could put okra in this shake too but we're just going to stick with the way the recipe is written because the okra would probably be tasted in this recipe but it would certainly give it a really nice puddingy milkshake texture we love the texture of okra in our shakes okay do you want to get this started kelly it's going to be super thick so i'm going to get the plunger it's gonna be loud [Music] we want it to be green it's a shamrock shake it's the perfect green okay if you want to grab a scraper we'll scrape down the sides we have a few little tiny chunks of of cottage cheese and a spinach on the side and that's not going to be very nice yeah you want to scrape down those little pieces of cottage cheese and spinach we might actually have to add some more ice we kind of decreased the ice because our ice cubes are big but we might have to increase the ice we'll see we're going to put that glucky in glooky lucky i still haven't figured out if it's glooky or glucky i'd really like if somebody would tell me if it's glooky or glucky so we could be saying it right or lucky yeah i don't know we said glucky for like two years already so now it's hard for me to get that out of my head i want to call it glooky still you want to call it glooky like no lucky clucky gucky lucky and what we can call whatever we want i guess but i'd just like to know what it's really called it's like you scrape these down here we want those chunks of spinach to if you say if it's like if it's glooky can you say if the two o so we can tell it's like okay so cali wants to know if it's glooky or it's glucky or it's glucky like lucky lucky we really want to know somebody tell us somebody help us out okay so i'm going to sprinkle it in i think you just splashed me oh sorry well you'll smell minty you'll be very festive okay i'm gonna sprinkle it in how much did we need hon we need a quarter of a teaspoon for one recipe rounded and we're gonna do double so we're gonna need half a teaspoon around so we're gonna make some noise again and i'm going to sprinkle it in super slowly get it going anytime this hits the liquid it's going to start forming these little rubbery balls of clump it's not very appealing oh she thinks it's like lucky lucky that's what we were hoping lucky so were we saying it right for those two years what did we say before i can't even remember now i think we said we said lucky yeah we said right the whole time so baby we're saying it right well thanks for helping us out letting us know what we should be saying there brandi okay cali so let's add a couple more ice cubes do you want to grab the ice back out it's looking a little thin we want it nice and thick like a true shamrock shape it's gotta be thick perfect maybe add well originally it said we should add eight and you added six right six times two so go ahead add four more let's go the original amount we should have just followed the recipe and done the eight cubes like it said all right i said wrong not lucky oh not lucky oh oops so it isn't lucky it's glooky with two o's like that sound lukey no i'm just confused glooky we're gonna have to retrain our brains callie okay [Music] so now what it said to do is it said once you've got your glucky in there you're supposed to just like let it sit 30 seconds to a minute let that glue activate and then put it back on again and it's supposed to give it the best texture i don't know i'm not a very good rule follower i have a tendency to just throw it all in there why don't you get us some glasses and some straws so yeah i'm not really a rule follower when it comes to the shakes i know many of them say add the protein powder in the last 10 seconds and i'm not so good at following that we like a fluffy shape so we don't we just usually all throw it all in there all right can you reach out get rich our fridge is way too full considering it has nothing in it can you reach it do you need me to grab one yes i don't want a glass to fall on your head no that would have hurt you're going to use that one okay sure you can use that one i'll use this one these oh this looks good let's see look how nice and shamrock shape and it smells like i think we got it had a really minty maybe you could have cut it back we ended up doing half i did two capsules so probably closer to half a teaspoon and it probably definitely could have been more like one one and a half capfuls but we like minty so a shamrock shake should be minty right callie we said we were gonna make for the boys we should better save some hey uh-huh we better just you're having less sure i guess i'm having less it's all right i'll have more if there's enough for everybody to go around let's give it a try um it's really good oh it's really minty i really like it but i honestly i would like to add okra to this i think the texture would be even more milkshake like if you added okra so i think the next time we're going to add two cups of okra one cup per recipe um yeah um you know those um things that you can find at sweet and sprouted which things are we talking about those make your own ice cream package yes you could make some of those and then put it in you totally substitute some of the ice you totally could so kelly thinks next time we make the shamrock shake we should make some homemade sugar-free vanilla ice cream and plop it in there and that's a great idea it would taste even more like a true shamrock shake okay we're gonna hop to our next recipe another really quick one and this one is our strawberry lemon we're calling them lemon limeade because we're out of lemon juice and we do have the strawberry lemonade packets so we're going to use one of these you have the same brown as this for the yeah we normally buy the same brand so we're going to do the strawberry lemon limeade starburst superfood chews um so if you follow in the trim healthy book the superfood chews i believe are in the original trim healthy cookbook but there's not this recipe this recipe was just found on the page on the trim healthy main page so i will still link it in the comments so you can see it there so it's just somebody tweaked the original recipe which is normally a chocolate one and there's a few other variations and we're gonna do a strawberry lemonade hardly any of this stuff that's okay we won't quite have enough of the strawberry protein powder but we will add a little plain two and a half scoops scoops oh this scoop is what you just dropped off of there let me move this out of the way and then we can bring the food processor in and then you can get started on it i can tell you guys kelly is chomping at the she loves starburst if you have any like really good cheap fruit processors food processors yeah we talked about that last time our food processor is very sad when we do one of these videos with it one day it's just going to give us the ghost because it's very old that's okay hopefully it won't be today hopefully it's gonna it smells like strawberries it's a strawberry yeah don't dump it we don't have a lot especially strawberry starburst well that's the goal here we're trying to make something that tastes like strawberry starburst do you want me to just dump it in if you hold the scoop over we'll do it as teamwork okay okay so you're gonna need for these starburst fruit chews oh we've got glooky again oogie i think it says goofy yeah we have to start saying it right callie we're gonna embarrass ourselves saying lucky a hundred times i think i just like that it sounds like a lucky i don't know okay so we need to think that should you maybe we should just call it oh we could call it lucky good point cali okay so we need two and a half scoops of the strawberry trim healthy mama we're using their strawberry protein powder you could probably use a different strawberry one if you've got it use what you've got we're just using what we've got which is apparently not enough one and a half so don't dump that yet because we're gonna top it up we're gonna need two and a half all together so we're gonna need some plain we've just got the plain this is just the trim healthy mama plain protein powder we are in desperate need of going for a shopping trip kelly because that's all i've got left for protein powder in the house and that's like a tragedy okay so we're gonna need two and a half this stuff's fluffier i wonder if they're gonna turn out different with the plane in there oh well we're gonna find out so that's two and then we need another half well maybe the other one's not so fluffy because they don't have it the other one is less fluffy because of flavor i'm not sure why the flavored trim healthy protein powders are less fluffy than that do we need glucose we need no we don't no we need uh collagen you want to grab the collagen one more time and we did have this from our previous recipe that we used it for collagen let me get these other dishes out of the way callie one half see it isn't see me does it mean cup cup yes a c in a recipe would mean cup oh oh half a cup honey so not the table food what's that oh yes not the tablespoon i'm totally wrong you are right i think callie's reading the recipe we have a cup of collagen there's a lot of collagen hence what makes them super food chews there's the half cup cali get some of that in there this is almost like the strawberry really dip it in here turn this like that sideways i'll hang on to it for you this is almost like the strawberry what protein powder because it's like oh the texture the collagen yeah it's the same half cup yep we want to be kind of more exact on this recipe because we want them to turn out where they stick together okay perfect and then we need to see the star ingredients which is going to be floss tea lucy lucy lucy they say glooky they say everybody says something different apparently yeah that's all right i'm gonna call it lucky that is so so so minty next we're going to try it with the dried mint like the recipe calls for see if it makes a difference because i really like that that's the difference between her recipe so okay we're gonna use in this case the recipe calls are you okay you bump your almonds it called for these the true lemon lemonade don't be mistaken and just buy the true lemon that are just the crystallized lemon you need these to be the lemonade mix and there's all different flavors so you could change this recipe i got two more in my hand i need a cup so you can use whatever flavor you want and change the flavor of your starburst fruit shoes to be whatever flavor you buy there you are dear cali is on a mission tonight we are on mission make this video short nice and short we're gonna try and be quick tonight one it smells like strawberry night kelly's gotta head to the bath after this it's like a purple color it is um that smells good this is a real life school weeknight kind of video we gotta be fast right kelly gotta go chop chop so i'm excited if these are good we're gonna buy more of the true lemon packets and do different flavors and we're gonna make a whole like mixture so when we've got those cravings for something chewy and candy-like we can be chomping on these her it's really perfect no there's a good chance cali we'll test it before we completely decide we like the flavor but we used some plain protein powder so there is a chance this might not be just a second okay there's a chance this might not quite be sweet enough because we didn't use all strawberry protein powder we did have to sub some plain in there so we're gonna taste it when it's done and if we need to we'll either add some super sweet or we will add another packet of the lemonade so we're going to have to just be careful of that don't let me forget to try it isn't lemonade like sour yes but there's also sweetener in this this is already pre-sweetened this one it's got um well there's actually cane sugar in here but it's just such a minimal amount and there's stevia leaf extract in there okay callie so it said you're supposed to combine all of this first blitz it up a little bit just so it's all combined evenly so that you're not getting like some that just tastes like collagen pulse it um you just whizz it on low maybe give it a quick whiz go ahead smells like it's burning i don't smell burning i smell lemonade no like when it was whirling then it smelled like oh dear that's just because our food processor is dying okay so to this cali we have to add some lemon juice and then we're gonna process it a little more and then add our coconut oil oh yes the lime juice we're gonna do lime juice because we're out of lemon so two table two tablespoons you can use that tablespoon measure over there extra collagen no all right collagen for what because i have like a little less oh that'd be fine that little tiny bit in the spoon will be fine i'm gonna let callie do the cooking video and i'm just gonna drink the shade give it a good shake those things when they're kind of new you have to yep you're getting it keep going [Music] keep going you're able to see this one you want it to be a bit more precise so that they stick together good keep going keep going a little bit more perfect one okay go ahead with one more we need two tablespoons it's bubbly in there add the lime juice or you could use lemon juice and two tablespoons of coconut oil i'll get the coconut oil started cali okay i'll get it ready to go but i'll wait actually because i don't want to interrupt you and i need to have a measuring spoon excellent i'm just gonna grab a spoon for the coconut why is it bubbly in there in here it's probably reacting with the um the packet of the lemonade that'd be my guess okay i'm going to grab something like that and vinegar yeah sort of like that okay so you need to begin processing and it says says when you put the juice in you need to start processing it like online like on low what no lime juice it smells like really like lemonade oh it smells really good and it's a little crummy it's supposed to be crumbly at this point it's supposed to be crumbly that looks right i'm using kind of a one and a half tablespoon measure and then a half tablespoon because again that's all we have for measuring spoons around here is random random ones so we're gonna use this one is a half so that'll give us two tablespoons of coconut oil i don't think you want to use a coconut oil that has much flavor here we're using this one this one's our favorite you see it there um it's ideal for cooking the omega nutrition one it has no coconut taste whatsoever i just got a sugar so it's my favorite to use i like coconut but i don't want coconut starburst that's it oops it actually sounds sort of good coconut starburst well that'll be your next creation maybe kelly okay so that you want to whizz it up again and we'll check if it holds together okay now be careful for the blade we gotta check if it's gonna just be careful there's a blade in there we're just going to see if it holds together i think it's going to hold together it's very coconut oily but it seems to be holding together holding a nice little ball there it's like a little gumball yeah we want it to hold together taste it see if it needs anything that tastes really good it tastes like a strawberry starburst mm-hmm which is exactly like a strawberry lemonade starburst i don't think we need to add any more sweetener there is no such thing as strawberry lemon there's no strawberry lemonade starburst but that would taste like a strawberry one you know all the flavors i don't but i'll take your word for it okay so now you have a couple of options a person can either take just take your fingers like we just did and make little balls out of this or you can roll it into a log and slice it i think we should roll it in a log and slice it what do you think callie can i slice it sure you roll on too long okay i'm going to grab a cutting board to do this one because this looks like it might be pretty greasy from the coconut oil and we'll do it on a cutting board and then if you want to grab a knife there should be one check if there's one in that drip tray over there for doing the supper dishes okay so we're just gonna form this into a log it seems to be sticking together nice okay then you can grab one from this drawer but just let me roll this out first okay because you have to get in there a little bit of sausage it's very coconut oily like i feel like it kind of had a little less coconut oil it sounds very coconut oily anybody made this does it look right i think it's supposed to be like shiny i think it's just melting from my warm hands yeah but it's very very coconut oily you're not gonna wait hey no no you're eager i'll just use this you're gonna use that big chef's knife okay nobody can see you want to come on the other side of me yeah but i gotta roll this up a little bit this knife in the house be careful with it please kind of holding it dangerously there for a minute all right now we may have a problem because this is not really wanting to roll out nice and thin we may have to do some forming of it with our hands i think that's what we're going to do it looks honestly like all the coconut oil is coming out of this and that can't be right so we're going to try and improvise well if your hands are melting well we don't want to lose all the coconut oil in our recipe yeah right so if you want to cut in pieces they have to be kind of even pieces calisora they're somewhat the same size and then what maybe i'll do since this looks a little on the big side i'm just going to break that into two maybe we'll go ahead and just form these with our hands starburst yeah absolutely you cut them in or even you just cut some and then you can help me form them i think we should do them in little squares like starburst would look like little cute squares can you see that our lighting in our house in the evening is absolutely terrible so i apologize because it looks like we're in a cave right now yeah we have a light on the way so that the lighting will be a bit better because it still gets dark here really early it's only 7 30 and it's getting dark outside so we're gonna get something but can you see our little starburst fruit shoes aren't those the cutest we're gonna have very greasy fingers when this is done cali did you cut them into half again yeah they're gonna be pretty big i think kind of just make them form them into little cubes flat they're gonna be bigger than a starburst i feel like we could have even made these into half again oh my god well you make that one whatever size you want it but i think the rest will make them just like little tiny one bite poppers because these are super filling with all that collagen in there and that protein powder you know this is a one right one that looks like a huge bite one you'd be full after just having one really you don't want to slice it in half and make it smaller i can make it smaller that would fill me up with just one it would so i think it's fun to do these in different flavors i like i do like the chocolate ones they remind me of a tootsie roll so i do like those ones too although i do not remember them being so drippy with coconut oil so i don't know if that is something to do with the lemonade packets just not being quite the same as the original recipe there's less dry ingredients but i mean they're turning out they're just drippy with coconut oil do this over guys this is pretty small and try to make sure sure you do it whatever you however you like that looks great this one has to cut in half after i made it you're gonna make it a starfish mini sausage a mini sausage so i think these would be fun to do with the kids if your kids like to eat thm food my kids do you can like probably make these any shape you want these would be really fun to do as something the kids could get involved in doing it's like school safe they would be school safe we have a tough time finding school safe snacks that in our house is really important as well because we have a son with a peanut and a sesame allergy so it's really hard to find snacks that are safe for him that are both peanut free and sesame free sesame is the even harder one i think than peanuts these days is finding things that are sesame free so whenever we find something fun like this this would be a super cute little lunch box accompaniment are you trying it yeah you taste testing it no see if it's any good i think they'll be even better once they're cold we'll chill them and then all that coconut oil will firm up and then they will be super good because that's what i used to do with the traditional recipe they used to wrap them individually and then put them into the fridge so like you'd wrap them and then you put them in the fridge so yeah i don't want to chill these because i well we're not going to eat them all this is making a lot so we're going to keep forming these and enjoying them yeah right i'm not sure if we have too much else to show you guys tonight we want to keep this really short and sweet we just wanted to show you a fun shake for st patty's day so um if you're just starting

bye bye", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from marijuana lay the topics in the description pink ominous video and we showed with an addiction to read if you like

show where we will eventually someday maybe potentially bake or cook something today is munch Monday so I've gone to one of my dispensaries here in Washington State and I picked up a new edible that I haven't tried before and I brought it home I'm gonna eat it right now in front of you and I'm gonna critique it and tell ya what's good these edibles are available here in Washington State and also for my friends that are watching in Oregon let's go so today when I picked up something that I probably won't need a lot of but it sure is nice for a treat today I went and I tried a new company called ho new Oh No this company's name is actually Hawaiian for great sea turtle or green sea turtle sea turtles in Hawaiian mythology stand for serenity [Music] longevity wisdom stability and it's uh it's a Hawaiian myth there's a Hawaiian myth that says that it was the Honu who brought the first civilization to who led the first inhabitants to Hawaii so that's kind of close if you go to their website there's more there's more talk about their mission statement and why they decided to go with the name Honu they have a [ __ ] ton of flavors of stuff I had to pick they had in my in my dispensary that I went to the other day they probably had 14 flavors and overall they probably have 20 plus ho nude chocolate turtles won first place edibles and overall Grand Champion in Colorados rooster magazine in 2019 now this package is an older package these were made in November of last year so they're not old they've got a year shelf life on them but they don't have any of the nutritional nutritional facts the new edibles that are coming out all have all of the new packaging has calories fat content all that kind of stuff this does not but these are all the ingredients and a liquid take your time read them all there's wheat there's milk there's pecans you're soy there's coconut they don't say which part of the candy is infused but they do you see right here they separate indica and sativa when I asked for the turtles she said that I want indica or sativa so that's kind of cool if you don't know we have indica which is kind of a couch lock situation okay that's a very heavy sunset I'd kind of situation indica sativa sativa goes by sativa Achieva you might have heard makes you want to paint a fence or do art or whatever I like a hybrid my personal favorites are the hybrids that way you get to sunset eyes from the indica and you get the kind of creative jazz from the center from the sativa anyway yeah lots of ingredients corn syrup but no no heavy corn syrup palm oil and palm kernel oil I'm not real hip to that but they're in here look up palm kernel oil in politics I'm here for distraction I'm not here to make a stand so we're just gonna eat the delicious candy today we're having delicious Honu chocolate truffles ten milligrams each a hundred milligrams per the whole bag here's what they look like oh my gosh they're so good I already had a few or a dozen I read about the packaging today Honu has an actual page about their packaging Washington state regulation requires that the candy be each piece of candy be in a child resistant package they've chosen plastic as some you could rip through some you cannot I've had to cut these open with the scissors I got them out they're so freakin yummy okay now so you have chocolate a chocolate wafer stuck on to that is a salty pretzel stuck on to that is a glob of caramel and then a toasted pecan on the top I don't know if it's toasted it might be wrong and they don't describe which part of the this candy is the infused part I'm assuming it's probably the caramel it might be the chocolate is probably the caramel because they're using them they're using coconut oil as the as the vehicle to carry the cannabis all right here we go oh my god [Music] that was delicious oh my god oh my god oh wow the salty the sweet the sweet the salty the gooey the chocolatey the caramel nuts aah oh my god I have one more mm-hmm listen set your timer I'll see you on the other side those ho news worked really great I loved him a lot gave me the munchies so I'm enjoying on my favorite treats I'm that look the tater tots also you see the part of my set is missing now because we harvested the pineapple because we live in the future and I could get pineapple in Seattle in the middle of the winter from the line below [Music] the Honu candies are great potent candies are great I'm anxious to try another one of their flavors they're really potent they're nice and potent than good oh you're supposed to do it scale hold on my mom come on if we're on the scale let's say flavor a 910 flavor 10 this is what they should dictate life this is what should taste like there was no pop flavor with

really strong so I'm gonna get back to my top delicious we'll see you guys next week Umoja Monday [Music] [Music] [Music]", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "kVI6X3fVnQY": "hey guys this is girl hermes welcome back to my channel says today we is getting lit if you are not 21 over please click off this video but today you guys i'm going to be eating some edibles so i decided to copy stoney gummies but i actually had these before but honestly just one like tab is it is enough to get you you know buzz or feel high but i'm gonna have more today okay i have it in watermelon i have it in papaya and i have it in cherry lime so these are all of the different flavors you know what i'm saying and this is how they look like so it comes with five gummies it comes with five gummies and it's extra strength 350 milligrams of thc so i'm guessing that the whole entire package is 350 milligrams my friend gave me one tab before and i just felt a little high i don't know i don't know you know what i'm saying but i'm only gonna have two today so i'm going to pick two two gummies that i want i'm gonna have two of those i'm also gonna have these nugs so these are medicated chocolate cookies and cream nugs you know what i'm saying so we'll see how these look like once i open them so i'm going to pick two of these i'm just going to pick two random ones and those are the two ones those are the two i'm going to try for you guys all right so i have these two in my hands so let's see what they are this is the cherry lime and this is the papaya i love you want to try the watermelon but it's cool it's cool so i'm gonna try the papaya first y'all my hardest raisin a little bit because every time every time i eat edibles y'all it literally don't work for me i either don't feel i either don't feel nothing either i stepped through it whatever the case may be i've never like had a full-blown high off of it edible but anyways this is the papaya it looks orange it's orange and like i said before these are little tabs i do not suggest consuming this whole entire thing y'all but 350 milligrams isn't a lot for me you know what i'm saying so it all depends on your tolerance we'll start off with start off with one and then move on so we rip one off this is the papaya one so let's try that it's currently 6 37 and yeah it usually takes an hour or so for edibles to kick in way longer than smoking you know i'm saying way longer time than actually hitting a joint so there we go and you just gotta suck that bad boy out you know what i'm saying so this is i don't know how many milligrams in here but not bad at all no wheat smell no we taste no saying very discreet if you're trying to be discreet so no issues with that now i have the cherry lime one i want to take that i'm so scared i'm looking getting scared i don't know if i should just have one of these and then one of the nugs all right how about this i'm gonna have two of these right and then in an hour at 7 30 i'm going to see how i feel i don't feel like you know super lit then i'll take the i'll take the nugs as well so i'm gonna take another cherry or should i just try the nugs right now right all right i'm just gonna try the nuts instead the the nuggets then but with the nugs you guys this is 450 milligrams you know what i'm saying 450. it's definitely higher than the sony gummies so i might not even need another stone yummy i might take notes for me don't i might take another stoney gummy depending on how i feel so these are just chocolate bars in here i thought it was going to be those nugs that are chocolate but it looks like weed you know what i'm saying that's what i thought those were going to be but i guess not but anyways these are some pretty it's like a pr it's like a cube it's like a chocolate cube and this is cookies and cream cookies and cream is my favorite if you did not know because in korean my favorite chocolate bar it's one of my favorite chocolate bars and yeah so let's give this a try don't smell like weed i don't think it's that good it has it tastes like cookies and cream but it has a like an aftertaste to it it tastes a little like it tastes a little spoiled you know what i'm saying i don't know so with the nugs you get six you get six chocolate um bars and these have and there's different flavors of these also so i got cookies and cream and yeah you guys it's kind of sexy it's currently 6 40 and i'm going to come back in an hour or so to other you guys so stay tuned you know i'm saying all right so i was pretty comfy in my bed as you guys can see but i don't care about the setup right now but anyways you guys it is one hour later you know what i'm saying where's my phone right there it is one hour later and it is 7 38 you know i was saying i took the idols around an hour ago and i honestly don't feel anything like i don't feel abuzz i don't feel slightly nothing so so with that being said i'm going to try the other one of the gummy sony gummies i'm going to try the cherry lime one now since i don't feel much at all i'm going to try the cherry lime one now and yeah the 75 milligrams per chocolate bar and with the gummies it's 70 milligrams per gummy so i've had i have one stony gummy i'm about to have another one so that's 140 plus the 75 that's 270 milligrams yeah i don't think that's much for me so i'm going to take another one i'm about to take another another tab this is not good cherry lime but anyways you guys it's 7 42 now i'm about to wait another hour and another hour i'll be right back if i still don't feel nothing i'm gonna have another chocolate bar so let's see y'all by the way i paid 20 a pop for these so i'm pretty sure i could find these cheaper online but i paid 20 a pop for these and for everything but are they worth it i don't know because i don't know because it's like i have to eat a lot for me to feel anything so watching some youtube videos about to go back to that i'll see you guys in a little bit okay honestly i feel a tad bit like i felt have a bit high you know i'm saying but okay um yeah i guess there i guess it's kicking in now it's currently nine o'clock and i took the edible at the last one at seven anyways you guys i'm hungry i'm starving you know i'm saying so i have me some pizza this is my second slice of the day so this is my second slice um i had one slice before um i took the edibles so that's why i feel like it took forever for it to kick in because i had you know i had a meal before i had my edible but it was like two hours before two hours before i even started y'all and i haven't uh you're making me happy so yeah i think that's why let's a lot for the edibles to kick in i gotta go i gotta start going back to my meal prep smoking [ __ ] because now i'm just you know i'm going back to my old habits again i can't be doing that you know what i'm saying says i can't be doing that so so my husband go back to my meal prep because maybe tomorrow i should do it tomorrow tomorrow saturday tomorrow saturday but i want to be filming a door dash vlog for you guys the dag is all the videos as you guys have been seeing have been like pre-recorded since like last week i honestly am filming filling the feeling the edibles i'm not gonna lie like i'll let you guys know at the end of the day at the end of the video if they're worth it or not you know what i'm saying i had two of these i have two of these and i have one of these and i feel high as [ __ ] right now i love jalapenos cheers this is just making me happy but yeah yeah i've been working out damn there every day so proud of me my sister my cousins you know sam we've been working out almost every year and i started doing my yoga again i was doing this challenge just 30 day challenge and i stopped at day 20 but i'm gonna start doing that again and yeah let me know if you guys would like me to do a yoga video i'll be i'll be lit on my channel if i follow the yoga video but anyways you guys i'm gonna come back in a few hours unless you guys know how i'm feeling and stuff like that but i feel chill i feel very cheap i feel very very chill and yeah i do feel high like i feel like i sparked up and i didn't sparked up anything since i haven't sparked up anything since since three o'clock you know i'm saying since three o'clock so yeah but anyways you guys i'll see you guys in a little bit right now it is 9 53 and i probably took the edible what time did i say that i thought the edibles at 6 30 and it's really fully kicked in at nine how about you guys so i just showered and all that and and i'm over here eating twizzlers um those gummies were worth it you know i only had two of them and i was high

"9ZO6TCvHbzU": "[Music] [Music] welcome back to the classroom this is the growler report schooled to you by the workshop my name is professor t and i'm coach johnny coach why don't you tell them what we're doing today today we're going to be grating a beer from bakersfield california from a brewery called temblor brewerico i love this brewery um so tembler their is actually used as a comedy house it's live music it's a restaurant it's all these great things it's probably one of the most premier spots if you've ever been to bakersfield off of buck owens to hang out at just a really cool place to be right and temblor actually is a 19th century word i believe for earthquake trembler wait do you feel that all right i don't know what that was let's just let's move on so this this this brewery tumbler has produced a beer called fog delay tell me about this beer fog delay is a double new england style india pale ale also known as a double hazy ipa um and it has uh three types of hops in it uh centennial um uh amarilla and uh vic's secret fix nice big secret i don't think my wife's gonna like me buying this one how did you mention it i don't know i'll never tell all right let's get to the next segment guys we're going to start to talk a little bit about the branding the the the specific can art that we have on this uh this particular beverage that uh temblor has produced johnny this is the art segment coach yep yes it is so this is where we talk about some of the specific uh character that the brewery might be able to present itself or represent itself through let's start with the branding talk to me about the tumblr branding well the templar branding has like this tremor look to it it's like it's not quite symmetrical it's not quite straight it's like like like it's on a fault line right so it's like somebody had two perfectly broke words sitting on top of each other in an earthquake maybe a 9.0 on the richter scale and then jumbled the letters up or whatever the case might be it is totally indicative of the earthquake theme that they have yes it is um let's talk about the can art uh for fog delay what do you see in there i see like a streamlight bus just in the midst of a fog and uh yeah like it just looks like it's going through this fog and with the headlights all bright and everything trying to get itself through i almost feel like if it stops elvis is getting off of it i think they're gonna have an elvis spotting so the thing that i did notice is that it does appear like it's still moving i don't think any bus stops in beggar still maybe the driver stopped at tremblay brewery and him got a little foggy you know there is a chance for that i really do like the can arc um i'm gonna go ahead and give this one an a i'm gonna give this one a b plus yeah yeah the uh the branding for me is definitely cool the can art is super cool i'm curious to know what that peer sign is we're gonna have to ask the templar folks about that one day guys this is an a it's a b plus we're gonna go ahead and pop the tops on these ones we're gonna start to talk about the looks next we'll be right back so we went ahead and poured this one coach uh this is the look segment so we're gonna go ahead and start to grate this beer based on its appearance why don't you tell me what you're seeing i'm seeing a very foggy orangey look to this um yeah definitely very very foggy a little hazy what do you think i i think if we keep referring to it as being foggy there is a good potential that bus will come out of it [Music] so having said that do you think that bus hit the sign when it passed it that that pure street sign because it it turns out that buck owens boulevard used to be called buck or pierce road thus they added that cyan as a nice homage to one of the original founders of bakersfield right yeah that's right the more you know back to this so this should look exactly the way we see this there is a good orange orange hue to it it's it's foggy or murky or hazy as they they more often call it this beard does look the way it's supposed to look i'm gonna go ahead and uh i'm gonna give this one an a i'm gonna have to agree with you it it has uh that that orange hue in it that's very foggy to me so yeah i need as well did you hear that sounds like somebody i guess we're in the smell segment now let's go ahead and give this one a smell oh yeah let's see oh yeah so i'm getting lots of citrus out of this and we probably should be getting citrus i'm getting a good hop balance i'm smelling that amarillo um i'm not quite sure what victoria's sick or vic's secret or yeah i don't know what that'll smell like i just want to know what the secret is right it smells pretty good what are you smelling oh it's very very uh uh citrusy i'm getting very fruity maybe guava in it yeah i can see some of those tropical tropical notes in there as well so it smells the world too for a new england styled ipa surprisingly as an imperial i'm not getting a lot of alcohol smell from it which you could typically get when you start getting into the imperial style uh beers you can smell a lot of alcohol but i don't smell that it seems like it's well balanced with the hops i'm gonna go ahead and give this one another a you know i'm going to have to agree with you i'm going to i'm going to give it an a as well excellent let's go ahead and taste it oh do you feel that it's making the earth move underneath me it's pretty pretty good was that you or me no definitely wasn't you that is a pretty good beer it's got to be the beard talk to me about what you're tasting i'm tasting a lot of citrus notes in that like i said uh uh yeah very very citrusy like i said the the i taste a little bit of mango in that as well do you get that hit too or yeah there is some mango or some tropical maybe that's a star fruit or a mango or something like there is a tropical maybe even a pineapple kind of yeah like a dull pineapple it's it's pretty outstanding almost a little orangey too right so and that's what we really look for is the citrus notes in our our new england style or hazy ipas uh again this is a 9.0 on the richter scale and i am not tasting that alcohol that's abv for use not so intelligent ones i'm not tasting the alcohol no neither am i which is again uh very scary and very wonderful at the same time let's do it again god i love that amarillo i guess that's the amarillo i'm really tasting there it's it's amazing yeah that's really good on the taste i'm great in this one an a i gotta give it a name yeah it's really great temblor you're doing a fantastic job with this fog delay beer uh well what's that leave us with coach it's time for my favorite part what's that professor the final grade what did uh what did the final grade come in on you i'm gonna have to give this beer an a i absolutely concur my final grade for this beer also was an a but this leads us into quite possibly my favorite segment here on the growler report it's mine too time to go ahead and lay on one of those stickers like your teacher did when you were in 10th grade 10th grade if you were getting stickers on your homework in 10th grade you had a problem there was some special problems i was going to say 4th grade definitely was going to say 4th grade so what sticker are you laying on this one for our fourth grade student i'm gonna give this beer fire because not only is it just a delicious beer but i feel like this is an intro to ipas this beer will get you started on your ipa journey it's a really great citrusy just a beautiful beautiful well done beer i agree i think it's gonna catch fire which is what the fire sticker alludes to if you don't like hazy beers i think this is that beer that could definitely get you lacking hazy beers fog delay is absolutely amazing i would also like to add on my own sticker front i'm going to go ahead and give this one the heart sticker guys if you don't know what the heart sticker means it means it's crushable it's crushable and it's on fire guys this is a hunk of burning love remember when i told you that bus was gonna stop here who was getting off that bus coach i'm getting off i'm getting off you're always going to get off in that bus bud it was going to be elvis having said that i i also want to tell you wait did you feel that i think i did it feels a little bit bigger this time huh yep yep it's crazy but when you have a sizable earthquake in bakersfield you can go to the templar brewery located off of buck owens in bakersfield california you get two dollar beers beers that's crazy it's crazy i don't even know why i live where i live i think i need to move to bakersfield bakersfield that's right guys we hope you enjoyed this episode of the growella report you need to like subscribe and ring that bell we'll catch you in the classroom next time [Music] you", "g4YQxTLcNjE": "winter is not over yet almost over spring is almost here and do i have a great recommendation for you so if you're looking for a great american imperial porter and one that will surely make you look like a connoisseur then join me on this tasting my name is eddie and i have tasted and sampled many beers from all over the world and it is my passion to help you find that perfect beer you're looking for whether you're looking to try something new or there is something very specific that you're looking for to pair with your foot i got your back [Music] welcome back beer lovers thank you for spending the next few minutes with me as i said in the intro my name is eddie and on this channel i taste and review all kinds of beers and give you my most honest opinion about them as well as some ideas to pair them with your food just like the one you're about to watch so if you're new here consider subscribing and hitting that bell icon down there so you're notified every time i release and you'll be a review video if you like the video hit that thumbs up let me know you like it now what did i say i have an imperial porter other wise known also as a baltic porter so um you know those those two styles are pretty pretty similar sometimes they are you know also known as kind of stuff and today i have one from this brewery that i have never tried anything from them before they are out of idaho laughing dog brewery and i'm bringing you their pecan porter today check it out that's right pecan porter that sounds tasty and guess what i'm going to pour that on in to my nonic pine here which is the glass i recommend that you use when you're putting yourself a nice border whether it's a robust porter or an imperial porter or any other kind of powder and remember having the right glass for the beer that you are tasting is always an important piece of being a beer connoisseur so if you want to get your own set of beer concert tv glasses look in the description below check out the store and see how you can get your hands on a nice set of glasses now where do we always start appearance more importantly the three c's of appearance which are color clarity and carbonation that is right now the color it was or it is but you know you can be full and think that this is black it was very very dark brown color very clear actually it was clear when i poured it a nice carbonation yeah i would call that a very lots of action carbonation the head it's not as big a head of foam you know and it's dissipating somewhat quickly i mean you can see some of the lacing you've lost about half a finger already but it's still a nice still head there and it's nice green color head of foam so very very nice appearance all around now where do we go next aromas right well they're not trying to hide that pecan for sure it smells like caramelized pecans in there and all kinds of kind of like vanilla maybe even a hint of kind of like espresso or maybe even like a cappuccino scent uh smell there yeah very very nice sweet malty kind of aromas there it smells like dessert to be honest with you and i like pecan pie so maybe that's what i'm thinking about and now i'm going to taste it and let you know how it goes well slightly different than i expected i would say it's a lot it's a lot more bitter than i would have led to believe with such sweet aroma so tip of the tongue is very bitter actually the carbonation is nice throughout so you know if you're looking for something that cleanses your palate very nice carbonation and then that malt base with some of that sweet pecan caramelized pecan maybe burnt sugar and even a hint of like i said roasted coffee maybe like espresso all that comes through the middle then what lingers is a dry bitterness so it's and i'm still feeling kind of like a smoky even peppery dry bitterness there in the back of the palate that that kind of lingers so uh just keep that in mind but it's very very good i would call that light to medium body so again it was a lot more um it has a lot you know it was more bitter and a little bit heavier than i thought it was going to be from the appearance and the aromas but it's not a heavy beer at all it's maybe a little bit light to medium body there um that all comes important when we go to the next piece which is the part that you come to me for the part that makes you a concert the foot pairings right now porters you know they are bold beers with bold foods you want to pair them with foods that are equally bold so that the food can stand up to the beer and in this case we always look for you know meats grill meats smoked meats that have maybe sauces and stuff like that and in this case the first thing i'm going to say check it out honey pecan barbecue sauce chicken sliders yes it's a thing look it up if you don't believe me but that is going to be a great great pairing because a lot of those flavors are going to harmonize and like i said nice carbonation throughout by the way this is 8.1 alcohol by volume and i could barely barely uh taste some of that alcohol so they they do a nice nice job of you know kind of like balancing all the flavors there but because of the alcohol that's also going to help you enjoy some of those bold foods like the one i just i just um suggested also if you like thai food and if you're like you know noodles and stuff like that thai peanut noodles yes it's going to go great with the beer again it has that pecan flavor so a little bit of that nutty peppery peas part of the beer all those are going to really help you enjoy that thai food and it has enough malt to stand up to spicy food so go and enjoy your spicy foods with this beer because it's definitely going to to help you you know put down the fire when you need it when you need it to and um you know i rarely give any suggestion to vegetarians and i don't want to forget my vegetarian friends who love beer so a nice grilled portobello mushroom burger with some caramelized onions on top that will go great with this pecan powder that i have here so all those are my suggestions and as far as the cheese is smoke gruyere yes anything because what i have been learning and teaching you as i've been learning here is beers that have that long kind of smoky part of the taste they benefit from a smoky cheese to kind of pair and sound like it can almost like a rest it stops some of that smokiness from lingering way too much in the back there so i think a small gruyere would be a great great pairing with this beer now you know you can always trust me to leave you a great recommendation as far as a dessert pairing and today i think you're going to enjoy that again if you enjoy this kind of flavors here that's going to be a winning pairing there for you my friend now that concludes today's lesson but not before i ask you have you had laughing dog pecan porter before how have you enjoyed it have you enjoyed it with food have you drank it solo what are your impressions what are your comments leave me some comments below that's how we we all continue on this journey right so i hope i have helped you increase your beer knowledge as we all continue on this journey of becoming beer connoisseurs and i encourage you to be on the lookout over the next few days when i release my next beer review video and until then [Music] enjoy", "aLG8dlxPbls": "yes yes guys [ __ ] the [ __ ] Hanks and we have the chuckles as you can see I've

I look a little bit tired as its first thing in the morning guys so I'm really looking forward to these these chuckles yeah so we're looking at 20 calories per serving so I guess a serving is a sweet though so yeah but I don't really care about that ingredients are calories oil sugar glucose fructose syrup wheat flour are seared dextrose palm oil nice nice nice guys so yeah very very very nice there is a nice warning on there as well so warning me intoxicate intoxicating effects of this product may be delayed by up to two hours may cause drowsiness the product may impair the ability to

using a car I'm not gonna be operating any machinery as much as probably a toaster as much as I'm gonna do right so not gonna do anything guys so stop talking just let's get the [ __ ] chuckles on oh oh look at that nice nice gonna get my stuff go he's gonna get matched up oh look at these oh there are there are look at them guys what do you think of those see if we can see that see that I can't do the crack ah Sh the snap arch but that's what we're looking at Oh beautiful guys right stop talking just alright girls what's the time right 10:30 10:30 6 9 cheers guys [Music] that's like everyone the sugars seems to be infused nice I do like peach beautiful guys just watching me eat sweets yeah [Music] so you can't take the Congress here there is a distinct flavor of cannabis in that we are [Music] 400 milligrams there guys how much can you guys take to stick it in the comment how much it's going to take you guys to really feel their backs [Music] mm-hmm best for second as the 721 so they got a long a lot of date or love so much sugar in the morning man mmm-hmm I feel like feeling like I'm rushing off the sugar more than here people I'm getting a [ __ ] a bit of a sugar rush [ __ ] going on here my god the things I do to experiment knowing the things I do for this channel then you guys like that boy [Music] someone that guys when I meet my sweet hope you having a good day you been lucky enough to try any of this or anything like that stick in the comments again really into a interested to know what other people's experiences on with them - I mean I'm nailing with vegetables now obviously I do need a slightly higher dosage in mouth but I know also to take a little bit too much whew you can go the other way so you have got be careful [Music] sugaring the more advanced hearsay yeah too much so yeah to explain from last last night's live Bob snake we've got Lana here and we've got ninja here a little robbing in the room basically so my son's in Greece so just to move around a bit of a family night where a few drinks got on the live last night but that's why they're here in this review obviously off screen but yeah they're in the studio like they're in studio oh I mean I can't really normally eat that makes through that then one go but again it's an experiment do like sweets but I just have a couple normalling yeah and then I give it to the girls but not the sweets last one here oh if we should look at that one it's ridiculous to my sugar I need the pack we're gonna have to have as well what can I say guys Silurian sweets at bloody hour past 10:00 in the morning 114 [ __ ] years old but it's for a good cause Bottoms Up boy bottoms up let's see how interesting this get Sam lots of sugar and now secrets of use got every last bit [ __ ] right mmm well gotta say they went that pretty easy although I do feel like I'm having a real mud sugar rush right now won't run smoothly my sugar on them it seems to be more sugar on them but whether that's where the THC is whether it's infuse sugar or if you sweets I don't know I don't know how to make so some people will accuse the sweets as well as the sugar and some people would just put sugar on it so I don't know I don't know animate I will do once I come up on that because I do really really feel it then it's probably all the way through it I would say yeah as I say I need a dose I need a dose so you have four milligrams Bob's up got sugar all by my side by that guy's normal you see smoking videos to me but you've seen any in video me but I'll say it's a good good cause but suppose if you don't need a lot and you had a pack of those and they're like 50 milligrams a sweet you could probably carry them about stab a couple of sweets at a time and just sort of go along your day we as a nice do it mean put in a hundred milligrams into your body every couple of hours or something like that just gives you that little bit of pain relief and stuff like that I bet so good from that

Storyline Online, brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation. I'm Betty White, and I think we're going to have a good time today! At least I know I am. I'm going to be reading you a book, okay. I love animals, all animals, but maybe dogs in particular. So today, I'm going to be reading you a story about Harry the Dirty Dog. It's by Gene Zion, pictures by Margaret Bloy Graham. Harry was a white dog with black spots who liked everything, except getting a bath. So, one day, when he heard the \nwater running in the tub, he took the scrubbing brush... and buried it in the backyard. Then he ran away from home. He played where they were fixing the street and got very dirty. He played at the railroad and got even dirtier. He played tag with other dogs and became dirtier still. He slid down a coal chute and got the dirtiest of all. In fact, he changed from a white dog with black spots to a black dog with white spots. Although there were many other things to do, Harry began to wonder if his family thought that he had really run away. He felt tired and hungry too, so without stopping on the way, he ran back home. When Harry got to his house, he crawled through the fence \nand sat looking at the back door. One of the family looked out and said, \"There's a strange dog in the backyard... By the way, has anyone seen Harry?\" When Harry heard this, he tried very hard to show them he was Harry. He started to do all his old, clever tricks. He flip-flopped and he flop-flipped. He rolled over and played dead. He danced and he sang. He did these tricks over and over again, but everyone shook their heads and said, \"Oh no, it couldn't be Harry.\" Harry gave up and walked slowly toward the gate, but suddenly he stopped. He ran to a corner of the garden and started to dig furiously. Soon he jumped away from the hole barking short, happy barks. He'd found the scrubbing brush! And carrying it in his mouth, he ran into the house. Up the stairs he dashed, \nwith the family following close behind. He jumped into the bathtub and sat up begging, with the scrubbing brush in his mouth, a trick he certainly had never done before. \"This little doggy wants a bath!\" cried the little girl, and her father said, \"Why don't you and your brother give him one?\" Harry's bath was the soapiest one he'd ever had. It worked like magic. As soon as the children started to scrub, they began shouting, \"Mummy! Daddy! Look, look! Come quick! It's Harry! It's Harry! It's Harry!\" they cried. Harry wagged his tail and was very, very happy. His family combed and brushed him lovingly, and he became once again a white dog with black spots. It was wonderful to be home. After dinner, Harry fell asleep in his favorite place, happily dreaming of how much fun it had been getting dirty. He slept so soundly, he didn't even feel the scrubbing brush he'd hidden under his pillow. Did you like that? \nWell you're going to like this even better. This is my friend Ringo. I just met him, but he's a shelter puppy who found a wonderful forever home, so he has a happy ending just as Harry the Dirty Dog had a happy ending. Thank you.", "63skpbAhLNQ": "what's up guys it's Sarah Gatewood tanco here it's fall which means that it's elderberry season now there are a lot of videos on the net about elderberries most of the ones I have seen make little or no mention that elderberry should be eaten sparingly so this year I thought I'd put together my own video on elderberries to balance this out in the interest of full disclosure I'd like to discuss some of the benefits associated with eating these berries as well as some things to be careful of based on the research I've conducted most wild food experts agree that elder berries are edible that said it's commonly known that elder berries contain cyanide producing compounds which if ingested in large amounts can lead to unpleasant side effects such as stomach ache and vomiting to the best of my knowledge blue elder berries contain much less of these toxic compounds and are thus more suitable for consumption furthermore the bulk of the cyanide compounds in elder berries are found in their leaves stems and unripe fruits so if you are diligent about how you collect and process your harvest the risk you assume should be minimal for this reason I have come to classify elderberries not as edible but as medicinal for myself and I eat them very sparingly no more than a handful every other day by now you may be thinking why on earth would I eat these berries after hearing that they contain cyanide well elder berries are extremely nutritious they are high in antioxidants vitamins and minerals and they are a great pick-me-up during the cold winter months when store-bought food is expensive and not as fresh the fact that they are slightly toxic is not unique most foods if even with reckless abandon will cause some unpleasant symptoms for example apples cherries almonds and peaches contain trace amounts of cyanide but since we eat these foods and manageable amounts and we have a liver and kidneys to help us eliminate toxins from our bodies most of us will feel no ill effect from eating these foods from time to time in practice I have eaten elderberries many times and felt great it is only when I decided to use them as a staple ingredient in my green smoothies that I experienced my first stomach ache followed by an urge to throw up since then I've learned my lesson and only eat a little bit at a time if I choose to add them to smoothies I do so very sparingly about half a cup or less most of the time however I just eat elderberries in their raw natural form with this video I'm not trying to convince you to eat elderberries my goal is simply to share my own experience and provide you with a more rounded view of the subject that said the first thing you need to do when harvesting elderberries is find some elderberry trees and pick some berries if by this point you still don't know elderberries look like please visit my website sergei valenko comm where you will find a wild edible app that will help you identify them some elder berries are going to be hard to reach for this reason it is helpful to have a ladder or something tall to stand on in this case I use my car with a paddle board on top of it there are two main varieties of elderberries red elderberries and blue elderberries the dark blue variety is much more suitable for food when you eat elderberries make sure they are fully ripe I make an emphasis on the word ripe because as mentioned earlier unripe green elderberries have a higher cyanide content you can upset your stomach but if the fruit is ripe you should have no ill effects how do you know if an elderberry is ripe or not ripe blue elderberries display a whitish dust when they are right they also turn soft as they write them on the other hand unrivalled herb areas can range in color from green to dark blue and they will be hard to the touch it is important to note that one cluster of elderberries can contain both unripe and ripe berries once again look for the whitish dust to be certain another thing to watch out for is eating too many elderberry stems when you collect your berries try to pick up as many stems as possible as they contain the bulk of the toxic elements I watched a great video about elderberry preparation by green bean from eat the weeds calm in this video Dene mentions that if you freeze elderberry clusters ie the branches leaves and everything else the berries come right off the stems I decided to try this and it works like a charm here you can see that the frozen berries come right off the branches enabling me to sift away 99.9 percent of the stems this process is fast and easy from here you can repackage the elderberries in ziplock bags and keep them in your freezer until you are ready to use them there you have it free nutrition for the winter months in summary elder berries are commonly considered as being edible but they can induce some unpleasant reactions if you eat too many of them or if your body is sensitive to them as mentioned earlier I have come to view elderberries more of as a medicinal plant rather than an edible one which means that I eat them very sparingly usually by themselves and I definitely don't indulge in elderberries every day what you choose to do is completely up to you as always I recommend that people approach all new foods with a degree of caution because you don't yet know how this food will affect your body eat it in small doses until you are sure that it Rizza you if you find that a certain food doesn't agree with you please don't force yourself to eat it there are plenty more wild edibles out there that will make you feel joyous and happy and if you follow your body and its cravings you will ensure that you're perfectly safe 100% of the time for more information on

highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "cDwgUU27NwA": "okay guys i just want to um do a quick disclaimer um before this video first um if you're not a medical patient or live in a legal country or state et cetera um leave bye i'm sorry but like you're not welcome here um anyways so if you're not supposed to be here leave and then the other thing is i my scale wasn't working properly for some reason and um i couldn't probably measure how much i was putting in the soup and um it turned out really badly like it turned out good but i consumed way too much way too much so like you can almost take this as an educational um a video on the effects of being dumb me i'm the dumb one because i'm like yolo um who cares i can tolerate it i could not tolerate it i could not bad bad bad bad okay anyways sorry for this long intro but i really want to stress you guys make sure you're not putting too much in there make sure you know your dosing okay i'm going to put a video below that can explain how to figure out how much you're consuming um but there's so many different ways to figure it out you don't have to watch my video my video is very long it explains it in a lot of detail but um yes please um be careful don't end up like me so i don't know how to explain this because i'm like pretty high right now but the after effects of the soup very dramatic okay if somebody had a low tolerance this would like destroy that like so there's a lot of video i'm just trying there's a lot of video so i just decided to make a separate video so this video is just about how to make soup and then the next video that i like stop stop what am i saying stop where was i oh my god my eyes are they red i don't get red eyes no they're not red anyways i'm checking i ended up like literally stuck in one spot and i couldn't move and it was the worst ever so i regretted my decisions literally every minute here we go what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to show you guys how to make infused noodle soup instant noodle soup to be precise but you could use any type soup that you like because really what we're making is an infused water and fat solution and with that infused water and fat solution you can make anything you like what i happen to be having is the soup like i said but you could use it for tea you could use it for um you could add like um um flavor like a flavor packet to it like um you got iced tea powder to it and they a infused iced tea you could drink it straight um so let's get started because it's going to be sitting on here for a while so i'll talk a little bit more about it once we have it cooking so we're gonna start by turning our stovetop on and i have two cups of water here and i'm gonna pour it in now i'm using two cups of water because that's what my instant meal packages call for um but this water is going to evaporate over time and you can add more water to your liking it's not really going to affect um how the product turns out so use one or two cups and add more water as you like but it's better to have less water than too much um because you can literally add more water any point so i'm just gonna put this aside while it's heating up and what we need to infuse our soup is um some decart cannabis now this is just a bag from before it was the carbs but i'm just keeping it in there and i need fats okay so you can't extract the thc from the flour in the water on its own you need fat for it to bind to so you could use coconut oil you could use sesame oil which is what i'm going to use because i like to taste sesame oil with my um uh instant noodles um and if you didn't want to use this for soup like i said because you can use this for tea you can use this for anything i would recommend something more like coconut oil because it has a more mild flavor um taste whatever but yeah so you could use this and make an iced tea with it right like that would be good actually that would be really good i think i might do that i am going to be using peanut butter and soybean oil for it's not soybean sesame oil for my um fats for my soup because when i make my instant noodle and i might accidentally call it mr noodle because in canada it's kind of just like the the go-to brand and i in my head i call this noodle but um i add peanut butter and um sesame oil to it anyway and they're both fat so this is like the perfect solution um i add a bunch of couple things that make it taste like so good um and i'll add it after but uh you don't need to you just need a fact okay any kind of fat coconut butter soy bean sesame olive peanut butter doesn't matter butter okay so we don't need this coconut oil because i was just showing that uh for demonstration purpose says options and then you're going to need um instant noodle packages package singular um or you know mr noodle not my stranger that's what this uh chicken noodle soup or chicken noodle soup mix or any type of soup mix or anything you want to add to your cannabis water so while we have this heating up here i am going to add in my fats so i'm going to start in by adding about a tablespoon of my sesame oil and i'm not measuring it because it doesn't really matter that much because i'm going to be adding probably more fat than i need anyway um but i think i'm gonna add about a tablespoon of peach so we have our tablespoon of i'm gonna keep calling the wrong thing sesame oil which smells and tastes so good and i'm gonna add a tablespoon ish of um peanut butter actually more than a tablespoon because i really like peanut buttery taste in my um soup so this is more than a tablespoon but this is how much i'm adding and the water's not warmed up yet so that peanut butter is not going to fall off just yet so i'm just going to leave my spoon in there so it can melt off until it warms up okay so we got our fats in there and now we need to add our cannabis in so i am going to be a little bit extra here and um oh well you'll see what i'm doing but um you can put your canvas in there one you can put it all straight in there and um not strain it out and eat the cannabis flower left over whatever but like i don't want that i'd rather strain it and there shouldn't be much thc left in it by the time you're done with it so there's really um that's not necessary so you're gonna at the end a lot of people um will run it through a strainer or they will um put it through cheesecloth or et cetera et cetera but i it just seems like i feel like we could do this an easier way right um so i went to the dollar store and tried to find something that would work um like a deep sitting mesh whatever this is called but i couldn't find any so i bought this one and i'm going to cut it and you could use like a big tea thing like this and the reason why i'm doing they do make smaller ones that would have fit in here but i wanted to have like as much uh i wanted it to like be able to like float freely right i didn't want to have the cannabis all like stuck in one spot if i feel like it's gonna extract better when the liquid and the fat is able to like fully get on all um sides of all the cannabis so i bought this and i have my uh wire cutters i think they're called and i'm going to cut the mesh out like obviously you can cut your fingers doing this so be careful okay our water is um starting to simmer and heat up and we don't want this to be boiling we want it to be simmering so i'm going to turn the heat down now to a low-ish heat hello-ish medium so it's simmering but not boiling okay no matter how hard i try like no matter how hard i try i cannot cut it with the wire cutters um maybe they were just not good enough so i got these like plier things and i'm like just pulling it out of the like just completely taking it out this is like just maybe do this like outside or somewhere because there's little pieces of uh metal or mesh coming off so i'm just gonna finish this outside the easiest way to do this would have been to do it um in the pot when there was no liquid in it but i wanted to do it on camera but yeah that way then you could kind of like shape it uh you could shape it to the pot and now we can put our weed in so i will post the link um below for both how to de-carb your weed and how to figure out how much thc is in it so you guys can figure out how much you want to put um if you're completely like unsure of how much to put you could put like about the same amount as you put for um the fat right so i have put like two tablespoons of fat maybe a little bit more and i'm probably going to add i'm going to add a little bit less than that but maybe like one tablespoon i'm going to do one brown so i had just decarb some weed yesterday i just did it in my leftover and then i just put it in here to keep it fresh so i'm just going to weigh this out my scale male functions and that was definitely more than one gram it's probably like two grams but um i have high tolerance if you don't have high tolerance start low and be more careful with it but if you do have a high tolerance you're probably fine like me to just take your chances i'm not recommending you do that i'm just saying i'm just saying let's get all the rest of that and again we're not having our water boiling or having it simmering i'm just gonna put my crumbs does anybody else do that like take their crumbs and like put it in it's like kinda okay now all i have to do is let this simmer for 20 minutes to like a half an hour um and like i said and i'm gonna keep saying don't have it um boiling just keep it simmering and you can stir it around occasionally but you don't should be fine without it um but yeah just keep an eye on it and we're gonna cook this cook it for um about 20 to 30 minutes so here's how it looks we just have it on um what is it on it's on like three and a half there it's a little bit too high to be honest i'm gonna lower that a bit because this is that's actually like on the verge of boiling there so we'll turn that down and make sure all of the flour is submerged because it's my mesh thing um it's kind of getting stuck on the side so maybe i honestly don't know how good of an idea this mesh thing was sometimes i i think i have like really good ideas and then i try and execute them and like and like trying to see it from like outside perspective and i'm like they're probably thinking this girl's dumb but um we're on crack i i've definitely been told that people call me crackhead all the time on my youtube videos i can't help that actually yeah i can okay um i don't know i still like it and i wasn't gonna waste my four dollars i spent on that mesh since i already started taking it apart you know also why do i always say no okay we've been cooking for about 20 minutes and i think i'm going to do another 10 minutes why you ask i don't know just because i'd rather get more than less you know oh my god if i say you know one more time i swear okay i'm gonna try and see how it tastes to see if we can see how it's going oh my god the embarrassment this mesh thing is i don't know what i was expecting it tastes like that's literally oil and peanut butter yeah ten more minutes okay i'm gonna prepare my other ingredients for it to make it extra delicious also i don't really smell it but at the same time i'm used to it so so since it's almost done i'm going to add in my other ingredients um this isn't necessary for anything other than flavor right so like skip if you want but if you want something tasty and you like like peanut based and like spicy and like yummy add these wow english okay but yeah you don't have to add these things this is just because this is how i like my stupid taste you could add oregano you could add parsley you could add onion you could add you could make a whole soup you could add carrots you know um but then you have to strain them out so that's a whole issue i would wait till after so i do some honey okay a little bit more i know you like honey ew but i love my sweet and sour i mean you can barely taste honey then we have rice vinegar a little splash of rice vinegar and then i'm gonna do some soy sauce and some chili flakes too after we'll grab those flakes i love flakes so we're almost done we're at about 30 minutes or just about 30 minutes and it's looking really good it's smelling good and shortly we're just gonna take it off of the strainer so i believe it's safe to say that this strainer thing was the dumbest idea i've ever had because i could have just put the strainer over the bowl and poured it embarrassing okay so it's been on here for like a little bit over 30 minutes taking it off simmering the whole time not boiling i stirred it around in my bowl i have frozen broccoli because i'm not eating very many vegetables these days because i'm lazy and i figured out frozen broccoli is a great addition to the noodles but not when noodles are by themselves but when you add those ingredients i said mm-hmm like so good so so so good i'm gonna be using my mr noodle spicy chicken mr noodle is like a popular instant ramen i used to say raymond until one day i figured out it wasn't raymond it was ramen like how embarrassing how many times you think i said that out loud everybody loves raymond you know okay so i'm going to take this out i'm honestly embarrassed about how stupid this idea was so dumb and i'm good i'm going to put it back in the bowl which i could have done this the whole time and i'm going to pour my um soup and i'm just uh oh my god i forgot to add the noodles and the seasonings so at this point this is when you add your stuff i'm going to turn the heat back on because we gotta cook these noodles a little bit um and if you weren't making noodles and you're making a tea or whatever you could um you could put this coconut oil and water combination in like a jar put it in the fridge and then you could pull it out and warm it up and make some tea with it or add some water enhancers whatever so just add my noodle how am i gonna strain the noodles out okay maybe this wasn't that bad an idea after all so put my noodles in this video is definitely like i could have been like a three minute video instead of whatever this is going to end up being um please tell me what you guys think would you have liked if i when i realized how stupid of an idea this mesh thing was if i would have like just completely took it out of the video and like pretended this never happened or do you guys enjoy watching me mess everything up i don't know let me know because i don't know okay so i'm just cooking my noodles in the water the juice um and there's actually less liquid than i wanted because um it evaporates pretty quickly if you're letting it simmer for like over half an hour so i'm just going to add some more water and i'm going to turn the heat up more let me show you guys what we're working with here watch me spill it noodles fat and liquid and you want to make sure when you're straining everything out like not that the fat would get stuck in here but the fat is what is containing most of the the thc right so you want the fat that's the good part so i'm just gonna cook my noodles and i'm gonna pour it into my um see you can even see some of like the fat stuck to the bottom of this so i'm just gonna try and press as much of that out as i can use my fingers here oh yeah yeah can you guys see that get all the good stuff i can't believe to waste that also you don't have to strain the flour out because um you could eat it i don't want to though just because i just don't want to and um i'm not serving this to anybody obviously otherwise like gross um i can't believe i almost forgot to strain that out just ignore me i'm so sorry i hope you guys don't hate this video okay for me my noodles gonna go wash my paws and then we're gonna eat and then i'm gonna show you guys how it's like when i'm done and it's kicked in a few hours later i just need to show you guys like look at all that fat that's like the peanut butter and come on there we go like the peanut butter and fat mixture that i like squeezed out of um that remaining amount oh yeah look at those colors the green the pink that looks good okay our noodles are almost cooked and we are almost ready to eat oh boy do you ever look tasty let me just let me try a little bit of that oh i hate human okay our noodles are cooked i'm gonna pour my soup here i am i'm gonna pour my soup into my bowl splashy splash i feel like we should scrape some of that up here i mean there's not really much to scrape i feel like that might be kind of like the the fat sitting on the edges but i don't like wasting things so i'm like i feel like i will just like i'll literally lick it after because i'm just like any bit that i can not waste better i'm very frugal i don't like wasting not like actually never mind okay yeah see there we go yay snack time i mean lunch bone apple tea i wonder if it's a good enough temperature because um the broccoli cooled it down a bit since it was frozen sorry so there's something in my teeth okay oh my god i forgot the seasoning mat so like this doesn't taste as good as usual what is going on what is wrong with me one second okay i got the mix you guys i'm sweating and dying your feet but i have to keep my clothes on usually i would like to take them off well like i'd wear like a smaller top because it's so hot and the windows closed so it's not so loud and noisy for you guys but then everybody's gonna complain about how i'm not wearing enough clothes like does it really bother you that much although it's interesting because it's usually only women who complain about what i'm wearing hmm oh my gosh i've never tried this sauce mix on its own but that reminds me when i was younger and i'd like really want to um uh i'd really want to you guys i haven't even ate this soup yet why am i acting like i have uh i used to love like eating them in the package when you like broke them up um and like put the seasoning eggs my mom didn't let me because i wasn't healthy you know i was like i wish i was allowed to eat that but it wasn't okay it smells like herbal soup let's give it a try temperature is pro oh yeah that's good very very good i never used to really like mr noodle or instant noodles but um can skip over me eating this if you like because i'm not gonna probably say anything that it's like information you need to know to make it this is more just for my peeps who my peeps for my friends my my best buds for my people who like are like i'm not functioning properly today i honestly could use some salt um and this looks like all the msg it already has i'm a salt addict i can't help it i honestly do want to add some more salt or maybe some soy sauce it would have been better with more peanut butter and honey but they're very high calorie and the soup is ready oh soy sauce is good by itself too yum but yeah i never used to like mr noodle because or instant noodles because i'm just like they're just not that good until i added like lots of peanut butter and it's just like game-changing peanut butter and then some acidity from the rice vinegar and the sweetness from the honey honestly it tastes better without the

give you these right yeah fake Oreos I got you something those are good is much filling in these I got you the best the leaning", "oUg7W9EtOyE": "[Music] this video will show you how to properly use your sublingual trochee also known as the trish or a lozenge this is a dissolvable medication that can be made with a gelatin or wax base to use your trophies first you'll want to wash your hands with warm soapy water before getting started it comes in a prescription container like this so you'll want to take the prescription cover off and then this plastic packaging to make it a little bit easier to work with you can actually twist and kind of select the packaging to loosen it and one side comes with the lid so you can open that lid up and then you'll see that they're pretty easy to separate and if you want to make make it a little bit easier you can flip it and kind of push one out so that would be one method of dispensing and you can see that's easily flexing out or you can flip it back around and then kind of play around with the pieces until you get them out but they should easily kind of separate once you play around with ink come out as a clean piece if the doctor prescribed less than a full trophy it is scored and easy to cut with a knife in 2/4 or 1/2 if needed the trophy should be used as directed by your physician it can be placed either between the teeth and the gums the side of your teeth or under the tongue allow it to fully dissolve for complete absorption of the medication this can take up to fifteen to thirty minutes the goal is to have the medication enter your system through the oral mucosal membrane layer through your skin rather than being swallowed do not eat drink or brush your teeth for 30 minutes after using the medication it is best practice to rotate the location where you place the troche to prevent any irritation these medications can be sweetened or flavored upon request due to the sweetness or flavor of this medication be sure to keep it out of reach from children most trophies do not need to be kept refrigerated they can be stored in a cool dry location or at room temperature do not leave them in your car in direct sunlight or warm places because they can melt if you have any further questions feel free to call our pharmacy at seven one four four six five nine three three four or visit us on the web at blue coast pharmacy com [Music]", "BVeNyeJ2f5s": "direct connection is made by MPT to serve all of our diverse communities and is made possible by the generous support of our members thank you live from Maryland public television this is direct connection with Jeff Salkin welcome to direct connection we are live tonight from the state's largest grower of medical marijuana these plants which it would be illegal to have outside of this building are the beginning of the growing process here at curio wellness joining us is Michael Braun fine curio CEO thanks for having us nice to come in Jeff first question is why am I wearing the bunny suit because this is a plant where we grow raw material to create medicine and so under FDA regimes it has to be hygienic we don't use any type of pesticides insecticides or any other crop control agent except or law of water and fertigation and people may hear this is a noisy environment it's the air purification it's bright LED lights tell me about the business this has been live for over a year now what's happened in that here it's been an exciting time and candidly a lot of time of great learning when you undertake a new disruptive industry you build a theoretical model about what you think it's going to be and then you create an actual operating plan and then you learn you've made plenty of mistakes and I've played it wrong in substance but you had some good ones also and and so we have evolved literally 180 degrees over this first year through a lean management system and some other techniques we use to the point where this is a very well oiled machine now where we're delivering large quantities a product every week with no defects and great customer satisfaction globally we got beyond your company what's happened to medical cannabis in over the last year or two I think it's become more more accepted as a true medicinal product and I think some of the historical negatives or things that people thought they were probably aided by the government with your Falls are starting to clear way so it's kind of dark clouds going away and interestingly the largest cohort of growth for us has been baby boomers and I suspect first of all they probably had some castle experience back in college but more importantly they got a lot of aches and pains and traditional medicines can sometimes be interactive in a way that's not very good and the medicinal cannabis plan is very safe it has very low interaction tolerance so it allows you to use it with many other things at low levels in a very effective way let's explain how the system works in Maryland designed by the legislature there are licenses for growers and retailers essentially and somebody in the middle what what do you have so there are three different licenses there is a cultivation license to grow the plants there is a processing or manufacturing license to create the product that is in some other form you extract the oil from the plant and then you turn it into other pills capsules like and then there's a retail distribution network those are the dispensaries we're fortunate to be one of seven companies that has all three licenses but our primary business is to enable the success of the dispensers across the state by giving them our products on a very regular and consistent basis you're a business guy trail of successful healthcare businesses private equity businesses so you didn't come into this I don't believe as a marijuana expert you've learned something about these plants the things behind us the big ones it looks like a topiary a sort of thing and then we have these little cuttings yes sir these came from that that's correct these are called mother plants we use a cloning process so that we could get the genetics from a particular strain exactly the same from crop the crop plant the plant so we have a proprietary process for picking seeds turning them into the best by winning out the weaker genetics through both growing and testing we have a lab here and then once we get to the prime prop if you will will use one of these mother plants for approximately four months the first thing we do with the new mother is we take cuttings and start creating the new baby that's going to become the next mother because these mothers have a useful life where the quality of the plant is determined by how many cuttings you click that as it gets older they diminish in quality so we focus on measuring certain cannabinoid content and other markers of health and yield and we try to maximize the life of the plant to optimize that yield let me remind our viewers if you have a question about medical cannabis shortly we're going to be talking to the head of the pharmacy the dispensing operation you can send us an email no phone calls tonight but send an email to live questions at mptv.org and we'll try to get your question answered during the program what's your competition like and and how do you do things differently than the rest of the market well one of a very few that are only dedicated to medicinal cannabis we are not in favor of nor do we want adult use because we think Maryland is a place where we can build an ecosystem in an industry that creates exportable intellectual property and products and we'd like to see that happen in fact we've just worked with the legislature on a new bill to allow for academic research here in Maryland and so most of the companies haven't made the investment in the pharmaceutical grade environment and equipment that we've had and they don't have people from big pharma like we have we're working with chemistry and drug discovery and such things there are some very fine companies out there and then there's some companies that really just want to grow cannabis because they think it's a good thing and they think they can make money doing it but they're not dedicated to the investment research and development that we are the trend is moving in the direction as you said of varying degrees of legalization whether recreational becomes law in Maryland at some point or not but federal law has changed Congress passed President signed a bill and I think it was a side item in the bill but it makes CBD and I get that letters mixed up that's correct but it basically legalizes CBD and hemp is that right it legalizes the CBD that's derived from him CBD could come from hemp or it could come from the cannabis plant they're both derivative of an original plant the hemp plant has very very low acid less than 0.03 percent THC the psychoactive agent that's in cannabis in if it were to qualify for his half and so now because of the farm bill which what you're referring to people will be able to on a state-by-state basis decide what level of participation the Hef market they want so they've kind of maybe the state's Rights Act but with a pure go-ahead from the federal government CBD is the stuff that gets all the press lately does it affect your business model if somebody without all of this investment overhead it can grow acres of hemp and refined CBD out of it less expensively potentially yes and no it really doesn't because in our case we could grow at very low costs and in addition we have to have certain levels of purity and we don't know yet if hemp can deliver that because we've never work with it but we know we can get it from cannabis so we now a full flower or hygienic cultivation chambers we call them that's filled with a 18 to 1 CBD to THC ratio plant which we use for our CBD products ultimately I think if it is available and it's pure we'll buy it as a raw material just like we buy other raw materials that we don't create on our own first question in my email how can somebody invest in this industry your privately held but not everybody is there is a about 30 or 40 new newly minted canadian public stocks to which actually trade on american exchanges and so you can pick through one of those one of our local competitors here we happen to think a lot of is a company called GTI they've recently went public so you know there's a lot of companies out there that we think are very good but their public this is a family-owned business we have outside investors but we're going to continue to just build it and grow it and keep it i have a bunch of emails on some of the more technical questions about prescribing so what we're going to do is take a break and we will come back with your clinical director as direct connection continues on MPT got an unused vehicle going nowhere donate it to the one place that can take you anyplace visit

potential for greatness [Music] CBS CBS CBS [Music] back live at curieux wellness at an undisclosed location in Baltimore County I'm joined by Brian sanderoff who runs the side of the business that sells things to people how do you describe what you do over there so on the general manager and the clinical director of the dispensary so my job is to make sure that one we're helping patients making sure that they're getting the right products the right way counsel patients all day long also make sure that we're living up to all of the regulatory requirements that we don't do anything wrong what's the last year they've been like for you it's been a whirlwind it's just unbelievable so our dispensary has been open for about 10 months 11 months now and it's just been fantastic surprise after surprise every day I get up excited to go to work seeing what I'm going to learn let me ask you a slightly skeptical question which is what I do I mean clearly a lot of people are being helped by this but you also read increasingly about people smoking this stuff psychoses impaired driving how do you think about the balance between taking the good stuff and and people maybe not knowing what to do with the dangerous parts so the way that I approach to this is that I want people to be able to use this in a guided way and using it in an unguided way it's much more likely to cause problems than if you're using it guided properly so that plant contains hundreds of bioactive compounds and matching the right ones to the right person with the right condition is how you eliminate or real you know lower the chance of having problems the intermediate step that Michael was talking about between grow these things and sell this stuff which we'll talk about right describe the functionality there how does it work and and how is it evolving it's amazing the way it's evolving and especially the way that we occur you go after it making sure that what we're making is reliable it's repeatable we know it's going to be effective for people more like a pharmaceutical than it is an herb more the science than the art of using this medicine we we mind the research we do some research on our own we put together products that we think are going to be effective we test them alright we haven't we haven't talked about this stuff before but but I'll ask it in terms of the most common complaints that people walk in the door with and and how some of this may be able to help me Payne definitely I can't tell you how many patients I have who are no longer on opioids where they were six months ago a year ago sleep is a big issue a lot of autoimmune diseases things like ms neurological problems like Parkinson's or ALS anxiety all right so what might you yeah a whole variety of products that are available here in all sorts of different forms so this is a container that would actually contain the flour the raw flour that someone would grind down and then either smoke or consume with the vaporizer these are packages for the actual vapes that we have and so this is an oil that someone would attach to a battery and vaporize that there are pre-rolled cannabis products I'm sorry we used to call these joints now they're called free rolls right or there's all sorts of ways to consume the medicine in a different way so this is a tincture that somebody would put underneath their tongue and it would absorb through the mucosa in their mouth there's some advantages to doing it that way one of the things as a pharmacist I love about that is that I can be very very specific with the dosage that I'm giving somebody there are topicals there are all sorts of concoctions that people use viewer writes in and says you mentioned not being completely supportive of recreational abuse can you elaborate on that so as I said I want people and it's funny because I don't even think in terms of adult use versus medical anymore I just think in terms of guided versus unguided and what I want to do is make sure that people are using this medicine in the most appropriate way for them and there could be lots of ways that it may be used inappropriately maybe there's interactions with prescription medicines that they're on maybe the combination of cannabinoids that someone uses isn't really good for someone that has anxiety and so I just want people to use it in a guided way how good is the data that the guidance is based on it gets to this email from a viewer for adults over 50 who need to manage pain are there long-term studies concerning short and long term memory loss so yes there are although I have to say that a lot of the studies don't come from the United States because of the constraints that have been put on cannabis here in the in the United States it's been difficult for institutions to do the kind of studies that we're used to but we can look to Israel we can look to Europe we can look to Canada where they've been doing studies and there are the short-term memory thing is completely manageable if we're using the right combination of medicine and if it were to happen to somebody when they stopped using the medicine that problem has a tendency to go away but I can tell you with 11 months of clinical experience I have not seen that problem how does it work in Maryland the nuts and bolts of it somebody can't just walk in off the street to your office and walk out with something correct so the step one is they have to become registered they do that online they go to the MMC C which is the Maryland medical cannabis commission website click on the button for patients and you upload some information and then you become registered that process right now is taking somewhere between two and four weeks assuming all those things are correct you'll get a 16 digit number that starts with the letter P for patient step two is then to become a certified patient which means you have to go to a prescriber or a recommender who will certify that you are a valid patient for using cannabis once that done then you can go into a dispensary and get medicine there was a pretty liberal definition of who the prescribers can be here right you don't have to be an MD well so you could be an MD you can be a nurse practitioner you could be a podiatrist or a dentist if I if I had that correct they all have to be able to prescribe controlled substances right now so you have to have a c.d.s license to be able to recommend this okay viewer wants to know can medical cabinet cannabis alleviate pain from Lyme disease have you seen Lyman I've had several patients that I can think of right away that have had success with that so it's not necessarily the Lyme that it's treating it's the pain part of that cannabis has shown to be has been shown to be anti-inflammatory very very helpful for pain well let's see the question about him and I asked Michael about this this earlier the federal government basically legalizing CBD through the hemp channel that's on that we use it we sell it to our patients they don't have to be members or registered within the Commission to be able to use it basically you can get it over the counter okay see so you can sell some stuff to people who are not registered that's correct so hemp Durai of CBD doesn't really have THC in it and can be very effective although I'll tell you that clinically most of us feel that CBD with at least a little bit of THC is more effective than CBD by itself okay all those letters confuse me a little bit THC is the stuff that people who are into recreationally that's the that's the one where you can feel some euphoria from where has CBD been tested I mean what do we actually know about it other than it's hot at the moment well it has been tested and we do see results with pain for anxiety for energy helping with sleep if that sleep problem is related more to anxiety and pain muscle relaxation seizures immune function all of those issues or conditions have been shown to be helped by CBD CBD from hemp hemp is sort of like a cousin of cannabis so it supplies the CBD which is another can happen I didn't by the way there's I think they've discovered over a hundred different cannabinoids now and so when you and I have this discussion in a year and then another year we'll we'll know so much more how often do people consult dr. Google before they they come see you in other words how much how much research are our people doing how accurate is the stuff that people find online about these products I'd say the accuracy is about the same as in regular medicine when people consult doctor Google you can find some good information and some bad information that's why people come to us that's why I'd like to see people use it in a guided way and use it that guidance from a health professional who understands biochemistry potential interactions with other medicines that someone might be using I would say that a lot of my patients especially the sort of cannabis naive patients they haven't done any research they've heard about it either from their doctor or from a neighbor they get certified and then they come in and then they rely on us to help educate them what's happening in the medical community so you were a long-term licensed pharmacist do you think the establishment the medical establishment is becoming more favorable not to what degree what do you think what do you see yeah there's sort of three camps out there and there's the ones who are the adopters who understand it who see results with their patients and like it there's that camp that says I'm not sure I don't know about it and then there's a camp that says no you can't use it or you shouldn't use it and so I'd say it's changing and it's it's shifting and probably this shift is most responsible for that shift is patients coming in telling their doctors that they're getting results very good Brian sanderoff curio Wellness thank you for

curio wellness Michael Braun fine is the CEO here how many are standing next to a lovely plant by the way how many how many folks have you hired in starting this up so far we've had 105 people and I'm proud to say that over the course of the first 18 months 18 of them have been promoted from an entry-level job to a mid manager from amid to a higher level and we instituted once we passed over break-even a living wage so our minimum wage in this building is $15 what are most of those folks doing I know there's a big production operation here yes what are most of the jobs like so there's really kind of semi skilled and highly skilled so 70 school would be people that do horticulture preparation pruning planning all the things required to tender to the plants and then the trimming curing and packaging lumber those take various levels the skill sets that we've developed trading programs and best practices around all those on the manufacturing side we have chemists we have pharmacologists we have people who are involved in analytical work and so there's a number of advanced degree people who are doing drug discovery formulation and then we have a manufacturing team who takes the oil that we create they purify they separate it and then they create recipes and we create products where do you think there might be misconceptions among regulators among your fellow business people among members of the public about just what has happened since this might live in Maryland and and what the business is all about I think probably the first misconception is that people don't appreciate the level of quality the maryland program has we have an excellent testing protocol here so the public is getting very safe product no medals no pesticides no contaminants of all and and all of us all the growers in this state have to abide by a very very strict regulatory regime for hygienic quality so we're providing cannabis and cannabis derived products that are highly pure where can people get more information well they can go to our website curie wellness.com they can go to the maryland medical cannabis commissioner by the way we call it cannabis not marijuana it's its proper name so well I say can I say marijuana sometimes so people understand what I'm talking about we're trying to change the conversation that's a lot of part of what our strategy's about it talking about science and facts as opposed to other things so but the the Maryland medical cannabis commission website is also a good spot very good Michael Brown find CEO here thanks for the time thanks for making us sort of look funny and appreciate it thank you for joining us for direct connection we're back Thursday with your money & business and I joined this Friday for state circle and a full wrap-up on the week's news from Annapolis please follow us on Twitter at MPT News Now for all of us at MPT thanks for watching and have a good night [Music] [Music] this program was made by MPT to serve all of our diverse communities", "hebvgdlyzYQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] good morning so I finally made it and I am now in drum roll made as a candidate I got here last night around like I want to say three four in the morning I would have blogged like me driving stuff but that's kind of boring and I would have did customs but customs is not name playing no games at that border she was not only I was some little friendly stuff she was not only and I pulled up somebody come on radio off I said he gets he'll be twice miss lady turned it off and she asked me five thousand questions literally questions I don't even understand why you need to know the answer to well how much money do you have on you why do you need to know that everything is just so nice here like it's just generally just nice the view is nice the Sun feels nice low you can see the Sun reflecting off my skin right now but I will say last night when I got here there was snow on the ground not like three inches of snow heavy snow but really I was driving around through some of the neighborhoods and stuff and they were powerless no yards full of snow and now I wake up this morning to sunnysean it and there are people downstairs swimming in the pool so our regions don't know how things work at Toronto it's clearly they just do it different here apparently you can snow one day and then you wake up and go swim in the next so hey I'm not gonna complain I'm gonna go put my swim trunks and I'm gonna go get in that pool later today but for now I'm just get my day started on the shower get dressed for today and then I'm gonna go explore some of the smoke shops because weed is legal in Canada so I'm gonna go see what's that's like I see if they got a gasser another thing I know gasps I'm gonna clown the whole store because you just cannot have a weed shop used to finish smelling rage now after that I'm gonna get some lunch or something and then I'll probably go I don't know today I'm in like a relaxing move so maybe I should go do some chilled stuff like our own little Museum or something go get a massage go spicy a little bit see what I can get myself into see if I can find a place to take pictures at and then after that I'll probably try to get some more food well let you see what we get let's just see where the day takes me I fell to the small shop that's my first mission smoke shops cuz I have to go see this is gas or not cause if it's not gas listen all right to get ready and we gonna air through the smoke shops okay so the hard part is now finished I got already did everything I had to do have my little pre-party turned up in my hotel room now the first stop is to go get lunch so I was looking online and the first thing God that popped up for like good food places he was plantain and it's supposed to be like this vegan place and I'm like have vegan have ice to eat chicken tenders whatever is not that it's not important but we're gonna try a plan to see if it's any good and then what you don't see what a day takes us hopefully Fanta is good because honestly I'm very hungry like very very hungry and I just don't have time for my foods to not be good because if my food is not good it's just gonna be a bad time all around for everybody involved all parties the waiter the manager the doorman the security guard at the parking lot everybody's gonna have a bad day if this food is bad but it is cross no bad vibes we gon expect this to be good let's hit the planter and dad so I just left plants on not too long ago the food is actually really good it fills you up really fast I wasn't able to finish my whole meal but I got the general gist of it and it was actually really good um I had an energizer shot the orange drink that was an energizer shot and it had like ginger in it that was actually to me nasty but it's only because I don't like ginger not because of anything else the lemonade was good fries are good they had some like dipping sauce I don't know what it was she said it was like dijon or something but I didn't hear what she said so now I am on my way to the smoke shop that is on the corner it's either this tree that I'm walking towards or the other Street but I'll figure that out after I start walking I guess I'm gonna go see what the smoke job is about hopefully they got good guess so that okay no you have seen but somebody will see what that's about hopefully I let me record in there if they don't then I'll try to like sneak a couple get a couple videos or something for ya everybody can see what's going on in the smoke shop because I'm curious as to how they do this here in how they I'm curious to how they go about the we stuff here too because it's legal here but it's not legal in the state so I'm wondering we don't see how they um how do you operate with the whole week [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I'm back from the smoke shop back in my hotel room and I got some food on the way to the smoke shop was crazy it's like a whole like personal shopper in it like somebody follows you around a store but I don't follow you but like you can go up to somebody and ask them like oh can I get some help and then they have like this little tablet thing where they walk around the store with you basically and tell you about each turn each other disposable pens the pre-rolls all type of stuff while you were on tell you about everything the name she rang you up on the thing and he goes at the front and check out they do ID you at the door though because I think in Canada you have to be 19 in order to buy legal marijuana but yeah that was super dope and then food was I just went to the bottom the floor level in my hotel and got a turkey burger from the little cafe down there but let me show you what I got from the hallway story so this is the bag it comes in I spent honestly I could not tell you how much I spend was in Canadian dollars and not a US so I don't know I spend a hundred twenty Canadian dollars it you know either convert that to us okay this is afraid it's already open don't don't only or nothing this is a disposable DAP in whoa there's disposable with THC pen it's tangerine dream innocence sativa him and it actually tastes just like oranges like its Lily just like oranges I don't really like it because I don't like oranges blood is what is the actual pin looks like it's already at the box because I was ripping it in a car I poured it like 20 times so there's that that was the disposable pan was 38 Canadian dollars again if you know how to convert it you got it okay this is the good supply Royal Highness pre-rolled blowing that's what it looks like it's not open yet because I didn't phone my readers need to bless yet that was 14 canadian dollars and as you can buy them one for you come bottom as singles or you can buy them in like some of them come in packs how about when it's a pack this is a single so it was one for one gram but then some of them say like five four five minutes which means that there's five blunts in there well five four one gram so it'll be five blunts in there at each dunno one gram this is an indica THC pyro blunt this is oh it's called Soleil oh this is there were new strands it's a reduced rate this is the one that grows only about its carbon new it's an indica and this is a female but it's 10 Canadian dollars and it's 14.5 so this is 0.5 Grambling also I'm not at telling nobody to smoke I'm not advocating nobody to go smoke out their smoke I'm just saying this is what I do she's known to get her money on me but I'm not very smart this is the houndstooth hybrid notice it's a sativa help sooth sativa one gram this is the actual flower here they call them flowers this is the actual like look you gotta roll up it you know this person got explaining this off this is the five things I was talking about so there's five pre-roll blessing here and there each one gram this is the the boss it's called the Boston Tea Party yeah and that is 31 Canadian dollars and these are it doesn't say but I'm trying to remember where I picked them up at in a store I want to say it's a sativa yeah it definitely is yes is this even yeah so that's pretty much I don't like to see what the rest of this stuff just all these products hitting like again I'm sure yeah that's pretty much it for today I just pick up tomorrow I started doing more stuff but let's taking the view one last time before a game for the day [Music] [Music]", "YwmemYVLehg": "real life I'm doing it's not okay unless you feel right everybody can hear me okay never done this before so just gotta get the tangle that's okay how's it been doing so this recipe is pretty pretty easy all you need is your strawberries and you want them dry and the nice firm berries you don't want the ones with the marks and stuff like that cuz they'll go mushy if you're gonna eat them lick right away the softer berries are okay but the recommend harder berries let me grab the wrong path and look through them so where's everybody from everybody can hear me okay so what we want to do is turn up the heat to medium so it's about four on my Abu and today you're going to need sugar just granulated sugar light corn syrup maybe it's a little too bright it's not better it's a better Tucson we want the light on or off office more better are we okay so anyways I don't have any long wooden dowels you should probably use those but I'm just gonna use some of the harder to fix these guys got like a bit of a thicker end on them I'm going to just jab the very you just want to take off the end here you want to leave on the the the whole thing and just take off the green bits and then I'll stab oh into there and then when your syrup is hot enough you'll be able to pour it and twirl it let's go as we go and we must get cracking on that because it takes a minute to get up to temp it sir these things are very handy to have their candy thermometers or deep fryer you can deep fryer with them to whatnot but very handy to have but if you don't have him candy thermometer if it takes about 20 minutes that medium to maybe just a little bit higher than medium heat and when the syrup is ready if you pour it into cold a cup of cold water and it supplies and it's cracky then I easily make dog if you pour it in the water into the cold water and it turns hard that's called the hard crack stage so you should be good alright so we want two cups of sugar you with a leftover sugar I'm going to make same banana cream flavor at hard candies because this is going to be way more than to cover these strawberries here all right so two cups of sugar you need 2/3 a cup of corn light corn syrup or in there it's pretty simple to make hard candy it's just a little bit of time and you got to be super in the safe department and then you want a third quarter cup of water I like using hot water because it kind of makes the melting process a little bit faster all right so that's going to take a few minutes to get going get the corn syrup off you just want to leave that be Charlie is doing some editing right now he's gonna taste the teeth it snaps once we're done here you're just being here bothering me anyway so just leave me be thanks for joining in everybody everybody's having to give me some fodder can you consult it we'll just start boiling away you don't need to turn a tournament or anything like that or stir it turn it stir it it will just do what it needs to do yeah he's on the couch jerking I meet some cauliflower soup today you're gonna get that finished up are you in CNF okay take a salt and who's on here and even smart dude over here he's got a new video right now making his brother sick themselves oh hey what did you be enough to diddle you speak a little money it's like the coronavirus is a good excuse for you to never have to come back in what anybody yeah whoa what's everybody teaching on right now 2:30 in the afternoon it's kickety-kick it appears kids get you it's really hard to focus on what you're trying to do and also focus on a chat to talk I don't know if you can see a thought better we've got a boil so Brett just over 100 Celsius and that will be 225 ish Fahrenheit for those folks and we're looking to try to get up to 300 Fahrenheit 150 Celsius everybody getting stuff done around the house since you're trapped there just everybody having right domestic with their partners everybody's just loving to do it all miss a little stink monkey what's everybody's favorite edible DEET is it cookie or muffin or is everybody has anybody like to cook savory foods with their medicinals does anybody have any good recipes it was like 28 questions coming at ya do seven domestics with you solve it just not putting things away you having to tell yourself twice in the eye CVD lozenges there a good burger or something some like nothing CBD or THC and the burger no meat itself or maybe make some type of something that goes on the burger that has the hash parts into it yellow cat maybe like a cheese sauce or something like that he could probably work the hash and you please root is he hopefully everybody let's these cooking shows but maybe give some more room get some ideas on what we might want to try and my favorite are the hard cinnamon candies that's probably not just a few to try and then I'm gonna make the hard candies with the rest everybody could still salt put this up it's a little bit over the way and higher just don't want it in the Chooch I'll get a stern talking-to terrible pretty soon does anybody cheat while they cook no at whenever Chris will bring me in a joint while I'm cooking or something I always feel like pinky Bundy you know and you see it in the beginning or she like drops her ashes into the hammock or something and stuff and just zero [ __ ] are given like that just reminds me of that so I try usually not to teach and cook too much food so just be careful one time my cousin she's wear fake nails and she made this lasagna and lost a nail but didn't know a fishy lost her nail in the lasagna or where she may have lost it right and she brought this lasagna to a family function and people I ate list is long yeah and she didn't tell people until afterwards that was disgusting I was very happy I didn't eat that lasagna so we're just waiting it's about like I said around in the 20 minute mark well it won't be able to see kinda how long the chat is but I figured you know instead of jumping the the candy making process I just show you up you know in full so you can decide if that's something you want to do for yourself or whatnot I'm pretty excited so yeah you just put your little guy on a skewer and when it's ready you just twirl it into the sugar you don't want like a super thick layer though just a nice thin crackly layer yeah do a little dance make a little image something get after net yes it can take a song while we're waitin everybody can hear me right I don't have the microphone plugged in I didn't want too much stuff around baby Jim burly there he is so if you seen puck ones Facebook we're changing the freezer shed into a chicken coop I'm gonna have chicken friends that's gonna lay egg ease for us I'm pretty excited I've already decided one of the chickens names is going to be Mable and I also enjoy the name Matilda need a little uh music maker in here play Jim Burley songs for friend seats make sure you go check out Jim burly's uh I should name one Kyle should night haha that's just chasing things though Jim really put your link up Jim burlap oh we're getting their checks for friggin ever all the frickin time making candies are so good they just take forever these are the candies I mean yesterday little uh marble sized ones it's well I have to get one of them you know salt these uh it's a fruit punch flavor these ones they're not bad at all don't teach the hash at all oh and when we're done they in the mix in just about three grams of rosin into the mixer pretty exciting I've got my two little monk meets on the show when I was a kid I got my ass kicked by a rooster we were playing by the pond and this thing decided it wanted to chase us and I'm not very good at like running and laughing and having a moment so I had to like stop and just scream and hope that the chicken would be more scared of me than I was a bit because like I just couldn't and it was getting me so that was my like defense mechanism it's like I'm an animal and scream at it and then it just left me alone then the next time it it got me and my tactic didn't work the second time because it came and got me and pecked me right on the shin bone big time hurt oh it's my friend of a time decided she was gonna like run - but then lock me out of the truck because that was our like safety thing that you know the rooster couldn't get in there but no no she just saved herself and I got [ __ ] over how are you doing full sand I'm pretty excited we're getting up there I might crank her up just a little bit to make things go a little bit faster but these candy thermometers are mucho good I watched that Jimmy sent me a video today and it was pretty friggin funny let me just socked if I could find it here real quick because it was a goodie you made me dunk my corn that was so friggin funny yeah don't be a [ __ ] I hope mine are nice to me because it will like really hurt my feeling it or not if you haven't paid attention over the years I'm a little bit sensitive in the animal department yeah we're doing it nothing with dipper word all of the sugars just gonna K forever I don't want to be attacked no I want them to be my friend I've been bidding lot binge-watching chicken raising videos and stuff and a little how much for something treats you can give them and different things and hopefully they'll have a good little life and you know as the years go on will improve and probably get more we're just going to get a couple three maybe up to five chickens and see how it goes comma comma comma comma come on sherry boil so what do we think we should try next on the THC well no not free-range so much like they're gonna have an area and stuff to be but I'm not ready for freer and jet I don't think my anxiety could handle it and I just got to see how things go and stuff but like the neighbor's dog gets out and runs over here and the cats get out and come over here and I just want to make sure that they're safe and stuff like that because like I'm not a kind of the kind of farmer that's gonna be like oh that's that's life you know like that's the way of fireman animals get got but it's preventable and you know I just need to do it the way and you give you up for a minute hmm but eventually you know maybe we get rid of some more stuff and make more room in the art and this or not and blah blah blah we could possibly have them free-range you know we have to get a fence yet and all that yeah when we do get the chip in them they fired out the chicken nuggets well I'll definitely cook with them and try to show everybody wall over at just about 250 right now we've got a few degrees go but see how long the process takes in actuality and like mucho danger like hospital up if you get burnt with that so you know don't do a bunch of dabs and carry on before you do you do this like make this a safety first priority not safety third come along to luck one puts the squawking chickens Jimmy Choo bad cuz they're gonna be on the other side of the yard so Jimmy Choo bad and it's not like we're having like a giant flock of them so and I mean it's no different than the dogs the neighbor's dog barked and belligerent but I'd find you know chickens probably less noisy than that well yeah that's exactly we got to like fix the holes in the fence that Rick cut before we could have chickens running around thanks Rick if anybody's in the area of in woods and has like chicken type of stuff or like extra chain-link fence or things like that but maybe they'd like to donate to the chicken kid just get a hold of me how you doing for Massachusetts I'd love to have a little a little piggy to but when we went and seen them and saved them and stuff that you know you got to have a lot of room and a lot of space for a piggy and like there there's no actual little piggies they get great big and they stink and they poop and they carry on and they need like appropriate spots you know mud to Rudin and different things and you know one day I would love to have like if we ever won lots of money or something ever happened in the favor of us being able to start an animal sanctuary or something I would love that big time we're getting there getting there slowly climbing up to the 300 mark we got a hundred and two people watching thank you everybody let's tuning in I'm kind of you know all over the place and you know once I kind of settle in on my nerves and getting things in order on how I want to show you and cook and stuff because it's kind of nerve-wracking but maybe you know each show will get better and we'll we'll learn as we go now you better settle down mr. Baker did you stick yourself I don't know we're not gonna kill the chickens they're our friends they're gonna be dirty scissors hopefully Gertie isn't a dick but she probably is cuz she doesn't see too many different things so she'll probably just stay in the house when I have to mine the chickens yeah give me a big thumbs up thanks bar we're getting there oh we're there all right so we can take out the thermometer shut off the thingy my hash he's gonna pop it off the heat my hash if you put it in the freezer first it comes off really easily and they're going to be a little bit of a mix can you still see all right yeah it's really for often gonna set the phone down function like a normal human being here for a second smells very in the Hashi alright so we shall start everybody's still saw I'm gonna take a bit of the mixture pour it over the strawberry and just like that well Elaine brown put it on a cold surface you also want to start with a cold strawberry sorry I gotta think what I'm doing here because I certainly don't want to burn myself we'll need all kinds of super chops hugging will be just be pissed right off because of burnt my sandwich makers but I mean it's a pretty simple process right please Shepard and if you find your mixture is getting a little bit thick oh good thing get a spoon there you can just pop it back on the heat okay this would just be a better process for me here there we go a ladle little dip it in give it a swirl there we go see you you figure it out as you go I'm uh I like to cook more than I like to bake because you don't have to follow the recipe so much you can kind of create your own how much for something and that's what I like to do to the best if anybody has any homemade recipes that they'd like to share with me give me a little message on my Instagram some always liking to learn and try new tasty helmet routes on things it's probably not a good spot for my phone do we have any artistes in watching right now my instagram is one pub life like the post things that make me happy on there and my how much for some things and of course all my pictures of a being great sees alright so there we go tasty here let's give it go you don't [ __ ] delicious alright so let the rest of it I'm going to pour in they've been a enough leave your breathe we're trying teach the strawberries how you done okay so now I got those on the go I just put my banana flavoring in and a little bit of green so we can make it a yellow color smells exactly like amoxicillin you might be like absolutely yelling now at my head right by the whatsit so I just got my silicone rubber mold totally it's like extra super braided just seemed like the program is that more better man I gotta get another one of these into myself yeah I wish there was people here and I can be like here try this their friend electus I'm gonna go get Charlie thumb just through your [ __ ] them we'll be right back see the only bad thing with these you got to eat them but oh alright so I'm going to pour my I can't eat a little bit still I kind of see what I'm doing a little bit so I'm still trying to come up with a way that I can pour each of these candies without it being like a complete mess I tried a stainless steel turkey baster but that doesn't work so I got the old knife and ladle but it kind of makes a little bit of a match so very nice a very holy I'm gonna be dead I still have to meet supper all right man these are [ __ ] tasty you got to try this at least once definitely like a little fun party thing yeah just making messes sorry I'm not being overly chatty but Jackson like yourself for a second definitely have to make a different type of the fruit - I saw that you can do mandarin oranges like that seems like something I might love making like a little not Sicilian candies right now they used to get wound when my mom would give me a mock Susilo know those like sick as [ __ ] as a kid like terrible stomach problems and other health issues and stuff though but anyways that's not wrong but my mom would give me like a mock Sicilian and it was like my go-go juice is like totally a placebo you know obviously was making me feel better but like it was like an instant feel better because it was delicious tasty little medicine and then the one time they gave my mom the strawberry kind and was not impressed about that get the other mold here finish this up thanks for tuning in with me everybody and I'm glad that it they turned out oh it's open they're tasty big-time you don't taste the hash at all I'm not a big fan of like super Hoshi edibles like no thanks I want it to taste good and you know like I can't I don't know how people do like the [ __ ] bazillion milligram edibles that just absolutely taste like kite I'd rather have a couple candies and maybe equal out to that much if I was if I wanted that much so I in my own baby bird so at least you know with this recipe you can get a bunch of candies made out of it and the little fresh candy tree all right not such but also would thoroughly enjoy evil - where was it going that oh yeah already can't remember we'll have to come back to me anyways let's do a little quick read-through yep Tiff's already dinked yep mama how terrible Brooklyn they are tasty as frig I'm gonna have to put them in little dish or something see you a couple or I'll be better if I cut a little bit of the great that way if they do melt a little bit we're not just gonna like completely on all the way but probably good if you have like a silicone mat and then you can just put it on there and then you won't have any of the breakage but there we go 509 big time so here are the gummies Ehrlich gummies the hard candies they're good pick your note okay I've got a little bit of moss on him but I was going fast the best works so then you better know it's like light up there that's good well everybody I think I'm unicolor quits I just want to say thank you big time for tuning in and I'll just show you the shades of the candy you know it's gonna take a few minutes for those ones to pardon but here's the shape of the candy good size case good so yeah if you have send me messages on maybe what you'd like to see and we'll try this again and meet something else how much for something thanks everybody bye for now how do you turn this off you sucked out of me you", "wYX_zhlTDr8": "you tried these new berries and cream starburst pardon me what could have stopped busters you just say very Larry's better than what else and cream Oh berries and cream berries and creams I'm a little out of those berries and cream there is a grave there is a pretty mom with a lot of those berries cream [Music]", "GlNRlD6udeA": "the heist but he's back he's back after an hour yes yes guys he's back he's back are you doing are you doing so roughly an hour late it's being literally about an hour and three minutes day but feel the effects I feel the effects very very nicely actually it feels lovely it's not overpowering or anything like that I really really enjoy it it's nice I don't think the 300 milligram sweets were quite enough for me I have quite a high tolerance to cannabis as you guys know you've seen more smoke but yeah you really really feel a nice effect from this like I said it's not overpowering I don't want to sort of - don't mean I'm not gonna sort of an uncomfortable position or place or anything like that I just feel really nice I feel good I feel like I put some games on I feel like I've got I'd be fighting for a walk I could be absolutely active scrappy-dappy-doo being stop it nor pussycat but yeah I feel I feel really good I feel really really nice on her I don't feel salt down all over or anything like that lovely I'm not see it's only it's only just being just over an hour and it does say quite clearly on the packet may take up two hours so delay by up to two hours okay so I'm probably not in the full of the effects as of yet anyway so it's probably a little bit more time I would say I think I'm just on a gradual buildup in a minute but I would say that after about half an hour I started to feel something which like so I didn't on the other packet of sweets at all I didn't it took like the full hour before I started getting the effects of it so it works a lot quicker but I'd probably put that down to me doing it first thing in the morning I'm not having anything to eat as of yet so so for me personally if I do have any of these sweets again I'm going to try my best to probably take them first thing privy inside you and I mean unless I've got loads of em and then I'll just wash them like anything but yeah if you just use them as medicine then yeah I think first thing in the morning for me works the and I'll be interested to see actually how long it lasts as well so be out feeling nice and feeling nice and I'm nice and relaxed nice and mellow nicely stoned in my body yeah just like not overpowering my vision feels a little bit like it's going a little bad times when I move my head's so definite strength to it but I personally think that I could eat a couple of packets of those no problem and it would be OK for me to do that I would recommend you guys do that obviously if you don't smoke a lot just you know mean they'd split up into 50 milligram pieces so it's really really good to go shoo just because I've taking a whole pot don't go do that please you know me know your body know your limits but for me it not problem been smoking quite a lot of years to be fair my tolerance is up there so but I think of ninja had taken for example that packet of sweets I think she'd be really really feeling it bang so a tolerance a little bit lower than mine Oh see I am the main smoker cheers guys so still on the black cheese loving it though does it make me feel like I want to stop smoking which is which is good although sometimes about as it was it's like I can't touch the smoke for hours but now I feel a right of your eye not a particularly high dosage for me but gets really good guys [Music] you're quite chatty as well I'm always chatting you know that my job really over chat in a minute nice pecked on me I've had a bomb since the last bomb over so again it's been an hour since all that bomb definitely like to try some more of these better bores I [Music] definitely like to probably get to a position where I can maybe have a couple of packs of em and see what they feel like but left me for me I've still got half of my speaker left which is just oh no I think I only have one mil of it or whatever it is but there's about half of it left night so starving hungry I'm gonna make a famous Ryan fecal pizza okay I will save a little drop of it just for the for the fecal hot chocolate cause I didn't want to do a thick hot chocolate as well but I'm gonna do yeah I'm gonna do a pizza with some Pico on it which is what like so Ryan eats it and he recommends it and I thought well do you know what that sounds really good last time I got it all over my teeth I've tried it in there's other ways you can do it as well but I think that defeats the way I really really really like the idea of that so I will try that I will try that definitely so I've seen a few people do the Pico pizza so yeah it's made me think hmm lot lot easier way to go down and a lot sort of safer in your body because you're digesting it with food at the same time lovely a little bomb well I'm a rocket oh dear cheers guys Cheers yeah I feel it [ __ ] lovely I feeling lovely nice they like say it might affect you differently if you take a packet about if you're like a one joint add a person and you know you you're not make particularly a heavy heavy smoker maybe you're not a smoker at all maybe that's the reason why you'll you know you're taking metaphors is because you don't like smoking so I would just say start with a low dosage and then just just build yourself up after an hour you'll get to feel whether you're comfortable or not and then obviously you can you can take another dose and so yeah don't do a packet in one go please please guys one love I'm fashioning I've been

then they're sour as [ __ ] too well i'm guessing yourself but this is what they look like how many are in here so i got one two so i have one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14. there's 14 little um um 14 little [ __ ] wow heads or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call them um they don't look like the [ __ ] regular warheads um every other [ __ ] review that i've been trying like the [ __ ] sour patch ones the watermelon ones really look like the [ __ ] regular candy um this one doesn't look like the regular warheads but or what the [ __ ] do the regular warheads look like anyways actually doesn't matter but i'm just trying to give you guys as much detail as i [ __ ] can um it doesn't say how much [ __ ] thc is per little little um little gummy or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it but it says the packet says it's 500 um 500 milligrams so we're just gonna [ __ ] take these shits and see what's up i mean all of them all fourteen is it fourteen i don't know i'm probably sleeping one two three four five six oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] again one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve three four yeah fourteen um but yeah they're regular as [ __ ] jelly beans or they taste like regular jelly beans i don't taste any weed i was just one of them they're not that sour i was over scared as well i think i was young i was gonna be on camera soured out and [ __ ] looking like my guy right here and [ __ ] um but damn [ __ ] jelly bean flavors are these either like the best jelly beans shits are fire i got me doing my happy dancing [ __ ] i get so i get so excited every time like i'm [ __ ] eating candy and [ __ ] or even when i'm [ __ ] eating too and i'm enjoying that [ __ ] i started dancing them like yesterday i was at ihop [ __ ] in my ass i'll just eating and [ __ ] all that happy um [Music] you know what they taste like or this one or basically all them they taste like those one [ __ ] long sour ropes with like different colors and [ __ ] like blue it's not like different ropes that are different colors but they're like a [ __ ] rainbow i don't know what the [ __ ] they're called but it tastes like that little sour ropes one two three four five six seven eight i just ate half of these [ __ ] it's still earliest oh no it's early we'll take a shower right now um hopefully you should snack we're gonna see if they make me feel different um or if they don't i'ma just be honest i have no [ __ ] hate against any company if it doesn't smack then it just didn't smack this it's not saying that they don't have any anything that [ __ ] smacks but i'm gonna just let you guys know if it just didn't hit me or or what's up i'm not gonna lie to you guys either all right we got two left that's all of them i enjoyed myself eating them for five the taste i gotta give it a 10 out of ten honestly i give some [ __ ] ratings on here i can say i'm not attending [ __ ] but my [ __ ] opinion doesn't [ __ ] matter speak from your own experiences and just try them honestly what i'm trying to do is like see if like if you guys seen these in a local dispensary if you guys are thinking of trying them but you guys wanted to see someone's review first that's all i'm trying to do you know um i'm not telling you to try them i'm not telling you to go out and buy them right now i just want to give you guys more insight on these [ __ ] or if you guys ever like haven't heard of them and then you see this video and then you guys [ __ ] find out about them or find them and you're like oh [ __ ] they actually [ __ ] smack i want to try um that's all i wanted to do or um get out of this video my [ __ ] ratings don't mean [ __ ] everyone has their own [ __ ] ratings um but it's currently uh like 10 10 40 now or 10 yeah i think it's 10 40 because when i started recording it was like 10 35 and it's been like eight minutes so it's like 10 40 um i'll pick up the camera like around 11 50 or some [ __ ] or an hour from now and just let you guys know how i [ __ ] feel so hour by hour i'm going to be updating you guys um i don't know if it doesn't smack within like usually i get smacked within like the first hour two hours um but who knows the [ __ ] sour patch edibles took like four hours before they actually [ __ ] hit me and [ __ ] um so we're just gonna go with the flow and see what's up see if these are actually 500 milligrams or what's up but all right guys i'll pick up the camera later alright guys i currently just got out of the shower um you guys can see um dude i got a comment one time someone said that my [ __ ] perm looks goofy um it's not a perm i have natural curly hair it's just that sometimes it should just be looking goofy as [ __ ] because i have some thick ass [ __ ] girls and my hair just gets dried out sometimes um but i know i don't know i just wanted to mention that [ __ ] someone said i got a permanent [ __ ] it's not perm natural [ __ ] curls um but anyways it's currently like [ __ ] 12 [ __ ] 12 30 i think um i didn't pick it up within the first hour um but i'm just here to [ __ ] let you guys know i i don't know if i [ __ ] feel something or not um i want to wait a little bit more longer give it another hour or so but as of right now i just feel relaxed and i don't know it's just [ __ ] weird i'm not gonna say i'm smack smack but i'm also gonna say like i don't feel a little something it's not drastic but i can't say that i don't feel relaxed and i feel like i'm just chilling you know like i'm just vibing and [ __ ] um like if i had to rate it it's probably like a six six point five right now where i'm at i don't know um i'm feeling something chilling [ __ ] vibing um but i'm just give it another hour or so and see what the [ __ ] happens cuz right now uh i'm not feeling [ __ ] but yeah man we're just gonna [ __ ] let it run and i'll pick up the camera within another hour or so and see what's up i still haven't ate anything so we'll see all right guys as you guys can see i just made um my tea i got a maca and ashwagandha tea mixed with some with two tablespoons of honey um just to get that vitality up and that energy up um but that's just gonna be pretty much it it's currently 115 um 120 or some [ __ ] or some one something um but i i'm gonna rate those edibles on my personal scale 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't [ __ ] try them um but honestly i'm not gonna say that i didn't feel anything because i do feel like some haziness in my eyes and usually that's [ __ ] an indicator one like one of the indicators for me that i'm [ __ ] like high and [ __ ] but like i feel hazy in my eyes my eyes feel like low-key kind of [ __ ] heavy but nothing major you know i'm [ __ ] chilling i'm rocking um i would suggest some more if you have a a lower tolerance um and then and if you have a lower tolerance and it may [ __ ] hit you a lot more harder um but it wasn't nothing crazy for me it was just i was just chilling um but it's cool trying out these different [ __ ] like candy um replicated edibles or whatever how however you would wear that um it's just cool to try out like [ __ ] like a wonka bar [ __ ] sour patch [ __ ] flavored ones warheads it's [ __ ] crazy uh mixed with weed that's crazy as [ __ ] that's just dope um but yeah just because i give it a 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't try it if you have a lower tolerance or an a [ __ ] tolerance then go for it give them a try they're [ __ ] the taste of them is fired um i'm pretty sure it will [ __ ] smack if i like gave it to my sisters or some [ __ ] um but yeah i'ma just go ahead and end the video here man um if you guys enjoyed this video hit that subscribe button also hit that bell notification she doesn't get notified when i drop more gems more bangers all my videos

you what I have been doing this week I have been taking the poke weed Barry so the pokeberry I have been taking it two times a day I will do it for two weeks I'm not telling you what to do you need to consult with an expert before you do stuff like this this plant is very toxic but anyway I've got another video that goes into detail about the plant but I am taken to Izzy's a day for two weeks now people do it all sorts of ways this is just how I do it if you're doing it and you just so happen to overdo it you'll get diarrhea you will know that you were overdoing it I swallowed this Aeetes I do not I do not crunch them I do not eat those I swallow that yeah seats are toxic so hey you want to make sure you swallow them or pick them out one of the other they're mildly toxic they're not real toxic anyway you don't really need to take this very for more than two weeks like I say people take it differently what I do it cleans the lymphatic system out it's really good for arthritis ninety four or five or something like that it's very hot anyway that's it just wanted to show you what I'm doing this week he is the root of the pokeweed is very very toxic you should stay away from this plant unless you study it very very well I've been eating this plant since I was a child so you make sure you study this plan out anyway we'll see ya hey but put some wild medicinals and wild edibles into your diet put them in there that's what I've been doing and hopefully I will continue that we'll see", "UFZyDK4w884": "yeah I think the guy who drew the artwork for these games used to work for Walt Disney so not surprised Reagan's lair play as the heroic Dirk the daring the valiant knight on a rescue to the fairway from the clutches of evil great Prince's name is Daphne and we learned how to pronounce that name last night [Music] all right [Music] yeah we need a substance Eddington Oh close like a drawing time oh yo fresh we'll watch the intro this this is the art original arcade intro when the cabinet was idle Dragon's Lair look bad as the adventure will you become a valiant light on a quest to rescue the fair princess from the clutches of an evil dragon you control the actions of a daring adventurer finding his way through the castle of a dark wizard I love the staticky noise on the screen to make VHS 83 baby so the thing about drink is lair is you guys have to understand when you walk into an arcade and you're surrounded by games like Tetris Galaga [ __ ] pac-man space invaders okay a guerra like that and then all of a sudden you see this machine that literally has a [ __ ] cartoon plane and you control the character it was mind-blowing it was like how could they possibly do this in that time in 1983 this machine was like this game was like so ahead of its time you just didn't comprehend in right it was kind of like the equivalent of when when what's it called Donkey Kong [Music] but Donkey Kong Country first came though for the Super Nintendo yeah I see what you're saying calls and you know they had all this pre-rendered [ __ ] so it was really clever what they did with this of course it's all cutscenes that's how I worked around it but back in the arcade days like this machine was [ __ ] expensive for me I think around the time where everything was like 25 to 50 cents this machine was like a dollar so when I was a kid I did not have the ball to play this game and it looked [ __ ] hard I saw all the adults play it I didn't know what the hell they were doing because I'm just watching it and like mesmerized and not understanding like what the controls because there's nothing on the screen that tells you what to do and they're just controlling the cutscenes so I thought it was like mind boggling and I didn't understand how like different capture scenes worked like that back then so it was it was [ __ ] madness bro so yeah like this these games laserdisc games or art are really really sick ok see if I can fix the video sighs my cat will just fullscreen it it's not a big deal you the research I think Enzo put it too put it - what's a coal hey we'll just fullscreen this [ __ ] we'll just fullscreen like re3 Louise the re3 over there No you it should have a good change all right let's play ok so I was looking at some of the settings and I don't really know which settings we should use definitely should max out the last [ __ ] here's the way to get infinite logic to do that move beeps we'll keep on moved I definitely have on then the original arcade version it showed you nothing on the [ __ ] screen the controls are literally up-down left-right and attack and it's just I guess I'd cancer our cake at with the phone off so the arcade version play the original scene order from the arcade cabinet easy [Music] the homers is the original laser this version of the game third must pass through each scene before I think we should do the home version just so we see all the cutscenes and difficulty easy we'll have more time to react for certain scenes some difficult moves have been removed [Music] we should pipe it on hard and see how that goes oh we should play on the hardest setting first alright alright let's do this you if it's too hard then [ __ ] it we'll play on easy [Music] in the arcade version I haven't even have that scene for something oh I think I [ __ ] I see how spoons press right twice dude in the arcade version it wouldn't tell you anything you just have to know you lose your [ __ ] dollar right there like this game is hard as balls if we match this can I go show you guys there is an arcade version man I'll show you all [ __ ] stupidest to at least a shoal something there but still I think you guys going to see the screen a lot by the way man you're gonna be fast dude who's like Oh [Music] [Music] but his screams are so funny dude no [Music] [Music] I [ __ ] press right oh no Rapids okay how am I supposed to kill the press up here how the [ __ ] would you figure that out oh god okay this is obvious dude you be screaming too if you're in this [ __ ] situation [Applause] okay good let's let's continue thank god this is just scary bro what this whole castle is a Disney [Music] revitalize Daphne that's sound effect [Music] once again I'll have to remind you guys that the original arcade version had no prompts on the [ __ ] screen you literally just had to figure it out and you would go broke trying to beat this [ __ ] English is he stabbed in the back bro you this game is designed to eat your money exactly it was oh [ __ ] holy [ __ ] down [Music] [Music] [Music] and there you can choose different hats too in this game which is really sick but we're playing so we see all the customs Oh God holy [ __ ] oh my god okay that seemed looked impossible like without the prompts you would be dead there's no way do don't get my ass kicked that I do have prompts like I said after this I want to show you guys the original arcade version I want to show you guys how impossible [Music] Oh God oh my god I like ice cream damn it I think that chad has counted how many how many ladies have spent on the game how many times have I [ __ ] up guys 14 dude that's not even enough for a for a [ __ ] apex gun skin I can't even buy anything apex legends with that apex gun skin is $20 oh [ __ ] like sometimes the game has mercy on you and shows you at him man up for days [ __ ] [Music] this sounds e makes or so I thought we just did this [ __ ] oh it's another way to try to trick me dude reusing accents what'd you say oh [ __ ] what'd you say no [Music] Jesus bounce if you actually saw come on [ __ ] I didn't let three times bro if you're in the medieval times and you went down the elevator that's looking faster you [ __ ] your pants oh [ __ ] I remember this [ __ ] I remember people swearing at the arcade arcade cab during this [ __ ] cutscene this is notorious this is cancer [Music] - it was cancer this dude is on my ass slice them holy Kate how are you supposed to figure this out in the arcade I just wanted him five times you're telling me someone figured that out on their own what I didn't see a prompt hold the [ __ ] weapon rack what the [ __ ] fifty dollars deep at this point bro I'd be [ __ ] broke-ass by here and dude I'm talking about one with the swing six times that's GG there's no way to get past that scene oh my god [Music] no not the [ __ ] marbles again slice it Oh God reuse assets Oh hopefully doesn't trick me drink me okay so it requires you to memorize certain scenes and if you have it in the reverse you gotta remember the opposite directions that's crazy Google is over [Music] what whoops dude the time it is so fast [Music] okay oh no not this [ __ ] again [Music] [Music] [Music] what [Music] [Music] this is fine this is the status tree Firefly right now this is fine [Music] [Music] [Music] what what this was supposed to do there [Music] okay that shake hand fall oh [ __ ] what there's a different time guys it was a different time a better time [ __ ] don't weigh all the way back here [ __ ] impossible [Music] [ __ ] it's hard to see the damn arrows because the [ __ ] goal is the same color [Music] [Music] save me the cage is locked was the key the dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon use the magic sword run run nice no come on I pressed it so [ __ ] fast okay it's three swings in a row it's three swings in a row god damn it you guys are understand this is explosively difficult difficult yeah this is this final boss [ __ ] you just the Regal bro yeah this game separates men boys clothes almost [ __ ] up there the damn sword okay three swings [Music] nice [ __ ] the tacky we win no consent they'll consent [Music] so how many tries that take us while technically chinking not changing what am I saying cheating I was gonna say thinking and she at the same time [Music] 29 that's with the arrows that's with the air if I had no arrows would be impossible especially that one scene where you got to swim like five [ __ ] times but it gives you the mood yeah that's what I'm saying that's worth cheating basically 29 death so how much in our case do it be like in the arcades when I played it was like a dollar each and that was back then when games were like 25 cents to 50 cents that's why when I was a kid dude I was I was like way too poor and way too afraid to play this game it looked so insanely hard and it is hard it's basically memorization yeah here I'm gonna show you guys the actual actual arcade machine and I'll show you guys the ridiculousness of it a second I'm good oops Kevin gonna set up for us here the actual actual arcade version - version brain-dead for laserdisc games I got pretty much all of them [Music] you dragons lair of fantasy adventure - a as the actual cancer at least to tell you some stuff on the screen there's nothing on the screen there is nothing on the screen you literally just have to know definitely boys to men this is boys them into the extreme sometimes the screen will give you hints just to show mercy on you and believe it or not there is no pink in you there is no continue you will start from the beginning of the [ __ ] game if you lose all your lives [Music] boys the men I was boys the men honey lives per dollar it's between three and five four it depends on what the arcade owner is sets it to right but it's usually like three lives it's too oh it's too long for me to remember as a kid but like like I said like this kind of game was kind of like it was so pristine back then because like I say you stepped the arcade you see all these [ __ ] games like space invaders and Tetris and pac-man is [ __ ] and then you see this game here like wow like this game is amazing you know it is just so expensive and so difficult right but it was a very amazing game yeah so if you--if you had the game of completely memorized I mean I guess you can show off to people and show them the whole thing but yeah okay uh we're gonna jump ahead now to 1984 we're gonna play time go and then we're gonna bounce back to space ace so let me a sort of time go here you [Music] so I showed you guys a little preview of time go on the Sega Saturn but like I said most laserdisc games the ports of laserdisc games are most of them are pretty bad the only good ones are ones that came I reported to PlayStation 1 or higher or PC but for the most thing you gotta use that emulation you should just do straight image because anything that's poured over two Sega CD or Sega Saturn right is most of it is garbage there are really bad ports how did you play laserdisc games there's a there's a laser the specific laser discs emulate emulator called Daphne you got to use that okay you before we get picture okay good we're good so this is the actual arcade version we're playing right now but it does have on-screen prompts so this is the actual arcade version come on make sure the volume is good for this [Music] start by blasting your ears [Music] so this will be tough because once again I don't think we have continues in this but at least we have on-screen prompts guys it was a different time it was a different time a different time [Music] it was 1984 those 1984 guys [Music] Oh [ __ ] it was an action but he knows an action button [Applause] [Music] take that go up shoot the enemy go down [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] [Applause] good tired I love this D oh [ __ ] it changes directions it tricked me no that's the chat that's laughing right now the action one throws me off go down [ __ ] it [Music] we had a 33% chance of getting that right the chat told me to go down so I blame that on you guys didn't see anything come on nice I'll share in the future 2001 2001 baby [Applause] goddamn [Music] [Applause] [Music]

crash I'm gonna die you're gonna get me [ __ ] killed that makes no sense [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right we'll see you guys know what you're talking about you [ __ ] idiot [Music]

[Music] what okay it must be a different key or something left am i pressing left's you got you guys see a left arrow I just see energized that's all I see cuz the left is lining up oh maybe you're right no don't know I don't see you left I just see the gun that's it maybe it's a different key we don't know about athos spacebar though because it's left on the animation oh right it didn't tell us though that's odd maybe the game [ __ ] up there and it gave us the wrong command yeah we'll just remember that for next time good I though it seems like every time it says energized we can't use the gun if maybe it's like only if we have it we can skip a cutscene yeah because I didn't use it I just press it up instead there it's hard for me to read the chat score very hard OC house really use my gun there [Music] Oh Wow and it has a different button maybe if control I'm going to guess this controller okay so if it just shows the gun its spacebar and if it says energized I think it's control I press spacebar backs and there we go we get lots of the funds control doesn't work I don't know the controls are we can't get further if we don't figure out what the damn control is for this unless we don't fire and it's one of those things again where we have to wear the right lights up okay thanks I was just about to say unless be at the Dodge [Music] you [Music] Wow wait wait holy [ __ ] I can't imagine what the arcade version of this game is like [Music] [Music] [Music] No [Music] just check the PC version guys if you can help you find the controls for the energizer it's not control I try control could be alter something or shared [Music] [Music] nice Jesus this is such a long cutscene look at this this is [ __ ] crazy what's going on Oh No don't timing the game is frozen that's the end like this you you die Gigi you you see vertices kind of bugged we always have the original arcade version would you like to exit no continue you and inserts coin it's not a [ __ ] arcade port I see the pause symbol that just brings up the options I think it's [ __ ] guys you guys find out what the other control was No Oh No there's that tons of controls [Music] / let me try relaunching again

sure what makes it a peanut butter and jelly crispy what what the jelly part is or the peanut butter in this don't know but looking forward to try it sounds good to me it sounds like flavorful and good it's a pretty affordable edible only cost me seven bucks in my dispensary as the packaging sort of indicates it's an affordable edible but in this case or than the previous TKO edibles does not mean it's they skimp out on the potency just means that you've got some less than fancy packaging which it's fine with me as long as you know they if they're saving that are passing the savings on to you that's great so let's go ahead and open this up and give you a little taste test then I'll finish it off and I will come back to you guys in two hours or two hours from me just a couple seconds from you guys just to let you know how I'm feeling so here we go open it up there you can smell the peanut butter smell to it for sure it smells a lot like peanut butter let's give it a taste mm I don't know how they do it there is a peanut butter and jelly taste to it what peanut better than jelly but there's definitely that fruity jelly sort of taste to it as well it's good I like it quite a bit this might be my second favorite tasting one behind the s'mores which I had but this one's pretty good I like the cereal like rice krispie treats and this one is not bad so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I will come back to you in two hours to actually let you know how it's feeling and for you it'll just be right after this break thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace hungry YUM got me some munchies um welcome back sweets guys sorry about that it's been two hours since I had the TKO 100 milligram peanut butter and jelly krispies and I gotta say I like it a lot I'm gonna solid five five and a half somewhere like that which is a pretty good value for a seven dollar edible I'm about as high as I you know I'm happy with where I'm with my high and not really wish it was any higher I really like the taste of it too one of the better tasting TKOs just all around a good product for another winner from TKO certainly one of my favorites from them and a surprising potency from just a hundred milligram edible so if you see this one out of the dispensary near you and you're okay with the lower dose edibles do not hesitate to grab the peanut butter and jelly krispies I don't think you'll be upset that you did and guys I'm gonna eat some more of this food I'm really looking forward to that and I will see you on the next review thanks for watching peace", "6sBWiwLyvK4": "[Music] no till uh orange spatula sick you're a long time wheats fan you know what that means it means I'm breaking my cardinal rule today fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited thank you so much for watching

like quickly let's stop but then I had to go pick up my daughter and I was a [ __ ] but these people were so nice it blows it to me I felt so freaking guilty anyway when you're in the waiting room they have a big board up TV screen that tells you all everything that's available in the price and that was really helpful especially when I was panicking so we could decide what we wanted fast and get in and out and these people were so kind and helpful like I was obviously panicked like because I had to be somewhere and so we told her what we wanted and she went back and got it all ready for us so when we finally finished processing our paperwork we were able to run back there grab the stuff and then like be mesmerized because there's all this stuff to look at they had like a little glass display cases where you can look at things and all this glass work to look at and I don't even know what else because I was like both focused but like I wanted to spend time there like I wanted to go there and spend an hour looking at everything they had and I felt good it felt like a really good beautiful place to hang out and be educated and talk about what they have also I wanted to tell you they told us that on weed maps is automatically linked to their inventory so you could see exactly what they do have at that time before you go and let's see let's get to the hole oh my god okay so this is Blue Dream by Liberty harmony it says how many liberties here you go it's just THC it is raved about online and so we were like oh let's go check it out I think we had hoped to get a cartridge got the tincture and I don't have a review on it I'm sorry I will hopefully get back to you with a review soon this is a hybrid and it's good for like beginners and experts it's just THC in it and I just tincture I don't you think you'd get the turbines trapeze terpenes I'm getting better I'll get better all right and it's a 500 milligrams in this bottle and I think it's like six seven for a dropper home or milliliter it's not really much of a home video if I don't show you what's inside so let's look inside for him so inside you have a Liberty in a black ball anyway breeze it's all proof as always everything is freakin childproof really crazy and you pick it up and this let's get some and it's a pale yellow there you go and it smells like alcohol hey that's what we got so there's number one second thing that we had to go for a cartridge a lemonhead cartridge here you go but look at it alright and they look - this was $90 I've always open it up cuz you talk to see and I always love opening there go it was very like anti-climatic let's pop it open and see what's inside alright and here is someone ahead oh I can smell it yes it's been used alright so it is a nice beautiful like it really looks like a lemony color doesn't it lemony and that was the lemonhead cartridge and that is good for pain and I think it was a cush and I wish I knew more I wish I could give you a description of more about it but I can't sorry I can do what I can do but I do have a sec I have a back onion uh problem but let's end up that was the end of zen lee sin leaf was a great experience

Dixie half-and-half I've heard this [ __ ] is delicious like delicious like you want to pour yourself a big old glass of it but don't do it because it's like a serving size is this remember it's hard to open everything a serving size is like half a cup and that's six milligrams so maybe two but you're not like really I don't want to go more than two so anyway delicious stuff highly recommend it's between 28 and $30 for this little container with a bunch of servings in it I should work out what if the price works out too but anyway check it out this woman was purchased I believe at remedy

real survival kids survival shelters simplifying survival and wilderness innovation calm well this this time of the year the fall this is an excellent time in a survival situation to be able to gather all kinds of food to eat now this time of year especially up here in the mountains berries are very prevalent I got choked cherries all over creation up here those are very good all right here's choke cherries right here kind of pull them forward so you can see them good I'm going to tell you what there's not much food that you can pick that's easier to pick than choke cherries you see how the fruit grows and little stems that hang down I mean all I do is just stick my finger on just put your put the stems in your fingers and just pull like that and a couple strokes you can have a you have a whole handful of berries look at this so simple to pick this stuff you shouldn't you shouldn't starve to death if there's some of this around so I I have picked here in about 15 minutes I've picked about 10 pounds where the berries so if I were out in a survival situation I could do a lot with that I wouldn't want to necessarily exist solely on chokecherries of course but that could cause possibly some other problem when the effects of this those chokecherries it's kind of clean they cleanse my my sinuses out your closing yeah my colon not yet though yeah no colon stuff yet you know it makes a good supplement to some greens or whatever other kind of things you know you might be able to find I do like the Indians did they used to mix they used to mix a lot of their foods in fact they'd a lot of times they would mix berries and meat and that sort of thing so you know don't be afraid to try some unusual combinations anything that will keep you eat and then keep you going and keep you alive which is all worth doing so anyway that's a little bit about the chokecherry here mmm very good got a little pit in it just kind of like a cherry and the flavor is kind of cherry light and I even look like a miniature cherry hmm these things are so good now they do have like I said that little them somebody described as a astringent property and whatever that means I think they taste if you've ever done pickling if you've ever tasted alum before it kind of makes your mouth pucker up a little bit well that's kind of what that reminds me of and once you cook them a little bit a good bit of that goes away man if you mix them with some other stuff you know that kind of discounts it to some berries have more of that property and than others do pretty good pretty good in that meadow to knows what she's doing yeah all in all this is some good eatin right here chokecherries", "qK_nZ8ErahY": "what's going on craft beer lovers i am super psyched for this review today it is a beautiful day in austin texas absolutely wonderful um pretty warm i'm kind of getting hot in my slacks uh but today i have the uh funk factory gutseria hope i'm saying that right and this is their framsvart framswart a spontaneous beer aged on black raspberries big old bottle got a ton to say about this one first of all i think it's the perfect day for a spontaneously fermented beer aged on black raspberries now what does that even mean well i had to do some research on this one this is a very interesting i learned a lot in a short time here so this is basically a um a lambic beer but lambic is a style a kind of a a a wild what's the word spontaneous you know in other words the it's fermented in the open and so bacteria or whatever it is in the air around you enters the fermentation and gives it a i guess a funky tart taste now uh lambic is a style that comes from belgium and they're very i guess possessive of that style it's done in a very specific way and uh you know they created it so this is a brood in america and um there's kind of some conflict i guess because the belgian brewers uh who've been around forever don't want us absconding with their lambic uh name kind of like champagne from france you know it means a specific region so instead they are i guess these brewers are taking to calling this the method traditional traditional a traditional method i guess that probably belgian for traditional method i'm just guessing and uh that means holy crap that means a lambic uh no no okay i won't let that keep happening i promise sorry about that um so it's windy so this thing six percent abv uh and i'm opening it up early afternoon i'm gonna have it with lunch and um to kind of sip it throughout the day is my plan but it's just i feel like it's the perfect picnic beer now i haven't tasted it yet i'm hoping i'm right about that but i've always sort of associated these tart berry beers good for um warm weather eating food sharing with friends so in more interesting stuff about so much interesting stuff i learned a little bit more about this beer first it's uh it's uh i'll just read the back it's a vintage 2018 so it's actually a couple years old now um it's 20 few years old what the heck it's 2021 right now hopefully this thing hasn't gone completely bad but it says um franzwort is our spontaneously fermented beer adhering to the method traditional standard uh it was aged for 18 to 30 months in french oak barrels and then re-fermented on two pounds per gallon of black raspberries for three months you know what that i bet what that means is it was it's been aging since 2018 because i don't i haven't had this i've had this bottle for like three or four months in my fridge but um i don't think i think what happened is probably brewed in 2018 aged for let's say about two years probably came out mid 2020 and i picked it up probably late 2020 or something like that and it's now kind of almost it's basically spring 2021 so uh very interesting it's got a lot of stuff i love right i love raspberries i love sours i love lambics i love barrel age stuff aged for a long time two years or so in french oak barrels six percent abv that's also interesting because you sort of a lot of times expect a barrel a beer that's been aged in barrels that long to be a higher abv at that point and i'm i'm happy i don't i don't want to knock out uh boozy day today i just want to taste this thing now another thing i learned funk factory well that's kind of an interesting play on words because i assumed that only had to do with the spontaneous you know the bacteria the funk from that but the guy the founder's name is something funk his last name is funk uh and another crazy thing i was astonished i'm still not sure i want to confirm this but apparently that dude is also the founder of untitled art uh the other you know uh beer company and so kind of crazy what's this dude up to man he's an economist his main job as an economist and he's founded i guess two uh beer uh you know companies or whatever so that's pretty mind-boggling i also want to recommend an article if you want to learn more about this i got my laptop over here i'll put a link in the description but it's called uh don't call it a sour don't call it a sour at goodbeerhunting.com so that was a very very very interesting article well written tons of cool info uh pretty lengthy substantial article and it has some great photos of this uh the place where this place the brewery uh looks awesome kind of a warehouse style space and uh they're located by the way in is it wisconsin yeah madison in madison wisconsin so um anyway just all sorts of interesting stuff i learned in a short time about this company and uh i guess with all that being said it's about time to crack it open i'm excited uh it again it looks like a picnic beer to me all the way down to this cool thingamajiggy that i'll probably struggle to open but i'm going to try anyway hopefully i can do it by hand uh as always once i pour it i will run to take a picture for my instagram which is at craft christian reviews i want you to go find me over there at craft christian reviews then i'll come back and do the um smelling and tasting and showing it off and stuff now i'm a little bit worried because i accidentally bumped it and i'm afraid it's gonna be very very fizzy so stand back all right i'm gonna make a fool of myself oh god there we go ye okay it's kind of going no it's not too bad all right i'm gonna pour it take a picture and be right back for the review that's beautiful beautiful yes sir wow can smell the raspberries okay be right back all right well i got my picture uh the only thing i regret is that the head just vanishes so quickly i still see carbonation streaming up in there it's not like it's a flat it's not flat it's just the head just poof it's gone which is too bad cause it's real pretty you guys probably saw on the video uh anyway go find the instagram post to get closer look at this um yeah i can just smell the tart almost makes my mouth water tart blackberries the color is just luscious uh wine looks like a wine with a little bit of carbonation um i don't know i don't know if you if you know the smell you're familiar with it it's the smell of a sour tart wild sort of beer so let's give it a taste okay very nice very nice um very very juicy very very very flavorful not very bitter quite tart quite almost puckeringly sour you can definitely tell the oak barrel agent you can notice that right off um it's almost like drinking a wine it's like some cross between a sour wine and and a fruit drink or something um you know i think that's not gonna be up everyone's alley some people don't like that kind of stuff personally i love it um it's sour whoa i love sour stuff it's very tart and it kind of rushes across your whole mouth um yeah i mean it's almost like uh this is one of the most sour beers i've i've had it's just straight up sour um and uh anyway look it's got it's got complexity it's a sipper uh not because it's so strong but because the tarteness is so profound that no one is going to be slugging back huge um huge uh gulps of this i don't think very very nice i don't think it's too old at all it's not a beer that needs to be excuse me i don't think freshness is that it's not like a hoppy ipa or something where freshness itself is is a quality um that you're seeking out i think this one is one that can age for a while and i don't actually have a cellar i just have my fridge and like i said i still don't know exactly when this thing was bottled or brewed but i can tell you this is delicious uh this this brewer clearly knows what he's doing and i'm going to enjoy sipping this on this picnic style day while my food while i'm eating my food so if you like this kind of content uh give me a like a subscribe and comment uh all that stuff helps me immensely means a lot to me go find me on instagram craft christian reviews follow me over there and again i'm going to put a link in the uh description to the article i read don't call it a sour which if you have any interest in this video i've just made i think you'll find that article fascinating i hope you go and read it go check out this brewery and of course um i love untitled art as well they've got a bunch of great stuff so uh until next time hope you enjoy whatever you're drinking and uh see in the next review", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "_t0ZIZmoXMg": "hello and uh welcome back to another beer review and you may well say looks like you're in the bath and i will say to you there's absolutely nothing wrong with your eyesight cancel that trip to spec savers so today in this rather echoey chamber we're looking at sharp tongue from the new i believe audi range of beers and this is the grapefruit pale ale coming in at four percent apv so very reasonable not too strong so let's uh take a look at the elegant can design quickly and by the way if you're uncomfortable about me being in the bath that probably says more about you than it does about me just point out because i have encountered these kind of issues before [Music] let's crack this open i've only got a little glass so see how that goes as you can see very light golden color hard to tell in this bathroom because the lighting is is well it's pretty non-existent it's one of those really old-fashioned goldfish bowl type affairs but anyway let's see what golem knows fragrant smells a lot fair liquid it's grapefruit it's sweet grapefruit lemony almost sort of like a a wash and wax yeah certainly right here washing my car it's nice to see got a nice white head a little carbonation in the glass let's go for a taste i've drank water at the washing up bowl and it didn't taste as good as that that's quite nice the problem is quite nice there's always a sourness to it as it says in the name sharp tom just a grapefruit pan i think they could have almost got away with coolness to sell to be honest it's a bitterness on the back end but you can certainly taste the grapefruit even into lemon there yeah it's actually rather decent you know i'm going to give it seven out of ten one pound 59 it's worth trying it's not going to blow you away but it's crisp it's refreshing and it's easily available so that's it for that one carol having my bath well thank you for watching hopefully i'll catch you again soon cheers", "qG-Ac48CyVU": "what's up friends welcome back today i will be showing you how to make infused pixie sticks the powder inside of these can also be used to dip your suckers into to eat by itself and if you add a lot of citric acid you can get it so sour that it's even more sour than warheads which is kind of how i like mine in this video i'm also going to be showing you guys how to infuse the sugar but if you already have infused sugar or don't need to know how to make it you can skip to six minutes in this video to get right to making the pixie sticks [Music] to make the infused sugar you're going to need half a cup of tincture and one and one quarter cup of granulated sugar start by pouring your sugar into a large dish and then pour your tincture on top and stir it all together i felt like mine was too liquidy so i added another quarter cup of sugar and then stirred that some more after i added the sugar the consistency was much better you could definitely still see the grains instead of it being mostly liquid like it was before um if you guys aren't sure about how much sugar to use if you find it's too liquidy just keep adding a few spoonfuls of sugar until you get a consistency closer to something like this then we need to evaporate all the alcohol off of this sugar so we're going to preheat our oven to the lowest temperature that it can go for me that's 170 degrees and we're going to place it into the oven leaving the oven door open and i'm also having a fan just to help with air circulation because you are having alcohol in the oven you have to be very very very careful to make sure to never close the oven door and to always have good airflow then i'm going to set the timer for about 10 minutes and every 10 or 15 minutes i'm going to come back and stir the mixture this is what mine is looking like after the first 10 minutes so i'm just going to stir it and try to kind of scrape down the sides and i'm gonna have to do this quite a few times like i said every 10 to 15 minutes just come and stir it so because i am making pixie sticks um i want to flavor my sugar so i want two different flavors so i'm just going to get another baking dish and pour part of this mixture into it and then i'm going to add a flavoring oil to each dish now we want to do this earlier in the process so we can help with the evaporation of the liquid but it doesn't really matter if you put it in the first 15 minutes the second 15 minutes or anything like that just try and put it while there's still liquid in there so that it can evaporate with the rest of the liquid then we'll just put it right back into the oven for another 10-15 minutes again we're going to have to repeat the process of in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it at a stir put it back in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it out to stir until it has returned to its original grainy sand consistency so at this point the sugar has been in the oven for about 45 minutes i think and is still a little bit too liquidy so again we're going to stir it and then put it back in the oven for a bit and continue to do this until we get a nice consistency so after about an hour and a half it was pretty much all good i did leave it sitting out um for a couple hours just to dry off any extra moisture and then here is what it looked like you can see it definitely made some clumps so we are going to break those up and each of these dishes are different flavors for me but um one is bubble gum and one is watermelon so i don't really mind if i'm using the same utensils because the flavors kind of go together but yeah so i'm just going to scrape all the sugar off the bottom of the dish and then we are going to put it in a blender to um make it nice and refined so i'm just pouring some of this sugar into my blender and we're going to try and grind it down into a finer texture unfortunately i don't know if it's because i put too much sugar that might be the problem um i it wouldn't really grind like the the blender wouldn't really get it to um like mix i don't know it just it wasn't working very well for me so i decided to use a food processor instead but i have a feeling if i did smaller amounts in the blender it probably would have worked a little bit better so using the food presser helped a ton it was coming out very very nicely you can see the texture is beautiful and i just continued to do this for all of my sugar until it was all ground down nicely i do want to mention that humidity plays a very important part in being able to make this sugar properly i luckily have air conditioning in my apartment so i set it really high so we could dry out the space as much as possible if it's too humid your sugar will clump so just try to avoid that if you can otherwise maybe just use extra sugar where i live in canada is not very humid at all so it's not something that i've really had to worry about but for those of you who do maybe you can leave some advice in the comments to help others out as well so at this point the sugar is pretty much done if you're going to use it for other purposes just store it in a airtight container um but for us we're going to be making pixie sticks so let's move on to what we need to make that our first and most important ingredient is the sugar that we just made we're also going to need some icing sugar some citric acid some kool-aid packets or some flavoring oils and some food coloring so this is 24 hours after i made the sugar and even though i did grind it down to a fine texture you can see it clumped up once again probably due to the moisture in the air i'm not sure um so we're just going to reprocess them i separated them into three bowls because i'm gonna do three separate colors and then we're going to start with the first one and place it into a food processor so i'm just pouring it in there and i'm going to grind it down first just to see how it's going to look and then we can add our other ingredients so it looks beautiful you can see it is so fine and not clumpy at all and then we're going to add our citric acid if you want to be sour just start out with um a teaspoon or so and blend it together see how it tastes and then add more as desired you can make it as sour as you like i'm also going to be adding some food coloring to mine i'm adding blue this is gel food coloring and i do have some issues using this as you will see as the video goes on at this point you can also add some kool-aid packages for your flavoring if desired i've already flavored mine with flavoring oils when i made the sugar but kool-aid packages work very well also and they have citric acid in them so if you don't have citric acid at home it'll help to get that sourness so you can see here my food coloring is not mixing at all it's just kind of clumping so i'm not sure why it's happening just yet but i have a suspicion that it's to do with lack of moisture so i'm just going to continue on with how i'd make these regularly and just see if maybe it binds so i'm just adding some icing sugar and this helps with the texture it kind of gives it like that baby bottle pop fine sugary texture that's really nice you don't need to use icing sugar um but it does help with the taste the texture and it also helps for people who live in more humid climates at this point the food coloring has still not properly mixed in so i decided it's due to the lack of moisture so i added my gel food coloring to a couple drops of water to create essentially liquid food coloring just a regular kind of kind you'd buy at a grocery store which i'm assuming most people that's what they would be using anyway so you probably shouldn't have this issue gel food coloring is just what i usually have on hand um but yeah adding a couple drops of water to the gel food coloring definitely really helped because clearly it looks very beautiful um and it mixed very nicely so i'm very happy with that now i'm just scraping the bottom to make sure everything is properly incorporated as well as adding some more citric acid so that it's extra sour and then i'm going to mix it a final time and then once that's done i'm going to pour it back into its bowl and set it aside until we have our other colors now i'm starting on my next one so same process adding the sugar adding some citric acid if you want to add your kool-aid packets you can do so now and then adding the food coloring for myself i am adding some water with my food coloring before i add it so like i said i'd let this sugar sit over 24 hours after i made it before i added um the food coloring and this whole process here today um but after i made my initial batch of sugar i did make some pink and i used my regular gel pink food coloring and i had absolutely no issues getting it to bind which is why i think it was because of the lack of water because the sugar still had a little bit of moisture in it yesterday but 24 hours from then which is now it was dried out more so that little bit of water added with the food coloring helps to restore that moisture now it looks like some of the food coloring got stuck on the bottom with the sugar so i'm just scraping it around to get everything mixed and then adding some powdered sugar the measurement is not really um well i didn't measure it i just kind of put spoonfuls into my taste but if you are looking for a measurement i would say use about half the amount of regular sugar for the powdered sugar so if you used one cup of regular sugar maybe use half a cup or less of powdered sugar but again it can be to taste or you don't even need to use powdered sugar if you don't want to [Music] now i'm just adding in a little bit of yellow food coloring just because i want to be a little bit more neon looking and then mixing it together you can see i have to scrape the bottom a little bit there um but yeah i think that the color turned out a little bit too green i kind of wanted to be more of a lighter green but that's okay anyway it still looks cool i was hoping i'd be able to lighten it by adding in some more sugar to dilute the color but it didn't really help that much and then that's done you can add in more citric acid or more sugar you can just adjust it to according to how you like it so then i'm just pouring that into its bowl and then i also have the blue one that i just made and then a pink one that i made yesterday and now it is time for the fun part which is filling up our pixie stix [Music] now we're going to prepare our pixie stick straws and we're going to seal the bottom of them using this bag sealer thing that i just bought i'm also going to show you guys later how to close them without one of these um i did just get this egg sealer thing but it works really well like look how great that straw looks um i think it was like 10 or 15 on amazon i'll post the link um but i am new to it like i literally just got it so you guys can probably see i will struggle a little bit but after the first few straws i got a hang of it better and then they were very easy to quickly seal now we're going to fill up the straws with their sour sugar powder dust whatever you call it um and i'm using this squeeze bottle to get it in there so i bought a tip that is slightly bigger than the size of my straw and i just put the straw in and hold it inside of that tip and then just shake it up and down and it comes out really nicely um the easiest way to do this would to just be buy bigger straws and then you can just use like a paper funnel to get it into the straw but if you already have these tools at home this works like the best it just it's not really worth it to go and buy it if you can just do bigger straws in a paper funnel then i just filled up all my straws using a variety of colors it was kind of annoying because i had to switch the tip every single time i did it if i want to change colors yeah just fill them up to however you like they can be all one color all different colors um and mine are flavored sour watermelon and bubble gum but they actually taste really good just with the sugar and citric acid like they don't even need flavoring okay now that all of my straws are done i'm just going to take my little sealer and close the tips of all of them now i'm going to show you guys how to seal the straws without a bake sealer so you're going to take an oven mitt or a folded dish cloth and then put a piece of tin foil on it put your hand inside of it sorry i didn't get this in the camera that well um put your hand inside of it and sort of shape it into like a little mitt like that with the dish cloth underneath to protect your hand now you're going to place the straw in your tin foil mitt hand and use a lighter to quickly light the other end then once it's lit you're going to quickly switch it over to the other side and squish it down holding it to seal it and then take it out see that looks pretty good so you definitely don't need to go and buy the sealer for this you could just use a lighter and some tinfoil and it seals very nicely the blue powder reminded me so much of baby bottle pops and it really like had that taste too i don't know i think it just because i used more powdered sugar in that one but i thought it would be really good dipped in or to dip suckers in there so i took these little bags and filled them up with some of each of the powders and then put a sucker in there these are just regular suckers because it's what i had on hand but if you really wanted to up them you could use a infused sucker and you can clearly see i'm thinking very hard about what color would go best i chose the dark one i hope that was the best color combination um i really like the way that the the red contrasts with the pink powder but yeah i think they all look adorable the green one's a little bit too green for me but i also really like all the colors mixed together so i did a mix of all the colors and then i'm just putting them into this little container because you don't need obviously those little bags to enjoy this you could also just put it into whatever you want and dip your sucker in there and i absolutely love how pretty all those colors look together once everything is done try to store it in a dry area so maybe keep them in a sealed bag or container to keep any excess moisture and they should last for quite a while i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did and please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching have a wonderful day [Music]", "EFjnNC4YNgo": "this time on rat cat snowberries are they poisonous or a great survival food [Music] welcome to rat and cat where we search survive and explore on Makia this last week I was really surprised to hear that a woman gave her presentation on wild edibles at my son's school and said that snow berries are edible and she popped one in her mouth and said look see I didn't die and I thought what that's completely different than anything I've ever heard also I've seen on a couple websites lists of wild edibles all kinds of things that I thought were poisonous that their listening is not poisonous or just mildly acidic or mildly toxic and that they're okay to eat in a survival situation or a lot of times to just saying they're just okay to eat I'm thinking that's really different from what I heard and so I've been researching it looking on the web at different sources and everything that I can find says that the common Snowberry is not edible I mean you can eat it and it actually has mild toxicity but it causes diarrhea vomiting nausea and lethargy and especially kids that are young can become quite lethargic and passive with it and oh there's only two recorded people that have died from eating snow berries but that is not the main reason that people don't die from eating snow buries the main reason people don't die from eating snow bears is because they're so busy puking and other stuff coming out the other end with their with the snow buries it makes them really sick and so I'm thinking as a survival food I think snow birds would be one of the last things that I would want to eat because you know you think about it one of the biggest killers out there is hypothermia or the effects of hypothermia and with hypothermia getting cold you're getting dehydrated that's a big part of it and if you add that to something that's making you dizzy when you're already starting to lose your mind a little bit and you're already feeling sick and you're already dehydrated and you're gonna start vomiting and having diarrhea then that's going to be a serious problem you're just adding more to it and it seems like there would be so many other things to eat in most cases be better just not to eat and then I was looking okay so where did this come from and and I've I've seen a little number of different things on different topics pocket pop up on the internet like this lately and I think we live in the information age but not the age of wisdom I've said that before but I just see a lot of misinformation out there and so I like to research where that comes from and where I think it comes from and what I think people are misinterpreting this as is the creeping Snowberry which grows starting about Washington State on North up into Canada a smaller berry grows low to the ground the common huckleberry of course is white and pulpy it's just soft and mushy really yeah it's like eating a really almost mushy apple it's hard to describe it doesn't have a lot of favorite flavor the seeds are really it's it's seedy yeah but those are the differences in the the other Snowberry is the creeping snow berry or the Moxie berry can be eaten and is actually supposed to be really good for you what let me back up one second here and say the snow berry actually has some medicinal purposes too when I was looking into it it's a natural anti bacterial and inhibits bacteria from growing so it's been said to be used for eye infections too Stav eye or cure eye infections or cure or be an anti bacterial for wounds but because it has that toxic toxic toxicity got it out it can actually cause a rash around the wound or whatever so you want to be careful or Wealth's or other allergic reactions and I think that's one thing that people need to take in mind when you're looking at these berries that the one the berries that don't taste great that we don't eat a lot there's usually a reason for that that bitter taste is usually a toxin some sort of a poison and actually there's some research into this that these toxins and poisons can be used like for medication on a limited basis or elements of them so there's some neat research going into that although not nearly enough but it's exciting to hear and think about but yeah I definitely want to stay away from them I didn't realize - that Snowberry is actually a relative to the the what's that called I've got a fly that just landed on my camera lens I don't know if you can see it but it's distracting me shoo so the common Snowberry is actually related to honeysuckle and actually when Lewis and Clark were coming through North America and the west coast and exploring and mapping they noted the Snowberry and they hadn't seen that before at all they noted that it was related to the honeysuckle and those guys were really really smart they had to have a ton of knowledge and so they wrote that down I think they actually took samples back east and they were planted there and I think I want to say I can't remember it seems like they gave him to one of the presidents he really thought they were amazing with the white berries because they're so unique and unusual and some of those have been taken back east to Europe where there uses a decorative bush as well but the Moxie berry has an interesting story as well the Moxie Snowberry because it was used for medicinal purposes and still is and is also being studied for its how it can be used as a medicine creeping Snowberry is also called moxie or moxie plum which in one Native American language means medicine and that is where the name for moxie soda comes from it doesn't actually have snow berry in it but it had some other roots in there that the creator thought was medicinal and so they called it moxie soda during the 20s they did a big campaign where gets I think was buu get your moxie get your moxie on that and that that guy's got moxie that's where that saying comes from I remember hearing that that term when I was a kid I heard that for forever but that's where that comes from so interesting side notes there but I am NOT going to recommend that my kids snowberries or that I eat snow berries and I sure hope that you don't if you have a different idea about that I'd love to hear about it please leave your comments below like subscribe share and we'll see you next time here on rotten cat if you like this video you might also enjoy the playlist that I put together odd things that kill people in the wild and how to avoid them I'll put that link right here", "Iy1WHADwxPc": "all right this is the pokeweed this is the pokeweed and this is the pokeberry poke very this planet has been brutalized by the birds and the bugs but anyway I'm at a video on the berry I've got another video on the plant itself the head ability of the leaves and and the plant itself no the berry the whole plant is toxic the whole plan the route the stalk the stems leaves the berries the seeds they're all toxic root being the most toxic and then the leaves and then the berries but anyway I am NOT an expert you need to consult with an expert a local expert before you go eating anything I am not telling you to eat any part of this plant this is a toxic poisonous plant now if this plant is done correctly it can be eat even the leaves can be eaten it's got medicinal value in the root and then the berries but you have to know what you're doing this this is not a plant you want to mess with yes if you don't know what you're doing anyway people make jellies out of out of the berries people may cut jelly out of it there's people to make pie out of the berries the toxic part of the berry is the seed ok the juice isn't really toxic to see this kind of medium mildly toxic so if you eat a berry I'm not telling you to do it I'm telling you what I here's what I do I eat a berry the berries are medicinal their antiviral and they're really good for arthritis so here's what I do I ate one berry one or two berries a day or let's say today so I'll leave to berries today and then I won't need any more berries for about three days am i eighteen to a month or whatever and it's really good for arthritis or if I want something that has a end that has some antiviral properties and if this is a this is good so anyway yet some people some people wait like three I just do too but you don't do it every day you wait three days and do it again so I'm not telling you what this is what I do and other people and there's some people who take take it for like 14 days they'll take one one day and then the second day they'll take two the third day three the fourth day for the fifth day five to six day six and then a seven day seven and then they'll back it up they'll do six days they'll back it up and do six five four three two one anyway alright so the seed is the toxic part so you do not crunch the seed don't cut don't crunch the see like to see go through your body it's just like a bird a bird eats the berry poops out the seed while while that seed is in its stomach the outer coating gets broken down by the acids in the bird stomach and then it poops it out and a plant pops up the same things all happened with you or me because you ain't gonna you're not gonna eat a berry anyway that's like my second berry today anyway so the berry doesn't taste good to me I don't I don't know why you'd make a bleep eye out of it but it tastes if you break the plan open and smell it it that's what it tastes like tastes just like the plan smiles so anyway can't be made into a dye as you could say yeah I can't see my tongue but it's probably purple anyway that's it I'm not an expert here to consult with a local expert before you go eating anything like you hear about people being poisoned with these berries kids usually but here's usually what happens I Kidal eight three four berries and mom will see that the kids mouth is all purple all purple and she'll freak out rush the kid to the hospital or a pump his stomach well the kid was never poisoned to begin with the it would take a ton of these seeds to poison somebody you'd have to eat these leaves raw a good bit of them to be poisoned but anyway you get your stomach pumped another things for a really no reason because the seeds go right through your body and the acid in your stomach will break down the outer layer on that see but is that's not gonna break down the seat this seat you're gonna poop the seeds out anyway that's it we will see you on the next one I guess if I'm still around those like croak after eating then maybe you don't want the green ones that's not the ones you want you want the purple ones dark purple black and don't get them real old and you don't need a mess with them anyway hey do I eat these berries unless you know exactly what you're doing but they are good for arthritis and they are antiviral anyway I guess we will see you on the next one", "ciNMbLUS_0k": "what's up guys my name is Shana we're back again so today I have a treat for you see what I did there ok so this stuff right here is supposed to be the granddaddy of desert babes this is a vanilla bean ice-cream sandwich between two Fruity Pebbles cereal rice krispies treat things right there this is a big mother bottle of juice right here this bad boy is huge I mean look at that thing it's messes the biggest bottle of juice I think I've ever had even the drip top thing goes all the way down it's absolutely a behemoth when I received this guy it came in this box right here look at that how awesome is that it's like a big wrapped up piece of candy and you got that nice logo on it right there it looks amazing that's actually maybe you want to buy this bottle of juice if you guys haven't seen the promotion for this thing check it out right here so I pretty much saw that thing and I was like oh my god I need to have this like in my life right now okay so inside the actual packaging right here came with a big bag with the juice in it right here as well as a separate unicorn bottle so you don't have to walk around with this big-ass behemoth in your pocket right here haven't really use this bad boy yet I assume it just works like any other drip cap but it does have a also a treats logo on it it didn't just come with a plain generic one right there the marketing for this thing is in full swing it is some really hyped up juice right now the low going is very minimalistic looks really good such treats it looks like a 1980s hotline Miami neon style stuff going on here two three milligrams of nicotine in this manner JAMA and Max VG so really really good drip juice right here so for getting further I've actually never had vanilla ice cream and fruity pebbles meshed together as an ice cream sandwich so we're gonna solve that problem right now okay so what I have right here is a vanilla rice krispies treat homemade smash between some vanilla bean ice cream we're gonna go ahead and try this manage a minute then we're gonna compare it to the juice we go ahead and actually do the review on it oh wow yeah I'll prove huh tastes like diabetes okay so now that I've experienced that I know what to expect hopping right on into this bottle right here so we're gonna go ahead and open this bad boy up and start the smell test on it okay so this stuff right here legit smells like some fruity pebble ice cream with a heavy sense of cream coming out of the smell of it it could vape completely different so I have it all loaded up right here an MVP 3.0 Pro Edition tugboat RDA brand-new dual coil build new cotton new everything is loaded up run at 60 watts it's ready to go this is treats buy treats I think hmm it's mixing real well with the treat that I just ate okay so like usual the lemon is very dominant inside this cereal babe however I am tasting the vanilla ice cream a little bit very very cloudy juice it's not so much like a looper it legit tastes like an original juice it's not the greatest thing in the world and if for damn sure does not taste like what I just ate I just think it's a little overhyped I mean the presentation is absolutely amazing with that being said though I do however think it's a really good cereal juice I am getting the vanilla ice cream but it doesn't really taste like an ice cream it tastes more like a standard vanilla mix with some fruity pebbles it has a very distinct amount of cream to it kind of like a fruity pebbles milkshake does that make sense that's kind of what I'm getting out of this like a fruity pebbles vanilla milkshake now the cereal is not as lemony as some other juices out there the lemons is still very dominant inside treats I think with the extra cream and the hint of vanilla to it it actually holds its own do I think it's worth 50 bucks no I do not however it does only come in 120 milliliters so if you guys do want to try yourself dropping 250 bucks on maybe you guys can pitch in with some friends and you guys can all take like 30 mils out of it or something like that and just kind of share the bottle pass it around do that sort of thing and if you like it then go ahead and spend the extra 50 bucks and get yourself your own personal Boheme a--the right here I do think it's a little overhyped however it's still a solid cereal juice it's not a bad juice by any means I do wish it had more of like a marshmallowy taste to it versus like a creaminess sample it out a little bit because it is an investment this is a $50 bottle of ejuice right here now you do get a lot of a juice however if you don't like it you're stuck with a behemoth of a juice that you're not probably not going to use and you're probably gonna give away to your friends I however thoroughly enjoy it I think it's a pretty good juice I'm giving it a solid two thumbs up just because it does kind of hold its own in the cereal market and the presentation is amazing the juice is a it's definitely a top not a juice I like max VG juices so one of my favorite cereal juices on the market right now is kilos cereal milk and I still prefer kilos cereal milk over treats right here now I do have the juice and I'm gonna let this steep for a little bit longer and it's probably going to grow on me a lot more bottom line though it's a solid juice if you guys want to make the investment on it I'll put the link right down to description as far as being overhyped I really don't have anything bad to say about it it's still a pretty good juice and I will gladly recommend it and that's about it anyway guys if you enjoyed this video be sure to give it a thumbs up and stay tuned for another one hi", "_pg1lPaeQaA": "in your words tell me about the very basic difference of ingesting marijuana via and edible versus smoking or vaporizing it sure so so the first thing is your body deals with cannabis very differently when it's ingested it if you're eating something it's actually processed by the GI tract and processed by the liver it changes from Delta 9 THC to hydroxy 11 which is more potent and the biggest thing is that takes time right we when we drink wine with a meal we don't get drunk like that right we let it kind of prickly and enjoy the experience so edibles are very similar when consumed there's other uptake or delivery systems right your oral mucosa is a very efficient delivery system our mints for example are dissolved in the mouth or tinctures right go under the tongue those are quicker one of the hardest things about edibles is the delay and getting consumers to understand that you have to be patient we are not a patient people so there is a learning curve there right education we have to talk about it we have to talk to tourists we have to be able to have a dialogue and not be afraid to ask questions especially because if we do have history with marijuana maybe smoking marijuana it's kind of an instant gratification thing we know if we're at a six or even an eighth about five minutes in edibles it can be anywhere from what an hour maybe sometimes more than two yeah so the the state language is this will this product may be delayed by two or more hours what we see is depending on the product type really you're looking at 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on a lot of things right are you eating an edible and then putting a meal right on top of that that will get the THC into your system much faster than if you eat a meal and then take something that is a slower process the state changed some of its regulations regarding labeling just earlier this year on February 1st and and and part of that was being more explicit about this could take more than two hours but I know before you guys were before that regulation took place the Dixie had some really creative activation illustration on the back of its products and and I'm wondering have you guys tweaked those since the states regulations have kind of caught up with you guys on that level yeah you know we always continue to tweak those as we get feedback on on how long products are taking to affect someone we will adjust our barometer right it's a strength time scale and one of the things we believe really strongly is we can have a whole paragraph of warnings that no one's going to read or we can make a visual icon that someone's going to see and get information from quicker so when we say that a serving size is 7 milligrams or 10 milligrams and we'll take 60 minutes that is a easier way for a consumer to understand faster what they need to do and and everything we do on our labels as much as possible is to get consumers to understand how to take that product and how to dose that product", "h-Vro_P_JjA": "[Music] hey this is horticulturist Jessica Wallace surfer savvy gardening and today I'd like to show you how to prune two types of dwarf berries that are great for small backyards as you can see I have a split raised bed here in my garden that I built about a year and a half ago and in this half of the bed I have a dwarf raspberry called raspberry shortcake and in the other half of the bed I have a dwarf blackberry called babycakes both of these plants are from the company called bushel and berry and you can find them at your favorite local garden center but I love them because they stay really compact they only get about this tall but they produce full sized berries that are absolutely delicious in the summer time so it's a win-win all around but you do have to make sure that you prune these plants properly each spring and I'm going to show you now how to do that now one of the biggest tricks to making sure you prune these right is to not do it too early in the season because if you prune these plants really early you could be cutting off your fruiting buds for this season these particular variety is actually fruit on last year's wood or what we call old wood so if you prune them too early you're cutting those buds off so come out once new growth starts to develop on these plants and you're going to seek out any varieties that have absolutely no signs of growth on them those particular stems get caught all the way down to the ground all the way back to the base of the plant and then look at the stems that do have buds developing and you're going to want to leave all those buds on there and just cut off those dead stems from you know that are projecting out beyond those buds and when you do that then that cleans up the plant and allows you only to have that new growth produced same thing with the blackberries we're going to go through cut off any canes that show no signs of growth and then cut any dead tips off of those that do have new buds developing it's a really easy process but it's really critical that you don't do it too early in the season and then you'll also see little new shoots coming up out of the ground in the spring and these shoots are going to be what produce your fruit either very second crop very late this fall we're the first crop of the following spring so we want to make sure that we leave all of those intact to get further fruit production so hopefully with these tips you will have a very highly productive dwarf berry garden in your own backyard thanks so much for watching and please subscribe to the savvy gardening channel for more great gardening information you", "Sts_DMj4IGU":

"l13SfeCm65c": "okay everybody so I have a bag here that I found I met with the owners last night and they actually played a little trick on me and it worked so I'm actually gonna do a live demonstration with somebody a complete stranger they don't know they've never seen this product before but they brought up a problem and I had a solution for them which is this and I'm gonna show their hands in this video and they're gonna try to try to figure this thing out okay so this is the e pack I think that's a company name but it's basically it's a childproof bag okay so here it goes alright opening I think I would name sensory remember this is a complete stranger this is not this is not a setup okay okay I'm gonna give you some more time anything you want except scissors okay I wouldn't do that all right can you try it okay hold this camera like this like that all right so it's a child it's a child safety lock there you can try that right there bring it down okay all right can we turn this thing around no okay so here it goes okay it's child lock you got a pull back that's how it opens okay so you pulled the back with the lever with the front gear now I think that was like kind of a kind of a genius idea you know I was on the show like these like yeah this is childproof like how did you make a bad child loop and I'm like I literally couldn't open it and it just went pow and I was like oh my god is this so amazing so there you go but this year we'll actually see oh that the odor in and then it's child proof at the same time up to maybe like age 13 depending on the IQ level I think Oh anyway I don't know this will solve your problem right there you can have that just take it home and play with it now you actually got a bet you got something you were just gnarling I think we're ready to pull your own hair yeah so yeah I think it's it's a pretty neat product it's kind of smart yeah so it's back and in the front pull it from I'll give you guys I have more detailed demonstration actually here to be sure maybe you might not be able to see it so she actually tried to bite on this thing and you can tell so anyways um normally bags are open up right in the front here but you can't open it so obviously an average kid may not figure it out but you know depending on their IQ level so you have to pull the back here okay with the front and then it opens up that way and you reach back into the front here okay so there you guys have it this is a EEP AK flexible packaging made in USA thanks guys hope you guys enjoyed this video", "Ufie6PEuBfw": "tonight Kevin and I are gonna try to bars from there Kakashi chewy granola bar lon these were given to me by Christine that my daughter-in-law and so the boxes have been opened and she actually gave me a 1 bar of each to try she says that she thinks that I really like them and so actually actually we're gonna try this one first okay it's a hundred forty calories for us cuz with women I had 40 calories for the bar chocolate almond and sea salt with Chia that sounds scary chewy granola bars six gram grams of protein it's not bad it's not any better than a Quaker I don't like that that grimy part of that you whatever they are a little small grain stuff every like that the texture I don't like the chocolate it's bitter I don't mind it it's not something I would die you could definitely make it last a little while because you have to chew it a lot it's very very chewy you place the almonds in there oh yeah it's not bad it's just not something that I would choose because there's so many other better Barb's that we like I know Kevin always mentions the Nature Valley you know peanut bars even though those have a few more calories I think they're just worth it because the flavor is so much bolder they were by I don't think these are 130 calories these is a very lemonade it says that a new twist on Sun right and cranberries and lemons seven-grain Bankia naturally sweetened real real fruit wildflower honey and no - Prosis corn syrup six grams of fiber and six grams of protein okay let me just say this I when I saw the name lemonade I didn't read anything else on there I'm gonna say right now up front I'm probably not gonna be a fair judge of these because I do not like cranberry don't like right okay that's yeah I'm gonna get one without much very end all I smell is lemon it's kind of like no I got lemon huger a government tastes like that that's to go it was the lemon bars it was it wasn't good I do not like that yeah Christie is gonna be disappointed don't she like that oh she loves things that's what she said you have to try there's a kind of bar for everybody these are not for us yeah this lemon is it's like and the cranberries him like I'm like I'm a little bit of a sour bitter taste to them to like a tart taste and so to mix those two together and it's not yeah I don't like you I would everybody doing one of those again so so far Coffee is 0-3 we haven't been impressed with the ecology yeah yeah so I know a lot of people swear bomb and love them but we just don't like them so anyway that's all reviews sorry you", "IPK8GTttsGA": "today kevin and i are going to be trying some cake bombs these were bought at critchfield meats so uh the title of the video will probably be like critchfield meat cake bombs because we bought those in a bottom in clear plastic packages there's no information on them um at all it just says safe handling instructions and keep them refrigerated or frozen that type of thing no calories no nothing on them so we're guessing they're just their bakery their bakery the crutchfield meat bakery so like i said they're called cake bombs i have the chocolate truffle and the strawberry and i have the key lob cake yes and so this is um i told kevin i said this is like trying um like a local place like we've done donut shops and stuff like that because uh really i don't have any information to give you other than they were 4.99 apiece 15 yes let's see what it looks like so um 15 here for the three soft so i'm wondering if it's just like a regular chocolate cake and they just no it's got like a movie no that's literally truffle so it said truffle oh my goodness i'm not just that's as far as i can go with it i don't want to go any further but that that's what it looks like it's got like a truffley kind of pudding like top on the top oh wow so we definitely want to try that so let's just turn that over like that yeah so we can see what we're getting here make sure we get it it's got like cake on the bottom yes so the chocolate cake i'm assuming it's just chocolate cake look at it has these little um crispy pieces of chocolate cake is not bad it doesn't taste like chop uh truffle it tastes like pudding yeah it's more like a devil's food kind of flavor a devil's food cake i don't know what the cat wants up here it um that's good though if you like more of a devil's food kind of cake i think you would like that i do too i like it a lot i think there's not anything bad about it but i wouldn't expect uh the richness of a truffle really it is a pudding okay so let's cut this one so i'll try to get a picture uh for you all up here inside of that yeah let's go and check that so that you can see the insides of them so i don't know the same thing if crutchfield meet is one of those that's a locally owned place i don't know if it's a chain i don't know oh okay so this just says strawberry cake balm yeah we'll just cut go ahead go for it i like the color of it so it's a vanilla cake on the bottom oh well all right oh okay like a savage that one's sweeter than the chocolate one i love the cake it's very very good the strawberry is very good that's good the cake's a little dry it has been on both of them but but it's still got a good flavor honestly that cake reminds me like a bakery cake i think that is very that to me it doesn't taste like your typical box cake mix it um your mind that's very nice you know the little strawberry um cake little cakes yes it reminds me that they've taken one of those and put up like a scoop of of a pudding on like on top of it and then dunked it or whatever they mira glazed it or whatever on top that's what it kind of reminds me it's nice it's very good strawberry it is very nice yeah it's a fresher strawberry flavor now this is let's take this one out key lime uh looks like they it has coconut coconut around the edge of the outside very soft now this cake fills moisture yeah where it might be i don't know if you can pick this one up it's a little wet i like to try the cake by itself first that's a really nice um limiting high flavor lemon lime kind of flavor it's very very good i like that one the best it's in the cake by the way is the first two i thought was a little drop this one's not at all no no no it um it's very zesty just like a a good key lime would be and the coconut to me the coconut on the outside is everything that's textured i have never in my life had a cake with coconut on it until kevin and i got married and his mother made one for easter she had this bunny cut out and so it's just a regular cake but she put a coconut shavings white frosting and coconut oh listen it was the best thing i've ever just put in that you wouldn't believe the difference that makes just to put that coconut on the outside it makes any regular cake incredible doing that and i like that one too quite a bit that's my favorite um after the three um yes i'm gonna pick the key lime as well for my favorite and then i would go for the strawberry yeah and the chocolate's good it's just a little darker than what i would choose to eat the chocolate for me was delicious but i was expecting truffle and not pudding and it truly does taste like pudding it just doesn't have the the thickness of a truffle or the richness of flavor of truffle it's just like chocolate pudding uh so yes these are all yes very good you could absolutely buy one of these for five dollars and split it between the two of you and so it could or have it one night half of it and then the next night have half of it so i

a 12 ounce bag and it has blue hawaiian cherry pineapple blast raspberry lemonade citrus rush and a white mystery flavor it says take your taste buds on a tropical vacation no passport required three bars 34 grams is a hundred and forty calories so so there's the mystery listen how many of you get of each because I'd say that everybody kind of varies so it'll take you how many we got in our bag but that doesn't mean it's gonna be that way in your bag because normally hey these were made in Erlanger Kentucky they're made by Perfetti Van Melle USA Inc other languor Kentucky normally it says if you might not get all the flavors but I don't see that on this side so maybe you will get the same in up now Shirley time oh good grief Willie got two of those one two three we got 14 mystery I hope the mysteries are good and we got three of the Blue Hawaiian three six of the cherry pineapple and I said two of the citrus in seven of the raspberry lemonade so let's try the mystery one first yeah and these are white as you can see we've had mystery before however because this is a different mix they might have changed you I'm cutting them to make them smaller so the only thing you're chewing on video format yes we're gonna Mele now would void half of it immediately it's a way to control how much water mom that's what it is it's watermelon hmm no its water no what a matter tropical no it's definitely watermelon no it's definitely Mormon when I first met my mother is this gonna be pineapple the pineapple for ya I think it's me it is watermelon ah yes it's definitely definitely 100% watermelon these are also from a peanut and tree nut free facility because I know we have some viewers who they or their kids cannot have peanuts let's go like that one of those goods and the texture was soft and Bernie yeah it's like yeah yes it would remind you of a Jolly Rancher Doraemon it really and it comes through stronger after you've swallowed it this is the blue Hawaiian sweet it looks like a slushie color the blue slushie yes these two we think you get a bag of these this isn't the kind of thing that you want to leave in your car on a hot day uh-huh because then when you get the bike home they're gonna be stuck to the wrapper and you don't want that that would be a good drink my brother had a bunch of those in those the white well yeah watermelon is not one that I would choose all the time but the blue is really good but I do yeah I do like the blue one more I wouldn't say it like raspberry no it's like a it tastes like a I swear P or some flavor you would get in one of those frozen drinks - yeah yeah I guess that's why I said that yeah it tastes like something you would drink this one is fresh it's like a Nickelodeon green because a it looks like flora no my new clothing as well that's the great good thing we only got a few of those yeah that's why they only gave me two that's terrible looks like great for it oh yeah don't know why you want that sour berry cobbler so yeah make sure it doesn't say it just says citrus rush I think it's supposed to be lime and lemon and orange but it doesn't taste like it tastes like very firm it tastes like grapefruit and the Blue Hawaiian was lemon and cherry and something else moving thing yeah that's like an orange but they tell her to play and I didn't and that green would I would never have no no water it's terrible it's like it's it's like a great phrase no you don't like very fruit I can't imagine what and grapefruit here penny this is raspberry lemonade and it has raspberry and lemon that's what's in here and it is a pretty like hot pink color thank you [Music] oh that's nice it takes a man to hate you just like the watermelon at the beginning it's like you don't really get that full watermelon until you swallow it no that's good so you're wondering what it is that's the side why it takes a minute but once you get the raspberry it's really very stronger miss Manion that's another one that can be a drink that would be a good drink this is cherry pineapple blast and it just has cherry and pineapple like if you got a sonic you can kind of get your own mixture of the wolf drinks and they say you can mix anything that's not science oh yeah I for one of those I love this color mmm smell it's very nice I got Viktor I get busted pipe oh yeah and it takes a minute to get that point / - I get a lot of cherry unless though I get a water chair gonna be now alright first it's all pineapple yeah when it it's like it sounds gross but you're eating it and it gets in your tape so you swallow it then you seals I still have some what's in your teeth good so when you swallow it you get that flavor but then you continue to get that flavor out of your teeth and so that cherry keeps coming back and I really really like that cherry ah the only one I don't like it's the citrus rush and they only gave us two it's like they knew there was like we made these and we made a mistake so we're gonna divvy some out throughout these bags to get rid of them because we're never going to make you some people love them if you love them that yeah we're a priority cuz I hope you get a bike home cuz I did not like the best ones were the blue the blue rice wear him down blue the wine the people my favorite one out of all of them was probably the raspberry lemonade man was the blue and then my second one was cherry pineapple no really alright and then my third one would be the blue one I would go blue pink red I would go pink red blue yeah yeah the same ones were our favorite it's just a different combination so they're good I mean it's a good bag I think it's a good I think so - I think it was 329 I think it's well worth it you get a lot of candy yeah kid Zoey beating on this for a while yes and there's an F in here too that we like even the mystery ones they were watermelon they weren't or a favorite but they're still a really good watermelon but flavor if you like watermelon a lot so the only ones for us that would get wasted is these two so you'll have to let us know if you've got a bag of these and you can't go out which most people probably don't but did you get the same amount in your bag I would think they would all be a little bit so I'm gonna have a picture parade at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "sYzpvzlUMDA": "[Music] sup everybody sweet head that's some

are many out there with a much higher tolerance than myself I feel like ball of Barry's will still pack a wallop even for those THC hardened professionals out there that's me i'ma TT all right professional let's give it a shot I'm gonna got a couple of popcorn bugs but ain't go there you go you good look at it so when I open up the package let me see what I smell immediately it smells like it smells like a platinum that's what it smelled like right you've had a platinum cush that's what it smells like like platinum anyway that's going to get in here because this is a tasty smell I said

I guess your skin gets thin when you get older so you get cold quicker yesterday was 83 degrees in the house I turned the air conditioner on she's like yeah maybe I'm cold I'm freezing I lost 83 degrees in house but in my room like the whole house will feel one temperature but for some reason in my room if it's 83 degrees out here then it's 93 or 103 in my room [ __ ] ridiculous I'm like Gavin when you walk out of my room it's like as soon as you pass the UM the door jamb or whatever you call that [ __ ] soon as you pass through it man it's like you feel cool immediately step back hot step out clueless like [ __ ] me or something what the hell is going on let's get back in here I told uh before talking between hits to give the buzz of time to catch up we hey man you new subscribers you guys are on point man y'all we get into a thousand really quick we're gonna make it that sounded so white right there man but that's okay you mean we're gonna make it [ __ ] out yeah let's go on to get this buzz going because right now I'm completely sober it's no bueno that was the one ball of berries huh what you got going on so I feel a slight burn in the back of my throat I still taste that platinum taste this doesn't taste like a berry taste like it really tastes like platinum cush to me or platinum og it's really nice taste but definitely platinum I might even find out what this is mixed with wasn't very much online about baller berries you guys gotta understand we don't get these exotics excuse me a lot more news so a lot of won't even have any information online about it I usually look through Leafly or I'll go to the website that it says on the package itself and it usually doesn't have a lot on infants a new strength I think someone told me a long time ago it takes two to four years or three or five years to create a strand because you know if you just just cross germinate some [ __ ] and put it in the ground put it together man and that's the strand that you created it's not just you created this one strand and here you go to the world nothing you gotta have some years of creating that same strand before it becomes a known strain so ball of brains just has a little bit of information on that's why there's people like us doing this stuff so we can give you all information of how it tastes how it smoke how it smell how high is you know all that [ __ ] now I'm not I don't get into the real particulars of [ __ ] if I don't know about it so I really don't know about ball bearings I can just give you my critique on it you know so so far I've tasted a platinum platinum cush on exhale so let's get back in I really don't feel a budget slight buzz right behind my slight buzz you know bird come quick - so this bug well I really didn't put a lot in here but it did seem like you burned up pretty quick you guys know about me blowing all this [ __ ] out or my garage floor oh pretty soon I don't have an ounce or two out here on the floor because I'm like burning burning them to Bowl all the way up you don't tell you don't like it burn until his ashes until it sucks through lie I don't want that flavor [ __ ] I want the green flavor I want that that sweet case oh yes now the hives really starting to kick in you know it's a nice top of the head high I feel it like like right here not on my forehead but like just right here starting to sweat a little bit lick it back in tasty delicious okay on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best of the flavor critique of ball of berries with this platinum flavor sale so I would have to give this a I have to give it a five no it's a good flavor its average it's it's a it's average plain you guys know platinum tastes like that's really this would this tastes like to me like a platinum cush or platinum og but um it's it's average it's a normal flavor I'm I'm used to it it's regular so I have to give it a five you can see a c-plus maybe let's go ahead get back in here and see what we can get out of this yes I called the papers on that we go oh [ __ ] son the whole heart I am who Jesus oh my bad y'all I'm just the buzzy dog Willie boys kicking you white flag awesome some people feel like Riverdance and some people feel like way even a moonwalk you know I'm saying yes but like no one is saying my bad y'all I just took a little side trip there and I brought y'all

came out it was talking about it every second of the day man I got tired of hearing about I was having dreams about coronavirus what the [ __ ] so that's what exactly what they wanted to happen they wanted to create a mass hysteria and now it's on the minds of everyone so they don't have to say anything else we'll let you guys run with it now we'll put look big baits a we're gonna take some fear throw some fear in there and stir it up with some simulation and here you go alright they're good now when I talk about in a moment let them go in every once in a while I will say somebody died from chronic virus like a weed like a week that went by so all year somebody died some get up somebody does so what they're doing now in my mind um in my mind re-engineering the virus or maybe they're not even reengineering it perhaps there was never a virus because I told you guys before about event 201 it's a video about how they was gonna make a simulation and see how the public responded to a pandemic so they told us that they were going to do this simulation and then I swear it man and like a week or two later oh we got the corona virus here's the corona virus this feels like a [ __ ] simulation because I didn't know anybody but corona virus and I pretty much believe that you guys don't know anybody with corona virus just because the doctor has said oh you got Corona box you know

restaurant pastry chef she's sort of well you know people know who she is she's written a cookbook and Wow she's like doing cannabis when we set out to create a brand for edibles we wanted it to be sort of sheffy under the Cresco brand we're looking at Mindy's artisanal a little bit more high-end that's where our chocolates and baked goods come in they're made with a distillate oil when we sat down and we talked about like I want to do my Brittles I've been making these brittles for years I want to see what it's like to make my brittles have THC in it what starts with good quality chocolate really she likes to blend so our flavors are a little bit of mix mixes of this chocolate that chocolates our specificity and then we add on the crunchies and the gooeys as we like to call them so she loves rich dead decadent caramel or peanut butter and then we'll make a toffee or brittle that will chop up and kind of mix into the bar I kind of feel like we have a really wide variety of edibles and I kind of feel like there is something for everybody and they're really really accurately goes on our more confectionery base and our sugar products I guess is Mindy's kitchen so that's where our gummies fall under we have Fruit Chews under that line as well as hard sweets so you know you're sucking candy is sugar base just kind of quick little bites I'm ahead of the game you know and I know there's gonna be a lot of other people are gonna get into industry hopefully my brand will be established and I mean it's gonna be like it's the craziest thing it's gonna be like you know like the Wild West I'm very excited about the future of this industry I'm glad that I'm in it and I'm glad that I'm a part of it that I've like sort of almost laid a foundation for other people like me [Music]", "5QSuBn15taw": "hey what's up YouTube Enzo Tropper here with but super calm and in this video I'm gonna show you how to open the Korova Saturday morning cookie so one other thing that this offers is childproof packaging when I first got this I didn't really realize that it was childproof packaging and I was kind of ripping and tearing at it and getting frustrated because I couldn't quite open it you know and every time I would I would kind of just I would have to fight it but after a little bit of research I figured out that on the package here it has the instructions for the childproof packaging so there is a technique to opening these things and I'm gonna show you how to do that in the video so here's the packaging and it has a little tear tab on here you can see I've already open this up so you just basically just tear it peel this off once you get this open you look inside and you'll see okay it looks kind of like a normal ziplock bag and you kind of want to you know just open it thinking that that'll pull it but that's not really the case and then if you're trying to peel this apart you'll notice that it is like you know seriously stuck to the packaging itself and then once you get down to this portion right here you notice that there's this part right here that's open and that's actually the part that you need to stick your thumb in so what you do oh and by the way the oil from the cookie sometimes makes it makes this bag a little bit slippery so just be aware of that and that's kind of what I was thinking is it's a it's it's a little bit frustrating I know I'm all for Children's packaging you know child packaging and stuff like that but this is a little it's a little bit difficult especially if it's a little bit oily from the cookie but what you do is you put your thumb down in here and what yours what you're trying to do is you're trying to separate right there you can see how it separates this little ziploc thing here and then once you get that open you're supposed to do something like that and like I said it's a little bit difficult you can see I've already taken in my sighting one cookie here but you know to reclose it you just kind of you know like a normal ziploc bag pinch it down and then just go across and and this thing is like heavy-duty ziplock so no kids are gonna get in there I can guarantee that and I think some you know serious like adults are not going to get in there either because this thing is a little bit difficult but let me try it one more time so you just pop your thumb in there and then separate it out all right let's try that one more time so go ahead open this up this way once you get inside be sure to find the portion where you're supposed to stick your thumb which is separated from the packaging and then you can go ahead and stick your thumb down in there and you can figure out your own technique that I like to do this and then pinch it here once you get your thumb in there just pinch it like that and then you pinch hold and pull and I wouldn't really try to force it because it feels like when you try to force it it almost feels like it it doesn't want to open so that's where the frustration can come in from this packaging I think because it's really there's not a lot to work with at least I don't know cuz my hands a little bigger maybe if you had smaller hands it might be better but once you get the hang of it it's not so bad so one of the things well I can already tell this is been out for a little while but you definitely want to put this in the refrigerator you can see the cookie itself it this has been out of the refrigerator for about I don't know maybe 30 minutes 40 minutes and you can already see how this is starting to like you can see how like kind of I don't even want to say it's a moist it almost it's almost like succulent it's weird but this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much inside and unfortunately I started this video before I should have shown you the whole cookie but I'll show you what's left I'm gonna go ahead and eat this now let me show you how big this cookie really is so it's a decent size I've already eaten almost half of it as you can see excuse me while I finish it kind of has a coconut birthday cake flavor to it and as you can see it's fairly thick and I kind of want to break this off just to show you I mean you can see that this cookie is really really moist I don't want to break it all the way but this to me is almost it's it's it needs to go back in the fridge so definitely store your thing in the fridge like I said since this is a video about childproof packaging you know I just would like to say if you have little ones try to stash it in the best place possible but I'm pretty certain that even if your little one was to find something like this because it's got you know cool graphics on it you know there's a cookie on it or at least something that looks like a cookie it's you know it's enticing so I do think that if your little one did find this I think that would have a very hard time getting into this thing they would have to get very lucky you know their little small fingers might be able to find their way into that but you know the other thing is if your bag is a little bit oily maybe that's a better thing because then you know little fingers will slip off of this thing but anyways hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the Korova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "VEiE_EhsW6Y": "a warning from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "lKS_Yu1LxqA": "what's up easy bakers so in honor of st patrick's day we're going to be making some fewd pebbles rice krispies treats for today's video but if you haven't already follow us on instagram at edbaker's llc and let's go ahead and be a gang gang by hitting that subscribe button so let's go ahead and jump into this easy behind recipe well i believe this step is optional about adding parchment paper to whatever pan you're going to use but i just like to make sure that none of my treats stick so i'm just gonna use a little bit of nonstick spray spray that add some parchment paper on that or you can use your infused butter but i'm going ahead and spraying parchment paper on the pan as well as on the parchment paper itself and i'm just making sure that all of my edges are nice and clean and crisp so first you want to go ahead and take your butter i did not tell y'all this is going to be a fuse anywho this is going to be infused so to this i'm using four tablespoons of infused butter now if you don't know how to infuse your butter i will leave a link in the description box as well as in the i cards for you for a tutorial on how i make my infused butter but if you don't want to have this infused that's all right girl go ahead and use some regular butter just use four tablespoons of salted butter put your tem put your scope on a medium low before you infuse folks this is a little tip for you y'all see that butter that i ran out of that was in that mason jar what i like to do to make sure that my stuff is great and potent i take my mini marshmallows because i am using 15 ounces of mini marshmallows and i'm just taking them pouring them in that mason jar and using my hands to get all of that extra butter that likes to clean on the side now if you are a original schmidt or digital type of easy baker you know i get all my product you feel what i'm saying you see the difference in that but anyway so back to the video so now you want to take 15 ounces of mini marshmallow and put that inside of that pan with the butter and if you're not using any infused butter you're going to wait until your butter melts down but now you're just going to wait well look at this boom y'all see all that look at that gone girl we got all of that honey so once i get my marshmallows in there i just like to mix it up a little bit because my butter has already is already melted down i just want to make sure that all of the marshmallows are coated with the butter and like i said before my heat is on a medium low heat and what you're gonna do is just gonna continue to stir this as you guys can see the marshmallows are melting now so it's not gonna take that long at all and you guys can actually do this in microwave you don't even need to do it on the stove and i'm going to add a splashy dash dash of vanilla extract this is my little secret that i like to give it a little you don't know what i'm saying a little stretchy so i'm just going to go ahead and mix that vanilla all the way in waiting until my marshmallows melt down then i'm going to remove it from the heat and add my fruity pebbles so go ahead and dump in all seven ounces of seven cups i'm sorry of your futy pebbles with the heat off and just slowly mixing that in together until everything is as sticky as possible girl [Music] now that you have everything all mixed in you're just going to go ahead and dump it in your prepared pan getting a thing of water which is very important this extra water that you have right here is going to prevent the the treats from sticking to your hand so every time that you go ahead and try to um what is it called like even out your rice krispie treats you're going and you notice that they're starting to the marshmallows is starting to stick to your hand just dump your hands in the water really a little bit and it's going to prevent the rice kiss retreats from sticking and i wouldn't meet daverny if i didn't get to rub a spatula and get all of that stuff out of that rubber spatula in that pan y'all why am i like this like everybody else well this is infused so this is why i'm like this but girl i could have been like let's just shut that up to the game don't worry about it girlfriend get all of these rice krispie treats but that's pretty much it you're just going to go ahead and shape your rice krispie treats and form them to that pan on an even like try to get it as even and as flat as you possibly can let that go ahead and harden for a few hours inside the refrigerator and then you're just going to go ahead and cut them up and serve them so after they harden up this is how they're going to look you're just going to cut them into even squares however you want whatever size you want them to be so thank you guys so much for watching this video i really do appreciate you happy st patrick's day and if you guys want to request a video hit it down below and thank you so much for watching this video ttyl girl [Music]", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "GsLMO_r-yKw": "all right create a little entry just to start we got the gooey Center and then when you rip away you get that real s'more look it's like you're watching the Sandlot all over again I did a lot of research found different infusion methods I went through some that I thought were good some that I thought weren't good and I've settled on probably the most expensive way to do it but it's also the best way to do it so now I just use the extracts and things are great we use a Claire dissolute so it's the purest form of THC this way we have a guaranteed dosage in each one should be okay now we will take this off yes just to get it a little bit more runny what I like to do is kind of suck some of the butter back up so this way we make sure we get everything out of there THC needs a fat to bond to a lot of people use coconut oil it's not the texture that's called for in most baking so you're kind of compromising but the texture I always say start off with a quarter work your way up to a half and then a whole investigate what your edibles are being made with when they say they're infused because there are many what different ways of cutting the THC we started from the ground up we work very hard we're proud Canadians we like that we're a Canadian run business and we just want to be supported by our country without having to fight our country when we're trying to do something positive so now we add marshmallows they did the same with alcohol prohibition of alcohol cigarette labels now I think once they realize that out of the three options weed is not the worst but the stigma is still there presently it'll the regulations will become more lacks but we have to go through that growing period and that's where businesses like myself we kind of have to toe the line and make sure we're abiding so we don't lose the ability to eventually grow properly and that's what's scaring a lot of companies right now so here is our oatmeal s'more cup formed in a cup very very nice it's not really anything to be afraid of but we are stigmatized by the laws that we have on the books in many cases for many things so I think it'll just make people more comfortable socially

show you how in today's video we are going to bake something with it i asked you guys in the comment section what you guys wanted me to bake with it and the number one comment was chocolate chip muffins and i'm totally down for a chocolate chip muffin i love muffins and i'm a basic guy i don't like a lot of crazy like random things like cranberry muffins or anything like that like blueberry muffins chocolate chip muffins that's that's about it so today we're going to turn this can of butter into some chocolate chip muffins i want to give a huge shout out to magical for sponsoring this video and for sending over a magical butter machine to give away i will be giving away a magical butter machine on my instagram page check me out on buds and beards on instagram for your chance to win a magical butter machine thank you so much magical for sending this over and without further ado let's get into making some weedy chocolate chip muffins oh yeah you guys can use cookbook and beards to save 20 off at passionbutter.com okay now let's get into making some weedy muffins there are a few ingredients that you will need to make these cannabis-infused chocolate chip muffins you'll need one and a half sticks of melted can of butter two cups of all-purpose flour two large eggs a half a cup of milk 3 4 cups of granulated sugar 2 teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and lastly 1 cup of chocolate chips let's get to making some muffins the first thing you want to do is preheat your oven to 375 degrees [Music] the first thing we want to do is add all our dry ingredients to the mixer so i'm gonna add the flour the sugar two teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and then we are going to mix that up [Music] once you're done combining your dry ingredients then it's time to add your wet ingredients the first thing i'm going to add is the melted can of butter [Music] the vanilla and the two large eggs and mix those ingredients well [Music] once you've mixed that well you can add your cup of chocolate chips [Music] and our muffin batter is done before we fill our muffin pan with our batter we need to prepare the pan and what better way to prepare it than using more peanut butter i'm going to use a tablespoon of melted can of butter and i'm going to brush that all over each of the muffin tins now that our muffin pan is prepared it is time to add the batter to each of the tins all right we're going to place these in the oven for 20 minutes what just had a thought i think once the muffins are about halfway done baking i'm going to add on top a little bit of sugar and brown sugar just to give it a little bit of extra sweetness we're trying to hide that wheaty taste as much as possible so little sugar topping to it these are our cannabis infused chocolate chip muffins yes i went a little bit ham on the sugar topping but i'm gonna let these cool for about probably 10 minutes and then we'll try one all right you guys i'm back i've been waiting over these muffins waiting on them and i think they're ready i think they're ready i think they're ready okay so i'm so excited i have a nice glass of milk let's get one of these muffins out and try one first things first the can of butter worked really well at acting as a non-stick like type spray because it came out all in one piece like this is the most perfect little [Music] it smells a little weedy i'm not gonna lie when we were baking it it didn't smell at all but like now that it's actually in my hand i can definitely smell the candy butter which is [Music] um it's not the best it doesn't taste the best it's not the best tasting on a scale of one to ten i'd give it probably like a a six it's edible oh my god it looks green [Music] look at that it literally looks like lime green inside of the muffin from the can of butter and the taste is just like it's just so off it has like such a strong wheaty taste but you guys know i'm gonna still eat it so that i can give you guys a report on how did it make me feel i both said from the big bite that i had at first it just kind of felt like a walk on my stomach which is more like how edibles feel when i'm like this is gonna like slam me adding that sugar on top that was a good choice [Music] because there is such an aftertaste to this muffin you were gonna want that sugar it i think it's what it's like saving it like i keep lifting my fingers because like i have the sugar on it and it makes it like slightly better i need some milk gonna go finish my muffin and i'll be back i don't know if i'll have a second muffin or not probably not because like i'm not feeling the taste unless this muffin just like knocks me on my socks and then i might have another one like right now but they're gonna be something i'm gonna have to space out and make myself eat i'm not gonna lie to you guys all right i'll be back in probably like 30 minutes to an hour probably an hour it normally takes about an hour cheers [Music] oh my gosh when i smile ew what gosh no you can't have my muffin no no what the hell all right let's talk it's been like probably 45 minutes and i'm gonna tell you guys what i've never had an edible hit so like hard so fast before ever like ever in my life like these muffins have to be at least probably like [Music] 150 milligrams probably each like these are strong ass muffins um they taste absolutely horrible like no lie this was probably the worst tasting edible that i've had in a while like it was pretty bad like i did not enjoy the taste of it at all the feeling though is amazing like 10 out of 10 recommend for the feeling the only thing that i've ever made that i would recommend more than this would be the sugar cookies that i made at christmas time i think it was last year or the year before those those actually taste pretty good and they were like really effective these taste like crap but they they are really really effective so i'm not mad i'm not bad at all because like at the end of the day this is what we're searching for is like this feeling right here if i'm able to do that with like trim and like a little bit of shake that's amazing because that's just stuff that would have gotten thrown away anyway so thank you guys so much for watching this video if you like it give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know what else you guys want me to make because i still have some peanut butter in this refrigerator over here like we still have three and a half sticks of can of butter over here to make stuff with and we're gonna make stuff with it so let me know what you want let me know what you guys want to see me make out of this canned butter i'm like having problems with my sentences now i'm gonna go check out my instagram page if you guys want to win a magical butter machine you can use cup buds and beards for 20 off at magicalbutter.com and i'll see you guys around for whatever sewing activity or video that i come up with for next time and i hope that like whatever we make is as effective as those muffins and i seriously think that it had something to do with this butter i think that that d-carve box really ensured that i was de-carving that cannabis properly because i feel like my oven was off not that i've made a bunch of edibles in this oven but i bet my other oven was off too and i wasn't de-carving it properly i think that that made all the difference in this butter which made all the difference in those muffins [Music] i'm like out of breath and i slightly have the giggles from the the um the muffin but anyways thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever show activity or video i come up with for next time bye guys [Music] you", "H6md_iTZGc4": "hi guys happy Monday its medical Monday with dr. Leslie Apgar today I'm joined with my girls we got Tracy Scott's flower and we've got two vana Austin both from grassroots so everybody waved hi so thanks you guys for coming and hanging out all right now Devon I just met you today I think I might have met you way back when we way back in the summer was my girl Tracy and I go way back and we are so grateful for you guys to come back thank you for having so first Tracy you get to go first tell us how you got to be in this role what is your role at crossroads so I am basically what you would call a relationship its manager which is basically sale if you want to be honest you're the one who tells us I'm the one that oh you're your failure dispensary and help you with your products awesome but I I basically fell into this okay I mean I did this kind of job back in the day sales okay but a friend had told me that they were looking for a person that was good at selling basically and and I went and I talked to him and I was like this is an amazing industry and I'm so passionate about healing and helping you know and that's how it happened I love it yeah about two davana so I started smoking weed in college and I was also following the industry because I thought it was interesting and I decided to write my thesis on the growth of the cannabis industry oh wow and at the same time Maryland's program was getting started so I found Danny Cohen our owner and met with him periodically over the summer after graduation and now I'm here I do marketing and outreach for grassroots so getting hard exactly so you guys may see these people out in the community well again we really appreciate you guys coming by today so let's talk a little bit about what makes grassroots different like why should our patients be purchasing from grassroots over any of the other grows that are out there well first and foremost you know the one thing that I love about this company is its passion for helping and serving me serving my dispensaries us serving the patients and and even our motto is to serve advance and respect them you guys you guys always say that you do we people joining washtech join the movement right right and we have actually been to their grow just beautiful and obviously you guys put your money where your mouth is because we have just received a very large shipment this is RSO for those of you who are wondering it says so right on the container are as Oh which we love that you guys are making that a priority and also making it affordable for the patient yes Aurra so I would say is probably our most medical product out of you know the many that we will have and that we do have now as you know it's helps with cancer tumor so much I mean there's been tons of studies all different ailments and our processor loves making it he says it's fun mm-hmm and I said great because I know they're already so them and Sierra and I have talked about this in the past but are so is really good for patients who are fighting cancer patients who have chronic medical illnesses and planetory disorders so it's got a lot of uses and we're so thrilled that we have a big supply so that we can really help our patients yes we just have to say a heartfelt thank you for doing that and thank you for helping you know that patients know we talked to Matt earlier who was Matt except Matt garbowski who is our head of processing the processing okay in our company though Matt actually gave us some pretty interesting feedback and I wanted to pass that on to our patients who are watching and that is to please respect grassroots RSO because not all RSO is created equal and this is incredibly strong incredibly he doesn't actually expect anybody with any kind of tolerance to be able to tolerate a full syringe daily he wants us to start off just as 1/10 the syringe to begin with and then to work our way up but he's not thinking that we would actually be able to get a full syringe and daily even after a month of trying to increase our tolerance yes I mean I guess it depends on every you know everyone is different every ailment you know every you have to listen to your body and that's you know we always talk about micro dosing right but yeah you know it is so apparently so potent I've never tried it but it's so potent that he wants you to take it easy whereas there might be other products that were less potent or for whatever reason was may different that you can maybe and have a little bit more he also had mentioned that when you ingest rather than this is both edible and smokeable so when you ingest it it's like 10 times more powerful a longer right so it really it's dependent upon that and the way that we ingest it correct or take it in yeah and then also just to clarify that we have two strains we have khaleesi and we have dead cherries and look to him in his estimation there's really essentially no difference between the two and I've looked at these and kind of you know evaluated the terpene profiles they don't look to be any different to me so I think they'll be fairly interchangeable for the patient's yeah it'll be nice okay so that's great information for the patients so yes we have it guys we've got lots of RSO so come and get it that's amazing yes some of the other things that we are carrying that we have in stock because I know we sell out of your stuff a lot I guess we'll start with your favorite this is my favorite a beautiful nightmare it's just a great product I happen to sometimes get heart palpitations when I use a sativa as you lean toward anxiety is that true my friend sometime I have a little anxiety right now that's some time but so I but I like a sativa because I'm and I like birthday and I like right I have a lot to do and this is just a great ride if L it does their main it doesn't upset your hurt no it doesn't it doesn't you might wanna mention about the CBD with that too or no oh yes yes yes because one of the tricks to being able to tolerate this a little bit better is to take CBD as well which we appreciate and the reason why I thought about that at the same time is because sometimes when you do have that that kind of heart-fluttering publication you just you know take a little CBD and it'll that works really well yeah yeah all right here's another real popular crowd-pleaser the Pelle Roja yeah I love that job this is something that sells very well very uplifting and then we have three as your favorite so actually he likes oh you like so Mambo sauce is my favorite so a lot of people like they're really skunky smell or cheesy this one's sweet it's no sweet and so I really enjoy it it burns nice and then what else do we have and then there's sweet D yeah it was named after me my name is Donna I was on that they also did name beautiful nightmare too laughter you just kidding that's just nightmare faceoff is also apparently great for like locations Wow it was just a no it was the pain yeah we're like if you have cramping is that do we talk about Sossamon area painful cramps yeah yeah these patients love the face off for the pain component totally and the one that you're missing is our blue sticker which is our hybrids and some of them lean sativa some of them lean hybrid I mean indica you know but our grower will say there's no such thing our poor patients have heard me talk about that but it's really important to educate the public because you know you see people are maybe not the old for all patients but you know a lot of people are like I need the most THC most THC it's not about the to you it's not it's about the plant and the breakdown all of it and how it's going to be wrong that's correct and it's not just about you know explaining the plant it's about removing that stigma and bringing legitimacy to the industry you know right as part of outreach we speak to anyone who will listen you know we go into hospitals and you know old-age home exactly assess elevating churches temples we try anywhere I'm sit on this conversation right if you show them it's not that scary you know people are curious yeah they know the guy helpful hear about it humans have been using this planet for thousands and thousands of years so now it's just time for the studies to you know watch a street yeah exactly how those of you were watching Dateline last night I know that I'm saying lovely little taste of what's to come so yeah finally we are catching up yeah so and so this is some of the stuff that we have available right now at greenhouse what are some of the things that you guys have in the works for us so actually we just spoke about it today more processing products we have disposable pens that are coming out within a week or two they're called torches they're 500 they are at a nice price point gorgeous it's just you know if you especially for somebody who's not looking to smoke weed but maybe wants to just be able to start off and is new to this type of introduced and we also have chatter coming and waxes and even though you know you wouldn't think that you know somebody who might be older or is is some kind of you know there's a stigma I feel like sure that a lot of people like that a lot of it you know a lot of people like life as well we love libraries and I mean that I like that yeah and it really it can helpful it can help a lot too I really have a medical anodized makes sense to me that you take that whole plant master rs7 exactly higher plan know about everything it gives you every benefit right you know the substrate totally I mean it's just it's a really incredibly we're talking about off camera I used to self-medicate and then I became a patient and it's wild for me to you know know the back stories and know the terpenes and know everything and I'm like oh and might have some crayons or you know whatever it might be and I know that if I take a certain strain it's gonna help me and it does it's pretty and it's wonderful you know your your stomach relaxes you maybe aren't nauseous like it's just amazing fruits balance right it does and it's just wild to me that something like this would have a stigma and we need to be doing community outreach that compared to other but this was filled with oxycontin it would be okay saying and it's just it's crazy it is a little silly yeah you've never heard one person died of an overdose not one nope it's impossible possible but if you take all of this you're gonna be in your areas especially if you eat it because I'll stay in your system for yeah all right well what else did you guys want at the public to know about grassroots is there any last little pearl or anything you want anybody to know well they can always reach out to us if I don't have any questions concerns we are truly here to serve our community and this industry and you guys and we just really believe in this product you're passionate it's not about you know uhyou it's hard to not read things on Facebook it's hard to not be affected by oh this sucks that sucks this is a very young industry right we're there's growing pains but I can promise you from the bottom of our hearts we're in it to help people and make people feel better and you know just how it not be such a not be illegal and I just you know be able to feel better well we have I finger questions we have a question from Blake he wants to know what you guys have thoughts are on oil color you see sometimes an amber color versus good dark which I've seen yeah and what causes the difference in color when processing well I was told and again I'm no chemist by any means okay but what I was told by our head processer Matt garbowski that you know I again I saw him Facebook bleep that there you know somebody said that's not RSO it's too light it's supposed to be tar it's chlorophyll right there's all different processes but Matt believe if he will tell you that it when you put it on something and you rub it out it should be like a golden color it should not be at our it should not be I think those are the impurities quite a yes is that what it is so yeah but I haven't have Reds on and and people just need to be educated right so thanks for the question Blake yeah that's a great question all right guys well I think that about wraps it up for our motivating wasn't that they hardly needed any CBD to get through this just all right guys well thank you so much for joining us you'll see us again next Monday for our next Medical Monday [Music]", "egNB5MXTmmc": "[Music] hello squid the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another drink Dixie elixir that's hard to read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show by the legendary Mike judge of beavis and butthead and king of the hill and office space the movie so it's a great show about that Lampoon's Silicon Valley and I just culture hysterical in its fifth season right now on HBO check it out if you haven't I'm sure you've heard about it from people other than just me and that guys is gonna do it from the cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat thank you so much for sticking around to the very end guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "LZJbqRUlzRA": "[Music] uh what's up guys welcome back today we're going to do a little experiment with gummy worms and tincture so i just bought some like these are from walmart just walmart brand gummy bears or gummy worms this should work the same for gummy worms gummy bears um anything with this type of gummy texture um so we're gonna do an experiment and we're gonna soak them in tincture i don't know how long it's gonna take i don't know if it's gonna be like a few hours that we're gonna need in there or 24 hours but we're going to see how that's going to turn out all you're going to need is some gummy bears or gummy worms and some alcohol-based tincture [Music] so here i just have some gummy worms like i said they're just the walmart brand i have my tincture and then a little container that we're going to put our gummy worms into now i'll just line up the gummies trying not to overlap them too much and then i'm going to pour my tincture over them just enough tincture to cover them all or at least the most of them and then whatever tincture isn't absorbed you can just pour back into a jar and use it as you would have previously so as you guys just saw i pretty much just pour tincture over these gummy worms i did add one or two more because i was taking a thumbnail for it but that's how they look we're going to leave them uncovered and we're not going to put them in the fridge we're just going to leave them open on the counter and then i am going to check back in when i feel like these are ready so we'll see how long that's going to take and we'll see if they work out hi guys so it's been about 24 hours a little bit under and here is what the gummies look like so they don't look that much different so far but it's kind of hard to tell they might be swollen a little bit um but yeah so i'm just taking these out and i'm gonna set them out to dry and then once they're mostly dry but not completely dry we're going to cover them with some sugar of course that's optional it just because extra sugar is nice and then plus the sugar on the outside will help with that tincture flavor like as soon as your tongue touches the gummy now that they've dried so they're pretty much completely dry except for a little bit of stickiness i'm gonna cover them in sugar so i just have a little container with just plain sugar you can add citric acid if you want but if you use citric acid just please use a small small amount like one quarter teaspoon for like one cup of sugar type of thing because too much citric acid will draw out the moisture and then they'll get wet and they'll never dry so yeah so i'm just shaking those and it's kind of weird how um they're coming out not completely coated in sugar or at least that um orange one did but then this one here is only like parts of it picked up on the sugar so i'm not sure what's going on there um but here is how you want them to be sticky wise so if you put your finger on it it like kind of sticks but you can pull it off pretty easily still and that's a good consistency for it to be when you're adding sugar to it um but yeah so some of these the sugar attached properly and then some of them they didn't and i'll show you guys how we can fix that though it's not exactly the most efficient way but i mean you got to do what you got to do when you're playing around with these things i'm thinking for those spots that aren't filled with sugar i'm just going to use like a regular paintbrush i think this is just from the dollar store whatever it doesn't matter um and then i'm going to dip it into the tincture which i should have got a separate container for my tincture so the sugar wasn't going back and forth but um and then i'm just going to lightly wipe it on the areas of the gummy that didn't get any sugar attached to it and not too much you just want like a light light coat and then i just put it back into the container of sugar and shake it up and then take it out and leave it to dry and it came out very well it was all covered it just would be time consuming to have to do this for each gummy [Music] and i'm going to try one of the gummies that we're soaking so far they don't look like they've soaked up that much like they don't look much bigger than how they looked before so just doing a comparison here the ones on the parchment paper are the ones that were soaking and then this one my hand was not soaking so for size difference it looks like the soaked one may be like a millimeter bigger but i don't i don't know it doesn't really seem like it um and then with this one over here um which one is bigger the soaked one definitely looks bigger for sure but also looks skinnier and the other one looks wider so it's hard to tell i'm not sure if the gummy bears maybe just aren't all consistent or sorry the worms okay and then for this one the one on the bottom there is the not soaked one and it's significantly bigger than the soaked one so that leads me to think that the gummy worms are just kind of have some variance in size and that they didn't look like they've gotten bigger and expanded or absorbed anything so let's let's try and see how it tastes and see if we can taste the tincture you can definitely taste like the strong tincture on it right away i kind of got like weird texture on it it's like from i don't know if it's just the brand of dining rooms that i use but like kinda like slimy i don't like that well i don't not like the gummy worm i just don't like the slime it's kind of like a weird texture so far like but i don't know i feel like that you're i can only taste the tincture on the outside i don't feel like it actually soaked up anything so i'm gonna try it rinsing one off and like washing wiping it down really good with some water so that if the if it is just tincture on the outside then we'll be able to find out because if i rinse off water it should still taste like tincture on the inside right so i'm gonna go do that and i'll be right back and we'll try and see how that tastes okay so here's the gummy i just rinsed very well i taste exactly like the original gummy worm did so it does i have no taste of tincture in it at all which is proving that it didn't soak it up which is really weird because if gummies soak up alcohol to make alcoholic gummies why wouldn't it soak up tincture so i'm very shocked and i'm like wondering if i did something wrong like why didn't they soak it up i wonder if it was the brand should i try this same thing on a variety of different brands of gummies like buy a bunch of different brands of gummy bears and see which one soaks up the most would you guys be interested in me doing a video like that but yeah since um essentially they didn't soak up anything it's kind of a waste so i think a better way to be going about it is to just put some tincture on them like put them in a container and mix it up or something and then set them out to dry a little bit and then cover them with sugar i'll try that and we'll see how that works as well so here we're just gonna place some fresh gummy worms into a jar of tincture then we're just gonna close the lid and shake it up so that they all get covered in the tincture and then we will take them all out with a fork trying to be careful not to waste too much tincture um from holding them from the jar to the drying area so just kind of shake them off a little bit so there's not too much dripping and then just leave them to dry until they're just slightly sticky and depending on how much airflow you have it can take anywhere between 20 minutes to a couple of hours so once they're not wet anymore and they're just a little bit sticky you can put them in sugar you don't have to but it's nice so that you're not having that direct tincture on your tongue so i'm just shaking these up and then i'm gonna put them back out to dry but these were not dry enough when i did this so you guys are gonna see what happens so i could tell immediately as soon as i opened it you see how the sugar is almost like chunky on there i don't know if you can really see it but um so it chunks up in i kind of shook it off there but you can still see it's like the sugar crystals gather together so that's what happens when there's too much moisture and these are not going to dry so yeah they're nice and chunky um even i can try leaving them out but they probably will very likely not dry they'll just keep pulling out moisture so you guys can see this is what the sugar looks like because now it's been contaminated with moisture i guess you could say so you can see it clumped up immediately just from that little bit too much of moisture and i'm gonna get some regular sugar so you guys can see a side by side of what it should look like so there's a regular granulated sugar and then i'm gonna pour the one that had a little bit of moisture in it and you can see those clumps that it's made and how it has a less fine of the texture so just when you're making your gummies make sure that before you put your sugar on they're fully dry because this is a very common thing people their gummies get all like wet and moist and it's because your gummy was too wet when you coated it in the sugar so here's one of the gummies that was coated when it wasn't wet and just only slightly sticky and you can see the sugar looks perfect there's no wetness and it's not clumpy and then if we pull up one of the ones we just did where it was too wet you can see the sugar is starting to pull out the moisture and the whole thing is getting that wet look and i'm just gonna continue to keep doing this um in this case i'm just going to eat them like that because they're not really salvageable because rinsing them off will remove the tincture that we dip them in so you want them to be just sticky like this so they're not wet at all just only a slight stickiness we're not going to use that sugar that's been contaminated with the moisture because it's going to not give us nicer so i'm just dipping these little sticky ones into a dish of fresh sugar and then again leave them out to dry and it'll probably need about 24 hours to fully dry before you package them up overall i think the best method for trying to infuse store-bought candies is using my sour patch method um i'll post a link for it in the description box and i'll try and post one on the video as well um but yeah check this out this is a lot easier they're gonna be a lot stronger it's just an all-around better option the only difference is that you definitely need a candy that already has a sugar coating on it thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you guys enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i hope you have a wonderful day", "ZHcknJIeDG4": "how you doing youtube matt massive beer reviews back with a little cape may up in this piece in the form of their cape me white yes this is a belgian style wheat ale brewed with coriander and orange peel crisp clean and alluring um this is born on 23 28 no idea what that means okay i think it was born on october 6 2020. october november december january february march six months on a wheat bear shouldn't be that bad um yeah uh 5.2 percent kate my white is brewed with orange and lemon peels coriander grains of paradise and our favorite belgian whitberry yeast fruity esters up front with a easy drinking finish yields traditional belgian style wheat ale brood in the heart of the east coast um i love i love a belgian white belgian wit allagash white man i mean that's one of the best beers in the history of mankind and it's kind of the uh it's kind of the the thing you hold these beers up to so let's see what we got labelize that's what kate may does i don't mind it uh beer wise that looks so light i don't remember and again i i apologize to kate may because i'm going to reference belgian alley ash white so many times in this review it's going to be annoying uh looks quite a bit lighter um more vibrant more i don't want to say watered down but it has this kind of light kind of thinner look to it again negative word shouldn't be used in that but it's pretty neon it's almost like remember when you're a kid and you got the highlighter and you've got the vodka bottle this is god i'm dating myself because no one does this [ __ ] anymore and then you get like a cool vodka bottle like an absolute clear bottle and you throw like the yellow highlighter in there and you let it soak and you put in your room you get a black light and you shine it and a thing glows kind of has that look going for it i had a white head disputing kind of quickly um you know it was about quarter pinky finger now it's about a 16th maybe maybe three three sixteenths i don't know um and so it looks the part anyway let's see what the nose has i mean there's a soft wheat characteristic but i am getting a little bit of like a funky sulfury thing which is typically reserved for kind of sour beers this is not sour but there is a little bit of sulfury kind of just verging on egg fartiness on here with that wheat grain behind it not really getting much as far as coriander or orange peel or anything like that it's really just wheat base and that little bit of sulfur-ness in there not offensive level of sulfur but it's kind of kind of floating around in there let's dive in cheers okay i mean that coriander and that orange peel really does take over and the beer um that sulfury uh egg fartiness it's more of an aromatic than anything else but oddly enough that weak characteristic which trumped it all in the nose kind of falls in the back there a little bit it's still there but that orange peel and that coriander really jump forward or i shouldn't say jump forward they present themselves quite aggressively um while that wheat drops back quite a bit um to where they become the predominant part of the beer almost at a part where it's a little bit kind of distracting because the beer kind of takes a step back so you're getting pretty much more adjunct than beer here even though on the grand scheme of things this is drinking you know at its abv level if not smaller more closer to three than it would be five i don't mind it i don't mind it there's a tartness to it makes me think is that part of the citrus is that the orange peel play or is the beer subtly softly turning a little bit and maybe that's why i'm getting no sulfury notes from it it's it's kind of going has a little bit of kettle sour um kind of creeping in there to where it's giving me a little bit of soul-free vibes i don't know but it drinks fine for it is it's not gonna be one of my favorite belgian wits that i've had as of late um but not an offensive beer by any stretch i'd love to try it again and by that i mean i will definitely try this again because i'm a big fan of what kate made does so to get one of these uh um and have it come off not negative but just a skew from where i think they typically land um probably the best way i could put it i want to give it another whirl yeah because it it comes off as more of a under tart kettle sour than an actual belgian but for me and that's not where i think they wanted to go with this but the grand scheme of things is not a negative beer i'm not gonna get sick or anything like that off it's just not really belgian white belgian wit it's not really there for me um so from that end it is what it is uh so yeah let's talk about it is this one of the better belgian based kind of whites the belgian wheat beers that i've had as of late no i mean not on the outside not on the inside somewhere that's the thing it's still kind of a tasty beverage just kind of i think just a little bit vague availability i i i'm sure i could rip six packs of these for 12 bucks you know that's how uh gateman rolls and leave you with if you like what we like this beer i mean if you like this beer particularly how it's drinking it's more like you like belgian wits but you kind of like berliners and you want something to fall in between because that's where this beer lands but like i said wouldn't really hold this up to what this beer probably is more often than not so if you like uh i feel like i don't want beers i don't know i don't know if you like experimenting with beers that might not be to style or might be a little bit sideways in a can but not in a negative way there you go i don't know how to say it hopefully you guys enjoyed the review thank you very much uh dave for dropping it off down there if you want to talk about it massive beers if you want to check me out in the social media stuff be massive if you want to check me out doing podcasting stuff hopefully you guys enjoyed the review hopefully you're doing a little whit bearing whitbear white bear belt and white words hopefully next time cheers", "v6fgHX6u6K4": "[Music] and the fruit loop one [Music] how does it taste so much better now like that butter just adds a whole new new layer what's up guys welcome back for those of you who are new to this channel my name is elena welcome and for those of you who are already subscribed welcome back um we're going to be doing a video on how to infuse cereal so we're going to be doing it with both tincture and with butter this will work on pretty much any type of cereal i'm going to be showing you guys or like demonstrating it on these three these are just these props um but yeah it'll work it'll work on all of them so let's start with the tincture um because that one is a little bit more simple so i just have a pan here with some parchment paper or wax paper parchment i guess and let's do some of the cinnamon toast crunch [Music] i'm just gonna do a little bit because i already have some of these made and it's not difficult to make more as i need it [Music] and then let's also use this one [Music] which we never had this in canada for the longest time it was only in the states and then we got here and i honestly wanted to try so bad i was so excited for it before it came to canada and when i tried it i'm just like it's not that exciting like [Music] the crunchies don't taste different like so the berries don't taste different than the cap'n crunch crunches dude you know what i mean like it just like tastes the same i really want to try the cotton candy one how is that one we definitely don't have that here i remember in the states you guys had cotton candy oreos back in 2015 because i was there and i bought some of them and they were like the best oreos i've ever had hopefully they'll come back one day okay so starting with the tincture we have our um captain crunch and our cinnamon toast crunch and this would all be easier being done in something like this because partly through this we're going to need to like turn it over and it helps having in here because you can kind of just like shake it and move it around um but the problem is that i personally only have this type of size of one and i want to keep them um like as spacious as possible so i can get um as much airflow so if you have a bigger one of these that would work well or if you're just doing a small batch okay so um so i already put some of my tincture in a little spray bottle i ordered these on amazon um i'll put a link for something similar but you can use this i'm just like one from the dollar store any type of spray bottle or even those little um like ones that are made for olive oil that kind of mist when you repetitively press them um i've used those as well but kind of like this better surprisingly um yeah so i just poured my tincture into a bottle now i'm gonna spray my cereal with my tincture and then see and this is where it's tricky because you have to flip it around and like you can do it one by one which is really easy for the cinnamon toast crunches especially because they're easy to just grab and turn around but that's a lot of work for doing like larger batches but yeah you could just like shake it flip it with a [Music] flippy a cookie a spatula and then i'm just going to turn these over like this [Music] okay so i think it's actually best to spray them close together so that nothing goes on the paper and it mostly goes on the cereal so then we'll now that we've turned them we're going to spray them some more and you can use as much or as little as you want i mean if you're going to add a lot a lot i would definitely um let them dry in between so we're gonna do that anyway so now that like we have them sprayed i'm gonna spread them out so they have good airflow and then we're going to let this dry um and the alcohol will dry pretty fast especially if you have um moving air wherever you are don't put in the fridge something you want to leave it's an open area so the alcohol can evaporate so then we're just going to leave this until they are pretty dry and then we can spray them some more so we can keep repeating this step until i mean you can repeat as much as you want um it's really that easy no need to put them in like the oven or anything like that so that's how you make them a tincture now we're gonna make them with some butter so we're gonna start by melting some butter i am going to be using a microwave you don't have to you can use a double boiler because every time i use a microwave in my videos i get a million people saying not to use a microwave and i just shouldn't use a microwave but i like using the microwave and i've still had good results like yeah maybe if i use the microwave and everything turns out really weak then maybe i wouldn't use it but then maybe i'm wrong maybe using the microwave um is making them weaker and maybe stronger if i didn't use it uh but i don't really see how the microwave would make a difference i don't see heating it up using the microwave versus anadele boiler would make a difference like i don't really i don't get it so somebody wants to explain to me in the comments and give me like actually the proper explanation and not just like this is what i heard and this is why but like i don't know i'm not flipped it i just like i'm lazy [Music] so i like the microwave but i'm open to listening it's just i need some more solid proof before i change my lazy ways you know okay so i'm just cutting up some um these are this is the butter that i have in um they're in half a cup blocks and i don't want too much right now so i'm just cutting um one of mine into like [Music] so i'm going to go and take this maybe i do want a little bit more let's see how much cereal we're going to do so i'm going to be doing this one oh wait no i'm doing this one i'm gonna be mixing it in here and let's start with let's give the cinnamon toast crunch last because i think the cinnamon um coating is gonna get into the butter and we'll transfer onto the other cereal so let's do fruit loops first the colors on these are not as nice to me i feel like it's probably because they're like colored with like natural colors now or something yeah no artificial flavors of colors does it like that mistakes i feel like canada is like more strict with their regular food regulations just like a lot of stuff tastes better in the states [Music] so let's do it cheerios and then we'll do this one next but i'm gonna i'm gonna go microwave this microwave i'll be right back i'm just gonna sneak back in here and add this other half because i feel like we're gonna need it and i like my stuffed buttery okay so i melted it for about i don't know 40 seconds there's still a couple little chunks i'm just waiting for them to melt with the remaining heat in the butter and so i have my um fruit loops [Music] i'm just gonna pour some of this over and i'm gonna take some of my butter and just drizzle it over not all of it you can always add more right and i'm going to put a lid on this and shake it up sounds a little broken but i don't think they are so we put a little bit in there and we shook it up and i feel like we can add a little bit more so let's just drizzle a little more in there [Music] and shake it up again [Music] oh yeah that looks perfect [Music] sorry i just had a little photo shoot here for the thumbnail um uh yeah so i shut up my butter and um [Music] and those are all shaken up and good and actually this the butter kind of hardens a bit probably because i have the air conditioner on so well i'll show you so i have this tyrex container and i had already treated the oven to about 220 degrees i've done this at 200 degrees i've done it at 250 um i kind of just the results are pretty similar either way so then i'm going to pour that into my baking dish and you can see that the butter kind of hardened in here i'll show you [Music] like that so i'm gonna actually put this whole thing in the microwave just to melt kind of that so that i don't have to like scrape and eat it with the spoon by myself after because i don't want to waste it so yeah i'll just melt that down a bit okay so i melted a little bit of butter and now we're gonna do cinnamon toast crunch which is my favorite actually it's not my favorite i love lots of cereals [Music] and then we're going to pour some butter over it yeah see i did make a little bit too much butter but not that much maybe i'll make some popcorn after and pour that on okay and then i'm just gonna um i don't know well let me zoom in okay so i have my uh slimming tools crunch and my butter oh i'm probably screaming into the camera right now um and i'm just gonna pour that over just a little bit to start with and we're gonna shake that oh my god that was so close to spilling that i can't believe i actually saved that okay see you do this in a plastic bag whatever okay uh [Music] i feel oh this one's gonna taste so good with the butter i can already imagine i'm gonna add a little bit more just a little bit i can you guys know like what am i trying to say like have you ever had that chex mix type thing that's made with um butter in the oven and then it just has that i can't even explain how delicious this is going to be this city into a french one it's like this is what it's about like buttered bread buttered cinnamon bread okay so that's how it looks the lighting is kind of weird uh maybe i'll zoom in when it's on the in the pan i'm just gonna put that in there don't worry it's just me eating this getting my little raccoon fingers all over everything now see what should we use this for cause this is like a mix of like cinnamon sugar and butter i feel like this probably tastes good by itself yes that tastes good by itself oh that is tasty it kind of tastes like frosting but anyways we have our butter coated cereal and it kind of has like a uh textures like i don't know how you explain that let's see uh like a butter texture essentially um so i preheat the oven to [Music] 220 degrees like i said and i'm going to put this in there and we're gonna let it cook for about 10-15 minutes so let's go bring that with us from the kitchen [Music] so i'll turn the lights on and what do we have 220 [Music] and we're gonna put this in i'm going to set a timer for about 10 minutes and we're going to come back and flip so it looks like these have dried a bit but not fully um if you're more patient you can just do this for the day and just come back to it every like hour or so and just spray and then um let it dry and then just do that every hour so you can really layer it up but for the purpose of this video i'm just gonna spray it again here and like i said before you can repeat this process as many times as you like i'm just this is gonna be the last time i'm doing it just because um for the video [Music] although like probably off camera i'll probably spray some more but it just depends on how strong you want to be and this isn't a perfect dosing um method like this isn't like some fancy like exact dosage and like it's not guaranteed the same results every time um but it's just a nice way to kind of just have the little snacks on hand so we're just gonna leave this out to dry we're gonna do that so we can get some better air on it and then that is pretty much good to go once it's fully um crunchy again [Music] okay so 10 minute timer went off and bear with me because i have uh i'm doing this one hand here so i'm just gonna pull this out looking good smells good oh very cinnamony um okay and i'm just gonna like if you just had one flavor in here you could uh how do i say this like [Music] flip it you know what i mean but because i have two i want to keep them separated and this would work better if you had it in a bigger dish so that the heat could get to the more evenly these look like halloween colors that's not what fruit loops used to look like like where's the red ones is it isn't it because red food coloring is supposed to be really bad or it comes from like cockroaches or something i don't know it's like why are you bothered by eating a cockroach when people eat like meat they're just like what's the difference so put that back in and let's do another 10 minutes [Music] and then we will come see actually let's do 15 minutes again like it doesn't really matter usually i put this in the oven between anywhere between like 20 and 45 minutes um and just flip it every like 10 or 15 or so um just just try different types and see how you like it it tastes maybe a little bit different if you cook it for you know half an hour instead of 45 minutes or 20 minutes instead of 45 but you could just take um some out at 20 minutes and then takes about a half an hour and kind of just taste each one and see how you like it the best and you can kind of figure out what your favorite way to do it is um from just one round essentially okay 15 minutes is up so it's been there for a total of 25 minutes oh my god that smells so good like i'm pretty sure it's just the cinnamon stuff it smells good but it literally smells like pie something like that i don't know it's really good oh sorry camera i put that can i put that there so yeah we're just mixing that up i think maybe like 10 or a minute should be good so just throw that back in [Music] and then 10 more minutes [Music] okay now our 15 minutes is over i'm going to turn off the oven and pull these out i think these are good to go let's just bring them over i am just going to lay them out on the parchment paper just to dry i mean i'm sure they could dry in the dish as well but i feel like they'll dry a little bit better here yeah so you kind of have them mixed together [Music] the rest of that here so we're just gonna leave these out to dry i'm just gonna separate the pieces that shouldn't be in the piles there kind of annoying um yeah see there they're not like they're not fully dry but they're just about dry it's all ready oh let's try the fruit [Music] lips sorry yeah so just leave that to dry and then i don't know i think it'll be good in like half an hour and then you can pack them all up once they're fully dry and they are ready to use whether you eat them by themselves or were you for milkover obviously i'm interested in eating them by themselves they're really good but thank you guys so much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did um i feel like i need to get a new ending because i feel like i say the exact same thing every time i hope you guys like this video and [Music] thank you guys so much for watching i hope you like this video please let me know if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up leave a comment tell me what your favorite cereal is and subscribe thank you guys so much i hope you have a wonderful day see you guys next time i'm back because i forgot to taste the tincture ones i guess because they're not fully dry but or are they okay they're pretty much dry they can dry out for a little bit longer um honestly like not as good as the butter because well you can still taste the alcohol in a little bit like it mostly evaporates but you can still taste it a little bit and butter is there anything you can add butter to that doesn't taste good like obviously not dumplings like adding butter fruits actually you know why adding butter to fruit like in the oven is good it's like apple crisp you know but the better one's better and crunchier and buddier okay that's all it tastes kind of like reminds me of pie [Music] because the butter [Music] and the frugal ones how does it taste so much better now like that butter just adds a whole new [Music] layer", "pn1WqJMStr0": "you know about my third book lon getting started on my third tour you know it just never does so but I'm so glad to be able to do my first talk here because there's a such a special place bro okay lesson number one is No Norfolk Virginia the ground throw and this is a piece of my youth I grew up in a military town my dad to the Navy and behind a field across the street from where I lived and as kids we did text and have computers and we did have Kanaka but this was my playground and it was the point of the most exciting times of my life at the time the entire field was cattails and there's a low lying area as we left the field and walked across my elementary school was there and then there was this tributary we and my mom passed away and I settled on her house it was that important to me that I drove by to take pictures because I wanted to say but I actually have had this reoccurring dream that I've gone there and it on it's some kind of Wildlife Refuge and I couldn't ever get back into this area this area so important to tell you the mirror and John manners in that dream with me talk and talk about hee hee and I find this rare cherry tree and so he first agency and he's saying that's not ripe enough but I had to be I woke I would wake up from this dream and go okay that wasn't real that's because this is and across that footbridge is what military housing was and that's where I met my best friend gentlemen because we would go you would go into this Wow and there were nine and we love to tell about it because we didn't know if it was edible or not and align hem and most of these wild berries from tree to tree are going to have a different taste I'm not going to be consistent Katrine you market you never tell anybody about it but I shouldn't have done that I should have eaten me Ronia but we did and it was about everything in the fall after school she would go out great but that led me to wanting to know a whole lot more about berries and I love gardening and I love edible gardens or edibility but I'm a wildlife gardener and so I grow a lot of berries for the wildlife and you know I get curious of whether I can eat myself so one of the things I like about the book is the publisher invested in a spiral bread found with coated pages so that it can get wet makes it easy to throw the glove box or the child's stroller or or just in your backpack nice and the book is laid out uniformed you flip it open it has the same berry in it our you know featured on both side has to plant type po-boys and mode which is on all of these cases it was ingestion the symptoms the toxic principal severity the season that they're in them bearing the flower I put the flowers in there because in some cases like a service berry it's hard to find the berries in when they're in very because everything's been in leaf but if you can identify it while it's in flower then you can mark that tree and then come back a month later once here and I put the leaf information in there the shape size the weather is alternate opposite and then all the cultural information so whether we can um grow it or not Oh worth one it's a bad berry but it's very low toxicity I actually took one and it was not any good than one another you know it this is interesting because my birds don't eat it and there was a study done a report I guess in Georgia where birds had died from eating no one has been able to know other reports that come in from that but I do know my birds don't enjoy but it's really okay so I had a um a head of the Fallen when I did the book it was I didn't say okay we're going to do these 40 berries it was but it kind of developed into that I wanted to be able to do the most common across the u.s. so I had to you know he's the California those in Wisconsin by the way if you think book tours are glamorous you're right guess where I'm going tomorrow Madison welcome I had a bar coat that covered the phone because it going to be colder up there and I still don't like I'm preparing enough for that so I had to do I did things that weren't necessarily obvious that they were married so technically if the tomato was a berry so if any especially flushing for so also by best definition of banana and any pineapple very interesting and mystical um but they're different clientele format bananas its poster child and my son benefits that I got a couple copies over there for ten and you should have gotten some seeds okay but I did stretch it a little bit I included a very interesting story about the you we don't tend to get the berries we're just too far south but in the North it were more prevalent and everybody knows that they're poisonous right everybody and that's the best school of thought to tell everybody's just never eat anything out of the wall guess what the flesh is edible and it's very very very good but the speed three to four speeds will kill you in three to four hours no symptoms no so so you I have that is my book I have it good berries I have bad berries but I also have good very bad idea I always reminded me something that's upset I think about her every time I'd say that it's a bad idea for various reasons in this case the seat is so poisonous don't even bother unless you really really know what you're doing when I was in the Netherlands in September it was very very everywhere so I gathered a whole bunch and had them at my launch and I'm going to prove that this is right and they were in there they're lovely and but otherwise that was the only time I've ever tasted one until I did this research so what it's worth and also with the Washington Hawthorne that seed is poisonous it's not as severe as the you but it is it is poisonous but the flush itself is very yummy in fact it's foraging it's a plant that is used for pepsin so it's a natural source of pectin one of the things I did talk about in the book and you'll see here is that when I talk about a good fairy and I mentioned whether it needs pectin or not afraid contains pectin or if it needs to be added that was really hard to find because a lot of these berries are just not you know like how to find something all these are the scare people that were really into make you know beautyberry so my husband and I have a shared interest we most love you Gibbons and we spoke about but he said this and it kind of bothers me because he was my hero right and he still is but he said there is no poisonous plants that taste good nature doesn't want to kill you so I'm not going to take too many points away but I think it's just that whole that whole mantra of just stay away from the you and if you do it that way right now that isn't so if it tastes bad that doesn't mean it's bad for you but if it tastes good doesn't if it's not bad except to you and that's my that's the only one I know about there might be others so she okay I really wanted to write this book when we were all hiking as a family outside Denver that is me and you see I'm still wearing a dress even what I like I am Maya I have my charm I guess and I found this we all found this produce Virginia well yeah that looks familiar but I had no confidence at all that I knew what that was I'm not a botanist I'm from Virginia I know this plant but I didn't expect it in the mountains of the Rockies and so it was just bizarre I said you know what I really really really want to learn more about these berries so while I was writing the book I started a group on Facebook if I do come to win if you like it's called foraging if you choose the idea is I don't consider myself this you know hiker that's going to be eaten yucca roots in the wild or whatever oh I'll have them at a nice Mexican restaurant I'll fry them just dry but on the greenways and the neighborhoods people out cycling in an Iran backyard I want people to be able to instead of having another crepe myrtle grow a service berry there are berries are hard to find for us and it's it has the same attributes as a primer ttle and our towns can support one less regular lightning so here we support a cough call my people foragers examples of hope foragers I include blackberries in the book but I don't grow them myself and I don't because I know all the great spots in Raleigh to forage for them and I was going to the farmers market that my car this is this wasn't a style shot which I that's my car and these are cyclist and there's students at NC State and they had a mission I don't know if it was a fraternity thing or what but I saw them I knew exactly what they were doing so I pulled over hey hey can I get some pictures they go boom boom busy here and so what we do when you said we were trying to get barry's it's a contest we're going to cycle around and collect berries and I said well let me get rejects and pictures and I'll tell you with all the very Patrick okay also I had been there a week before and pretty much stripped the tree of every local blackberry there so I kind of felt a little guilty by didn't tell them so I'm often asked if birds can eat it can wait not necessarily and just make that a big now oh very is sample of that birds love it I actually grow it I know you probably think less of me now but I think it is a really pretty plant and actually the berry is the least poisonous part of the pepper berry and then it's a we can date it can our guts and that's also a know dogs are highly allergic to grapes for example and that's my dog pepper aka apparitions all right so I'm going to just go through some some of the berries for the examples that are in the book starting with some bad berries but look how good that looks right how do we never not want to try that berry I mean okay so nobody wants to grow kuba okay well you might now because a lot of research is being done so that it's not looking like that anymore right you know we don't want to miss that last year but you know they've been making some new prettier ones I bought one recently but I won't eat the berry I'm not even sure we'll take one for the pain on that it is I love toxicity um and the leads are also poisonous but obviously the fruit but if this is one of those things that our parents said don't eat any berries and it's still a really good thing to tell people if you really really know what it is you're eating but it is a low toxicity nausea and vomiting possible so here's that Pope Queen this is in my garden Helen payments um yeah and you know and you have you if they fell like trees when you have to get rid of one and I only ever let one get this big every year but the wildlife but the birds just love it here's the flowers okay so this picture was taken by my friend Bill Johnson who does wildlife wildlife plan he helps a lot every part of the plant is poisonous by ingestion and it's lovely you'll get diarrhea vomiting internal bleeding reppin RP you know is nothing anybody wants it it's mild to deadly but here's what's interesting to me is the new shoots supposedly are edible I'm not even anyone eaten yes yes good for y'all y'all miss tell about it you know it's one of those things that it has to be less than a hands with right and it has to be more you have to pull it with more than two changes of water you know what if your hand is really really big you know or you know what if it's really three changes water which I've heard just like well I'm really sure I'm going to be into this but I might try it y'all bein Bloomsdale about it but this would probably be a much safer bet if you're into that but don't eat the berries not a bad very is Virginia Creeper and how can something so beautiful be so bad and I know y'all are going out like a she said or taste in plants but I didn't I love this is a great wildlife plan and the color in the winter is so beautiful so how something so bad look my friend's house in Washington a tasty aqua Oh Oh even the Anthropology thinks it's kept but they can't get it but it is how a toxic and maybe fail with no ever thought about that you start today here's another one in who ever thought about eating one maybe that you didn't get rid of Phillip on it but Solomon's nail that's going forward to them the flower it would take a lot to have a reaction it's not worth it and I don't have to take them up of the team out I'm like Oh now Tony sells the borage flowers form so that is worth having in your garden this came from affiliates card and my record is beautiful and that picture is going to be in historian carolina partner as exhibition okay oh this is my most hated plant I don't yell assault only Facebook I was you know doing some teasers about plan I absolutely love this plan it's just taking over the wild and somebody put it in my garden in 18 years ago I didn't really know how bad it was and this isn't a good very bad idea and it's good because it's not toxic but it's bad because it's so invasive but the real reason it's bad picture we hope you all beyond though this I don't even cringe when somebody is growing it I took the kids my kids to Spain for a month in 2005 when I came home my entire big tree was covered in this line and the bees love it unfortunately and so I had to get up before the bees and start removing it to save the FIB but it can get out of hand so quickly hey what you have to understand is look how cute animal is right you put a mask on people tune it porcelain various evil look that got it you cut it on the wall advanced but the only reason why it's about ideas because it really tastes awful it's not or you and I really wish it did it like that's my friend bus says does it have a flavor on its own that or do you have to add sugar to committees and this is one that no amount of sugars ever want to make tasty a lot of these berries are going to be astringent and when you're eating them raw but they can be sugared up nicely but this is not one of those yeah yeah they do which is why they pop up everywhere I know it's really pretty but you know by the way that was a all right so here is a another good very bad idea and that is the Washington offer and we talked about that a little bit but mainly because it has a poisonous seed but it is a weak I can't grow it has anyone I know in the mountains they do but can we quickly no one's been able to grow it here well that way you have here in Rahway my neighbor had it in their backyard they had several really had it had it I'd love to grow that that's a great wildlife plant beautiful flowers pollinator and it contains pectin so this is where that indication comes in so it's you think if you didn't use it as a fruit what you would do you roll it down sit out the seeds and then you can use it either the pectin or a relish is really good or even a jelly I don't have that the sample I hope you all take advantage of all berries heron okay here's another one that I've only tasted once and I do not have a sample and that's the me Apple and that's a good very bad idea and guess why does anyone know why this is one of those contingent things you've got to think about it beautiful flower there's my ear there's research that they're more upright so you can see them but it's a bad idea because it's only safe to eat if it's completely ripe so you got it you know with a life I mean who found that out okay that's good now but it has such an exotic taste and I can't even describe it but I'll find it in the springtime it's porn fans so feeling a lookout for that that is definitely worth giving I everywhere on the Internet see if I can find someone wasn't able to great so it's great Jam jelly but but the speed so it's one of those things all right that's right oh so you know it has to be really doing GUI to be considered right may Allah preserve some yummy worth trying I don't grow enough of them to cook the berries I do know a garden in Raleigh that they've got hundreds of them and I'm thinking on going the your friend though so here is a kid bearing that is also bad you know I posted something about a Amalia Agnes on my Facebook page and you get hate mail I know I eat that plant message I'm not I'm not losing it I'm just saying it's edible so the books main feature is now I wrote about three of them with the automata very very yummy very very invasive and we I've seen him around Raleigh and they were always good to forage but even Raleigh has decided to clean these up and I'm not able to find them nearly as much um it needs pectin so if you're making jelly that's going to be important and then the Russian all this is taken over the whole western plains and it's really really that bad of a plant but if you see it in forage it eat it take it because no one must be like are wait jelly but this is the one at home or whether yes and they both taste about the same in fact all I think all the aliens tastes about the same but he berries is the one that is grown for home use and it is not as invasive as is the autumn or the Russian olive but it still is but the idea is if you're growing this to eat now the birds might leave each to it but the very arrogant plant know my friend John bigger says that he's pulling it out because it's too thorny and he doesn't like it anymore he's pulling out but proven winners is really pushing it out there in fact I forgot nature Hills is hosting a giveaway of one of their plans and a copy of my book so if you go to their website look at their blog you might want to enter one thing to do but it's a great Jam and one of John's recipe here's another one oh it's a noxious weed right it's a good very though so bad it's good though every part of this plant is edible but when you see that your Gardens cringe don't you mutant oh why but if you see this in your garden and then this is felt very so embarrassing but how'd it very very very good so it's not you know is it the lemonade very Miglin and my life and these are used like potatoes well in our garden I got rid of 400 pounds of them I didn't need a one because they had pound up on it from time to time don't the he'll back off there when I finally decided to go ahead and dig it up and dig it up and dig it up with a pickaxe it was like this week this living mass underground to try and kill a round of now but the smile lines berries are edible and they're often choose one get gone so there you go right compactive you can use your Washington now here we go with the couscous though it's interesting it depends on what hat you're wearing you know of your old cue a wildlife gardener which is what I thought I used to be too or if you're a if you're an edible gardener which is kind of how I think of myself now you know what had you where you wear the native Eastern dogwood very learning good but supposin thirds like it in downtown a classifies this as cusco not that the Eastern dogwood has more benefits than the acoustical would I mean that Christmas cornice he groups them together now basically suggesting that for the wildlife one is as good as the other I don't believe that actually I think it needs to be broken down from an edibility standpoint it's it's an underused edible tree so you know as you know they've got that flat flowers in their hair and blue koala and leaf but when I was in the Netherlands in September they were in very and growing everywhere I think it's a very underused tree for us and it's a common residential a cherry or peach which I thought was really really interesting of course I ate my way all the way through the Netherlands would notice the interesting thing about the couscous is that during the drought of 2007 I lost everyone in my native dog was in the couscous survived the drop I just think this accessibility in the native anthrax kind of offer again whereas we didn't have that problem with you know so again it depends on what hat you're wearing and you're really interested in in providing the best of everything you have the land to do and I have a half acre which I think is a lot dude what's going to benefit you all the way around there's nothing that's taste use the dog more pictures from the Netherlands needs Patrick if you're going to make a jelly out of it it's got a really big steed and a really bumpy in but the fruit is really delicious I just love to see us start to grow a whole lot more these just for the fruit picks a great day so here is my childhood memory my aronia which is the food right now for all the chefs and people are starting to grow on butt and I have a little one in mind and I don't think it's going to be good enough fun and I did it my childhood memories but it's also really good I hope I mean I think as a kid my berries were tasty because that tree was tasty but it's like a mulberry you might taste a mulberry on one tree and it's in then you taste it on another and it's super super sweet so you really kind of you know you can't discount a taste of a wall berry just move on to another tree and again treatment don't tell me about it but this isn't no showing up and everything and I love the great chefs are starting to use it it does contain captain and called Chuck Berry because it causes gagging reflux it wasn't so description you're eating it but again as a kid I didn't have that problem John Victor made me some jelly the pink rose give John grow a lot I didn't even tell my kids that I had put it but it's good in scones it will you can be a substitute for bloom very easily with complete now this one was a surprise to me it's a good fairy that's done the stack horns - Mack I took this picture and he was North Carolina UNC Guard man beautiful specimens in the fall but it's I think if it is it's drinkable instead of edible which I guess is going laughs but what you have to do is you have to believe or let down you have to send it through like a cheesecloth to get the little stack warm towards off if it doesn't sound very pleasant and then it makes a really really nice refreshing drink so now I tried to grow this but the bowls loved it so I'm going to have to try again and introduce some farmer all right so here we are so this is what was so fun about writing this book was I have all these wonderful horticultural contacts and but edibility isn't necessarily something that people talk about so I went to my friend John Dolan said who is the premier person that could talk to me about beautyberry it gives me his name he's punk rock up and up in um Oregon and I say now I know the purple beauty theory is edible but can you tell him to why it is and he says well now you're telling me something I didn't know I didn't know it was edible but we had this wonderful conversation about the edibility of beauty berries he said it's just nothing we ever considered what he had and then we went on just he talked I can't even tell you what he told me but he deduced that the white is probably edible based on some and I have researched on the internet one person who claims to have eaten the white and lived but you don't hear the white very often the purple yeah I not have it we have it over here and I have like six quarts our pints of it it's cold because it's really a great and really a great home deli but you're going to go why would I want to why would I want to cut this beautiful plan and as a jelly well just because because so if the apopka looks calm and you got very lonely Bush you got dinner that night so that that's my book well um I decided I did it totally because in the back of the book why'd you ask that pathway I put the ones that didn't make the book in regions you know there is still not an exhaustive list but it's in there the reason is is that it reason why I left them out like Snowberry you know it grows in some free Michigan I don't think they're going to be fun so that's kind of what it came down to yeah but I have a supplemental list yeah tell mother Holle bear muhuali IV finding i'vei've a poisonous is poison yep and every Holly's bit of point others as well yeah a crowd for your oh yeah not very hard now yeah Mahoney is a good fairy every mony is edible and the the great pollen from native to Oregon is the most popular to make it there or jelly but all of our animals and I having them enough it's better sugar Oh Bonilla well most likely it's a Mahoney Emiliana that you're growing here and that's not it they call it great Pollock because it had it looks like it has a holly leaf but it's not really a Holly yeah she's my my professor I think my closet at one point I made a whole batch of wild cheering jail and then I was the only one who would give it because everybody was probably enough to design attitude are you talking about the ground cherries no the ones that get the awful no I don't one said I don't eat apples either I don't need a polluter because they have Sinai well I don't know but I guess my point is is that you get this just paper you forget that some of the most basic senses well peaches peaches absolutely apples it was argument involved yeah so you're gonna get them all to yourself right so yeah you know that's one of the problems is that what's finite and then once it gets into the system when it's in that lower gut because turns and um hydrogen thank you and then and it's not pretty vomiting with I'm not how you want to be remembered any more questions for Helen doesn't look like it thank you so much how", "IbeJXgw1t-o": "hey welcome to my youtube channel it's called eat your backyard and in this channel I generally rant about all kinds of things that I think are cool in terms of edible landscaping and just plants the grown Florida Central Florida I live in East Central Florida and there's a lot of cool stuff that grows here so anyhow let's get on with it this is something I'm walking through this nature preserve I'm doing a number of videos I try not to keep them too long so don't bore you to death if you're not interested in the topic but there's a thing called a Florida blueberry and it's not really like a blueberry and kind of is horrible actually it's kind of bitter and blue but they are edible and they grow these beautiful blue it's more ornate it's more like a cool thing that's very easy to grow in your yard and you'll see them as you walk through the woods in Florida if you dare to walk through the woods in Florida not to get bit by a pygmy rattler snake or whatever but you know this is a walkway I mean leave this very soft interactions nature there's no no danger of being really been by anything but anyway my point is that the Florida blueberry is very cool and it's got these beautiful leaves and it can be trimmed to be fairly bushy and they grow all over and I see a bunch of them growing in this general area generally they're not going to grow in the deep hammock that grow on the edges and you can see I'm kind of on the edge well maybe you can't really see but I'm on the edge if I just walked out of a high hammock kind of canopy dairy and I'm on the edge and that's where you generally find them now if you get if you pick the seeds when they're ripe they'll turn that bright purple you pick them you plant them they'll grow they germinate very easily if you put them in a little potting soil I mean you're gonna have a ton of them so you don't need to go dig them up don't go dig them up out of the forest grab some seeds the seeds are just going to drop anyway you can grab a handful and probably have 50 of them and that's more than enough but let's take a look they're just getting started and not at the point where they're blooming these bright blue flowers these bright blue berries which are very small berries maybe the size like a BB but they come in clusters you know if it says your hand and they're very distinct is the beautiful native Florida plant if you're into xeriscaping and a native flower plant so here they are first they start off this is it see it's on it's almost got that kind of like a very light fuzzy leaf to it and you can see that it's starting just starting to grow those beautiful little flowers they start off with light purple and then you can see just a little bit lower they get that they get a flower look to them those flowers will all bloom into what yeah a little lower you can see what they're looming into they're turning into little green berries those green berries will turn into clusters of bright berries oh look at what I up Hey look at what I found here that is a blackberry beautiful blackberry right next to it now that's not going to start blooming blackberries for a little while but I bet you'll get a ton of blackberries off of that one too look at that it's another blackberry run it's covered in the thorns but it'll produce tons of blackberries and let's grown right next to that grapes this is like your own eat your backyard eat right back forest and this summer this area right here it is more blackberries behind it I really have to get taller so cool yeah if you know what to look for and you can find tons to eat and the blackberries are really grown up through there that's so cool I'm not used to seeing that just growing around there all over here's one that grew a little bit more in the shade another one with these Florida blueberries a little a little wasp and its thing they love it because they can go get miss flowers but again there's the beautiful little light pink flowers and and farther down what's turned into the into the berries but the Florida blueberry kind of bitter but still edible you know I guess worth a try and you know the general theme is if you know what you're looking for Florida edible plants are everywhere I mean they're everywhere every one of these Sabal palm trees if you want to do and I wouldn't want to do it but you can chop it down and you could eat the heart of the pump there's just an incredible amount the weeds that grow on the ground half of them you can eat yeah you know some amount of them you eat I mean you're going to die so you got to know what bag you're doing they'll just go out and start eating stuff but there's plenty of books available I've read so many of them and anyway Florida edible plants Hey look what I see right here that's not edible that's poison ivy growing on up so you better know what you're doing but uh if you do close-up on my mouth if you do then you are going to have a good time walking around in the summertime in Florida even though you'd be sweating like crazy you'll be eating food that is delicious and camera right from the earth naturally hey I hope you like

welcome to whiskey web wednesday today i'm going to talk about scotch choc apocalypse try saying that 10 times when you've had a few chocopoops it's easier said at the start of the night than the end of the night but i'm just going to do a follow-up on one of the tastings we had recently at the shuttle point whiskey club because i thought it was really interesting and i think you guys might benefit from what we discovered at this tasting so really what i did was um well actually one of the things that really i love about the whiskey industry is the people you meet and the random contacts that lead to great things so through setting up shuttle point whiskey club one of the people i met was uh sherry sakamoto who's uh based in pal river across the water on the sunshine coast and she knew these guys in richmond vancouver called wild sweets this is them here so these guys are one of the top 25 chocolatiers in the world dominic and cindy i think it's doobie it's pronounced but they do extraordinary things with chocolate there and this one for example is fennel caramel walnuts and smoked salt so like exquisite bars of chocolate and these these are just about five dollars each they're not even too expensive but they're just absolutely stunning and when i first tried these i was blown away by the quality of the chocolate and the flavors and i really recommend checking out like wild sweets you can online them but yeah the first time i smelt this chocolate oh it's just absolutely heavenly like during the tasting we actually did like a one minute kind of chocolate meditation we just opened it really slowly breathed in those aromas tasted the chocolate just let it melt there for a good minute or two and then we went on to the whiskies and it was incredible like um there must have been about 10 or 11 different flavors of chocolate and i just sent them out randomly to different tasting cakes so everyone kind of had like something different and then we went through these four whiskeys here and we discussed what worked best and it was all done on a blind basis so people didn't know what what they were tasting um but the clear winner will be revealed at the end before that let's go through them one by one uh first we did the cardu 12 year old this is space sides quite light 40 alcohol about 70 dollars a bottle in bc uh it's core for the johnny walker blend kind of like the home of johnny walker nice nice malt but somewhat overpowered by the chocolate when you're drinking intense 95 organic chocolate with some really strong flavors this kind of got overpowered a little bit but on its own good whiskey then we had something a bit more robust this was the benry cast strength now this is batch number two it was part of the premium spirits release here in british columbia and this one was about i think 145 dollars something like that great strong spaceside whiskey 60.6 and this was amongst my favorites for pairing purposes with this chocolate i just thought that they went together really well um beautiful aromas on this whiskey there's all the ross so sherry there's virgin oak there's ex bourbon so real complexity in the maturation uh with the cast strength benreak and a thing that's worked beautifully with the chocolate the number three was rock island 21 year old now this one's bottled at 46.8 so a little bit weaker so it allowed more of the the chocolate flavor to come through maybe but this one was just a salty dream quite a salty dram and that just like creates such harmony with the chocolate it was unbelievable like fantastic in fact i might even give that a go at the end um and then log roll so we went for something repeated at the end this is the long row repeated on each statement whiskey 46 percent until filled with natural color about 105 dollars a bottle here um in bc the rock island 21 by the way was about 220 or in there so which was the best with chocolate well let's have a taste and find out oh wow the endorphin release with this chocolate is incredible like the whole body just gets covered in this my hair's standing up absolutely phenomenal that's so good check them out please check them out i'm gonna go for rock island to anyone no no the chocolate no here's for the harmony oh that's the bell of harmony right there the saltiness there's a bit of smoke the chocolate the creaminess it's just absolutely incredible like these two work together so well this chocolate here has a bit of fennel in it so it's fennel caramel walnuts and smoked salt and the smoked salt just ties in beautifully with the saltiness of the rock island and this was by far the club favorite so rock island 21 if you're looking to pair someone with chocolate go for that it's absolutely incredible like chocolate and salt just seem to work really nicely together um the saltiness of the whiskey the brininess just ah absolutely heavy but yeah pairing it's a whole world to discover and like after this tasting it's certainly like motivate me to find out more about what else works well with chocolate or which chocolates work with you know different whiskeys so let me know your thoughts have you've got any thoughts on your favorite chocolate whiskey pairings or other whiskeys that i should maybe explore when tasting chocolate i would love to hear your thoughts please like and subscribe and yeah we'll see you around for a future whiskey web wednesday videos thanks guys cheers", "QHvP5l9-VyQ": "hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at a new to us capsule brand from the folks at get zen we are looking at their cannabis infused capsules today this is the high thc line where each capsule has 25 milligrams of thc uh for 750 milligrams in the total bottle uh like all of our wheats reviews we're not going to be doing all 750 milligrams at once we're going to be taking four capsules for a hundred milligrams uh and that is what we will base our review off of so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach california uh for i believe uh with taxes included uh around about ninety dollars uh so pretty expensive for these 750 milligram capsules uh certainly on the upper end for what i've seen in the area uh so we've got some decent expectations for them uh and on their website they've got such wonderful boilerplate uh text as this let's let's give you a read here gitzen is on a mission to improve the quality of life for patients by manufacturing the highest quality of cannabis capsule and other cannabis products our goal is to bring honesty integrity and accountability to the cannabis market and change the way cannabis is perceived by the medical community in the general public how noble i'm sure they are uh fulfilling that mission uh with the absolute utmost zeal every day of their existence so uh let's get into the product review here uh here's our little bottle uh it's got some lab testing results on the bottom that doesn't really give us more than just the number there uh which actually comes out according to these lab testing results to about 821 milligrams 10 more than advertised there's one of these like little funky stickers that you can pull away to get more information than you occasionally see on these pill bottles oh and uh back here we just have uh the ingredients which uh is more elaborate than i would have thought and now i am seeing that this is actually um rso in here or at least as advertised this is uh not just any um thc distillate it is rso rick simpson oil doesn't really change things that much it's just a different extraction method uh let's get that sticker off and get to the promised effects of these pills which are high euphoria we shall see i'm realizing now i have no liquid in here with me so good old-fashioned dry swallow it is and here are capsules ah okay these are quite a bit different than what i have seen these are just little gelatin capsules but instead of like liquid filled there's a very dry amount of i guess rso there at the bottom uh just kind of splattered in there i'm not sure how well it's showing up on camera uh but it just looks like somebody just took a little dropper of some really sticky goo and put it in this capsule um not very appealing looking but you know uh you gotta do it one way so here we are here is again our 25 milligram capsule uh let's give it a try down the hatch it goes one and two no taste believe it or not other than the elegant capsule two all right that's half of what we're gonna be doing for this review we're gonna do all 100 i'm gonna take about i don't know uh 30 minutes to an hour or so before i try these next two but once i do about uh 90 minutes to two hours after i have my second half of this dose i will come right back here guys to give you those most important part about all of the reviews the wrap up thoughts are these get zen high thc capsules gonna get you high for that guys you'll just have to stick around and i'll be right back in just a bit thanks for watching welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two and a half hours since i had my first get zen capsule i was about to show you the logo again but i ripped the sticker off i can't do that uh and about what did i say two and a half hours inside my first probably about 90 minutes since i had the second two the other half of my dose and these capsules work pretty well they're good uh the rso oil in there will get you quite high i'm still pleasantly high two and a half hours later um i'm not sure however that they are worth the premium over some of the other capsules uh of a similar strength at a lower price or higher milligramage um uh so if they are cheaper at your dispensary or if they're the only ones capsules they have available and you like capsules these will certainly do the trick but i don't think that they are necessarily worth a premium over anything else if um if they got some buddies or some papa and barclays or whatever in there and there's you know cheaper than these you're fine using those uh but these get zen will certainly get the job done so i'm gonna give them a thumbs up but again it's kind of a qualified thumbs up uh these are good but you don't need to spend the extra expense if these are more expensive than any other at your dispensary anytime we give a thumbs up we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that is not weed related we can give a little recommendation of very simple quick easy one this week just finished or re-watching the 2012 uh movie killing them softly uh which is i think available on netflix the stream right now stars brad pitt uh was a legendary bomb the year it came out but it is a great great film pretty quick like 90 minutes to get through too uh super cynical super dark uh about um oh uh what is the movie about uh it's it's about [ __ ] you pay me that's what it's about i guess uh so check out killing them softly on netflix and if they're not too expensive check out get zen capsules the high thc especially if you like the capsules they'll get the job done and that guy's then is gonna do it for this cherry on top it's gonna do it for the review until we see you for our next one stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "Ha8Eej6E7i8": "hey guys and welcome back to the channel today on this redline vlog style video i've got the newest member of the volkswagen suv family that's right that is the 2020 volkswagen atlas cross sport now the last time i drove this thing i was in vancouver it was about earlier this year right before the pandemic started as you can see this is an sel with the r line sport appearance package designed to be a competitor to things like the ford edge a jeep grand cherokee a honda passport the upcoming toyota venza it essentially takes the very successful 303 row atlas and shortens it creating a two-row version and kind of gives it a cupified look to kind of make it resemble like an audi q8 or a lamborghini earth so the big question i want to answer is the new atlas cross sport the perfect family vehicle for today's modern family that's over here to find out [Music] so just like the regular three row atlas the cross sport has the newer front fascia which actually volkswagen just put this new fascia on the 2021 atlas so stay tuned for my full review on that video called a later date but as you can see compared to the last one that i drove in vancouver which was a boring silver color this is a very pretty shade of kind of like a greenish blue tint this is the sel with the r line package it's not the full sel premium but you get full led headlights no led fog lights instead you kind of have this sculpted front fascia with a deeper uh blacked out painted lower air dam and you get more of that chrome trim this kind of very subtle r-line badge and this is a very big vehicle remember it goes head-to-head with cars like the honda passport the ford edge the chevrolet blazer and compared to the regular atlas this is about three inches shorter but at 195 inches long overall this is still on the bigger end it's about five inches longer than something like the honda passport now because this one has the r-line sport package you get these 21 inch wheels wrapped in two 65 with tires these are one of the largest wheels that you can get in the industry and just like the regular atlas you still get a fairly decent amount of ground clearance around eight inches total and it shares the same 117 inch long wheelbase obviously when you get back here you can see it's got that sloping coupe like look kind of reminds you of an audi q8 or a porsche cayenne coupe which is also a really stylish looking vehicle now the tail light modules just like the regular atlas are kind of an led combination but they do look slightly different this is the most differentiating angle between this and the regular atlas you have these fake chrome exhaust trim pieces vw and audi have been very guilty of that as well this particular one here also has the towing package which can tell a maximum of 5000 pounds and because it's an suv the trunk capacity is huge you can see with the seats up which this doesn't offer a third row my dog cedar happily kind of jumped right in you get 40.1 cubic feet of space and if you fold down everything you get around 78 cubic feet of space and you also get a very happy puppy now of course on the inside of the atlas cross sport if you guys are pretty familiar with the atlas interior and a lot of other newer volkswagen interiors it's going to look very familiar now first things first as you can see this is the sel with the r-line package it's got this really nice tan interior with the two-tone the seats are just heated if you want cooled seats you have to go for the sel premium which my tester is one notch below it shutting the door it has a relatively solid thunk that you associate with other german cars and this interior at a glance looks fairly nice however if i'm going to be honest here vw really needs to do something about the design of their interiors they just don't really have that wow factor that they used to have a few years ago i mean sure you've got the digital cockpit display over here which is very close to what you find in a lot of audis with their virtual cockpit you have an eight inch touchscreen over here that includes things like android auto and apple carplay it is a very nice easy to use system the screen is bright although i think that at eight inches it's starting to look a little bit small especially considering how expansive and large the dashboard is of this vehicle the materials here have some of that faux stitching with the leatherette there on the upper portion here the door panel here is also a soft touch injection molded plastic you've got some silver painted plastic and some imitation plastic which tries to look like carbon fiber the door handle here is metal at least and it's also slightly padded over here the window controls are one touch up and down for all four so that's all very nice stuff in here really the newest thing that you're gonna notice in the interior is this steering wheel it's the new volkswagen steering wheel with the new volkswagen emblem it definitely looks a lot slimmer a lot more modern it looks a little bit more luxury oriented as well i really like the emblem this is what you're going to start seeing trickle down into other volkswagen products the steering wheel itself tilts and telescopes offers a lot of adjustability and range which is very nice and then over here you can see the dashboard layout design is pretty similar to every other volkswagen that i've seen and i kind of think that's where vw could have done more to differentiate this car from other vehicles i like this little shelf over here where you can store stuff you've got dual zone climate control just heated seats no cooled seats on this particular one here there's a couple of empty buttons over there and then over here down here you can see there is a wireless phone charger two usb ports and then lots of controls over here for your drive mode selector this controls the eight speed automatic which by the way because i don't have the premium package i only have just a standard backup camera if you guys go for the sel premium package um you'll get the full 360 camera with the top down views your cup holders over here electronic parking brake and then of course nice big center core storage over here with a nice padded lid the lid itself however doesn't slide forward and back that's always typically been a volkswagen thing so that's weird to see it missing here the seats are also a little bit boring to look at but i do like the color i wish they were cooled on this trim but you got to step up one more notch and then they feel relatively good this is not a real leather this is the synthetic leather leather that volkswagen offers on the lower trims the premium package gives you a real leather and then the glove compartment here you can see there's two us sd card slots there for the gps it's not lined with felt but it is damped and then above me you can see panoramic roof is included on this trim which lets in a lot of light the back seats as you can see are huge let me show you guys that real quick and as you can see the back seat of the cross sport is actually larger versus the three row atlas because volkswagen said when they took out the third row in this vehicle they were able to kind of push the second row a little bit further back to give passengers more space vw says you get around 40 inches of legroom back here 40 inches and you have a nearly completely flat floor surprise there's actually a little shelf here where there should be something here maybe for like your climate control settings in other parts of the of the world two usb ports over there a household power outlet and then when you shut the door you can see it sounds pretty similar to the front this is a hard touch plastic material here on the upper door panels of the rear door so a little bit of cost cutting there two map pockets which is nice the seats themselves you can see they don't actually slide forward and back which would have been nice but they do offer a little bit of adjustability so you can kind of fold them forward or you can also recline them slightly which is good but i'm surprised that vw didn't allow me to actually slide the seat forward which would have been nice to uh to include on the two-row version so overall if you're looking for one of the largest back scenes in the segment the atlas cross sport definitely will satisfy that and really this is about as big as what you're going to find in the honda passport so the atlas cross sport is volkswagen's entry into the continuously growing two-row mid-size crossover second remember this is a segment for vehicle for people who think that the compact crossover like a tiguan or a rav4 or crv is too small because you want something with more space in the second row and the trunk and you potentially want a six cylinder engine most vehicles a lot of entries in this segment have a six cylinder a v6 or vr6 like this one and honestly when i first drove this car back in british columbia when i was in vancouver i was pretty impressed with it it's a relatively solid entry in the segment it's not the sportiest it's not the most luxurious it's not the sleekest looking but it covers a very nice middle ground volkswagen has priced it well and it also looks relatively handsome on the outside now the one that i tested in vancouver was a very boring silver with black interior but this one here in tourmaline blue with this beige interior combination is really nice this is how i would i would buy this car if i was going to look at one of these and the outside like i said um for 2021 vw is adjusting the regular atlas to have the same front fascia as this but unlike you know the passport and the pilot which have basically just a different grille and slightly different tail lights they look like exactly the same vehicle this however looks you know slightly more different to me i also think that the vw did a good job with the proportions of the rear even though i hate this sloping coupe design i think this particular one looks good at the back now regarding the interior vw has been heavily criticized by consumers and myself for being a little bit too safe on the interior and the cross sport is technically no exception to that rule either so the inside may not be super luxurious or full of all the latest tech it doesn't really wow you but it is comfortable it's easy to use it's also very quiet in here and this car has a really good ride quality despite the fact that it's on 21-inch wheels now a 2-liter turbo engine is the standard engine in the cross sport i actually haven't driven the 2-liter turbo i would probably skip it just because i don't like that engine in the tiguan but it is tuned to make 235 horsepower in this most people who buy a cross sport will probably go for the vr6 and this is vw's 3.6 liter unit with 276 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque it goes out through an 8-speed automatic transmission this one has their hall decks based four motion all-wheel drive system and when you put the vehicle into its sport setting here and put your foot down this definitely has the grunt that i'm expecting for a vehicle that's in the midsize crossover segment i mean the tiguan um which is pretty big for a compact car is just ridiculously sluggish with the two liter this 3.6 has a very nice snarl to it it's very smooth it's very refined it's not the quickest in the segment cars like the honda passport will be faster the subaru outback turbo will be faster the chevrolet blazer with its 3.6 is faster this feels pretty comparable to the last grand cherokee with the 3.6 liter pentastar engine that i drove i also like this has a traditional stepped automatic so for those of you who hate cvts this is going to be a really nice option for you it feels like it gets to 60 in the mid 7 second range which is adequate performance um it's got plenty of power for most people i actually thought it felt underpowered when i was in vancouver now that i have the car back at home at sea level where it's not we're not at elevation i find the power to be adequate um do i wish it had a little bit more power sure do i wish that the crossbar was a little sportier to drive sure absolutely i mean this car feels big and heavy it's very wide you really notice the width of this car which translates to a lot of interior space in the front you know between the two passengers at the back or the front here it's a very smooth refined car but there's a reason obviously why you know the audi q8 gets the turbocharged v6 because it has way more low end torque it feels a little bit more effortless this engine you know you kind of have to rev it out to feel a little bit of power but it's a good engine that you want to rev out that you know is very smooth and quiet so i don't really have a problem doing that the 8-speed automatic in this car also is very smooth it shifts perfectly fine it's very competitive with the segment it's not you know one of the best transmissions in the business but it's a transmission that will just kind of you know fade and fade into the background as you drive this thing daily so i think that's really important uh when you're talking about a daily driver really the cross sport is so middle of the road just good at everything that i have trouble finding faults with this thing i mean sure i could complain about it being boring on uh to drive i can complain about the interior not having that wow factor but really volkswagen knows you know their target audience with this thing and for the people who are looking for a family car that has way more space than most of the competition this is going to do very nicely in that regard now if you guys were planning to actually tow use that 5000 pound towing capacity i would be concerned that this v6 doesn't quite have the grunt but like i said for most everyday usages you get it up to highway speeds it has a very soft controlled ride quality it's very quiet in here this would be a really excellent road trip car just from the sheer amount of space that it has really where i think vw needs to work on is the fuel efficiency for this engine it is rated at 16 in the city and 22 on the highway which in my week's worth of testing i have been averaging around 17 mpg which is not great um on the highway i did get this up to about 23 mpg so it will do a little bit better than the actual epa numbers which seems a little bit conservative to me but you know with the turbocharged engines that everyone's going to in the competition set vw does need to work on the fuel economy and make this thing better it is a product of the fact that this is a heavy car this weighs you know a little over 4 500 pounds so it is pretty heavy and it feels heavy when you're driving it but that heft translates into you know feeling of safety a feeling of quality so i think there's a reason why uh vw did that so overall if you like the way the atlas drives this drives the same way it doesn't feel any smaller to me or any sportier but it's just as every bit as comfortable it's just as quiet it's every bit as smooth and it's also different you don't see you know that many of these on the road like you would see at an edge or in grand cherokee and let's be honest here i don't really particularly like the way the current edge drives i also don't really like the way the grand cherokee drives with the v6 you got to go for the v8 if you want the grand cherokee and then there's the passport of course which i think the passport has a transmission that i don't love the nine-speed auto is not good and then of course the nissan murano is another option which the murano is a very smooth driving car but a lot of you you know hate the cvt and i also am not fans of the looks of the current generation so the crossport definitely has enough high points in here to warrant a look if you guys are looking for something like this size so the 2020 volkswagen atlas crossport may not be the sportiest vehicle in the segment to drive that's not its mission of this car you can't deny how ridiculously practical the atlas cross sport is just like the three row atlas the cross sport offers a lot of space in the second row and the cargo area and the front seats because it's the same width and rides on the same wheelbase it being three inches shorter does give this car a slightly different look in fact unlike the honda passport which always constantly reminds you that it's a pilot uh the crossboard definitely has a unique look at the rear now of course the front will remind you of the regular three row atlas but i think that vw did a good job with making this thing look a little bit more standoutish especially the r-line package that gives you the 21-inch wheels this tourmaline blue exterior color and just the sloping rear roof line of the rear area it reminds me a lot of the lamborghini eras and the audi q8 and keep in mind this is about half the price of something like the audi q8 now of course the cross sport isn't perfect i wish that the interior looked a little bit more special to kind of match the premium look on the outside and i also think that this one here at 46 000 should be the fully loaded version i don't like how i have to go to a premium package to get things like the real leather and the ventilated seats which will push the price a little over 50 000 but this car starts at around 31 550 which is about a thousand dollars more versus the three-row atlas it represents a good deal and it's going to be less expensive versus cars like the jeep grand cherokee and the ford edge but keep in mind that the hyundai santa fe and subaru outback which are smaller vehicles will be less expensive versus this fully loaded atlas but with all that said i hope you guys have enjoyed my full

drum roll please regular tea original i love the original kind because the original kind is my favorite then we have drum roll please gummy bears so let's get right into the oh video yeah okay so first let's start off with the gummy bear i i don't really eat gummy bears but i don't love them i ate some yesterday because my mom gave me some so i'm gonna eat one and see so i'm gonna eat the red kind i haven't eat the red kind okay these are different flavors so for the green packet it says strawberry from the red back on red one it says raspberry there's no way that's raspberry that's definitely strawberry berry but i'm not bad bad i like all the fruit i like lemon too try lemon cotton but it doesn't show you some reason what this mystery is let me find it it doesn't show you what this mystery kind is but this it says lemon definitely lemon but we don't know what this one is because it don't show you all you have to do is pineapple okay green one you see this tastes like strawberry like i said this tastes like pineapple but way sweeter hmm does not taste like strawberry it tastes like raspberry more but i'm not mad about it but it just tastes like raspberry more we're gonna open the tea if i can whoa okay i'm going to try all every single color in one with a whole entire bite so every single color but it's just going to be one color there's not really that much clear ones i okay ready these are all of them got women we got raspberry i mean strawberry we got pineapple we got a raspberry okay let's try them if you tried all of these you could in one bite you

it and peace bye hold up you guys got to say bye to gummy bears gummy bears gummy bears", "1BviwB6i-RM": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel I'm dr. Phil via a general practitioner and writer and this is Africa where health where we provide you with direction and clarity about everything medical the measures to manage cycle cell anemia the inherited condition that affects hemoglobin in the blood which can cause significant illness have evolved over several years in this video we're looking at the current that is the most recent updates for potential cures we have available in 2020 now for several years a cure for sickle cell anemia has been largely elusive in places like Nigeria and West Africa the country that has the highest burden for sickle cell anemia people hardly talk about a cure for the disease and people who suffer with sickle cell anemia resigned themselves with prevention as much as they can sickle cell crisis and taking treatments that can promote their health as much as possible however for some years now there has been a cure but it has been mostly available in high-income countries where there are adequate facilities and effective health came from structure to manage the process of delivering the cure and maintaining people's health afterwards what kyoto called stem cell transplant has developed challenges in terms of its use and administration and so a lot more recently within the last six months a new alternative has developed known as gene therapy we're going to talk about both of them but start with stem cell therapy stem cell therapy in sickle cell anemia requires that the individual with sickle cell anemia who is going to undergo treatment has a healthy brother or sister from whom stem cells can be taken or harvested in order for the procedure to be carried out now stem cells are particular types of human cells that can develop into many other types of human cells for example muscle cells or brain cells or bone cells how do we get them cells there are two main sources first human embryos some human stem cells are produced from the embryos that is immature fetuses during in-vitro fertilization and donated to science other stem cells can be formed from fully developed adult cells the critical thing about stem cell is their ability to develop into other types of cells inside the body so essentially in stem cell therapy for sickle cell anemia it is thought that the healthy cells taken from the donors bone marrow will be transplanted into the recipient and developed into non sickle cells red cells within the recipient the person who's suffering from sickle cell anemia the like I mentioned earlier there are some challenges with stem cell therapy one of the problems is that many people with sickle cell anemia do not have a healthy relative or healthy sibling brother sister who can act as a donor for normal or healthy stem cells to be harvested from the other problem that could happen is that they may develop serious complications following the transplant assuming they're able to get his sibling donor there may be serious complications after the chance but all the transplants may fail and the finished stem cells stem cell science is still evolving is still developing they still in lots for scientists to learn about techniques which with which the stem cells can be controlled and used appropriately the way you want to for the benefits of of science of medicine and there's also also the issue that some people find it troubling use stem cells obtained from embryos that are not used after cycles of IVF but an alternative solution has come up and this is gene therapy in gene therapy for sickle cell anemia it is the patient the person who suffers from sickle cell anemia it's their own stem cell that I used so removing the need for a compatible donor now to understand how this works we need to digress a little bit and talk about the role of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell disease now fetal hemoglobin or hemoglobin efforts we also call it is unique for quite a few reasons number one it appears to be very well-suited for supporting or maintaining the baby within the wounds low oxygen environment compared to normal or healthy adult hemoglobin researchers have also found that the presence of fetal hemoglobin prevents the formation of the cold red blood cells now after birth and as they developed infants or young babies gradually stop producing this fetal hemoglobin and instead start to develop what is MV an adult hemoglobin the hemoglobin that they will eventually continue with us and all the children and as adults for the rest of their lives now this process where they stop producing hemoglobin fetal hemoglobin starts or tends to happen from about four to six months age so what you find is that from about forty six months of age in children with normal immigrating genotype the hemoglobin F will be replaced by hemoglobin a but in a child with the SS genotype the hemoglobin F is going to be replaced by hemoglobin s that causes the cleaner of the red blood cells now the crux of gene therapy and this is research that's still ongoing with clinical trials that are presently going on at the Boston Children's Hospital in the United States this research has shown that the production of fetal hemoglobin can be reactivated which in the case of an individual with sickle-cell disease will be first the condition now the scientists working on this belief that this process can be reversed by the activity or or suppressing or preventing the activity of the of a protein called be the L 11a and so what they do is they use an inactive virus to deliver instructions genetic instructions to the RNA of the red blood cell of the person the individual with sickle-cell disease and these instructions are meant to drastically reduce the production of this protein bcl11a in the individuals red blood cells and this is what allows the reversal from the adult hemoglobin in that individual to the feats of hemoglobin okay so it's a lot more complicated than what I've just said and clinical trials are going on the process is underway there are if they're described as promising they're individuals who have received these treatments and they're promising resource and if you want to read more about sage and find out more details I will put a link to the Pape and E and research studies in the description box below so please are the measures available for people who ask what is they care is their care for sickle cell anemia these are the measures available to consider in terms of cost accessibility availability they are technical highly specialized procedures that have still been looked into in high-income countries and the United States so the feasibility of having them performed in lower middle-income countries of course can be quite challenging but they are fair as an option and possibly in the next decade or less maybe more available to other parts of the world so let's watch this faith now if you are interested in a 7-point checklist for what people with the a s genetic short considered when the ancient relationship is all generally should be aware of about their health care status make sure you check the link in the description below because I got a free II leaflets on that particular topic now next time in this series are going to be looking at the treatment available for sickle cell anemia understanding the treatment of sickle cell anemia so what drugs to people the sickle cell anemia need and when they are having a crisis or just to maintain their health generally and why do they need this medication so make sure you check out that video could put the link
