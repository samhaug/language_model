{"8Zu6AGgUtFY": "hey guys Tammy and Ashley are going to be trying a blind taste test between these Kellogg's fruity snacks mix berry and the Welch's fruit snack and we're all gonna do the berries and cherries because the fruit punch is too far different from the fruit from the mixed berry the Kellogg's were 398 at Walmart and they're 70 calories per pouch and there are 20 pouches in the box and the Welch's there were also 398 at Walmart they're 80 calories per pouch and there are 22 pouches and all similar to 1111 but I don't know that so yeah so I'm gonna get these open now I've got these two plates set up for Kellogg's and Welch's I'm going to open up probably a couple packs just to get the flavors all the flavors and then I'll be back to let you know what the case law okay here they are the Kellogg's brand the three and here's the Welch's there's actually six there's six different ones and we'll just compare the ones that I think are equal to each other so we'll be back to watch you blind taste test these people okay here are the victims I mean the people that's gonna try these the first thing we're going to try is this and we're going to try these hands good flavor very very chewy like squishy chewy our firm chewy I don't like that flavor okay no try this like that one better - I like this will better better flavor much better flavor mmm-hmm next time we'll get this one right there good big flavor mm-hmm good texture yeah flavor I agree guess not a good texture any like has little particles in it I don't like it it's not that one didn't have a bad flavor but the texture is weird yeah wasn't growing I'm gonna believe this one I can't swear that that's the same but little city no that didn't have I didn't care about it's okay you know this one Lanza I think the flavor is matched but I can't swear to that okay you can pick the level they did not like these at all the Kellogg's brand I didn't like the texture you that's the one you said tasted chunky and stuff like that yeah the Welch's you picked pick them all the same yeah sure you just try that those now different than what we had yes it looks like blackberries and a good texture good is it raspberry I know blackberry that's what kind of look like I don't know I don't think it has much of a flavor at all to be honest this is kind of dude these aren't really powerful flavors ruined in this mixture so that's actually the berries and cherries which is what she likes yeah yeah you said this was like your favorite mixture and I I don't I would not personally buy this mess I would rather have a very distinct grape apple orange you should boil them I'm in the mood for well since I even all together no matter the Welch's ones they have a gummy bear texture almost uh yeah they didn't get me very definitely I would know by either one of those definitely not the Kellogg's I know I know what about viewers she said she really likes Kellogg's and I'm sorry but when you're comparing it to something else side by side you can real it's a noticeable difference it really is a very very noticeable lick that gesture like when you chewed it it broke down into little particles in your mouth and that just disturbs me so like a little squares of freaky techno so Welch's well just one yeah well just one I personally wouldn't buy the mix like I said I actually liked it so but it was a fun review and I'm glad actually recommended we tried and thanks for watching I want to make sure I said because we really didn't care for this berries and cherries Kevin and I have done reviews on other Kellogg's gummies and we loved on in the regular mix where you get like the fun shapes and stuff like that they have like an cherry and orange and lemon and love their blueberry a raspberry I think it's raspberry anyway those are really really good I just didn't care for this particular variety", "GbrHkV_DN9M": "[Music] favori one and welcome back to my youtube channel today i am doing 20 different snacks i get so many requests with help and snacks but children for yourself or on-the-go so I just feel like this video is going to help so many of you out if you are a member of my squad app where you have hundreds on there as well as you if you would like more but this video is just gonna be something that you can always refer back to they're really cheap they're really easy most of them are really really healthy and obviously super delicious so let's get straight into it number one zucchini right so what you'll need is 2 zucchinis an egg corn onion fresh coriander and I've chosen to add some parmesan any of these recipes are totally versatile so if you don't like palms in which I know that is just like heaving at the smell of carbs and she hates it and so does Greddy I absolutely love it so you can swap and change things if you don't like it or if you do like it to make it so your taste buds but this is what I'm making today so I have grated up my zucchini and then I've added some salt let it sit for 20 minutes and then put it into a tea towel and squeeze out all the water is it's quite a watery vegetable so that's what I've been left with I'm now going to add one egg and I've also preheated my oven at 180 degrees I'm gonna pop the egg in one full egg and just whisk that in with all the zucchini and then I'm gonna add my other ingredients and then I'm gonna add my palms and I do have 1/2 a cup here I'm just gonna slowly add it in one of these recipes they're not like super strict or measurements just kind of taste as you go and mixing as you go and see how we go now if you find that your ingredient is a little bit wet you can always add a type of flour with that's coconut flour or almond flour or even chickpea flour just to thicken it up a little bit or even almond meal so I think my ingredients is a little bit moist today so I'm gonna add in a little bit of Carmen you know then we're simply gonna roll into balls and pop it onto a tray tres and I've got baking powder on the tray as well just pop into little balls and sit onto the baking powder paper today I'm making mine quite large up next we have a healthy banana bread from the clean chocolate cone this one is one of my favorites and one of Tasha's favorites he has pretty much one every day and once again really versatile you can use almond milk or coconut milk I prefer it with coconut milk if you wanted to add some extra fruit as well you could pop in blueberries or chocolate chips or strawberries I'm just gonna make it as in so basically you need two eggs instead of the flaxseed you can use flaxseed but I find eggs makes it more moist as much as I hate that word when you're baking you definitely want your cakes and cupcakes to be nice and moist bananas oh wow the more spotty and brown they are the better because once again it makes it really moist and sweet so we've got two really really ripe bananas I've got these cute little trades that you just got from Kmart and the mixture and then my coconut milk so first of all I'm just going to crack the two eggs into a little bowl and whisk them up I'm gonna add the dry mixture into a big bowl pop my eggs in now I'm gonna get the two bananas and put them into a bowl and mash them all up so my banana is all smashed I'm gonna pop that into the bowl and I've had a bit of a mind blank but we also need coconut oil and rice not syrup as well so just get out a cup pop that into my bowl two tablespoons third of a cup of the rice water that's right so once that's mixed through but I'm just gonna pop into my little tray spot on the oven and we're done so on top you could add some shredded coconut or a sprinkle of cinnamon or like I said chopped chips or strawberries or blueberries whatever you like I'm just gonna keep them nice and simple so that is that one done banana bread is all done on the oven I've let it sit for ten minutes just to cool down and now I'm just gonna push it out of the little silicon trays and they are ready to dry up next we have banana roll up so you simply just need to find a healthy wrap at the supermarket they don't have too many options that are really clean I've gone to a health food store and found these quinoa flour spelt flour wraps I'm going to use those so grab a wrap you're then gonna grab a banana pop that to the side now I'm gonna show you two different combinations is it's such an easy snack enos so yummy so got almond spread you could also use peanut butter if you like I'm gonna spread that onto the wrap get the banana sprinkle of cinnamon and then simply roll it up then I want you get a really sharp knife and chop it up you know my second combination is gonna be a little bit more chocolatey see my supermarket supermarket I have found like a hazelnut and cacao spread I've got cacao nibs my banana and the wrap make sure you spread it right around the edges because that's what's gonna make it stick when you do wrap it around and there you have it like little banana sushis almost such a good little snack for kids or just if you need a lunch break and pack them into little containers up next to do-it-yourself fruit and nut mixers so this way you can create the perfect fruit nut mix that has all of your favorites in there so you actually look forward to eating it I know sometimes when I both buy fruit and nut mixes in might have say walnuts in there and I hate walnuts or a dried fruit that I really don't like this way you can pop in everything you like mix it all together and then put it in these cute little jars which I also got from came out they were like a dollar each so today I have chosen almonds cashews Inca berries if you have not tried an Inca berry before they're really beautiful they're almost a little bit tangy which I love pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds goji berries hazelnuts and chocolate coating berries because we all love chatlog chocolates faces so I'm gonna pop them all into a bowl and then just mix it all that together once they're mixed up simply gonna put them in little jars little snack size I like just to have these at my desk um I don't eat all at once they're nice little size don't make me over indulge too much up next we have cauliflower bites I love these if I'm going to a party or a barbecue or if I just need something as an entree if I've got friends and family over really easy super super tasty so what we need is a full kalus now now if you have a food processor definitely pop in there and just blend up almost to consistency like cauliflower rice if you don't have a food processor just simply chop it up and go back and forth until it's really nice and fine we've got olive oil Parmesan cheese I've got garlic powder you can use fresh garlic or minced garlic salt pepper Italian herbs two eggs and I also do have some almond flour in case it is too moist I'm gonna add it in my palms and cheese gonna add in two eggs it's gonna mix that through first now when you do chop up the cauliflower sit it in a bowl add like probably half a teaspoon of salt let it sit for 20 minutes then pour the cauliflower into a dry tea towel and squeeze the tea towel and squeeze all the water out of the cauliflower it's a very watering vegetable so it's definitely a must when you're making these balls garlic powder I'm gonna add that 1/2 1/2 a teaspoon spring today you know I love garlic salt pepper some mixed herb just a little sprinkle and then a tablespoon of olive oil we may need another object see how we go I'm gonna add a little bit of the almond flour in there so our mixture is looking really really good so now I'm just gonna roll up into little balls put it on my tray with my baking paper now we're gonna pop these into the oven for about 20 minutes just keep on checking on them make sure they don't get too burnt on the outside you want them kind of crispy but obviously not that and they another great easy snack is popcorn if you love chips and I find popcorn can be a healthier alternative these days and health food stores even our supermarkets there's loads of brands that haven't got a load of added ingredients or you can make it at home from scratch next we have little chocolate or as we dropped so it's the easiest thing you'll ever do little raspberries and little chopped chips you can get dark chocolate chopped chips or vegan chocolate chips and just simply pop it in the raspberry up next we have little vegan coconut yogurt blueberry drops that's a mouthful two ingredients we've got our fresh blueberries and then we've got coconut yogurt go to a health food store there is so many different brands out there these days our coconut yogurt and majority of them are pretty natural which is awesome we're gonna pop the blueberries and maybe two in each and then fill it up with the yogurt pop them in the freezer for probably half an hour and then pop them out and it's a great little snack once again Todd loves these ones and my little yogurt blueberry drops are done as well so this little thinking came out so cool you can just literally pop them out so this one is similar to the blueberry drops but we're gonna make them choc strawberry these are delicious and they're a little bit bigger so we're gonna do is add our yogurt in first mix in some strawberries I've got cacao nibs and then I'm also going to mix in some of the chocolate greens powder first step is pop the yogurt in these little circle compartments so just thing a little sprinkle maybe a quarter of a teaspoon for each little cup you'll have like a Milo a sort of taste delicious so now I'm just going to mix that through in the video good cow nips and each bond and then add the strawberries in so just a couple of pieces in each one mix them around a little bit now in the phrases I go up next is kale chips these are really easy and really tasty if you don't like raw kale I can kind of understand it's quite a strong bitter taste but try them in a chip form and I reckon you'll love them so all you need is some big leaves of kale olive oil and today I'm using garlic powder and onion powder for a bit of extra flavor I always chop out the stem because I find that quite like grunty and hard to chew so I just want these nice big leafy bits and pop it into the bowl add a teaspoon a tablespoon of olive oil a sprinkle of the garlic powder and a sprinkle of sprinkle of the onion powder pop it on this tray and then pop into the up because my oven has been on for a long time as I've been doing these recipes this literally only needed 10 minutes and they seem like they're pretty crispy so definitely keep an eye on them so I've got three different rice cakes I'm going to create few one is just avocado with salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice peanut butter can't go wrong once again if you put banana on top of the peanut butter so delicious I've run out of bananas now though and then last but not least we're gonna do tuna tomato and salt and pepper and they have it three easy snacks up next we have zucchini chips what I want you to do is chop up a zucchini into almost looking like they are a big thick french fry we've got two eggs just beat it in a bowl here and then it's in this other bowl I've got almond meal and palms and once again so I'm gonna add a tablespoon of olive oil into the eggs as well and just mix that through and then it's totally optional but I do have salt onion and garlic powder as well so I'm gonna put a sprinkle of that into this the dry mixture just I feel like it adds a lot more flavor you don't have to do that but I love it your zucchini sticks into the eggs get them nice and wet and then pop it into the dry mix mix spin it around and then pop it onto your tray then you know repeat well they're all done and pop them in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes and then you've got your zucchini chips now as far as drinks can go I know that we can get really sick of just playing water so something I've been really getting into lately is kombucha really good for your gut and it tastes amazing now when you're finding the right brand just turn the bottle around check the ingredients some do have quite a lot of added sugars in there obviously you don't want to have that so I go to your local health food store look at the flavors turn the bottle around and it's such a nice refreshing drink if you are a soft drink lover then this is definitely an amazing replacement once again really simple really easy takes me two minutes to organize we've got hummus in the middle as a dip and then we've got some beautiful raw fresh crunchy vegetables awesome if you are going to barbecue or you just want a healthy snack a lot of the time my mid-morning snack is fruit especially if I've trained that morning I just love a fresh bowl of fruit so I always chop up my me and that's favorites take it up to our office and injury up next to you would have seen a lot of healthy fitness bloggers foodies love healthy ice cream which they can call nice cream or just a healthier version of sorbet you don't have to add any actual extra sugars or anything I send them adding a fruit and coconut water just to make sure it blends enough the more liquid you do add the more runny it's gonna be the banana I find makes it really with a creamy you couldn't even use coconut milk as well but I'm using water today and then I've just got a little slice of lemon just to give it that a bit more of an xizt that you get from an aged sorbet so I'm going to pop it all into my nutribullet and blend away [Music] it might take a couple little shakes in between to get that nice smooth consistency of it blending now if you wanted to you can add half your whey protein powder I love the vanilla vanilla in this and if I'm making a potage sometimes you might have seen in the previous video Krissi we make it with banana the greens powder and almond milk and that makes like a greens nice cream that's really with a nice but this is just pure sorbet but there is different options so it's nice and thick like a moosie sorbet texture it's just nice knowing that you can still have that sweet free and it's all natural up next is just a simple protein shake protein powder and water or you can make it into a smoothie if you're placing it for a whole meal if I just want to snack though I'll simply have the protein powder water and some ice shake it up now make sure when you're choosing a protein powder that is all-natural doesn't have any artificial sweeteners or anything that your body can't digest I have always used happy way I love it it's really easy on my tummy they have way and vegan options I love the vanilla it's my favorite and the vanilla comes in the way and a vegan option I do have a sneak you just can't crave it as valid 24/7 so it doesn't run out or week after this video which is just happy actually I'll get that put up on the screen for you so simply spot one scoop of the protein powder water and shake up and there just knock on the go up next we have creamy homemade ice blocks I'm using coconut milk spinach banana and pineapple blending it up and popping it into this cute little Isaac homemaker you can get I'm sure them from came out of Target I've got some TK Maxx always love grabbing a bag in there so I'm gonna pour them in and then I put my little sticks in here all right we're done gonna pop them in the freezer now and then Taj can enjoy one [Music] these are really really nice snack they're really sweet if it's salty they've got lots of protein lots of fiber and they are really versatile once again this is just like my ultimate peanut butter and jelly cart so as our base I'm using coconut yogurt you can use vanilla yogi if you like I just want coconut yogurt sits on my tummy a lot better I've got almond butter instead of peanut butter I find um but it has a more caramel e twist to it so I prefer almond butter and then I got strawberry jam now when buying trouble gin just turn it around have a look and make sure it doesn't have any added ingredients this is pure strawberries and grapes and lemons that's all that's in it I've got the happy whey protein powder so I just love getting protein in all of my snacks and meals if I can and then I put our chia seeds which are full of fiber and protein and immediate threes as well which was awesome and try to coconut just to a top off the top so what I'm gonna do to start with is mix in our coconut yogurt at the bottom of our little jars I've got these jars from it came up so to each tablespoons of our coconut yogurt so we can add in about a tablespoon of almond butter in there and I'm gonna mix that through really give it a good stir I'm actually gonna go and add another heaped tablespoon of yogurt just to fill it up a little bit more and mix that way as well probably half a teaspoon or chia seeds into each and mix them around protein so we're gonna add half a scoop into each one and the taste of the frozen cut is so nice it's a real nice vanilla flavor you could also add vanilla paste or vanilla essence in there that would be really beautiful as well but vanilla protein powder it does the job we're gonna add it you know the rest of the coconut yogurt I've got here I would have liked to have a little bit more just to fill them right up so if you do have more you want to fill your jars up these jars are quite large though and they were on top of that jars we're gonna add in the strawberry jam on top you can mix that through it's like to have mine at the top though and sprinkle some shredded coconut and you can pop it in the fridge or the freezer and makes it Alicia's little snack or dessert up next is upper sandwiches no you're not putting apple on bread it was basically just slicing up apple and popping arm and but it in between just a really easy satisfying nice snack I love almond spread as you guys have heard in this video you can use peanut butter though so let's grab your Apple and then you going to do little slices grab two other circles if you've got little scenes in the middle you'll need to chop those ones out get your arm spread or peanut butter and spread it on and there you have an Apple sandwich it looks really simple but trust me try it it's really really up next I don't really know what to call them their little coconut balls and once again look like all of my recipes really really versatile so I've got some of my favorite ingredients maple syrup is what's gonna hold it together and then at the end we have to pop them into the freezer so they do harden into a bowl so I've got my income various like I said they're a real tangy flavor I've got hemp seeds hemp seeds are an amazing source of protein so if you're a vegetarian or a vegan you can definitely start adding those into your diet I've got shredded coconut sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds so I'm going to do 3 tablespoons of my maple syrup in a bowl to start with this obviously makes it really nice and sweet as well eating seeds by themselves like so boring but when they're mixed in like this delish I've got my organic do out vanilla extract I'm still doing like half a tablespoon of that I love vanilla in baking and then I'm going to mix in my hemp seeds probably two tablespoons of hemp seeds big handful of the Inca berries lots of shredded coconut small handful of the sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds also and then just mix it together if you find you need to add more wet ingredients you can could even add a little bit of coconut oil or if you need more dry ingredients thank God for as well so then mix that around together and see where I'm at they will be hard to form actual balls because they're just quite a lot quite a lot of ingredients but once they freeze together then they're awesome now I'm just gonna put onto little blobs onto my tray and then I'm gonna pop those into the freezer thank you so much for watching everyone I really hope you enjoyed this and I'm so glad that you get a video that you can refer to all the time if you're stuck with snacks especially for your little ones and Families or if you're on the go I find all of these super affordable really

what you end up making or what you've enjoyed or what you can't wait to make and make sure you do subscribe as I do upload videos every three days look forward to see you in my next video thanks for watching bye [Music]", "J3m0SUZjGv8": "Oh Ambrose Oh welcome to home brew well in cheap so I must apologize for taking four months to make another video I have been super busy in work and super busy trying to get my company up and started and as well as playing the stock market and generally you know trying to live a life it is very difficult to try and balance everything as it turns out so what I'm gonna be doing because I have been keeping higher kind of tab on the comments thanks to my shiny new phone instead of the potato that would barely send a text message so I'm going to be doing a brew diary this is going to take approximately 30 days that means that we're going to be making a sweet wine so at the end of the 30 days when we put it in the bottle you are able to drink it it's not bad it will get better with age but at the same time sometimes you're just gonna have a quick drink so what I'm gonna be using is perfectly imperfect mixed berries from Tesco's the total cost for two kilos of this mixed fruit which is strawberries or raspberries and blackberries what 7 pound that's not so bad I've got a huge tub of sugar but I'll only be using a kilo so I've got a kilo bag to one side that's gonna boost up the alcohol because you must have a 3% alcohol or less maybe you do that's up to you we're gonna be using fun enough I'm gonna be showing you sterilizing process the making Pro you know everything basically from start to finish in this brew diary so without further ado I suppose we should get stuck so the first step that you were going to need to do in any brewing endeavor its sterilizing it's on the go so sterilizing as you know I do like the simple things in life dish soap bleach can't go wrong with it it's worked for countless amounts and it's gonna keep working for countless amounts of homebrew if you don't want to use bleach you can use the sanitizer easy stuff I misspelled here you can use caching tablets supposedly these are good for sterilizing the times that I've tried it with they don't really do what I want it to do just personally I have had more failure with this then we go to a fashion bleach so it's up to you or you can use that stars' and no wash sanitizer that does the same thing now it's very important that you need to sterilize stuff because we want to give our yeast a fighting chance to help populate everything else and kill it with the alcohol goodness so we don't get mauled or anything like that seven very simply we've got fish stew which is very and you just pour a little bit in like so and then you've got bleach get a bleach so if you read destructions on the side it will tell you about open up an ax it's approximately six bases directly there we go we are working on the idea of work surfaces bins and floors so that is approximately 300 milliliters to 5 litres of water yeah so and it goes to the top this is my other jug here which I'm going to be using to sterilize my airlocks so I went and bought some cheesy airlocks because I was actually gifted a load more of these demijohn bottles so seems rude not to use them so in girls are lovely blog and this is this gonna help sterilize and help everything out before we shall play don't drink it get out the way mmm pretty so the reason that I've put the bleach in first and done this is because sterilizing usually takes the longest to make sure everything is super sterile leave it for about 20 minutes you can leave it longer if you like but 20 minutes it's the same is using milton's sterilizing tablets for baby bottles the solution is active for about 24 hours and then it needs to be changed so here are my lovely airlocks now king air lucky and of course the rubber bung so bleach does destroyed rubbers so well it will still do for a lot a long time so now we basically set this to one side and I will start cleaning this out with my lovely bottle brush which you combine most places just to get it in and get it swish round and that's where the fairy washing up liquid will go nuts but basically the bleach is gonna do the main work which is nice so I've got my pan if you're doing this method of extraction which I am going to be using heat because it is quicker it also sterilize and kills off the yeast and helps get the fruit flavors out now if you don't want to do that you can do exactly the same process but in a big tub and one hand and tablet to your liquid whether chalice it's old which was really know these because I'm very ready to use them and that just kills off any world yeast there's in with our fruit that's frozen because we don't want the yeast or anything else to play havoc with what we're going to add in so I'm gonna dump the fruit yummy one lovely kilo of our imperfectly perfect mix berries yeah well basically it smells pretty good so who doesn't want mixed berry wine and the fact that it was kind of cheap there we go and get the slush Oh smells really good actually and funny enough smells like strawberries raspberries and blackberries all together in sweet chewing gum anyway so ho there we go we're looking in our pan lovely now we're gonna add some boiling water in rows we're gonna add some boiling water in and this is because one we're going to be boiling this just to kill off all the yeast - we want to extract as much juice and flavors from these berries as possible and three because it's also gonna sterilize it so even better for us so I put one point six liters of boil water in the band now the reason I only add in about half the amount ever into this is because when we're going to put it in the demijohn we can top it up with cold water and it cools down quicker which is nice right so we have now got a well it's actually every semi warm because the boiling water counteracted the ice so it's kind of even now but it's just a machine poke right now so on the hub goes and we're going to boil it heat it up because it's gonna destroy the fibers and the structures of the berries that have gone in there so we can take it out you can ferment on the pope yeah yeah you can ferment on the pope if you like but you're not going to get as much alcohol in the finished product mainly because this is gonna take up room in your demijohn so yeah some of the questions as we go that have come across that haven't answered - hmm and I'm gonna do my usual alright it has now come to the boil and of no turning off it smells fantastic so at this point you have got a lot of options that you can add in you could add in for instance Hector lays when this is cooled down for about 20 degrees and what the pet relays will do it will help clear out the pectin - straight down break it down into smaller bits so you don't get pectin haze I'm not worried about texting haze if you are then you add in one teaspoon of this to this when this is cooled down to about 20 degrees or room temperature and that will make sure your wine is lovely and clear but since this is going to be a sweet quick drinking berry wine I'm not going to worry about the pet delays it's not needed just so you know you can make additions to your wine to give it extra body extra flavor for everything one of those the ones that I would recommend if you want to go a little bit more fancy is spamming the two-pound 50 and getting this this is from Wilkinson's or will go and this is great juice concentrate especially designed for wine using wine grapes obviously not the best wine grapes otherwise they would be turned into one I presume so but you at least into fruit wine to give it more body a little bit more sugar and because grapes contain all the nutrients that are needed for yeast to ferment it also adds in extra nutrients lovely fortunately I have been adding because of this berry makes I've got strawberries in here and I have found personally that strawberries in a strawberry wine do not need nutrients the strawberries contain all of the nutrients that the yeast needs and yeah basically adding into these nutrient industro berry wine makes it explode and makes it very volatile it all pukes at the top not what I'm after and it only really does it for the first 24-48 hours while using nutrient there's enough in here so I'm not gonna use that it's up to you if you want to use it but I'm not going to in this particular wine it is simple that's what we're going for so well this is cooling down I've got a division over here which I have just left for the last 25 ish no 30 minutes now because they're funny enough took a few ticks and now I'm gonna sterilize and clean this but finish sterilizing cleaning it let's get it right get ready you know yeah over by my lovely sick lovely and I've got my Debbie John which has been sterilized as you can see the dish soap that I put in has dissolved into the liquid lovely lovely and I've got my bottle brush which is about to go into a bleach and water solution it's already clean so this is going to make sure this is sterilized and basically I'm gonna go around and Jesus out of it being careful not to get bleach in your eyes [Music] it's like since this demijohn was already clean it's pretty much good to go but if you've just finished brewing you're gonna have the crust that's at the bottom and little bits on the side near the top so you're just going through and cleaning it the better you clean it the less likely you were to have an infection of any type and just the one that you want which is the yeast [Music] there we go when you remove the brush I put my hands over it because it will flick bleach and washing up liquid and I have lost many a t-shirt doing that so just bear that in mind so now the outside is complete the inside sorry is completely sterilized you can see it's beautiful and clean and lovely and just a little bit of soap on it the outside doesn't really matter as much though you can give it a bit of a white so since I've got this bleach solution I'll give it around here awesome sterilize this my sink lovely very handy so let's dump this out [Music] and now we've got a lovely pretty clean stuff so we're pretty clean stuff there now we have a pretty clean damage up I'm gonna rinse it out to remove all the bubbles and the traces of soap because I don't want them in there I don't know about you but soap wine doesn't sound that tasty [Music] [Music] [Music] so now this is looking pretty damn good give it a sniff doesn't smell bleachy so it's definitely clean and rinsed now while we wait for our lovely berries to do their thing I've got my top half of my hair look which has also been sterilized in just bleach because it was already clean and prepackaged and now we're gonna put it together needs a little bit of force here's the smidgen just to push it all the way down add a little bit of water stick it on top now what this is gonna do is this is now sterile in the few seconds basically that this was open and allowed to have air in it because it's always got air in it there's a very very slight contamination nowhere near as much as they would have been before so our yeast basically has stands a fighting chance because we're gonna add an ass-ton of it in comparatively well perform everything else and sterilize the inside just to make sure great so back over there oh so it has been 45 minutes and as you can tell it's still real warm but it is able to be touched now so it's not too boiling hot so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a rough filtration because I did have a comment about why do we filter or why do I filter out all the solids first so I'm gonna show you it's gonna be a lot easier so I've got here a sterilized pan and column detectors I got my job which was sterilized and basically I'm just gonna remove the bulk of the solids but as you can see look at that lovely color is a pretty color so on this goes and then we're just gonna filter out some of the bigger bits and splash fit everywhere kiss you know that's fun there we go so basically I just have to let this drain through and then out bottom should be mostly strained large chunks what will be removed which is pretty nice and then basically we're gonna add it into our nice damage on it is a bit warm but yeah it should be fine here we go there's the first batch doesn't matter if it goes back in so here we go that is that rough string Pope hit [Music] mmm yummy so basically I'm just going to go through and roughly filter this just to remove the largest of the chunks [Music] coming in spoon so I can move the smaller bits out the way er me and basically I'm just gonna keep doing this until this is filled up and this is empty I'll see you in a couple so this is what it looks like after you've finished filtering it roughly and putting it in the demijohn now there are lots of bits in here have you not bring this a bit closer you may be able to see hopefully you can see all these little seedy Pippy things in here so I've left these in on purpose instead of filtering them out so you will actually see what's gonna happen over the course of the month as this brews so first things first I'm gonna top this up up to the rim here and the reason I'm doing that is so I get 4.5 liters or one UK gallon obviously American guns are smaller so you'll need to adjust your recipe accordingly it's a little less so you need to basically yeah you need to put listen no you keep the fruit the same and you just adjust the sugar to 750 grams instead of a kilo and that will get you the same alcoholic concentration as we have here if you like it a bit stronger then you can just keep the extra kilo it will make it up to you see about 14 15 percent roughly this is just going off like quick mind maths so this is the big stuff that I've taken out as you can see here it's not that much considering there was two kilos of fruit this is now basically warm mush which I'm going to store and keep in the freezer because I'm gonna be doing another video with it yeh so I'm gonna top this up with some fresh cold water from my lovely jug that's the word so I've got my water which I used from my sterilized jug from the beginning where I sterilize this this was sterile at the time and it has lovely lovely stuff in it and just top it up to the top mark we've got water and there we go so now I have to put this on and leave this to cool down to pitch in temperature it's nearly there it's still a little bit warm right so this is now cooled down to about 2000 degrees roughly it's very slightly warm but it is in acceptable Torrance's for yeast because it's under 30 depending on your youth straight but yeah this is basically it's about 20 to 23 degrees fine for pitching yeast so what I've got here is I've got expressed yeast Express wine yeast compound oh yeah so it is basically it's already got most of the stuff already in it if not you can use normal yeast I would suggest doing a berry wine using a red wine yeast mainly like a Bordeaux it will ferment slightly slower but you will get more of a fruity taste that comes from the yeast the simplicity I've got this because you can buy it for like a pound and it does everything they're like universal so it is a very simple case I've already sterilized my wiped up again it's why it's not red and covered in glue and I've got my clean spoon and I've got my brand new yeast so basically I'm going to take a teaspoon of this approximately and just dump it in a little bit whatever the say and that's basically it hitched so on goes the airlock and in theory in about 20 minutes this is gonna stop activating the yeast and it will start to bud and be lovely so that's all added in let's get a hydrometer which I just have to go and wash no wash it's because I sterilized it and then have them cleaned off the bleach so it's up to the rim here normally you use one of those little testing things but I prefer this so let's see what our potential alcohol could possibly be well we're in the blue and it says 70 which is funny enough came out at 11 percent potential alcohol here so that is one point zero seven zero there we go um it's roughly got according to the hydrometer a hundred and eighty grams of sugar per liter in this because it's five liters so roughly tears like how much sugar is per liter I mean just double check just to make sure [Music] and yet in saying the same twice so go since I haven't had it in any preservatives and just a little bit of yeast that's very nice it's got strawberries and you've got a hint of raspberry and then you got like a mmm very mildly tan any undertone of blackberry not bad for seven pounds for the fruit so on goes lovely airlock see you my brain isn't working now so um goes the airlock and basically I'm gonna come back later on and we're gonna start the video diary so you get to see this from start to finish I see what happens if you ferment on unfiltered pope and hopefully this is going to wear yeah you're gonna love it that's the plan if not a", "1WemtjyZhLQ": "i've made wines from strawberries from blackberries from blueberries and also from raspberries this time around we're going to see if we can make a mixed berry wine containing all four [Music] okay to make our mixed berry wine we are going to need the following ingredients we're going to need anywhere between three to five pounds of mixed berries right now i'm using strawberries blackberries blueberries and raspberries in my blueberry in my mixed berry wine you're going to need some wine yeast i'm using premier roots because it's specifically designed for uh for red wines it's got an avb potential of 16 and a tea bag to give us our tannin uh we need the juice of one lemon to give us our acid blend if you've got acid blend use that instead but this works out just as well up to four cups of sugar straining bags which are optional we're going to need up to one gallon or four liters of water something to do primary fermentation in something to do secondary fermentation in air lockwood stopper star sands to clean it all and get everything sanitized and a hydrometer to let us know what our potential avb is going to be for this wine now i'm using frozen berries for this particular batch of wine if you've got fresh berries so much the better and i'm also using straining bags to help out a bit if you don't have straining bags but you just don't have training bags don't worry about it move on to the next step so let's get the berries into the bags see if i can do this without putting berries all over the place this time all right that actually worked okay uh put that off to the side [Music] [Applause] so yeah almost made maybe without making a little bit of a mess but okay if i were to try and twirl this around instead of just slowly turning the bag so i can tie a knot in it i will definitely have juice flying all over the place and i can't hear that so two one gallon straining bags is all that i needed which is fine don't need that third one it's now time to move on to the next step which is the kitchen now that i'm in the kitchen first thing i want to do is i want to pour off about two cups of our water to make up the difference from that two cups of juice we've got and the remainder goes in the pot all right let's cover that up and let's turn on the heat and let's bring this up to a boil now that our water has come to a good rolling boil turn that down a bit we're gonna go ahead and add our fruit and the purpose of adding our fruit to the boiling water at this point is that since we're not using canned tablets to sterilize the fruit we're going to use boiling water to kill off any stray bacteria or bacteria straight straight yeast or bacteria that might be present in the fruit and while we're at it just go ahead and add our teabag slash tanning substitute to the mix [Music] and at this point we're just going to go ahead and bring the temperature up a bit let it boil for a few minutes at least five minutes to be on the safe safe first side and then we're going to let it come down to room temperature well before it comes down to room temperature while it's still warm we're going to go ahead and add our sugar now if the temperature has come down a little bit i mean yeah it's still hot but that's good because what i want to do now is i want to add at least three cups of sugar i know i'm going to add more but i'll be taking hydrometer readings to make sure that i don't over sweeten it at least not initially but since the water is nice and hot it'll help dissolve that sugar a whole lot quicker so we'll just go ahead and give that a stir a good stir [Music] all right that's good enough and we'll just go ahead now and let it come down to room temperature before proceeding to the next step probably end up mashing these berries a bit more but i wanted this to come down to room temperature because we'll need to add our peptic enzyme now that the mixed berries have come down to a nice good room temperature we're going to go ahead and put those in our fermenter first thing we want to do is transfer our bags of berries so [Music] so [Music] so all right now i did take the opportunity just beforehand to do and take a hydrometer reading and came up with a reading of nine 1.0922 it looks like which is exactly where i want it and i'm now glad that i did not put in that last cup of sugar three cups of sugar was all that i needed to get me to that mark at this point it's time to go ahead and put in our peptic enzyme now if you don't have peptic enzyme don't worry about it it just simply helps break down the uh the cell walls of the food a bit to release uh and cause the pectin that's already in there to help break that down as well helps the wine clear a little bit faster but again if you don't have it it's no big deal believe me about three quarters of a teaspoon will do it we can go ahead and give that a little bit of a stir let me put the cap back on because for the next 12 hours we're going to let the peptic enzyme do its thing so 12 hours from now we'll proceed to the next step more than 12 hours later it's now time to wrap this up a bit we're going to go ahead and juice our lemon which is acting as our acid blend we have acid blend use it if you got it if you don't [Music] limit [Music] let's go ahead and get that in our berry juice mixture straining out any extra little seeds that might be in there now all we have to do is add our yeast now i'm adding a quarter of a teaspoon of red star premium rouge yeast again use whatever you got whatever makes you happy and just go ahead and sprinkle that around somewhat evenly [Music] and although you don't have to because i've got some of this you sitting on these streaming bags i'm just going to give it just a slight little swirl [Music] put your cap back on [Music] nice and tight and let's move this to the counter now you should always label your batches of wine so that you know exactly what it is in case you have multiple batches you'll know when you did it or started it and you know the original gravity reading that you began with which in this case was 1.092 now we're going to let it sit in doing primary fermentation for the next five to seven days for at least the next three days we want to we want to remove the cap give it a good stir uh to get all the beer juices flowing and also to incorporate some additional oxygen into your musk we don't want to do that after that three day period not if you can help it but the yeast will need the additional oxygen just to help them keep going during this initial process after that uh go ahead and keep your cap on as tight as you can and after that five day period five to seven day period you can then go ahead and wrap your wine into your secondary but all things being said and done this wine is now on its way you", "FZF3pCAnjkc": "well good morning friends happy friday so excited to see you guys all here today this was such a requested live and i decided that that we needed to make it happen so we're here and so here's the thing um if you i posted on my instagram stories that we were going to do this live q a and we were going to talk about the anti-inflammatory diet because so many people have been blowing up my dms with lots of questions and there's no better way than to ask them all um than to do something live so as you are are joining the live right now good morning i see you guys there it's so good to see you guys drop me some questions um that you have if you've already dropped them in the message that i left before feel free to drop it again below but i'm here to answer your questions i'm gonna take you know the next 20 minutes and we're going to chat this out and we're going to kind of kick things off by by talking about um we're going to just talk about what i started with so many people want to know you know what did i actually um start with when i first and this really answers your question um try till you fly um what are you not eating um so we're gonna talk about that first so and if you guys can you see the little question box that's on the live chat if you can drop your questions in there that would be really helpful too okay um if you kind of drop them in there so here's what i did most people ask me like what did i start with um so i started with whole30 so many people ask me about what is the what like what was the detox that i followed and so whole30 is actually a program that i did many many years ago probably four years ago and i remember feeling the best that i had ever felt before and so for me i was like as i was kind of going into december and i saw somebody else's question somebody else said like what what were your symptoms so my symptoms were like brain fog where i was like i couldn't get a creative idea uh i just felt like i was sort of in a cloud like you know you know when you're on and you're creative and you're you've got good ideas and and so i just like i couldn't think clearly and so that was kind of number one the second thing that i was really noticing is that i've had a headache all the time like every day i was waking up and i had a headache and then i also was like waking up in the morning and even after eight hours of sleep i was just exhausted i could put my head down and go back to sleep for for three hours right so there just was this constant like never feeling rested never having mental clarity um always being exhausted and then the irritability i just was like irritable i could and i hid it well nobody would have known uh and then i was having some trouble like losing some weight i had about 10 pounds it was kind of hanging around and i couldn't get rid of it no matter kind of what i felt like i was doing right so that's really what prompted me to go down this path and so you know in december i was like you know i'm getting enough sleep at night i'm taking care of my body you know i'm decreasing my stressors in my life like what is the reason why i am not feeling well and so then from there i really said you know what i'm gonna start with kind of a detox because i remember whole30 feeling good not having energy not having the brain fog and so i kind of went down that path first so i bought i had pulled out my whole 30 book and even when you read whole30 it's meant to cut out inflammatory foods so inflammatory foods are things like your your sugars right processed sugar um alcohol um gluten is a big one gluten and wheat and then and dairy and so i knew right that i do had some i have some triggers for example every time i would eat oatmeal i would get exhausted and i'm like man oatmeal does not give me energy i must it must be something i'm sensitive to dairy every time i would eat dairy i would get bloated and gassy and i was like okay i think there's something with dairy and i knew that there was sort of this correlation between alcohol and my anxiety because i would always wake up the next day you know with higher anxiety or i'd be overthinking things so there were all these sort of like things that were beginning to line up that kind of pointed me in the direction you know of knowing that hey i think there's something going on so i started with whole30 and again it talks a lot about inflammatory foods you know right there at the beginning i started that on january 2nd and i thought i'm going to give this like 30 days i'm just i'm going to cut these things out because i really want to see if it makes a difference and then i started that and then i also connected with um a functional pharmacist so josie phillips ross is who i work with you can find her here on instagram um and so i connected with her and she start like got me a cortisol test um and then we also started some supplements because we were pretty sure my cortisol was depleted and i had some leaky gut issues right so just from the symptoms from the intake from the form that i filled out we decided to kind of go down that route and start to kind of heal my gut which if you know anything about inflammation in your gut your gut controls everything you know your gut is your mental clarity it's your anxiety depression it's your you know it's your digestion it's that bloating and so all of these things really began to add up and so what we figured out is is in fact i did have leaky i do a leaky gut i do have um adrenal fatigue like significant adrenal fatigue and through the process of whole30 i realized that every time i drink alcohol i get a headache um i also realize that i don't have a lot of anxiety after cutting those things out i also realized that the more good fats that i eat throughout my day right like having that balance of lean protein and you know all natural fruits and vegetables and really healthy carbohydrates and like good fats right that i feel better and so now that i've i've figured that out and i've added in some supplementation i feel good and yes i did lose 15 pounds and i wasn't necessarily worried about losing too much weight because it wasn't this is not a weight loss plan this is an optimal health plan because in order for us to function long term in life we have to make sure that we are eating enough food to give our bodies strength to give us ourselves like brain fuel and if we deplete our bodies we go into sort of starvation mode and our body doesn't know when it's going to eat next so it just kind of holds on to fat so so here's the thing you know i'm not worried about losing too much weight i'm not you know actually eliminating food groups at all i'm just really choosing foods that give me fuel and so you know a lot of people are saying to me you know well can i still do portion fix can i how do you incorporate this into beachbody and so here's the thing it's i'm still doing my workouts i'm still doing um i'm still following even a portion fixed sort of lifestyle like when you look at portion fix i'm still focused on you know a lean protein and i want to have a good serving of vegetables and i want to have a healthy fat and i want to have a healthy carb in there so i'm still getting proper balanced nutrition which is what portion control teaches you but i'm sort of past the point where i need to lose weight i'm in maintenance mode and i'm eating you know three four meals a day so i'm still living that it's just you know when you look at your container list i'm just not eating all of the foods on the list i'm choosing the anti-inflammatory foods i'm choosing the the more nutrient-dense options so you know a lot of people are like how do i do this and still do do beachbody well it's simple it's just like it's thinking outside of the box it's making the modifications so that it still works for you you know water huge part of my day i'm drinking you know four of these every single day because i know the value of water which is absolutely what we teach you know through all the beachbody programs but also in whole30 as well all right so it's not about you don't have to count calories i think that's the biggest thing we get into is where we don't need to be so rigid we don't need to be in roxanne that's kind of answering your question it's not about calories we're not doing this for weight loss like if you're going to say i want to walk through an anti-inflammatory lifestyle for 30 days you actually need to put aside the the calories and you really have to say to yourself like i need to eat foods that are going to help heal me and then after 30 days and the funny part is you'll naturally lose weight because you're making really good nutrient dense choices and your body is going to settle into that so remember that um what about shakeology somebody else asked about shakeology you know so whole30 right the book says nothing you cannot have any of that stuff you can't use shakeology but i did i kept shakeology in there it is my functional pharmacist said you know shakeology is a great superfood you know i've researched the ingredients it you can have it you know that's kind of my afternoon snack it's kind of my middle of the day you know sort of like you know snack that i have or i'll make it sort of into a pudding and kind of make it like a dessert for myself but i kept that in there so again you would technically say oh melanie you didn't follow whole30 which is fine but i did keep that in there okay all right so here is the other thing let's kind of go through some of these questions do you consider do you continue to use beachbody yes and here's the thing the try tell you fly um is i did keep doing the workouts but the one thing that i really adjusted for myself was the fact that i wasn't going to make myself stick to a program in terms of so for example i did nine week control freak so at one point i was like man i'm exhausted today and so knowing that i've got some adrenal issues i was like i better do a yoga or i better do a stretch today and so i adjusted so it took me longer than nine weeks to complete a program but it was really intentional i was making sure that i was listening to my body and i wasn't beating myself up for how long it took me to complete a program i really looked at this and said i'm being healthy i'm making good choices i feel good about myself all right so that was something that i did so that i hope that that helps you in there as well all right so let's do what supplements did you add in again if you have questions that you are that are coming up drop them in the q a like you can see the q a put them there that's where i'm going to be answering questions from all right so what supplements do i add in i want to do a disclaimer on supplementation every single one of us is different and those of you that also follow my business partner katie you know that she went through a detox as well and the two of us have two very different sort of reasons why we came together to do this and so for me my supplementation was based on my symptoms and my lab results and the blood work and the testing that we did so i was taking supplements for i was taking you know a melatonin at night because i take an anti-anxiety medication that depletes my melatonin um i also taking a vitamin d because my vitamin d was a little bit low i was taking the an adapt cns an adaptogenic herb to help me with my cortisol and stress response right so i was doing that after 30 days i started to take a probiotic um that i was taking i'm kind of looking back through some of my stuff um so all l-theanine is so good for anxiety that is one that josie will tell you it improves cognition it's a relaxant for stressful stimuli so that's one that i was taking so every single month we would meet and we would go over my my how i was feeling the progress i was making and then we would have a new protocol that we would follow um so i'm on my third protocol with like what i take and when i take it so i also take a magnesium supplement you heard me talk a little bit about the chaste berry that i started adding whenever we realized i had some hormonal stuff going on but i really encourage you guys to um get you really want to pick supplements that are quality that's really important quality supplements you don't want to just randomly buy supplements and you want to make sure that you talk get blood work done um have the testing done so that you're taking the right stuff for you so i encourage you to you know check into that all right okay so again if you have questions drop them in the q a so i can answer those all right what four sigmatic prop products do you use so you have been hearing me talk a little bit about four sigmatic which i found on the whole30 website they talk about like approved things that you can have so four sigmatic is great and so i use the the more they have like a coffee it's a think coffee so i'll drink that in the morning that kind of gets me going during the day again those of us with some adrenal issues you really have to be careful with caffeine because too much caffeine can really um it can make you wired and tired it can really have an adverse effect on your adrenals so i do the morning think i really love the matcha so there's like a matcha latte so sometimes i'll have that mid afternoon or you can swap that out for your morning coffee and then at night i do the chill so it's a chill drink and you could actually drink that at night and that will kind of help your body sort of calm down again with not all that caffeine um for the four sigmatic i have a link that you can get 10 off so i'll drop that for you guys after this live if you want to dm me for the four sigmatic link i can send you that as well all right so i do i love those supplements i'm all about sort of biohacking your body i think that's great okay i did the four sigmatic let me talk about this one what do you feel oh hold on what do you oh that one went away uh what do you feel is the number one most important change you have made on this journey so the most important change that i have made on this journey has been there's so many it's really hard to say i would say nutrition so i would say my nutrition probably would be the number one most important thing so if you were starting out right now today do not worry about supplementation do not go buy tons of supplements start with whole30 i would actually encourage you to commit to 30 days of this and then i just kept going i actually haven't i didn't reintroduce um i tried alcohol but that didn't really work and i just kind of have stayed off of everything else so i would say the most important thing would be to actually change your your nutrition most people have an incredibly poor diet and they don't actually realize that their anxiety their depression their chronic headaches their chronic fatigue their brain fog is actually related to the foods that they're eating most people once you change that you're gonna see a significant difference right from the get-go okay all right how does fasting work with whole30 how often do you eat so candy if you're somebody who does intermittent fasting um i mean totally fine you can keep doing it you know you can make your window so you know with whole30 it's really about not snacking so it's like three meals and maybe one snack so if you are gonna if you're an intermittent faster because that's what works for you then you just pick your window to eat your three meals in right so that again you can totally do that most people tend to fast for 12 hours anyways so your last meal of the day shouldn't be before you go to bed you should actually leave about three hours before you go to bed um before you eat anyways so you should be able to kind of get that 12 hours so i hope that helps i'm not a big intermittent faster i'm curious about it but i'm not it's not something that i you know actively do at this time okay um why didn't i do the ultimate reset heather good question so ultimate reset is a beachbody program um it is a 21 day cleanse that you can do but if you look at the ultimate reset um it has gluten or has wheat in there it has soy in there um and neither of those two things were i knew that wheat was a trigger for me i didn't want that and beans beans are inflammatory so for me personally i knew that wasn't going to be the right thing just knowing i probably had some triggers already to those kinds of foods so that's why i did not go that route withhold with um the ultimate reset so i hope that answers that question [Music] um no this is not a time nutrition plan somebody asked me if i was worried about losing too much weight the answer is no i really wasn't worried about losing too much weight and the reason is because i wasn't restricting my my food right so when you think about it i'm not cutting calories i'm eating a meal for breakfast i'm eating a large meal for lunch i'm eating a large meal for dinner i'm eating all of my food groups um your body if you're hungry you just eat a larger meal so i had absolutely no worries about losing too much weight because i wasn't like restricting right i wasn't cutting back my calories i wasn't over exercising as well so i think that's really incredibly important to remember is that this is not necessarily weight loss is a byproduct of choosing healthier foods okay um where do you start as a beginner get this book whole30 a 30 day guide to total health and food freedom you can get this book on amazon i would highly encourage it that's where i got mine um but that will will help you out all right let's see did you delete entirely dairy products yes absolutely 100 they are an inflammatory food um they do not do well with me at all um somebody even asked like am i going to go back and add like sugar dairy gluten alcohol in moderation maybe i might i won't say like never i'm sure i will have ice cream at some point um but i'm just gonna be really intentional about why i'm having it and and why i want to and i'm not really there yet i would like to get through the whole process with josie first by functional you know pharmacist and then once i'm sort of the point where i'm completely considered healed then i might reintroduce something to see how my body responds and if i have brain fog or a headache or bloating then i have a choice i can eat it you know on occasion or i can eliminate it forever so it really is like me kind of asking those questions all right so that is what i'm gonna do all right let's see how does brain fog feel well that's a good question so how does brain fog feel so brain fog think about it this way think about your like underwater and nothing is is clear everything is just sort of hazy you can't make clear thoughts it's like your your your processing is in slow motion um there's just not that mental clarity and so that took me a good week and a half once i started the detox to really begin to feel that but it's like whoa my brain is on i got ideas going i've got energy throughout the day i feel really good so that's kind of what what brain fog feels like whenever you're having it all right okay what were your go-to meals or what are your go-to meals okay so i eat the same thing every day for breakfast matt makes fun of me because he's like really aren't you sick of eating the same thing and i'm not so i eat three eggs um i will slice up a half of an avocado put that on my eggs in the morning i have fresh salsa that i get from costco put a scoop of that on there and then a sweet potato we bake sweet potatoes once a week and then matt will like throw it in the pan and just sort of like fry it basically on both sides and then i mix that all up and then i usually have blueberries or an orange as my fruit that's my breakfast so that is my breakfast with my cup of coffee and then i take my supplements in the morning um go to's for dinner or lunches lunches typically are leftovers from the night before so we had spaghetti squash with ground meat and some all-natural sauce so i had that for dinner but then i ate that for lunch the next day because it heats up well chicken we just grill chicken or put it in the airfryer and we'll make grilled chicken salads that's another staple another go-to so those are some of the things that i would we would eat we do like flank steak we'll have actual steak like we do lots of veggies and and we steam them so really sweet potatoes white potatoes are my go-to um balsamic brussels sprouts we make those ahead of time keep them in the kitchen sweet potato french fries um the roasted root medley is another one that we do so those are kind of my go-to meals again it's whole foods like i'm eating whole foods i'm not eating snacks or processed stuff very often whatsoever and i pack a lot of my stuff like i just take it to me take it with myself on the go and it works really great um okay did you cut coffee completely no i never cut coffee completely because i started to feel better and i was like oh coffee really isn't a culprit for me one cup is good i used to drink these ginormous big cups of coffee and now i just do a regular sized cup of coffee and i always drink my coffee black um and i'll put in there i just i have like my four sigmatic that i'll blend in there with that um if you notice that coffee is making you feel jittery you can cut it out and then you know you might be somebody that can't tolerate coffee so i think it's important for you to kind of try that out as well all right did josie give me a timeline for my journey yes so i did ask her this on monday when we chatted so we did sort of the detox phase then we are we are repairing and then the last phase is really sort of it's like reinforcing i'm like reinforcing my gut i'm reinforcing all of the things that we've worked to repair so it's probably going to be about six months once i'm all said and done and it's been process of elimination i think that's important like it's not an overnight thing i would say the first 60 days were gritty they were i had to be really disciplined i had to be really like i want to change more than i want to stay the same you know because there were times where i was like is this working i'm not sure that i feel better and then it was just like all of a sudden things began to really make a change but i was so diligent about the headaches the water the food that making sure that i was getting enough sleep and i really had to set these these healthy boundaries for myself in order to get to where i wanted to go right um i fully expect it'll take me a good six months before we figure it all out and there still are days where i don't feel a hundred percent um there are sometimes that i eat like a healthy food and i'm like oh that gave me gas or that made me super bloated and i just keep track of those things so at the end of this i really will have a very clear picture of what works for my body and the cool part is and i say this and i've said this for nine years while i mentor people is that you know your body is a science experiment every single one of us is unique we have a unique biology we have a unique you know genetic makeup and what works well for me may not work well for you and vice versa so i think it's incredibly important to remember this is a process um this is a lifestyle change i don't ever like i do not like when people say oh poor you you had to give up alcohol no more no more cocktails and margaritas guys i would so much rather feel good than drink like i would much rather wake up in the morning without a headache i can make a fancy mocktail i can have a great drink in my hand it just doesn't need to have alcohol in it i don't feel like my life is depleted if i can't eat ice cream life isn't about just the foods that you eat life is about the experiences you make and the people you get to experience them with and i would so much rather experience life without anxiety i would so much rather experience life without chronic headaches or irritability and so you know it's not about whoa you have to cut that out forever that must be so bad it's not about that at all it's about oh my god i feel amazing why wouldn't i want to do that so it is about shifting the perspective a little bit too right and really kind of looking at things from a different angle um and that's really you know that's kind of my perspective all right okay so again i am gonna go ahead and and finish this out but i you know hope that this was helpful i hope that this gave you lots of information i hope that this you know really did sort of guide you a little bit more so on your own journey to discovery of what's going on with you and if there are any questions you have you can dm me and i actually am in the process of writing up a mentorship program it's called living your best life mentorship uh so stay tuned for that i'm actually going to do just a private mentorship for people that are interested so i will be dropping the details probably over the weekend on that so you can check that out you are able to apply for that mentorship too if you'd really like to go down this path so all right you guys i hope you have a great friday drink your water start whole30 that's the most perfect place to start um and i will see you guys soon all right okay bye everybody", "AWEvwNj1eYY": "in today's video we're going to see just how much liquid we can get out of ten pounds of fruit gushers [Music] we have a lot of gushers we do we have about 11.6 pounds of gushers he rapidly depleting eleven point five pounds eleven point four pounds of dusters here guys we may have chosen this experiment today simply for the excuse to have 10 no maybe maybe maybe gushers it's like a fruit snack with like I think it's flavored corn syrup in the middle when you squeeze them or bite them the liquid inside bursts out it gushes fantastic and we have a lot of them we want to try a few things now that Kelly has cleared out Walmart we want to do some experiments with these gushers some things that we often do we might try melting them down and probably freezing them and vacuuming them to see if we can actually get them to burst from the inside out but mostly we want to see what happens if we juice them all I don't know if that's quite the right term I want to collect the liquid from 10 pounds of gushers and see how much that else I don't think milk is the right term here's the basic idea we have over 10 pounds of gushers and we want to try several experiments with them including seeing just how much juice is in one pack but I think the first step is actually just we need to open these I want to see what 10 pounds of gushers actually looks like we're just gonna put them in a bowl we've got a bowl here and we're just gonna fill the bowl with gushers and outside of the packaging I just gotta see what it looks like [Music] before we start juicing all of these there are some other experiments I think we should try out some of our standard stuff I for instance have some liquid nitrogen right here I wanna see what happens when you freeze a gusher solid I bet it does I'm gonna throw in one of each color here [Music] [Music] [Music] huh all those become very fragile dropped like two inches and just shattered apart wait it did well yeah I poured him out of the cup and just the fall from four inches off the table just broke into pieces so they they probably broke I'm gonna try to eat this although it's probably cold enough or this gonna freeze to my tongue so it's just like gummy kind of thought the middle is still frozen so it's kind of crunchy crunchy grocers I love them crunches crunch crunch our gesture cruncher crushers you got a torch is everybody surprised at this point yeah and I think I know exactly was gonna happen it's gonna burn sugar gonna melt first I am actually gonna surprise somebody here you do it mmm look it started burning I'm fine [Applause] oh it melted it fell from my grasp very good melted and burned and smells like burning sugar we've got our vacuum chamber set up with some gushers both in a cup and some just on the bottom of the chamber to see if there's any difference like individual ones will burst we'll see if the collective group of them will expand just generally what are they going to do one inside the cup has started leaking it may have already been leaking before I went into the cup many of them are there's a tiny bit of juice boiling right there yeah there's a few spots where it's bubbling a bit so it looks like a couple of them have ruptured but they may have already had holes in them when they went into the machine they have definitely not all ruptured we'd be able to see it more on these five that are on the floor of the vacuum chamber let's let the pressure back in see what that does there's a very very small change the in the cup they just shrunk down like Oh a few millimeters is pretty minor overall on ruptured it was like normal Nate yeah when did we start this like five hours ago we started at 11:00 it's 4:00 p.m. we started actually like juice extracting juice from these maybe not eleven but like hours ago and we did take a break for lunch in the middle of there but still this has been going on for far too long hours thousands of these gushers we've gone through is not a quick process I never want to see another gusher again my life that's probably a lie it's Friday I'll probably have a gusher before Monday [Music] wait are these our last ones I hate you little the fruit thing and it broke the wrong way so 10 pounds of gushers and what do we have we have about can I combine them just combine them at this point this is pure gusher syrup right there all right Nate we have a cup of juice and we have a pile of empty husks which one do you want to consume first neither I just I got a look at this like this is 10 pounds of gushers worth of juice I mean I'm sure there's a maybe a better process than us just squeezing them into cups but we did our best not to be like if we put him in an industrial grape press or something just squish them all like that but there you go like this is this is never as far as I know no one's ever done this before this might be the largest collection of gusher juice ever assembled heavier than I thought it was gonna be well first we should look at bi that cool color feels like there is a couple like there is like five yellow ones I think there is just a few blue ones with a dark blue juice a lot of the blue gushers have like a purple or red juice in them yeah but some were actually dark blue yeah they got some cool swirls going on in our juice so with this being possibly the largest amount of gusher juice ever collected in one spot I feel like it is our duty to try drinking some I'll do it if you don't want to and then I may puke but and I'm not gonna drink a lot of it but since I don't know that anyone's ever had the opportunity to actually like drink before this is so gross you take bubble gum juice it can't be worse than that oh but if it's as bad then I don't want to do that either all right [Music] [Laughter] how're you doing buddy yeah not great your life choices Wow so it's like sour corn syrup kind of yeah like it has a tartness to it it's also like fruit flavored in a very candy like way I'm not gonna do what you did but that consistency is so well gosh no like as soon as it hits your mouth you're just like well I'm not supposed to drink that and then you taste it and it's just overwhelmingly sickeningly sweet and like a little bit of tartness and just too thick not supposed to drink stuff with that consistency oh wow I did I did I did yeah there is the gusher juice from I just probably drank like a hundred gushers worth of juice which if you think about was probably close to 500 calories in your life this is just there you go pure sugar maybe a stick of butter is more calorie dense than this but I don't know also everything in the studio is now sticky when you didn't mop it we might just get the power washer and you actually see can you hear our shoes that's just like well there's wrappers everywhere but also just our feet are sticking to everything like for example if I just touch knees oh he'll go shower in the middle just video over all right so guys we have the gushy juice I have a suspicion that this stuff will not go bad quickly since it's basically pure in their minds I'm just saying we can hold onto this for a bit I tried drinking a little bit and that was gross but if there's anything really interesting you want to see us do with some gutter juice we now have I'd say about three-quarters of a cup of gutter juice let us know what you want to see we go oh I regret this for you guys click that link up there to see our latest video we'll see in the next one talk to you then

corn flour to that coulis probably of adding corn flour to coulis is when it cools down it can become quite soggy so if you get the measurements right with your berries and your fluid and when you pure it then you should be fine okay we're just going to let that cool down for a couple of minutes and then we're gonna blend it I'm gonna use a small kitchen blender you can use a hand blender and

and sizes. From the smallest blueberry to the biggest,\nspikiest pineapple, berries are about as varied and diverse as they come. While you may already know that there are\nmany varieties of berries that make for a healthy and nutritious snack, you might not\nbe fully aware of just how effective these little fruits can be when it comes to maintaining\na healthy lifestyle. In fact, according to the experts at Healthline,\nberries are in fact one of the healthiest foods that you can eat! In fact, we here at Bestie think that it would\nbe in your best interest to make an effort to eat berries every day. So what makes berries so special? Before we go any further, it would be \u201cberry\u201d\nkind of you to subscribe to our channel, and ring the notification bell. That way, you can get helpful tips and information\nthat we have to offer. Now then. we hope we didn\u2019t \u201cberry\u201d the ledge\nwith that little segue. Too many puns? We\u2019re sorry, hopefully, you can forgive\nus and \u201cberry\u201d the hatchet, unless you think that we\u2019ve crossed the line and that\nwas the final straw...berry. Okay, that was the last one, we promise. Now, let\u2019s move on and learn all about the\nmany reasons why you should consider eating berries every day. Low in Calories As you may already know, the average adult\nneeds a certain amount of calories per day in order to properly function. For women, the requirement is about 2000 calories\nper day on average, and for men, the average number is 2500. In order to lose weight, however, it\u2019s actually\nrecommended to consume 500 calories fewer per day; so around 1500 calories for women\nand 2000 for men on average. By maintaining this daily intake of calories,\nyou can expect to lose about 1 pound of excess body weight per week. One of the things that make berries so special\nis that they are relatively low in calories. To give you some examples of what we\u2019re\ntalking about: One cup of blueberries is about 84 calories, one cup of blackberries is about\n62 calories, and a single cup of strawberries can contain as little as 49 calories! With such a low-calorie count, that means\nthat you can eat more berries at once than you can with other foods, while still controlling\nyour daily calorie intake. And as we said before, limiting your daily\ncalories can help you lose weight at a rate of 1 pound per week, which means that after\none full week of eating berries, you can already expect to see progress towards your weight\nloss goals. Hey, one pound might not sound like much,\nbut it\u2019s a step in the right direction! Vitamins and Nutrients In addition to being relatively low in calories,\nmany types of berries contain a wide variety of beneficial vitamins, minerals, and other\nnutrients to help get you through your day. One very important vitamin that all berries\ncontain is Vitamin C, which helps your body\u2019s immune system and prevents diseases such as\nscurvy. Remember when we said that one cup of strawberries\nwould be about 49 calories? Well, in that same cup of strawberries, you\ncan expect to find a whopping total of 150 percent of your recommended daily intake of\nVitamin C! Additionally, berries provide an excellent\nsource of Manganese, which can prove the health of your brain, bones and nervous system, and\nVitamin K, which assists the body with blood clotting as well as bone metabolism. The fact that berries are so rich in nutrients\nyet so low in calories means that you can use them to ensure that you\u2019re getting all\nthe nutritional benefits you need in a day without accidentally overeating. After about a week of snacking on berries,\nyou\u2019ll not only be on the road to weight loss, but you\u2019ll probably be feeling healthier,\ntoo! Antioxidants Most types of berries come fully loaded, not\njust with a wealth of vitamins and minerals, but also with plenty of antioxidants as well. Berries contain a massive amount of antioxidants\nsuch as anthocyanins, ellagic acid and resveratrol; all of these antioxidants are helpful to your\nbody, as they can prevent cell damage by keeping the free radicals within your body at reasonable\nlevels. Among the many varieties of berries, a study\nhas shown that blueberries, blackberries and raspberries have some of the highest concentrations\nof antioxidants out of all commonly eaten fruits. Just another one of the many health benefits\nthat berries have to offer. In addition to preventing cell damage, the\nantioxidants found in berries can also help in preventing inflammation within the body. While inflammation is your body\u2019s natural\nway of fighting off injuries and infection, modern diets and lifestyles can often lead\nto excessive and chronic inflammation, which in turn can lead to unwanted conditions such\nas diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Thankfully, studies have shown that the antioxidants\nthat berries contain may be able to help lower and prevent the chances of chronic inflammation. In one of these studies, a group of people\nconsumed a strawberry drink along with a meal that was high in fat and carbs, and the result\nwas that the inflammatory markers in their body were much lower than those of a group\nthat didn\u2019t add the strawberries to their meal. What this means is that strawberries, as well\nas other types of berries, may be an ideal snack for those hoping to reduce the risk\nof heart disease, as well as other diseases and conditions. It is also believed that the antioxidants\nin berries can help to reduce the risk of certain types of cancer; specifically, cancer\nof the esophagus, mouth, breast and colon are all believed to present a reduced risk\nin individuals who consume berries every day. The anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and resveratrol\nfound in berries are all believed to reduce markers that are associated with the formation\nand growth of cancerous tumours in both people as well as animals. High in Fiber Like many plant-based foods, berries of all\nkinds are also an excellent source of fibre, which aids in your body\u2019s digestion and\nmay even help lessen the risk of certain diseases. More specifically, berries provide a very\ngood source of what\u2019s known as \u201csoluble fibre\u201d. Soluble fibre is characterized by the fact\nthat it dissolves in water, and studies have shown that the consumption of foods containing\nsoluble fibre can slow down the movement of food through your digestive system. This means that eating foods that contain\nsoluble fibres can reduce feelings of hunger and leave you feeling full for longer amounts\nof time, which in turn makes you less likely to overeat or snack on foods that contain\nempty calories. This, in addition to their already low-calorie\ncount, makes berries even more ideal for weight loss and weight management, since a healthy\nserving of berries will leave you feeling more full and satisfied than an equally-sized\nserving of other foods that don\u2019t contain soluble fibre. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the fact that berries\nare so high in fibre means that they are also low in carbs. Studies have shown that diets that focus on\nreducing carbs can be up to 2-3 times more effective at weight loss and management than\ndiets that focus on reducing fat. So that means that if you decide to put down\nthe chips and start making berries your daily snack instead, you can expect to see fast\nresults! Additionally, it is believed that the soluble\nfibre found in fruits and berries may also help your body by reducing \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol\nand keeping your heart healthy. Strawberries, for example, are an excellent\nsource of pectin, a type of soluble fibre that can reduce cholesterol by up to 10 percent! In addition, berries such as strawberries\nand black raspberries have also been shown to help lower and reduce cholesterol in individuals\nstruggling with obesity and metabolic syndrome. It is believed that berries may also help\nprevent heart disease by preventing LDL, or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, from becoming oxidized\nor damaged. Berries May Improve Blood Sugar Studies have indicated that berries may also\nbe useful when it comes to improving your body\u2019s blood sugar levels, as well as improving\nyour body\u2019s insulin sensitivity and insulin response. In one of these studies, a group of healthy\nwomen consumed 5 ounces of strawberries or mixed berries, or about 150 grams, along with\nbread every day. The resulting data found that the inclusion\nof berries helps reduce insulin levels by as much as 26 percent compared to the bread\nalone. In another study, obese individuals who were\nstruggling with insulin resistance were encouraged to consume a blueberry smoothie twice per\nday. As a result, the individuals who consumed\nthe smoothies experienced greater improvements to their overall insulin sensitivity than\nthose who did not. This means that people who suffer from insulin\nresistance can turn to berries as an option to improve their insulin sensitivity and potentially\nlessen the negative effects of their condition. Thanks, berries! So the next time you decide to search your\nkitchen for something to snack on, you may want to consider putting away the chips and\ncookies, and instead reach for a cup of fresh berries. Not only will the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants\nhelp to keep your body healthy and protected against disease, but they will also leave\nyou feeling full and satisfied with fewer calories, allowing you to start seeing weight\nloss results in as little as one week. While they might come in all sorts of shapes\nand sizes, one thing is clear: with berries, you can\u2019t go wrong. Did you find this video helpful or informative? Do you know any other berry-related facts\nwe may have missed or glossed over? Let us know in the comment section below.", "gG9BXBb-tew": "(gentle music) - Oh, I got rid of my spoon. Here, come here, come here. (screaming) Did you have a few seeds? (gentle music) Hey health nuts. Welcome back to my channel. My name's Nikole. If you're new here, hello,\nwelcome to the channel. If you are new here, you may not know that I\nlove me a good smoothie, mostly green smoothies. That's Cashew in the\nbackground with a squeaky toy. Cashew, Cashew, we're filming. We're filming. And you guys have actually titled me, The Green Smoothie Queen,\nbecause I love them that much. In today's video, I\nthought I would talk about some common mistakes\nthat people are making when they make a smoothie at home. By the way, we actually have a full, free, downloadable guide to how to make the perfect green smoothie, which I'll have a link down below. You guys can grab that. It's free, you just enter an email, and you'll get it right to your inbox. That is your resource to\nmake the perfect smoothie, but I'm gonna share 10\ncommon mistakes that people are making or that I\nthink people are making when blending up a smoothie. So let's hop right in. Number one, the first\ncommon smoothie mistake, in my opinion, by the way, these\nare all just in my opinion. I'm not a professional or\na doctor or a nutritionist. These are just things that\nI've learned over the years of making lots of smoothies. Just take what you want,\nleave what you don't want. But anyways, the first\ntip is that I think people are adding in too much\nboxed nut or seed milk or just plant-based milks or regular milk. I prefer to do more of\na half and half style with my smoothies. So I'll do half nut milk or oat milk, and then I'll do the rest filtered water. You could also do just filtered water. I think it's fine to add\nwater into your smoothies, especially if you're adding\nfruits like banana or mango or you're adding in a protein powder. That's gonna give it that\nmilky texture and taste that you want without\nadding so much boxed, plant-based milk. My next tip it so not\noverdo it with the fruit. I feel like people are adding in way too much fruit into their smoothie. It's making it way too sweet and sugary and honestly, it's not necessary. You can cut it down,\nyou can use vegetables. It doesn't all have to be sweet fruits. You can use things like celery, cucumber, you can, of course, add in some greens. Ginger, you can just add\nin more ice if you want it to be that texture and still cold, but you don't wanna add\ntoo much frozen fruit. I also use steamed and frozen\ncauliflower and zucchini. That is my go-to. I'm not about a super sweet smoothie. Then it's more like a desert\nthan a breakfast to me. So switch it up. Try to add in more of those vegetables that you may think are more\nsavory, but aren't gonna add, they're gonna add nutrients\nand texture to your smoothie without overdoing it with the sugar. I actually have some\nawesome veggie smoothies that I will link down\nbelow if you guys want to check them out. There are some unexpected vegetables that you may not think of using. But zucchini and cauliflower\nare definitely my go-to's. The next common mistake with\nsmoothies that I personally find is people are not adding\nin healthy fats and fiber. These are two things that\nare actually gonna make your smoothie filling and\nsatiating when you drink it. When people are like,\noh I have a smoothie, and I'm hungry two seconds later, it's because you're not adding\nsubstance to your smoothie. Yes, protein is important, but fiber and healthy fat\nis what's gonna help keep you full and also, just\nhelp move things along. My go-to's are flax\nand chia seed for fiber and for healthy fats, I love avocado. You can put in some flax oil in there. You, even like chia seeds and flax, they have healthy fats in them, too, so they're kind of like a duo combo. Even just adding those\nin are gonna be amazing. Nut and seed butters are awesome. Just think about healthy fats and fiber, add those into your smoothie and they will keep you full longer. My next common mistake\nwhen it comes to smoothies is adding in liquid sweeteners. There is no need, if you're\nusing nice, ripe fruit, which I'll talk about in my next tip, you don't need extra sweeteners. You don't need honey, maple syrup. You don't need sweetened\nyogurt, sweetened almond milk. Even juice, I don't think\nyou need to add juice. Sometimes, if I'm craving a sweeter treat for a smoothie, I'll add\nin a little bit of fresh, squeezed orange juice,\nnot boxed orange juice. I'll add that in. But for the most part, I'm not\nadding any liquid sweetener. Fruit is sweet enough, and I don't feel like\nyou need to add any more. You may see on my channel, I may time to time add a little bit of maple syrup or something if I'm tryin' to make it more of a desert smoothie, but we're talking about healthy\nbreakfast smoothies here and I don't think you\nneed liquid sweeteners. Next common mistake is\nadding a protein powder that is full of sugar. You do not need it. Look for ones that are low in\nsugar, low on the GI index, and are either sweetened with a little bit of coconut sugar or Stevia\nor Monk Fruit is another awesome sweetener that I'm\nreally liking right now. This is just gonna help it still give your smoothie sweetness but without spiking your blood sugar. So just look at the ingredients\nin your protein powders and make sure you know\nwhat's in there because they can be chock full with a lot of different processed ingredients. So know your ingredients, know the brand, trust the quality of the ingredients that they're sourcing it from\nand just do your research. Protein powder is expensive so make sure you're buying a good one. My next smoothie mistake\nI think people are making is not adding in real,\nfresh, leafy greens. I know that there's all these\nawesome green super power powders, that was a tongue twister, I know that there's all\nthese awesome green powders out there that are great\nfor if you're traveling or if you just ran out of greens that day. But guess what, just fresh, raw, beautiful leafy greens are amazing to put into your smoothies. I always have either\nspinach or kale or romaine or a spring mix or something 'cause you wanna rotate your greens. I will always have something in the fridge to add into my smoothies. I personally like, I feel like\nI only make green smoothies. I have non-green smoothie recipes on my channel and on the blog, but I personally think\nyou should add greens to every smoothie if possible. Yeah, so try to get\nthose fresh leafy ones. Obviously in a pinch,\nyou could use frozen, if you have ones that are about to go bad. But yeah, the powders, there\nis a place and time for them, but I don't think they should completely replace the real, raw stuff. The next mistake is not having a variety with your smoothie ingredients. Same thing, like I was just talking about putting greens into your smoothie. Even myself, I can get into a rut of only using baby spinach because\nit's just easy to buy and throw in, but you really\nwanna rotate your ingredients, rotate your greens, and have\na variety of ingredients when it comes to making your smoothie. Some weeks, I'll do\nchia seeds for my fiber and healthy fats. Other weeks, I'll do flax. Sometimes I may add a\nhandful of dried coconut. Then for my greens, I'll\nalternate between kale, spinach, romaine. With my fruits, I'll\nalternate between berries, mango and banana. You don't always wanna\nbe doing the same thing. I definitely have my go-to\ningredients that I'm even known for just repeating, putting\nthem in my morning smoothie, 'cause they're just so good. But I really do try to\nswap out tumeric for ginger or swap out zucchini for\ncauliflower as my base. Just have fun with it. You can use my smoothie guide. There's lots of different ingredients for different sections of\nyour smoothie when it comes to fruit, vegetables, milks\nand fats and protein and fiber. It's all there so you can\nkind of rotate each week and try different ingredients\nand different super foods and just have fun with it, spice it up. You're gonna get bored if you're drinking the same thing every day. This next tip is so important. You guys ask me all the time how I get a super smooth smoothie and\nreally, it's all in the blender. Having a good blender is\nso important when it comes to making a good smoothie in my opinion. Honestly, my mom, I won't\nsay what blender it is, my mom has a blender,\nit's not my favorite, and every time I make a smoothie there, I feel like I'm a\nsmoothie snob at her house 'cause it is so pulpy and I\ncan just feel the texture still from all the greens. I get kale in my teeth\nand I don't want that when I'm drinking a smoothie\nand it's just too fibrous. There's too much texture and I personally love a smooth smoothie and\nhonestly, it's in the blender, and I will actually link\na higher end blender as well as a affordable blender 'cause I know not everyone can just go out and buy a $600 blender. I get it. I waited years before investing in one and even still, I was like, okay, should I make the investment. Honestly, it was the best thing ever, but there are definitely options, depending on what your budget is. I will link my two favorite down below for you guys to check out. Smoothie matters; a lot\nof people ask me that. Yes, get yourself a good\nsmoothie if you know, if you know you're gonna be\nmaking a smoothie every day or salad dressings or soups or ice cream. You can make so many things\nin a good, high-speed blender, so check the links down below, get yourself a good smoothie\nmaker, blender, yeah. That's what they're called. The next common mistake is\nnot using ripened fruits. If you want your smoothie to be delicious and sweet and easy to digest, you wanna make sure you're\nusing ripened fruit. So at all times, yeah,\nI have one right there, I will have a bundle of bananas\njust ripening on the counter and I will just have them in rotation. One's ripening, then once they're ripe, I will just peel and chop\nthem up and throw them into the freezer and then\nthat way, they're ready to go. I'm never out of frozen\nbanana and you just wanna make sure you're\nusing nice, ripe fruit. So a lot of times when\nyou're buying frozen fruit, they are freezing them\nwhen they're nice and ripe, so that's the nice thing\nabout getting frozen fruit, you don't have to worry about that. But with banana, you can't\nreally buy frozen banana in Canada, at least. It's really hard to find. So I just do it myself and it's like the most cost effective. Bananas are so cheap\nand they're a great base for your smoothie. I will never eat an unripened banana. I find it's a little, it's too starchy, it upsets my stomach and it's just not sweet and not delicious. Let your fruits ripen if\nyou're gonna freeze them or just buy frozen fruit\nthat's already ripe. Last but not least, the\nfinal mistake is people are not adding in protein. I get it, not everyone\nwants to add protein powder into their smoothies and I don't always add protein powder into my smoothies. I feel like I kind of go into phases where I want protein powder, depending on if I'm going to the gym a lot or if I'm just feeling extra hungry. But it does not have\nto be a protein powder. There are other foods. Technically, protein is in so many foods, so many fruits and\nvegetables, but obviously you want something\nthat's higher in protein if you're gonna add it as a\nsupplement to your smoothie, so things like hemp\nseeds are a great source of plant-based protein. Obviously protein powder is a great one. Even spirulina powder, it's\none of my favorite super foods. I'll have to double check this, but I believe spirulina powder has the highest amount\nof protein in plants. It may look like a small\nthing you're adding to your smoothies and it\nmakes it really green and fun, but it also adds a lot\nof nutrients and protein in there as well. If you're gonna buy spirilina powder, make sure it's one from Hawaii. I personally find it's the best quality, best tasking; it doesn't have this nasty, fishy smell and taste. I throw it in my smoothie,\nI don't even notice it. Some other protein sources\nwould be like nuts and seeds. You can throw in a small handful of some raw almonds or Brazil nuts. They're also gonna add\nin some healthy fats. I also love to do collagen powder. That's another go-to. If I don't have protein powder on hand or if I just want my\nhair and skin and nails to look really awesome and strong, I'll add in a scoop or two\nof some grass-fed collagen. I'll link my favorite down below. And it also does work. I need a hair cut so bad. I'm getting one on Sunday. Yeah, make sure you're getting\nprotein in your smoothie in some way, shape or form, whether it's in whole food\nor it's in a powder form. Make sure the quality is good and that's what's gonna keep you full, protein, healthy fats, fiber. You wanna get all of the food groups when it comes to your smoothies so that you feel refreshed, energized, and full until lunch time. There you have it. Those are my 10 common smoothie mistakes I feel like people are making when blending up their breakfast.

(gentle music)", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "nZDuDBI3sqY": "mixed berry pie with frozen berries is easy and delicious just like with all of my other berry pie recipes i'm starting off with 24 ounces or three cups or 680 grams of frozen berries that are now completely thawed i'm using a mix of frozen berries this is what i'm using it has strawberries blackberries blueberries and raspberries and since the strawberries are listed first it has more strawberries than blackberries more blackberries and blueberries etc whichever brand you use or if you make your own mixed berry medley the exact ratio will differ but as you can see even though it has more strawberries than anything else i honestly think it's a pretty good distribution of different berries i tasted it and it tastes still low on the tart side so i'm going to adjust my sugar accordingly i am using 250 grams of sugar which as i measure is one cup plus two tablespoons plus two teaspoons i know that's a very precise amount of sugar but i think that that is exactly what i need for this to suit my tastes again there's some personal preference if you have more strawberries than anything else less more blackberries or more raspberries you'll need more but like i said for my variety of mixed berries i'm gonna go with this i'm also using just like in the other recipes 80 grams or eight tablespoons of corn starch i have two tablespoons or 30 grams of sugar off to the side for sprinkling on top and one tablespoon of lemon juice like i said it's already pretty tart from the blackberries and raspberries so i don't think it needs a lot of acidity from lemon juice my nine inch pie crust over there homemade par baked at 350 for five minutes now all i'm going to do is add the sugar the cornstarch the lemon juice oh and the sugar has an eighth of a teaspoon of salt forgot to mention that and now i'm just going to stir the berry filling to dissolve the sugar and the corn starch i'm done mixing the berry filling everything is dissolved so i'm just going to pour the berries into my parbake pie crust once i evenly distribute everything it will be time to put on the top crust my berries are now in my pie i did move them around a bit because i felt like there were a lot of blueberries over there for some reason now it's time for the top crust once again homemade but you could do store bought totally fine as always i roll out my pie crust between two pieces of wax paper so all i have to do is peel back one piece and take it like this flip it over and then position it on top of the pie now i'm going to try to maneuver it exactly where i want it now i'm going to peel off the top crust and this wasn't quite as centered as it has been in the past but that's okay and really you want to position it while it's still attached to the wax paper i actually made this yesterday so it's a little bit drier but it'll be fine so now i'm going to take my knife around the edge to clean it up and then a place like here where i notice i didn't do quite as good of a job as i normally do i'll just patch it up i finished crimping the sides after i cut off the excess pie dough i just took my fingers and went like that to seal the edges i did have to patch it up a bit because it is a bit dry but i think it'll be fine now it's time to make the vents i took a ruler found what looks like to be the center almost the center and now i am going to cut slits this is so that as the berries cook and they produce steam the steam does not cause the dough to form a dome of course you do not have to go through all this kilumbo as the argentines would say are all this mess to make nice slits like this or if you want to you could make a design possibilities are endless now this mixed berry pie will go into a preheated oven at 350 for i'm guessing 50 minutes but i will let you know oh before it goes in i'm gonna sprinkle two tablespoons of sugar on top and now my mixed berry pie with frozen berries is ready for the oven just like always i'm going to put on my pizza pan when it goes into the oven just that in case it boils over it's not going to boil onto the floor of the oven because that is a lot of key lumbo to clean up my pie wasn't at 350 degrees fahrenheit for 55 minutes this mixed berry pie with frozen berries was both beautiful and delicious after cutting out the first slice i saw just how beautiful the mixed berry pie filling was the strawberries and raspberries mostly broke down while the blueberries and blackberries remained whole resulting in bits of purple suspended in red jelly just like with all of my other fruit pies the filling wasn't runny at all so it sliced perfectly this mixed berry pie with frozen berries looked magazine picture perfect so i couldn't wait to dig in after tasting the pie i concluded that this mixed berry pie was good really good but it wasn't great just like with my raspberry pie that i uploaded a few weeks ago this was good but like i said it wasn't spectacular however one thing that i did notice with this mixed berry pie was that bites in which there were bits of purple on my fork i seemed to enjoy more than bites when there were no bits of purple on my fork my guess is that my palate really liked the blueberries and blackberries so since they didn't break down as much as the red fruits especially the raspberries i didn't like all parts of the pie equally if you recall i really liked the strawberry pie and i really liked the blueberry pie and last summer i really like the blackberry pie so honestly i think the issue with this pie was the raspberries which doesn't surprise me since like i already said my raspberry pie was good but not incredible however i still can't put my finger on exactly why i don't like raspberries and pies one mixed berry pie that i want to try maybe next summer is a pie that i actually made a few years ago i used one bag of frozen mixed berries and one bag of frozen dark sweet cherries i remember thinking that it was really good so maybe raspberries are good in pies just in limited quantities as an accent in the background however in all honesty i'm kind of a picky eater so i'm sure that almost everyone would be very pleased with this mixed berry pie using frozen berries if you buy large bags of frozen mixed berries and you're tired of smoothies or adding them to yogurt and you want to see if you can make a pie out of them i definitely think you should give this one a try like i said i'm just very overly critical of my work so maybe that's part of it if you cook or if you're an artist or whatever type of craft you have you're your own toughest critic if you're looking for a pie that will celebrate the flavors and colors of summer this mixed berry pie with frozen berries is for you so let me know if you give this recipe a try as always thanks for watching see you next time bye", "DveHXFyCGwA": "a couple is a super easy dessert to make and you can make it with almost any fruit that's in season today we're gonna make a berry cobbler so in my bowl I have a mixture of berries raspberries blueberries blackberries the one thing you should do though is taste one to make sure that it's sweet enough that will determine how much sugar you need to use hmm delicious now we're gonna toss these berries with some ingredients one of them is cornstarch that's gonna grab all those juices that come out of the berries and make a delicious sauce we're gonna add to that some cinnamon that's gonna give us a depth of flavor we're gonna add sugar and we're gonna add a pinch of salt I'm gonna whisk this together what this will do is the sugar will break up any lumps that are in the cornstarch so we won't have lumps the corn starts in our berries so toss all your berries with this mixture all over our berries they might break down a little bit that's okay we're gonna add a little bit of lemon juice for a brighter note let all of this sit together and macerate so that all those flavors come out the juices will start to seep out the cornstarch will start to grab onto it and when we heat everything up together in the oven it's gonna have a beautiful sauce mixture you can make your biscuit batter topping by hand but if you have a mixer it's super handy to use that so we're going to add some flour some sugar a little bit of salt a little bit of baking powder and then we're gonna cut in our butter so to do that I'm using a paddle attachment on a stand mixer [Music] and we're gonna start to stir this and tell the storms a coarse crumb now we don't want the butter all mixed in with the flour but we should see flakes of butter almost thin ribbons of butter coated with flour at that time we're gonna add some milk mix that until it just comes together it will still be lumpy that's what we want now we've got our batter mixture we've got our berry mixture you just need a nice ceramic or metal cake pan dump all of your berries into the pan make sure you get any of the juices that are left behind in the bowls then we're gonna spread that out a little bit and we're gonna doll up these big pieces of this batter right on top the last step completely optional would be to sprinkle a little turbinado sugar on top of the biscuit batter at the end this is just a coarse golden brown sugar it adds a little texture now we're gonna place this into a preheated 375 degree oven we're about 35 to 40 minutes until the top is beautifully golden and the berries are bubbling up in between after about 35 to 40 minutes we're gonna take that cobbler out of the oven and take a look at it beautiful golden top biscuit crust we're gonna spoon into this we're gonna serve it up with a little bit of ice cream it's gonna make everybody happy you", "y8VWfqgcHMI": "now I think everyone's gonna agree with this when you buy a pack of fruit guns sugary fruity candies you always eat the red and black ones first let's face it they are the best yeah then you can get the leftover ones Jamie because it isn't any different here go mate doctress ah which is why we're just gonna make the very ones today because why bother with the rest pick your favorite fruit we've gone for a forest fruit selection play we're frozen we've let them defrost and now we're gonna cook them up in a pan with sugar and a dash therefore we're now combined the red and the black ones together to make the ultimate damn sweet winner and one thing to remember for all of these steps is you don't need your hands in your pocket at all times casual casual cooking at this point let them bubble away and tell the various of softened then either blitz off the food processor to make yourself a puree or just force them to a soup just push the berries through a sieve on the back of a spoon because they're nice and soft should be a problem just two guys making fufassel no can you hol get any more just ridiculous don't forget to scrape the bottom because that's where all the little gone through but it's still just clinging on once you've got yourself a fruit purees on to the next stage what's enough stuffing we've got caster sugar liquid glucose citric acid and pectin yeah really is for me what they again we you know what sugar is sugar liquid glucose sugar citric acid lemon yeah and pectin the hetro polysaccharide yeah kind of naturally thing you get out of fruit stabilizers jams it stuff all available in a supermarket they go into the pan and whisk it up nailed it at this point to put your sugar smomid set into the pan and heat the whole mixture up to 105 degrees Celsius some people would argue 116 for pectin when I find it but they've run the game through 105 is fine gives you a nice gummy astral yep when making sweets pellets and creative juices go crazy and the size to make them into squares we've had this argument before squares tessellate better week about testily no we're about fun tasty goodness you don't waste any of this stuff and also important thing though is to double line at the cling film anything that's heat proof other shapes are available like well Steve you think it'd be invented you could cut them into triangles you can cut me show you one but there's no point ahead at this point whip out your sugars monitor and pour it into your mold don't be tempted sit your finger in it because it will be mega mega hot instead let it set up in the fridge or a room temperature for several hours and then it's solid how long several hours and here's one I made earlier from pure rose breeze all we have to do is turn it out with a scattering of sugar cut them up and guess them with more sugar what if it don't like sugar don't think this was for you these are intensely fruity and sweet so much better when you make them self that actually tastes like fruit it's it's worth it's pretty much all it is fruit and sugar and it really it's really intense jammy gummy past few things if you don't believe is health food - they taste you have to make yourself the recipe as ever is linked down below or if you don't like red and black ones make green ones or yellow ones or pink ones or no one likes the green they don't do they ah", "tJjVC7Y_PJE": "hi guys we're in the kitchen again we're gonna be making a mix berry crisp today this should be really good we made an apple crisp here not long ago and it came out good so I'm gonna try a mixed berry crisp to see what we got going there so follow along hope it comes out good [Music] [Music] all right guy I'll show you some of the ingredients we've got a pack of this frozen very mentally it has strawberries blackberries blueberries in red raspberries in it so that's gonna be our berry mix we got some brown sugar some flour some regular white sugar we've got some canola spray we've got some oats cinnamon got some vanilla a little bit of lime juice and some almond this is almond extract so this is our greenness we also I forgot to get out but we got a stick of butter let me get ourselves a stick of butter out now you want this some butter to be still cold because what we're gonna do to make our stuff we'll kind of chop this up and put this entire our crisp mixture so we're gonna start out here let me get out of here of the scissors here and open up this mixed berry now we're gonna look at this over see how much we have in here I don't feel it enough we have some blueberries will add foot it's definitely it's still frozen so we're gonna have to chop that up just a little bit here let's get a knife here and see if we can chop some of this up here I set it out but not long ago sorry about the banging of the knife this isn't gonna be enough so let's go ahead and get out our we've got some blueberries Oh [Applause] mixed with a blueberry add-on so we're gonna add blueberries to our mixture here and again they're frozen so we're gonna have to chop them up a little bit all right guys we've gotten our berries defrosted but I put them in the microwave so what we're gonna do is add sugar sweet knees up here I'm gonna say I probably put in and say maybe like a 1/2 a cup of sugar and I mix that in here looks like it's about right you know how you can kind of tell when you see the sugar incorporated and your berries and stuff here now we also are gonna add some vanilla extract this is actually I'm sorry that's almond extract so we put a nice pop of that I don't major guys so and a little bit of vanilla extract and something else I done here is I've got this lime juice let's shake it up a little bit and so we're going to put a little bit of lime juice I think I want a little more sugar in your song to throw just a little bit of brown sugar in the bottom here too with this yeah I kind of do things by sight there you know I look at go ahead at means a little more one thing I don't like to do is skimp on ingredients that should be enough here all right doesn't make a nice thing now I used the pot I'm gonna bake it in but I did forget to do and you should do this is spray the pan with cooking spray I didn't do it I think we'll be fine so I'm gonna mix this all together so we have a nice sweet berry mixture in the bottom me personally I think a lot of fruit sour and so I do light add a little extra sugar to it you can adjust that to however you like it it's just happened to be the way I do it but so these ingredients we got our berries prepared here they're all mixed up with all the ingredients in it and kind of show you what they look like there there you go that's the berries are all all set now next thing we got to do is make our crumb topping now I'm thinking about ending it I'm gonna turn the oven on to 350 degrees so get it heated up here now we're gonna use our next pan here we've got we're gonna put brown sugar and oat so let's get our oats in here like a nice heavy crumb topping I'm gonna say I put probably I'm gonna even go a little more not quite two cups I'm gonna finish this up there's probably two cups probably had two cups of crumby it just adds more to it I like that crumb topping on it okay so the first ingredient we added about two cups of the oats that's um this is light brown sugar you could use a dark brown sugar so we're gonna put our brown sugar in here I'm adding pretty good little bunch here I'm gonna say how about I'm gonna guess about a cup of brown sugar now we're gonna put a little some flour in it and I'm not measuring but we're just gonna put a nice little little dusting of flour there just kind of hold things together it's probably getting on that I say probably put in here a good half of three quarters of a cup and then cinnamon now I didn't put any on top of the mixture berry mixture but at this point I think I will just sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon over the top of the berries and then we're going to put in here nice little amount I'm gonna say a good tablespoon tablespoon and a half of cinnamon had a little this almond flavor to it just a little bit they give it a little bit of presume and a little more of our lime just a little bit all right what are we mixing we got our butter here now now what I do with this butter I it's still hard you want your butter hard and what we're gonna do is use a pastry sink here there it is oh you guys have one of these it's like a pastry dough hook or dough blade so this is how we're gonna mix this all up now this will take a bit we got a crunch this butter up in there [Music] okay the next thing we're do we've got our crumb mix all done up here we're gonna just spread it on top of our berries here just kind of move it around I'll take a knife and see we have a nice layer on top of here just spread it evenly all right there we go there's our Apple our Apple I mixed very crumb crisps all done up with the crumbs on top of it you're gonna open up and put it in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes and you'll all check it out see how it goes in but we'll set our timer here for 40 minutes and then we'll come back and we'll see how it's coming out hi guys it's been about 40 minutes I just checked it it looks pretty done let's shut the oven off here it's a how the berry mixture kind of bubbles up along the side here Wow wow this looks really good yeah bring that over and see if you can show it a little bit to you looks pretty good I'm gonna set it out here a minute and let it cool down before we dive into it mixed berry crisp I think this is gonna be a real winner you know what we're gonna taste it up here gonna let it set just a little bit let it cool down just a bit and then we'll give it a taste all right guys we're gonna give this a try here and take a nice little corner here peace out it's really good when it's warm so there it is and I get Pierre a little closer and show you there's the mixed berry crisp and this stuff it's gonna be good let's do a taste test here and just just see what it tastes like it's still pretty warm oh man it's

doing that it's supposed to develop the flavors you know by adding air like wine hi guys today I have a special kind of video I like got my cards today I'm going to be working on cutting my car [Music] so welcome to party me in cakes um I'll of course I mean excessive tights I love bad IDs so mine for auditing carbs pasta potatoes bread sandwich rolls chips desserts sweets and candies but Dios rice the rice and more rice I'm liking white rice Mexican rice where we get nice fried rice Portuguese burgers race but every meal of the day because it is a pleasure I am on the hunt to be healthier and less I my crepe intake so cut my carbs um if a my probably also being probably carbs with my knee meals like breakfast lunch in dinner um I have had to find Lokar snacks my goal is to cut down my carb intake to 100 to 150 per day and it's still kind of high but it's less like half and what I do now because I snack on all those cards attention so welcome to the target because all this this room target low carb snack tasting I guess we can call it up look big because I've always wanted to do my thing and when I started this one by the way good morning it's like like 7:00 in the morning I have a couple hours before church Oh virtual Church yes okay if you're looking for a good virtual Church I'll link the one down below they have a youtube page and it's amazing pastor Chad is amazing so Before we jump in to the video I thought we talked about my drink of the day since 7:00 in the morning it's not a mocktail right non-alcoholic beer it's an iced coffee let's roll into the footage it is the Jordans skinny salted caramel coffee guru [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] so we're going to start with a few of my favorites and one being flavored almonds I love flavored almonds these are my absolute favorite blue diamond bold sriracha flavor I love these they have 5 grams of total carbs with 3 grams of dietary fiber so 2 grams of net carbs per 28 almonds that's an amazing snack this is what they look like they're not spicy they're just like an overall good flavor you can eat these all day long in fact I do at 7:00 in the morning and my throat is like why are we eating ramen so surly besides in grenoble oh okay so in the blue diamond wasabi and soy bold ones are six total carbohydrates with 3 grams dietary fibers equaling equaling 3 3 grams of net carbs amazing hmm so just like I remember using her a little bit kick here if you've ever had wasabi peas these are like those but not as not as strong about wasabi flavor because of the soy sauce like it doesn't like punch you in the nose and punch you in the throat it's a very like calm wasabi flavor that's delicious mmm so good I leave these on my desk while I'm working okay my last favorite item that I must buy every time I'm at Target especially this is I think only at target is granola and granola is not carb conscious as carb conscious as I would like but it makes for a great like snack topper or dessert before bed I love the Target store brand good and gather that's right do my water my granola and a bunch of other things okay so the good and gather good and gather French vanilla almond granola is my absolute favorite I go through bags of these so quick and so as a snack it's 23 grams of carbs - 2 grams of dietary fiber sleeving 21 grams of net carbs per 1/3 cup mm-hmm it's for cereal so 45 grams of carbs - 4 grams of dietary fibres is 39 grams net carbs per 2/3 cup so it's not suggest - which is like Apple peanut butter and a little bit of granola so good going in I'm granola is a very good like helper in the digestion are you okay and now the reason you're all here the reason that you all have come to watch me - pancake but are the nutrients so we're gonna start with something I'm so excited about because I love candy we have smart sweet fishies smart sweets and gummy bears smart sweet peach rings my treat [Applause] so first up are the smarts sweet sweet fish chewy candy gays are 35 35 grams of carbohydrates 28 grams of dietary fibers and so that means that they are seven grams net carbs per one bag translucent but it's all about the flavor in all honesty it kind of tastes like jello like strawberry jell-o so the next ones are the fruity gummy bears yes so these ones like 33 grams of carbohydrates with 28 grams of dietary fibres equaling 5 grams of net carbs per bag they smell good they smell like gummy bears actually I could you not get our spot on mmm same texture in everything over there this one's 1 and then we have a pinkish once in college the swedish fish okay good texture come again a little bit with raspberry apple lemon and peach [Applause] okay next up our peach gummy breeze I love featuring hopefully they're like same texture as a feature they still a little hard so which is good so these are 33 grams and carbs with 28 grams of dietary fibers equaling equaling 5 grams of net carbs per bag do you see that it's a little better it's a little similar it smells like a peach ring [Music] these are featuring like but I wouldn't say they're spot-on like the gummy bears the texture is real nice the flavor takes a minute to get there which is kind of weird okay next up we got some sours first up our sour blast buddies these have the most carbohydrates so they're actually 36 grams of carbohydrates with 28 grams of dietary fiber so that's 8 grams of total net carbs per bag blues my favorite so I was definitely a good sour after you chew it for a minute it gets there okay let's try the berry I like a warhead type sour up art fer last but not least I have shower bears so these are 35 grams total carbohydrates with 20 I'm sorry yeah 28 grams dietary fibers leaving seven grams of net carbs so it's the same bears just with the sour powder on it oh here's that clear one that I think this is Apple kind of medicine II my favorites are definitely the sour black and the gummy bears a good sour flavor good texture but even before I lived here I knew about Chicago popcorn mix and if you don't it is this like bright orange cheddar popcorn mixed with shiny golden caramel popcorn and it blends together and you eat them together and I can kill a whole bag of Garrett's popcorn or this worked out like was a question or talk or anything thgh awkward you know and one sitting I can go back so I had to find healthier weight because 1 and 1/4 cup of the store-bought mix is about 17 grams 15 grams net carbs and so can I mean it not much skinny pop popcorn mini cakes in salted caramel these are 19 grams carbs - 4 grams dietary fibers equaling 15 grams per net carbs per 20 cakes to mix it got any pops the bags are always biggest in here we got skinny pop sharp cheddar popcorn mini cakes 18 grams total carbs - 4 grams dietary fibers equals 14 grams net carbs per 20 cakes let's go ahead and try these let's try look like good like melty - I'm gonna take one of the caramel I'm one of the cheddar [Music] you guys if you can't live without your popcorn mix try these tend to be right so like I'll grab a cup you spread it and post it or not go sit and eat I put cream cheese and like everything seasoning I'm some kind of a cucumber tomato in there like an I'll be I'll be that's mostly my breakfast accepted aches of eating okay or can you later yes I love you later so I had to find but so I know there is low carb bread but not at the target that I go to so I thought what can I get a target that would be low carb and a good snack during the day rice cakes so the first one I have is this year this is Quaker large rice cakes everything flavor wouldn't did they come out with this and why didn't nobody tell me mmm look how many Hardy here with some cream cheese some locks into onions I don't hate locks but that cream cheese and onion is screaming at me okay so these are nine grams total carbohydrates total net carbs per cakes they don't smell very everything right so what I'm thinking for everything like I want like a big bold flavor you know so this whole this whole cake is 9 grams it's definitely garlicky which I like okay use a little pick-me-up it's good actually yeah it's not that it's like styrofoam with a little bit of garlic we have chocolate favor favor favor double this is chocolate so it is chocolate crunch large rice cakes 12 grams 12 nickk nickk carbs there's no dietary fibers per cake so what they have it with is yogurt and raspberries I could see that maybe I'll try that but when I was thinking is peanut butter okay okay okay kind of smells like chocolate oh my god I got a whole chunk of chocolate right there you see that or is it up this little tiny bit right here is chocolate hmm all by himself okay talking about chocolate let's try these I think I tried these when I was younger like before I was like it's like I provided a different developed palette I try these and I did not like them so these are good and gathered my brand from Target thinly dipped dark chocolate almonds dusted with cocoa it's so surprisingly these are 9 grams of carbs with 3 grams of dietary fibres equaling 6 grams net carbs per 24 all right so it's pretty dark okay I wouldn't like if I was having like a real like chocolate Fein just be good it's like that it's cocoa so it's pretty bitter it's not like sweet doesn't have like it's not semi-sweet it's like pure dark chocolate cocoa what's next okay so since right here on almonds let's go ahead and try the other flavor of the Blue Diamond bold but have you decided if you want to see a video a complete video of all their flavors let me know okay so this one is Blue Diamond bold sweet Thai chili this one is 5 grams total carbohydrates with 3 grams of dietary fibers leaving 2 grams of net carbs per 28 almonds I have never tried this I do like sweet Thai chili sauce I love it here you go intense pepper flavor after sweet Thai chili sauce my favorite I like human and a lot of pepper but not like the sweet Thai sauce what is going on they're not bad but they're not the best I will say I will thing and so something I like to do with my almonds when I'm making like a quick little snack to munch on just add some pepper rose is the mini pepperonis especially so you can put this on the on the rice cakes with a little bit of cream cheese oh so good um so these here are four males pepperoni minis for salads pastas and more and they have zero carbohydrates these are also from trigun I'll link it down below I like to basically take one pepperoni one there we go savor of the video right here I'll link them down below okay but we gotta make some pepper besides the one I tried to take out them some salt and vinegar know something salt vinegar habanero bark you honey roasted some cows spicy deal which I happen often target so identical video toasted coconut blueberry and so many more so if you want to see a complete blind taste a complete bran taste I just look I'm in let's do it I'm down for real you know it Oh next is again granola but more chocolate okay so this is we're getting there this is the double dark chocolate chunk granola from good and gather myself rice snack it's a little bit better than the French vanilla and I got this one form is Oh cuz we both like granola the way it helps our digestion but he doesn't like french vanilla who doesn't like french vanilla okay so for a snack it's 19 grams of carbs - 2 grams of dietary fibers equalling 17 grams of net carbs per 1/3 cup and then for a cereal it's 43 grams of carbs - 5 grams of dietary fiber equaling 38 grams of net carbs per 3/4 cup so you get a little bit more with your school I've never tried this one either [Music] Roah blub so as I said before I know granola is not the most carb conscious but I love the way granola breaks down like in my cereal in my mouth and it's just like melts almost this granola especially I love it okay so speaking about melting food that has like that melting factor like the rice the mini cakes how they just kind of like most it melted in my mouth I love food that melts in your mouth or I should say my mouth um so the next food may seem a little weird because of who makes it and who make what they make it for but that's okay you know okay um and it's your notes this first one is Beechnut yogurt milk teas and this is strawberry apple and yogurt these are four grams of carbohydrates per 1/4 cup this is what they look like that's so good we have the happy baby Yogi's banana and mango yogurt and fruit snack okay so these are five grams of carbohydrates per 22 pieces one holidays no mango flavor whatsoever unless there's like separate mango ones they all look the same I doubt it it literally just tastes like banana baby food okay next is also from happy baby it is the Greek Yogi's in blue berry and purple carrot [Applause] these also have five grams of carbohydrates per 22 pieces they don't make me smell like nothing when you open them this one tastes more like a candy you don't get it you get lots of berry I don't even know if that's blueberry but lots of berry no carrot I got the value cracker cuz I love them so this whole value pack is like $9.99 so let's start with mixed berry so 4 grams of carbs per 1/4 cup and they have so many more flavors to now than they did so cute little chocolate chips it's good it's not as sweet as those other ones and it's like not as tart strawberry oh good it tastes like almost like a fresh Thai nut strawberry flavor this is pancake mix what would a part of my pancakes video be without pancakes right so five neck Graham caught net carbs per two pancakes so this is Bridge blenders micro pancake curry keto Edition okay we're gonna make them we're gonna try them we're gonna see what happens let's jump over there

drizzle on here [Music] just like that I'm just going to dip it in there it's very crumbly I will say not like a normal pancake I could just pick it up with your hands and eat it it's decent I don't know if it's my favorite pancake that I've ever had but it's decent mm-hmm um I love chips and I shouldn't love chips as much as I love chips let's be honest I should not these are the wisps Asiago and pepper jack cheese crisps one gram carbs per serving so that's per 23 crisp or three grams of carbs per bag I wouldn't suggest eating a whole bag because it can't be kind of pricey but just know for the next snack carb snack video there's going to be a bunch of these because they have so many flavors kick too from the pepper jack lovely like for I'm talking about okay so if you eat yes as a snack with like would you flip them stove and eat like with butter and maybe some hot sauce you may just be like Mexican or you said we know what's up cuz they are bombs so I had to find low-carb tortillas because I eat them as snacks all the time so we're gonna jump over to the stove in just a sec these ones here these are la banda Rita carb counter whole wheat low-carb tortillas so these are

[Music] welcome back i'm nicole and today like i said we're doing 20 foods i eat every single week these are foods that i've been consistently craving throughout i'd say the second half of my pregnancy after i kind of went through that nausea fun phase i really have been liking these foods and i feel like some of them aren't foods that i used to love this much before i was pregnant so i'm just gonna have a sip of water because i'm so thirsty all the time third trimester it's like drink eat repeat was is that how it goes drink eat pee repeat that's drink eat pea repeat yeah all right i'm ready so this video i filmed last year and it's at almost half a million views which is really crazy so obviously you guys like it i feel like they're just fun videos kind of like a grocery haul but it's just we're gonna get really nitty-gritty into the foods that i've been loving while pregnant um so in no particular order this isn't like most favorite to least favorite i'm just going to grab and we're going to show you i'm going to show you what i've been loving so first thing we have sunflower seeds oddly enough i mean i've always liked sunflower seeds but like when i'm saying i'm liking them like it's every day i could probably go through a pack of these a week just by myself not even matte included they're so good i've been loving them the taste the crunch i add them to my brown rice puffs cereal which is also in this list and i've just been really and really enjoying them so funny thing is i feel like your body works like it has this intuition of like what it needs and then that's what it what you crave and funny enough i've been getting like really annoying restless leg syndrome which is mostly due to probably uh magnesium being sucked from my body into baby and i realized the other day that sunflower seeds are really high in magnesium 50 of your daily intake in just a serving of these guys so i am definitely eating probably four servings of sunflower seeds a day they're the best i love them and they're like we gotta have them at all times all right next up we have dried apricots i mean i've always liked dried fruit but specifically right now dried apricots which i know are really good for you when you're pregnant i was actually listening to a podcast yesterday but like foods to eat when you're pregnant and the apparently dried apricots is a good food they are high in potassium um there is some iron in them i think they're just really easy to digest they are dried fruit so you want to make sure you are drinking lots of water with them don't worry i am and they're just a great like dry fruit and nuts and seeds are great go like on the go snacks so i never leave the house without snacks at all times because you're gonna get hungry and when you're hungry and you're pregnant it's not a good combination so dried apricots have been my favorite but i've also been enjoying dried figs and dried mango but these are the winner these are the ones i need every week next up we have raspberries i've always liked raspberries i probably have said that they're one of my favorite berries or fruits but like right now there's something about like the sweet tartness the texture of them so good like i just appreciate raspberries so much more and i've been adding them to my cereal i've been adding them to my pancakes i'll just eat them straight out of the container they're so good and i just i cannot live without them right now next up we got some avocado because avocado is really good for you healthy fats it's very satiating and i feel like it's a good base for if you're making avocado toast you're just having it with scrambled eggs i'll add it to like my burritos and i just think it's a really good nourishing food for when you're pregnant but also just in general and i liked them before i was pregnant i still like them now i feel like i wasn't eating them as much in the like first trimester but later in the later half of my pregnancy i've been really enjoying these and even just making guacamole guacamole so good a little lime juicy salt i don't even have to add too much to it sometimes i'll add fresh tomatoes from the garden but avocado so good so i've been stocking up and making sure that we always have some so when they're ripe i got backups ripening it's like rotation kind of like my bananas but with avocado next up we got mushrooms i got two kinds of mushrooms button and shiitake i mix it up every single week sometimes i'll do oysters portobello i haven't really done a ton of i just feel like they're a little bit of a stronger tasting mushroom but these are really good i actually added these to some meatballs the other day that was really good i add them just like sauteed on the side of my dinner i'm trying to think what else i order a lot of these like mushroom risotto balls from a local health food store i just like mushrooms are just so good i don't know they're just like a very soothing food that i've been enjoying i'll add them to like pasta soups and things like that they're just really good so i usually have those on hand to add to most mostly like my dinners okay then we have some sweet potatoes guys i can't every single week i am roasting up sweet potatoes i'm either baking them whole so they're nice and soft inside like mashed potatoes but mashed sweet potatoes i will cut them into medallions and roast them i always roast the ends and give them to miss cashew and she loves them i'm trying to think what else fries sweet potato fries so good with little organic ketchup or um yeah that's pretty much what i do with them i roast them and it's so satisfying and they're just a really great carby snack or like i'll just eat cold sweet potato fries out of the fridge as a snack it's really good um but yeah i always have these on hand and i like to get the organic i feel like they taste better guys watch my foods i always buy organic video and i just feel like those are the ones that um just make a big difference when you buy organic next we have rapini so i would say kind of in my beginning of my second trimester i was hit with awful indigestion and bloating i've never dealt with experienced anything like that i have so much more respect or just sympathy for people that deal with like ibs and just like digestive issues because it is not fun to have fear around the food that you are eating and if you're going to be able to digest it properly so one of the foods that's really good for stimulating digestion and help stimulate the liver is like bitter greens so dandelion greens which i kind of felt like were a little bit too bitter for me sometimes so i opted for rapini i actually love rapini um it's in a lot of portuguese dishes and i kind of grew up eating it so i'll just saute this with olive oil garlic and salt and pepper and have it as a side or mix it in with mashed potatoes and it's so good so i'm good for digestion in your liver but also just super tasty speaking of portuguese favorites we got olives i could not eat olives in the first half of my pregnancy anything sour like pickles sauerkraut kimchi all lips could not no bueno but now olives so good i don't know if it's like because they're oily and fatty i don't know but i could just snack on this whole jar before dinner and i would be super happy with that so i've been just mixing it up i'll do kalamata i'll do really any black olives green olives i'll eat them all and they're delicious so a lot of times i'll put them on my pizza i'll i'll just snack on them as is um they're just a great on-the-go snack i just put them in a jar and i brought them to the beach with me many times and i just make my own little like shakuri plate okay speaking of chicory board i've been really enjoying just like snack plates especially for like going to beach or just doing a day trip and on that snack plate i've been really enjoying cashew cheese's oh speaking of i wasn't supposed to say her name um cashew cheeses so i've been limiting my dairy intake i was eating an obscene amount of dairy and fruit in my first trimester and i also think that's kind of maybe what contributed to the indigestion and bloating i'm just eating a lot of dairy and i've always been able to digest dairy fine but i think i was just like on overdrive with it so i needed to tone it down a bit so i've been just switching to some fun alternatives and when it comes to dairy-free cheeses you want to look at the ingredients a lot of them are just filled with a lot of stuff and it's fine to have it once in a while but i didn't want that to be like a go-to snack of mine i wanted to make sure it was good ingredients and nourishing and good for me and baby so a couple of ones i've been really liking this one is an organic fermented cashew spread and it basically super simple ingredients sprouted raw cashews water sea salt water kefir and then just some spices and herbs and it's all organic and delicious it's kind of pricier like cashew cheeses can get pricey um especially for like the good quality ones but a little goes a long way and they're so tasty and i've just been loving this one on oat crackers which i'll talk about in a sec and then this brand which my acupuncturist sounds so fancy i have an acupuncturist but seriously it's much needed um she told me about this brand cultured and i've really been enjoying them so i got two flavors here i got they're sharp and smoky aged sharp and smoky and then they're aged everything bagel and these are like aged fermented cashew cheeses so flavorful ingredient lists are amazing and yeah these have just been so good i'm really i'm really digging it because i was sad when i was lowering my intake of dairy but these have been amazing replacements and i think i'm just going to continue to eat them they're so good speaking of oat crackers that is another thing that i've been loving oats in general you're gonna see a theme coming soon but these this brand specifically narns so good there's two different kind of versions that i like so they have the flatbread ones there's a rosemary one and a caramelized garlic no caramelized onion one these i like to do more savory crackers so i'll do mashed avocado i'll do the cashew cheese on these and then i like these round crackers to be like more sweet so i'll do nut butters honey a little chia seed going action going on these are like my nighttime sweet treat and these are just like my mid day lunchtime snack time uh savory cracker and this like they they're gluten free but they don't taste like gluten free they're a really nice hearty cracker so good highly recommend checking out this brand i'm just like really digging them speaking of oats i feel like i'm just going through like segways here i've been really enjoying oat milk i i mean i always love oat milk i think it's also more sustainable than drinking almond milk all the time but it has like a naturally sweet flavor to it um it froths up really nice in my frother when i'm making my herbal coffee lattes in the morning and i don't know i'm just obviously other people are liking it because i had to buy the one in like the dry goods section at my grocery store because the fresh is always sold out i don't know why like when i see it i just buy like three cartons of it um but i also have just like the one that is shelf stable and i just bought three of these today because i was like so sad i was running out um but yeah i've been enjoying this in my cereal in my herbal coffee in my pancakes that i make which i think what else i don't know oh in my roribus tea latte so good so delicious speaking of oats i've just been really digging just like plain old-fashioned oats not i don't eat them like this but i've been making so much oatmeal in the morning i've been making my oatmeal pancakes i actually have oatmeal or sorry not oatmeal pancakes oat pancakes i have an oat pancake recipe on the blog but i also have these super seed pregnancy pancakes that i've been making i'm gonna share the recipe with you guys at one point so if that's not already up it will be up soon but i've just been using oats as like a base for a lot of my breakfast in the morning and it's really soothing i know oats will be good too for like postpartum and like milk production and supply so i feel like i'm just getting my body used to them and it seems like a boring food but they're a really great staple and they're inexpensive and you can make a lot of stuff you can grind them up and make oat flour with them pancakes cookies like the list goes on so i always have some oats on hand okay then we have a rooibos tea which i was talking about that i put my oat milk in and i've just been really there's something about the rooibos tea in general like i've been drinking so much tea so much herbal tea my purple coffee lattes but rory biz tea is so soothing it kind of has like um kind of tastes like black tea but with like vanilla notes it's caffeine free and i just find it really soothing on my stomach especially when i mix it with the oat milk it's this like really nice milky tea and it's just a little bit different than just drinking herbal tea all the time really enjoying it i'm almost out so i'll probably have to pick up some more but um specifically this brand i've been really enjoying who doesn't crave peanut butter 24 7. i mean no surprise this has been a huge craving i really enjoy this on the oat crackers with honey and the chia seeds as i mentioned um i'll make my peanut butter cookies i'll eat this just with apple um yeah i've just been i think peanut butter is a great staple and it gives you some healthy fats and some protein and i've just been really enjoying it i feel like it's self-explanatory peanut butter equals heaven okay then i keep talking about my cereal it's nothing fancy and i don't know why i'm so in love with it i don't know if it's because it's really easy for me to digest at night as like a midnight snack but puffed brown rice it's just whole grain brown rice that's popped or puffed yeah puffed popped it's not the same thing so i just stock up because i can only find white puffed rice at my local grocery store so i get the brown at the health food store so i just buy like a ton of bags of it and i also will sometimes mix it with puffed kamut but the brown rice is my favorite i do this strawberries or the raspberries sunflower seeds oat milk drizzle of honey and that is pretty much what i eat every single night before bed because i you have to have a minute snack when you're pregnant otherwise you know wake up hungry at 3 a.m or 7 a.m and you're gonna be like i need food asap so this is my midnight snack and i love it next up we have honey i've been really enjoying honey as a sweetener whether in on my like oat crackers or my cereal those are the main things i just really like the taste of honey and i don't eat like processed sugars and stuff for the most part unless like i'm eating it in something but i don't actually own any white sugar in this house it's not something i use so i like to use more natural sweeteners like maple syrup date syrup honey stevia and things like that so this has been a really good go-to i got the raw stuff i also have the liquid form from drizzling but yeah and i know not everybody is comfortable eating raw honey when they're pregnant but i just think that there's a lot of benefits to it and as long as i'm buying a brand that i feel comfortable and safe eating i'm okay with it but like you do you so if you don't want to eat honey when raw honey when you're pregnant it's totally i totally get it talk with your doctor i'm not a doctor um but i've been really enjoying honey i'm just craving it so i feel like you gotta listen to your body if i'm craving it i might eat it for the most part i mean you know within reason next up we have pistachios so this big is actually upside down so i actually just get the large costco bags of this stuff because it's just been a go-to snack for me i just find that they're really satiating they sit well even when i was nauseous in my first trimester i was eating pistachios and if i'm you know out and about and feeling a little bit like a bit of acid reflux or just like hangry kind of kicking in i can just snack on a few pistachios these are just i think roasted and salted um so they're just like a fun little treat to have and um yeah they sit really good and they feel like they're a healthier snack than like potato chips or something so loving the pistachios okay so for some freezer stuff oddly enough dark cherries frozen dark cherries so good i don't i never really bought this many frozen cherries before i basically buy them just to add to my oatmeal because cherries and oatmeal is a thing i discovered while being pregnant and it is a magical thing it tastes so good you got to get like good quality frozen cherries though because some of them can be bland um so i just get the organic ones and they're so good they just melt right in but they still hold their texture so like they they melt like they thaw really quickly but they hold their texture so it tastes like you're eating a fresh cherry in your oatmeal and i've also added these to smoothies or acai bowls um but they're just like just i wanted to mention them because they're kind of a frozen fruit that i wasn't buying that much before and like now i i'm this must be like my fourth bag of them like i love them okay then the next for like our protein category i have a bone broth bone broth is so good for you so many things that i've read about pregnancy they recommend bone broth because it is really nourishing get the collagen and this one in particular i've been really liking um it's a grass yeah grass-fed one it's by heritage cattle i really like it and i'll make bone broth gravy from it another recipe if you haven't seen already will be coming soon and you can just sometimes i just warm this up on the stove and drink it like a tea and it's like perfectly salted you don't need to add anything to it and i've liked it and you can also just use it as a base for soups and stuff um or just drink it straight as is and then my favorite protein of choice this year has been shrimp i i don't know what it is like i well i love seafood but specifically shrimp i've been really craving i don't know if it's because it's really light and easy to eat a lot of it and it doesn't feel so heavy um but it's you know it's still a good protein source i've been sauteing this chloe's been making shrimp tacos for me um i feel like i've just been really just enjoying shrimp a lot so i thought i would mention it because i feel like um i always like shrimp but right now it's like it's it's aggressive how much i've been liking shrimp so definitely wanted to mention that as like one of my favorite protein sources obviously still eating like some chicken and eggs and beef and stuff but shrimp it's the best so good there you have it those are the 20 foods that i'm eating every single week while pregnant in my third trimester i hope this gave you some ideas whether you're pregnant or not um just for some new foods to try but if you are pregnant i feel you it's like learning how to eat all over again what what you're craving what doesn't work like salmon for me still is kind of in the iffy category um i feel like yeah my diet has just changed so much this year but it's also fun because i'm discovering new foods that i'm

well as showing you guys some snack ideas and in my opinion these are pretty healthy snacks i'm not a nutritionist or anything but i do try to eat relatively well and hopefully you find some meal ideas or snack ideas that you guys want to try out and remember to subscribe to be notified about future videos and also please excuse my frizzy hair but i just got out of the shower so let's continue with the video so today i'm having cereal and some almond milk [Music] blue diamond almond breeze milk is my favorite but there are plenty of different non-dairy milk options to choose from i always like to have some type of fruit in the morning with my breakfast so today i just grabbed some blueberries out of the fridge and then i of course rinsed them before i ate them [Music] and then for my beverage this morning i'm just having some cold water and i feel like water goes with everything and it's really good to have in the morning to help wake you up for lunch i started off by toasting an english muffin and then while that was toasting i decided to get myself some fruit so i got out some watermelon and i struggled a little bit getting it off the fork since i was using only one hand and one hand to film but i managed to fill up my bowl and watermelon is so refreshing especially in the summertime and then once my english muffin was done in the toaster then i just drizzled on some balsamic and i don't put too much on but then i use a butter knife to spread it around a little bit just to kind of cover it everywhere on the bread then i added some cheese and some pieces of basil this is a really really great refreshing summer lunch and it's super simple and easy and again i had water so these pita chips are my favorite brand and i often have these as a side at lunch time they're pretty good for you i mean they still are a chip but they're a pretty good option and so i'll just have some of these with some hummus as aside for lunch and i love this hummus and also red pepper hummus so i thought now would be a good time to incorporate the other snack ideas into the video and share them with you guys and all these items you should probably be able to find at your local grocery store if you're interested in trying out any of them these welch's fruit snacks i've mentioned them before but they're a really great option if you want something sweet that's not too unhealthy and another option for snacks is dried fruit so there's raisins but there's also different kinds of dried fruit like dates and i also highly recommend trying dried cranberries even if you don't like raisins these do not taste anything like raisins they have a lot of flavor and they can either be tangy or sweet and you can also mix all these items together to make a trail mix and you can also incorporate some nuts into atrix as well or just eat them separately these two kinds of nuts right here they're not the most healthy options ever but that's just what we had in the house for me to show you guys but you can get any kind of nut and you can get it low salt which obviously would be healthier and then another snack idea are these newtons they're similar to fig newtons but these ones are triple berry and i prefer these over fig newton and these remind me a little bit of those nutrigrain bars so if you like those then you'll probably like these and this pack comes with about 20 in it next snack idea is dark chocolate you can obviously eat this plain or break it up and mix it into the trail mix and i'm pretty sure dark chocolate is the healthiest kind of chocolate apples and peanut butter are such a classic snack combination and it's a really great way to balance savory and sweet and is definitely one of my go-to's i usually start dinner off with a simple salad and this one just has spinach lettuce tomato and cucumber and then i just add some balsamic dressing later on and my main thing for dinner tonight is a hamburger and i'm just having it on a piece of bread instead of a bun i love this peppered farm wheat bread because it doesn't have those hard things throughout the bread and then as a side i'm having some homemade macaroni salad and this only has a couple ingredients and it does not have mayonnaise because i really dislike mayonnaise so i'm glad we found a recipe that does not have that and i'm actually going to show you really quickly how we make it and how simple it is and here i'm being picky about making sure it's all in one spot on my dish because i'm just like that so this is what my dinner looks like with everything all together it's a pretty typical summer meal that we have and it's not exactly what we have every night since obviously it varies but i just wanted to share this idea with you guys because it is pretty simple and i think it's pretty balanced with like nutrients and carbs and protein and everything thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed the video and that you found it to be helpful hopefully this gave you some meal and snack ideas and comment down below what your favorite snack is i'm always open to trying different foods and trying different snacks and remember to subscribe if you like the

the performance energy bars in different flavors I had an opportunity to try this mix berry blast flavor and ever since I've tried it I've just loved it and if you are looking for a great flavor of power bar for the performance energy bars this flavor is one that I highly highly recommend it's delicious it comes 12 to a box and some of the things i was actually learning as well the palate bar energy bars are before and after I'm sorry before and during your workout and then they have other products that you could take thereafter as far as the prob what I like about the product i should say is that it helps when i'm in need for that boost of energy to help me get through or if I'm kind of feeling like I might have the shakes a little bit I'll take this product and it is my Savior i remember in tennis you know there were times i'd be out there and it was so hot out i reach up for this bar and this was the one I would go to so definitely would recommend it um what I like about the product again it tastes good it's I don't know I find it's just easy to digest and it's kind of a little sticky kind of like the little gummy type of substance to it but it works well definitely ever really is just so delicious so anyway just wanted to share this with you if you have any questions let me know this is a great flavor i highly recommend it leave any of your comments or questions

we're only packing twice this week so this might be a two week combine video otherwise you only get two lunches and that doesn't make for a whole lot of inspiration for a week so sometimes the kids pack more often and sometimes they only pack once or twice a week so it just kind of depends they do get at lunch at school about as much as they pack Jaxson especially gets hot lunch at school more often than not alice is my packer so if you are go around here Jackson is in second grade Alice is in first grade they get a 25 minute lunch which is not long enough in my opinion especially with Alice she's a very slow eater but I give them the choice each day whether they want to do packed lunch or have lunch at school so what else all of the items that we love and use frequently are link down the description box below if you'd like to see them and that includes our lunchboxes and all of that so if you have questions just let me know and I can point you in the right direction but let's jump into the lunches from this past week or two alright friends here is the first lunch then I've got to show you that the kids will be taking I'm using these easy lunchbox containers they are pretty much the same except Jackson has a bit more his appetite is bigger than Alice's and so I'm trying to accommodate that basically so they each have a capri-sun for a punch to drink one of these banana gogo squeeZ yogurts and then inside the EZ lunchbox container they each have some goldfish some green grapes cheese cubes I did throw a baby Bell cheese in with Jackson's too he likes those Alice does not they've got some sliced salami and then a pack of mutts fruit snacks so I will make sure to show you what they have left when they get home from school I'm also including out I was gonna put a fork that's when I was doing something different um I was gonna do Kiwi in there and forks are usually helpful for that but I've got napkins I've got them just left over from birthday parties and events so I'm throwing in a unicorn one for Alice and then just this like coldest yellow one for Jackson but that'll be their lunch for tomorrow hi friends this is what the kids have left from their lunches Jackson ate most of his he also said he traded a grape to goldfish and his baby Bell cheese for another pack of fruit snacks from a friend so that happened I was like you already had a pack of fruit snacks he's like yeah now I had two so yeah he did say he ate his yogurt too i Alice didn't open her yogurt she's gonna eat this actually as an after-school snack because it's still cold so she ate a little bit of everything but again slow eater and she likes to talk to her friends makes for a very unproductive lunch as far as the food the sheets so that's what they have left we will see you the next time they pack which i think is actually tomorrow so I'll see you again later tonight when I pack their lunches for tomorrow all right friends here is the kids next lunch I'm not this is technically for Tuesday I think we're gonna have to combine two weeks together though so I mean it's what it is because this is the last lunch that they're packing this week so they are identical they each have a turkey and cheese sandwich sandwich sandwich on a brioche that's where the SH was coming from bun the buns we had from Costco there's no mayo or mustard or anything neither of them like that they've got some red white and blue star shaped marshmallows in here for sweet treats these fruit pops will do our Delmont a's new bubble fruit it's the peach strawberry lemonade and it's got the little boba like the poppy and boba pearls or whatever in there they love these and so I bought some today and thought I'd throw it in the lunchbox I do have spoons to go along with those in the center is a pack of sun-maid s our raisins I actually a split one pack between them and these are the mixed berry flavor and then we've got some goldfish cracker and a capri-sun roarin water strawberry-kiwi swirl and as always I will show you what they have left when they get home okay here's Alice's lunch what she has left she actually ate more of the sandwich than I thought she would those brioche buns are like kind of thick so it's more than just a standard piece of bread so she did good there I forgot what was here I don't remember marshmallows she hid the marshmallows what was in the back goldfish she said she didn't see the spoon that I put in here for her so she was like eating the fruit with her fingers and then she saw the spoon at the very end and raisins I didn't think she would eat those cuz she's very picky on reasons even though these taste more like fruit snacks and candy yeah then a regular raisin but whatever weird child and Jackson left his lunchbox at school he said he ate everything right yeah he said he ate everything though so he'll bring that home tomorrow um it's actually getting hot lunch the rest of this week so you will see them again next week for two lunches so this will be a dual week combine like I said so anyway see you in a few days all right friends new week same video this is Alice's lunch for Tuesday coming back from the holiday weekend she's got an applesauce pouch from Costco fruit roll-up sour I don't know if she'll like this one just came in our variety fun box and there's only one and since she's the only one packing lunch right throw it in her lunch we've got some just shredded turkey lunch me a few grapes that I cut up and some strawberries cucumber Spears with a little cup of ranch dressing and then a capri-sun roaring water strawberry Kiwi surf so that'll be her lunch and I'll show you what she has left when she gets home so here's what Alice has left she did pretty good she a monster of fruit must her meat I forget what it was right there oh you commercia ate all those she did not open her juice and she did not eat her fruit roll-up did you eat your applesauce pouch what is on your face look at me no chocolate all over the place you eat that for after school snack all righty alright friends this will likely be the last lunch unless Alice changes her mind on the rest of the days this week but this is her lunch for Wednesday she is using the planet box and this is a stainless steel lunch box that goes into this insulated lunch box and I put ice packs in here and then seal it up so let's see she actually helped me pack her lunch so she wanted half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich yummy she says a pickle and these are the kosher dill spears from quality so I put that in a ziplock baggie because the bad thing about the planter box is that it is not leak proof in the center she's got one of these juicy choose from lovely candy Co it's an organic candy company she has been wanting to try these cookies out of our variety fun box for weeks it's the Knott's Berry Farm raspberry shortbread cookies so I put three of those in there and then she also chose another applesauce pouch she's been really into those lately which is weird because she went like the last year not liking them as she was going to do a juice but she decided she's going to help water I think in the cafeteria so that'll be her lunch so I'll show you what she has left when she gets home my friends Alice did really well today and I know because I actually went and had lunch with her at school so the only thing she didn't finish was her applesauce pouch there's about half of that left other than that she ate everything except for one bite of pickle and one cookie what she gave to me she insisted on me having bites of her lunch even though I was fine so that is what she has left I told her apparently I just have to come and eat with her in order for her to finish her meal she just kind of laughed so Natalie round out this week's lunches because tomorrow is Bosco sticks which are like cheese filled breadsticks that the kids love and then Friday it is pizza we will see you next week all right friends there you have it another week of kids school lunch ideas for you hopefully you enjoyed this or found it entertaining and until next time I will see you later bye [Music]",

will see you later bye [Music] you", "mS-vfm5RT-c": "aldi is a great place to stock your freezer as there are some truly mouth-watering options to choose from in aldi's frozen aisle if you're not sure where to start try picking from some of our personal favorites these are the frozen foods you should be buying at aldi even if you're on a really strict diet experts say you can afford to indulge in a decadent slice of cheesecake once a week and this option from belmont is the perfect way to do so because they're frozen you can store these cheesecakes for a little longer than you would be able to a regular slice and since they come two slices per package you don't have to worry about eating the whole cake yourself but whether you're on a diet or not we suggest picking this one up so we love mint ice cream enough to eat a pint and night but we know that's not the healthiest of nightly snacking options still if you can't resist heading over to the ice cream aisle every time you're on a grocery run consider this amazing good ice cream all these sells at a seriously good price without all of the guilt usually associated with this frozen treat the brand offers a ripe strawberry chocolate and vanilla bean flavor but we're going to go out on a limb here and give the mint chocolate a double thumbs up it's a great alternative for your ben and jerry cravings the brand claims the delicious treat will help you increase your protein intake without adding to that daily calorie intake we're all so worried about yeah i'm gonna get chip face come join me aldi's protein pints are also a lot cheaper than most other healthy ice creams giving popular brands like halo top and enlightened a run for their money sure there's been a lot of debate recently about whether all meatless burgers are actually as healthy as they claim to be but superfood or not there's no denying how delicious several vegan options can be including this one for a patty that packs a punch without puncturing your pocket aldi has just what you're looking for and for under four dollars for four in most locations even if you end up having a favorite they offer many different and amazing options as well these frozen patties are great to keep in your freezer for a quick lunch or dinner since they can be ready in minutes don't shy away from the frozen fish section of the grocery store any longer besides the american heart association says those who ate some fish every week were at lower risk of heart disease they also found that the best way to increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acid is a dietary approach over pills and supplements so if you're not already trying to increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acid perhaps you should as always there's something in aldi's freezer that will help you out they have a range of inviting frozen fish options but among our favorites are these wild caught sockeye salmon fillets they're full of flavor easy to prepare laying on the pocket perfectly proportioned and if that wasn't enough already it helps that they're pretty healthy too since aldi is so good at keeping our pantry stocked with everything we may possibly have a hankering for it's no surprise that they've got pretzels covered too aldi's deutsche kusha bavarian soft pretzels have been gaining popularity for a while now and after trying them ourselves we realize they're on the lists of all these best frozen foods for a reason they really are that good these massive pretzels come six to a box so they're a steal at under four dollars in most locations they're easy to prepare and they're a great bang for your buck aldi's relatively recent deutsche kusha range of german inspired treats also has schnitzel sandwich cookies and other cookies and puffs for german food aficionados hashbrown patties are a great breakfast option but if you've ever tried to make them yourself you'll know that there is a lot of work and waiting involved instead pick up a box of seasons choice hash brown patties from aldi with 20 whole patties in one pack imagine all the money you're saving by picking these over the dollar a piece option at mcdonald's these hash brown patties are really tasty and they're perfect as a to-go breakfast option on their own or is aside for something a little more fancy there was a time not so long ago when we'd microwave a hot pocket whenever we had a slight hunger pang but even though they're not as bad for you as you'd think they're still not really the best afternoon snack but you're not going to be able to resist aldi's spin on the popular quick fix food the live g-free stuffed sandwiches from aldi are the best tasting of any hot pocket wannabe we've tried and they're gluten-free without tasting dry or falling apart there's a delicious assortment of available flavors and they're included in the live g-free range of frozen snacks and microwave meals that are all worth trying whether you're following a gluten-free diet or not we know the mention of gluten-free pizza isn't usually met with sounds of delight this isn't really surprising because most gluten-free crusts taste terrible and ruin the indulgent idea of digging into a cheesy slice aldi's live g-free gluten-free pizza option though is good enough to pick up even if you're not limited to foods without gluten while aldi doesn't have a magic solution for all of the pizza problems their gluten intolerant customers face they do have some respite at this store because the live g free brand recently introduced a wide range of delicious new foods to their already impressive selection as an added bonus not only does the live g-free pepperoni pizza at aldi not taste like sawdust the entire pizza only costs about five dollars if you've done much shopping for gluten-free foods you know that's an amazing price that simply can't be beat one of the best parts of a japanese meal at a restaurant is definitely the dessert while there are many options there's something special about the relatively new invention mochi ice cream so it's especially exciting that it's now available in stores and even more so that it can be found at such wonderful prices thanks to aldi for those who don't know mochi is a dough made of sticky rice and the mochi ice cream if the name hasn't given it away already is ice cream wrapped in this sticky sweet mixture we're all for the more traditional matcha variant of course but aldi sells mimo mochi in ripe strawberry and other absolutely delicious flavors and we can't get any of them off our minds you should definitely be including more fruit in your diet but it's not always easy to keep a steady stack of fresh food around if you're tired of fruit going bad but scared to lose nutritional value by picking fruit-based alternatives that last longer invest in some frozen fruit season's choice frozen berry medley from aldi in particular luckily it doesn't really matter whether fruit is frozen or fresh and while fruits like apples and bananas are best bought fresh season's choice frozen berry medley from aldi are perfect frozen too they're very easy to use with breakfast or to defrost and eat plain contain plenty of that fiber we were talking about and tastes just as fresh and sweet as the real deal in the frozen aisle don't forget to pick up something from the popular casa mamita selection after all there's something so satisfying about being able to pick a small packet out of the freezer and have a meal or snack in minutes and even more so if it's something as tasty as the casa mamita beef and bean burritos from aldi to add to it being aldi lovers dream come true they cost less than four dollars it's not always easy but it is important to make sure your diet includes enough vegetables the american heart association recommends at least five servings a day of these and frozen vegetables definitely count toward that goal which makes our lives easier aldi's seasons choice steam mix vegetables are one of our favorite products from aldi's frozen section not only because they're super cheap but they're also ready in a jiffy and taste just as good as fresh produce we mention aldi's delightful selection of german food already but we just couldn't leave all these beer bratwursts off a list of our favorite things to get at the store most beer bratwurst brands usually hover around and go upwards of the four dollar or five dollar mark aldi's are usually under three dollars and they definitely don't compromise on taste what makes these brats even more special is that they're flavored with beer which gives them a particularly wonderful summery taste boil these grill them fry them there's really no way you can go wrong the kirkwood crispy chicken strips from aldi may come in a resealable bag but we're not sure you're going to need it after you taste them all of the kirkwood frozen products are usually cheaper than similar options from name brands and kirkwood crispy chicken strips in particular are increasingly popular with their customers they're also quick and easy to prepare and although they are better oven cooked unlike some other brands they taste pretty good out of the microwave too making them our favorite for when we're craving some tenders and don't want to wait for the oven to preheat check out one of our newest videos right here plus even more mashed videos

water you're going to say well our water looks very nice it does look very nice doesn't it look look this beautiful garnet color it's gorgeous you know what it tastes like nothing i'm telling you this water tastes like nothing matter of fact if i were to give you something to eat and i close your eyes and say what are you drinking you'll say i'm drinking water that's when you're drinking water you just happen to have color on it but i tell you what it tastes like nothing so when i make a i want to replace a water then taste like nothing with booze you can use shambo you can use grand marnier you could use keys you could use so much but that is better than water i'm telling you so now let me show you how to do it first you gotta defrost the fruits and i'm telling you this takes at least 24 hours you got to do it i promise you you made this one time you'll never go back to another recipe there's no cooking involved it's really the best recipe i learned that roger virginia from the mulan vuja and taught me to make this recipe it's really really a fabulous recipe friends all right so frozen berries mixed berries in the food processor i'm gonna try not to mess up too much meaning i'm gonna try not to mess up my jacket too much that's what i'm gonna try to do but every time i make a somehow i wear the so so here we have it i'm telling you you got to do the experiment you're not

getting ready to pack up matt's lunch cooler today i'm giving him a capri sun berry in the roaring water the clear juice pouch a dr thunder which is like a dupe for dr pepper i packed up the yum box

them everywhere if you ever see these grab them if you like pickles if you also if you like pickled carrots that this brand makes pickled carrots as well which are really good too so this is his lunch today thank you so much for watching i want to share with those who don't know what the lunch cooler and the water cooler looks like but everybody else who already knows or isn't interested in that once again thank you for watching have a great day and i'll see you in my next video all right guys so this is the lunch cooler we've had it for many years it is the igloo brand um we got it i think at walmart or target and it is washable you can wash it right in the sink and the way that i pack it is just with this large like huge ice pack in the winter months in the warmer one month i'll add another ice pack along this back while there's room down here and i have one that fits along the back wall so i just lay it down year round and then i'll put like the sandwich the salad or whatever is you know the perishable food like i'll put this box right on the top for example and then i'll put anything that needs to be kept cold down towards the bottom so it's touching the top of the ice pack keep in mind too it is cold here still right now it is 16 degrees so it's only going to be a high of like 20 today so it's pretty cold here still um but yeah everything just fits you just kind of assemble it or re arrange it the way that makes the most sense and it works out perfectly once again it's really easy to clean and i'm just going to share quickly the um the water cooler right here's the water cooler it is the bubble brand again we got this at the same time i think we bought these back in 2014 when we lived in south carolina um this he uses year-round as well i fill it to about here with ice and then about here with water and he drinks it throughout the day usually whenever he's working somewhere he can fill it up with water if he needed to but he said nine times out of ten what i give him is plenty even in the warmer months but yeah that's just what we use every day in case you're curious and thanks for watching [Music] [Applause] so you", "7JdCgx-KV5w": "[Music] 10

sorry next until next time I'll see you later bye [Music]", "mrg1Ogi9ep0": "one of the keys to being successful with\nthe keto diet is to always be prepared and I have foods on hand that you can\njust make recipes out of moment's notice so if you come home from work and you're\nstarving or if you wake up in the morning and you're hungry too or if you\njust need a snack you always want to have foods on hand to keep you sticking\nto your goals so I'm going to share with you guys my favorite foods to have in my\nfridge today we're gonna take a peek inside my\nfridge and I want to share with you guys ten keto foods that I think everyone\nshould have in their refrigerator so let's go take a look the first must have food in your\nrefrigerator is eggs unless you're allergic to them then of course don't\nhave eggs but I usually keep around two or three dozen eggs in my refrigerator\nat a time and that's because we eat them like crazy I use them for breakfast I\nuse him and baking my kids like him as a snack or pack them in their lunches to\ntheir big hard-boiled egg fans so I usually have two or three a fresh\nuncooked eggs in a fridge and then one carton of hard-boiled eggs so I usually\nmake up in my instant pot these are the eggs that I buy they're from happy eggs\nthey are from pasture-raised chickens the yolks are orange they are so high in\nomega-3 fatty acids and all these nutrients inside of them plus they're\ncreamy too and delicious it's my favorite egg the benefits of eating eggs\nis that they are an excellent source of protein they're a complete protein in\nfact they have all the necessary amino acids that you need they have a large\namount of omega-3 fatty acids that is if you get the pasture-raised eggs and\nsaturated fat too they also have a lot of vitamins and minerals so there's\nselenium copper iron zinc vitamin B vitamin D and they have choline too\nwhich is great for nerve function besides making eggs for breakfast I also\nlike to pack them in our lunches so I'll bring him to work with me or pack them\nin my son's lunch he's a huge fan of hard-boiled eggs I use eggs when I'm\nmaking chaffles or pancakes or fat head dough obviously any sort of keto baking\nthat you're gonna do you're gonna need eggs and the yolks can actually be used\nas a thickener so if you're trying to make dressings or sauces you can use an\negg yolk as a thickener and then the whites you can actually whip those up\nand form stiff peaks get them all nice and fluffy and you can make meringues\nout of those or like a whipped topping out of the whipped up egg whites\nexcellent delicious I have a hot chocolate recipe that uses a meringue\nwhipped topping and all leave that video linked up here for you I mentioned\nearlier that I like to make up around a dozen hard-boiled eggs for the week and\nI usually make that in my instant pot I love making them up an instant pot\nbecause it's really easy it's convenient I don't have to babysit them and that\nshells peel off so easily too you place your eggs on top of the trivet that came\nwith the instant pot and then you're gonna add a cup of water and pressure cook it on high for five\nminutes you're gonna let the pressure release naturally for five minutes and\nthen immediately transfer it to an ice bath and let it sit there for five\nminutes then you can peel your eggs some people store them just with the shell on\nwhich is what I like to do others will actually peel their eggs right away and\nstore them on peels in the refrigerator if you do that you have to put it in\nsome water that you change out daily or ever that you can put it in a container\nwith a damp paper towel and that works too another food that is always in my\nrefrigerator is bacon we love bacon in my household my kids love to eat it in\nthe morning for breakfast so I usually have like two or three packages of bacon\non hand because we go through it so fast and Bacon's delicious it has such great\nflavor it's fatty I mean most people love it\nI mean who doesn't love bacon everybody loves bacon if you don't we're not\nfriends I like to add it to a bunch of my savory dishes just to pump up the\nflavor or also if I'm thinking that a recipe is lacking in some fat content\nbecause I want to make sure it's gonna keep us full until our next meal and\nwith bacon you can actually save your bacon grease stored animation jar or\nthey have those bacon containers that you can pick up from Amazon that help\nstore your bacon and keep it fresh you can use this bacon to cook other things\nwith like your eggs saute up some chicken with it and it\nadds just like a little hint of smoky bacon a flavor and it's delicious it's\nthe perfect fat to cook any of your foods with I have lots of recipes on my\nwebsite that utilize bacon I have maple bacon cookies bacon Mayo bacon a blue\ncheese doodles bacon-wrapped shrimp bacon wrap little Smokies stuff with\njalapeno poppers which is delicious by the way we're actually making that this\nweekend because we're having people over and they're so good all of mine on keto\nfriends love them too if there is one a big tip that I could\ngive you guys to make meal prep easier and making dinner easier that would be\nto have all of your vegetables prepped out ahead of time so all the washing the\nchopping the slicing and dicing and storing it all in a container that is my\nbiggest tip for you guys and that is why number three food on my list is to have\nthese pre chopped up ready to go vegetables on hand you can have pre\nsliced onion bell pepper or cut into strips celery broccoli cauliflower any\nof your favorite vegetables just pre chop them get them washed up ready to go\nyou store them in an airtight container with just a paper towel on the bottom to\ncollect moisture and that way you always have something to eater to snack on or\nyou can bring it out and throw it in your recipes when you're making dinner I\nlike to have these all prepped up and ready to go it makes packing lunches\neasier in the morning too because I can just grab a handful vegetables toss it\nin a baggie sand the kid out the door well I mean I give them matter food too\nbut makes it so much easier so I'm not really scrambling in the morning trying\nto figure out what to pack them for lunch I also find that if I have my\nvegetables prepped up I'll use them more in my recipes too so I can toss some\nveggies and some scrambled eggs or toss them in a salad so it's not just like a\nplain lettuce salad we actually have some other pretty-looking vegetables in\nthere or you can just serve them as a side dish so you can toss some butter\nand salt in with some broccoli and cauliflower put it in the microwave or\njust steam it on the stovetop and it's a quick side dish for your family at\ndinner time another keto food that I like to have in\nmy refrigerator is some sort of leafy green vegetable so I usually get the\npre-packed salad mixes like either a baby spinach a 50/50 blend or the spring\nmix and I like to have these on hand just because I can put together a quick\nside salad for dinner it makes it really really easy I don't have to wash\nanything dry anything I hate pulling out my salad spinner I don't even know why I\nstill have one because I don't think I've used that thing in like three years\nor so it's been a long time so probably should get rid of it having spinach on\nhand is great if you like to make smoothies if you're a big smoothie\nperson in the morning or you can throw spinach and like\na soup or some sort of casserole or if you're making like an egg scramble in\nthe morning - spinach is great or any sort of leafy green vegetable you can\nthrow in there one of my favorite leafy greens to get is chard and this is a red\nchard I love it because I can throw it into soups for a little extra green and\nyou can actually cut this up and saute it with some butter and salt and it's\ndelicious it makes a really good side dish\nnot very many fruits are allowed on the keto diet but the ones that are just\nhappened to be my favorite berries so I always have berries in my refrigerator\nfrom strawberries raspberries blackberries blueberries we usually have\nsomething mostly it's strawberries and raspberries because those are our\nfavorite but occasional have the other ones too\nif they're in season berries are full of antioxidants that are low in sugar too\nso I love giving them to my kids as a snack or pack them in their lunches I'll\nserve them on this side with some eggs and bacon in the morning - but I love\nincorporating berries into my keto desserts there's so much you can do like\nI have a recipe for strawberry cheesecake bars on my website super-good\nI also have a video on it I'll link it up here for you and I have a recipe for\na raspberry crumble that is excellent it's easy to make it's really good for\nsummertime you can top it with some keto ice cream or some whipped cream it's so\ngood but berries are great if you have a sweet tooth and you're craving something\nbut don't want to drag out all of your baking equipment or start your oven so\nyou can just have them by themselves as a good sweet treat or you can make up\nsome keto whipped cream which is just sugar free whipped cream and just mix in\nsome berries with it or you can make like an easy berry cheesecake fluff\nwhich is where you add your favorite berry cream cheese some heavy cream\nvanilla sweetener to a blender and you blend it all together until it's smooth\nand it's just a quick easy keto dessert that you can make but this is one produce item that you\nshould not pre wash ahead of time so on meal prep day do not wash your berries\nbecause if you wash them they actually go bad faster so keep them unwashed and\nthen when you want to have them just wash a little bit at a time just so that\nthe rest of them aren't spoiling another food that I always have in my fridge is\nsome sort of precooked protein so this is something that all prep up during\nmeal prep day and I'll have mostly its ground beef so it'll make like a taco\nmeat have that all prepped up ready to go so we could have tacos anytime\nthroughout the week a lot of times my husband will take them\nfor lunch or we can make a quick taco salad for lunch I also like to have pre\ncooked up grilled chicken if it's cold outside and my grill is covered in snow\nthen I'll just put my chicken in my instant pot and cook it up that way but\nI always have some precooked form of protein in my refrigerator that way if I\ncome home from work I don't have anything planned I could just easily\ngrab that grab some vegetables make up a quick stir fry if I have the precooked\nground beef I can make up a lasagna I know you guys have seen my little is on\nyour recipe before if you haven't I'll have it linked up here for you or down\nbelow in the description box so easy it's delicious you got to try it\nheavy whipping cream and nut milks are pretty much the only milk options that\nyou can have on the keto diet so I like to have both on hand I like to have the\nheavy whipping cream in case I'm going to make a quick dessert like whipped\ncream and berries but it also works great as a thickener too so you can\nthicken up gravies and sauces with heavy whipping cream it can make your eggs\nsuper creamy if you like to have scrambled eggs in the morning the nut\nmilk that I like to have on hand is macadamia nut milk I preferred over\nalmond milk because it has a higher fat content and it's lower in carbs plus\nit's so creamy and it tastes delicious they have an unsweetened version which\nis the blue label that's what I usually get I'll use it in my savory and my\nsweet dishes but I will also sometimes get the vanilla flavored one because\nit's delicious it's unsweetened but it has just a hint of vanilla I like to use\nnut milks and I'm trying to thin out something like a gravy or sauce or\nsmoothies and I don't want to add additional heavy cream because I don't\nwant more carbs or more fat going into it I think I lied when I said that\nberries were my favorite fruit to have because I forgot there's one other fruit\nthat's allowed on the keto diet and that's avocado now avocados are great\nbecause 3/4 of the calories of an avocado come from fat so it's the\nperfect food for you you can just shave off a couple of slices top it on a taco\nsalad I like to sprinkle some salt on it and I'll just take that to lunch\noftentimes I'll just bring an avocado and a knife and some salt to work when I\nam too busy to pack my lunch and it's perfect I mean don't tell anybody I\nbring a knife to work because that could get me in trouble this is a sharp knife\nbut it makes the perfect meal because it's super high in fat it's loaded in\nfiber has lots of vitamins in it too it actually has more potassium than bananas\nso as a pharmacist that's my day job I actually will recommend when people have\nleg cramps I recommend they go eat some avocados I don't tell them to go eat a\nbanana because there's not as much potassium in bananas plus they're loaded\nwith sugar so I'll tell them to go eat an avocado and see if\nhelps and if not then we'll talk about some other options for them you could also add avocados to smoothies\nyou could also make guacamole I have an easy Akita of welcome only recipe on my\nwebsite you can also make those little avocado boats where they stuff them with\nchicken salad or you can just crack an egg and put that on the avocado put in\nthe oven and bake it it makes a little egg egg boat avocado thingy I don't know\nwhat those are called but they're really good an avocado works as a substitute\nfor mayo too so if you're trying to make a lettuce wrap or just a low-carb wrap\nyou can just spread some avocado down and it serves as like a mayonnaise to\nhelp moisten your wrap I like making avocado fries they're delicious or fill\nalongside a bunless burger I'll leave my favorite\nrecipe link down below for you and you can also use avocado in your keto baking\nso it works as a fat replacer so it's replacing any of the oil and butter that\nmight go into a recipe so for every one cup of oil or butter you're gonna use a\n1 cup of mashed avocado I like to store my avocados in the fridge because I\nthink it keeps them from going bad too quickly and as some are looking sad you\ncan actually freeze them to just scoop out the green insides toss in a ziplock\nbag and freeze it I'm sure if you're on the keto diet you probably already have\nthis in your refrigerator unless you're lactose intolerant or trying to avoid\ndairy but that's cheese and I always like to have cream cheese and regular\ncheese stored in my refrigerator and the cheese that I mostly like to have in my\nrefrigerator is mozzarella cheese because I like to use it when I'm making\nfat dough if I'm gonna make up a pizza or chuckles a lot of my chocolate\nrecipes require mozzarella cheese I like to have it on hand so I'm gonna make\nsome key to lasagna too but the cream cheese I like to add in if I'm gonna\njust I want a little bit of creamy factor into a recipe like if I'm trying\nto make like a soup nice and creamy or some sort of a stir fry add some\ncreaminess to that instead of using heavy cream sometimes I'll just add a\nlittle couple cubes of cream cheese and it also can be used as a thickener in\nthe sauces too just similar to the heavy cream you can just use cream cheese\ninstead cream cheese is also great if you're\ntrying to make up some quick keto snacks like taking celery spreading cream\ncheese on it you can sprinkle some everything but the bagel seasoning on\ntop or make a quick salami roll-up with some cream cheese inside maybe a little\npickle slices and there's delicious as well and the last keto food that I\nalways like to have in my refrigerator is grass-fed butter and I get the\ngrass-fed kind I don't get the conventional butter because I want my\nfamily to have that extra a little bit of nutrients grass-fed butter is filled\nwith conjugated linoleic acid or clas and this is an essential fatty acid it\nhelps with inflammation so it's naturally anti-inflammatory it also\nhelps with muscle growth and grass-fed butter is filled with vitamin k2 which\nis also essential for bone health plus grass-fed butter tastes amazing so I\nlove to use it in everything so anytime I'm sauteing vegetables even some meat\nif you're finishing off a steak throw some butter on there I use it in my\nAikido baking too I mean I don't have to tell you what to use butter in because\nyou probably already know it's butter it's the keto diet it's amazing just\nmake sure you don't run out these were the ten items that I like to keep in my\nrefrigerator at all times so there are many more items that I could add some of\nthis list if you guys have some ideas make sure you comment them down below so\nmaybe we can get to thinking about hey maybe I should always have that in there\nthat's a really good idea some of my other ones are chicken broth I always\nhave a barbecue sauce on hand too what else do I do pickles garlic I\nusually keep garlic in there I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you liked it\nplease give me a thumbs up because that tells me if I should make more videos\nlike this have a good one bye", "AyATtbEB_xo": "hi and welcome to Anne's family recipe today I'm making the perfect after-school snack mixed fairy muffins [Music] today's video is in collaboration with my friend Jen from the channel when with Jen now she and I are both sharing with you recipes for homemade after-school snacks Jen is a mother of three and I have four children but our two oldest are the same age and in the same grade and it's funny because we were just talking about how we've had all this peace and quiet around our house now that our second grader and kindergarteners are at school for the full day we had forgotten that peace and quiet and calm was possible and we've really been loving it and one thing that I like to do in the afternoon before my kids get home is bake when one of my sons is napping and the other is playing quietly in his room I can relax myself by baking in the kitchen and I think it is so nice to have a home baked treat ready and waiting for my kids when they get home from school plus it just makes the house smell really warm and welcoming it's just so nice Jen is so sweet she's become a good friend of mine here on YouTube and she has wonderful content she has Kito friendly recipes low carb recipes she's always in the kitchen cooking with her kids she shares family vlogs there are just so many fun videos for you to watch on her channel so after you finish watching my video make sure you head over to win with Jen for these mixed berry muffins the first step is to whisk together the dry ingredients so in my mixing bowl here I'm gonna add two cups of all-purpose flour which I'm using my awesome 2 cup measuring cup here and love that so we'll dump that in and then I also have I already measured it out there's a half a teaspoon of baking soda and a half a teaspoon of salt just regular table salt and then this is optional but I really like to add a half a teaspoon of cinnamon as well it gives them this really nice warm flavor and it's also perfect for fall so I'm gonna sprinkle all of this into our flour and then just whisk that together also that cinnamon smells really good too the next step is to work on our wet ingredients so the first thing I'm adding to my large mixing bowl here are two eggs that I've allowed to sit out at room temperature it always helps if all the ingredients are kind of at room temperature just so they incorporate together evenly find my two eggs I'm just gonna quickly whisk the eggs just to kind of break them up a little bit get things going and then to this I'm adding half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar and the nice thing about muffins or quick breads that I found is that you can adjust the amount of sugar that you use a little bit you don't have to use quite as much as a full cup of sugar if you don't want them to be as sweet you could probably get away with about 3/4 of a cup of sugar total and they would still be really good next I'm adding half a teaspoon of vanilla extract so just did a little splash also smells amazing and then one stick of unsalted butter that I melted and then allowed to cool just a little bit because of course you don't want to cook the eggs if you add it in super hot butter okay and then I'll whisk that all together so now we just have to incorporate our dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and the way we're going about this today is adding half of our flour mixture and then a cup of sour cream and then the rest of our flour mixture just so it all incorporates together evenly and for this process I'm going to switch over to a rubber spatula because it's just a little bit easier to work with as the batter thickens up [Music] [Music] my final ingredient is one cup of mixed berries so these were previously frozen and I allowed them to thaw a little bit just so that everything would separate and evenly dispersed in my batter this particular mixture is strawberries blueberries raspberries and blackberries they are so so delicious I buy my berries at Aldi and they're a really great price you could definitely substitute in some fresh berries but it's so great to have frozen berries in the freezer because you can make these year-round the other reason why I like to thaw my frozen berries is because sometimes especially with the strawberries there will be whole berries in the mix and that's a little bit too big for the muffins so that way I can easily cut them up into smaller pieces so that every muffin has a little bite of my mixed berries so next I'm gonna spray my 12 cups just basic muffin tin here with a little bit of baking spray you can also use those paper liners I just don't have any on hand today so it's just as easy to spray and it goes really fast I like to spray kind of in like a circular motion because you want to make sure it is well coated you want to be able to get the muffins out to enjoy them later and now I'm just gonna use my ice cream scoop to transfer my mixed berry muffin batter into my greased muffin tin [Music] this final step is totally optional but I have a little bit of cinnamon sugar here that I thought it would be fun to sprinkle all over the tops of my muffins so I'm going to do that and then my oven is preheated to 400 degrees and these are gonna bake for about 20 minutes [Music] my muffins baked for exactly 20 minutes and I did stick a toothpick inside and pull it out and there weren't any crumbs so I knew that they were cooked through my kitchen and home home smell incredible and now I get to give them a taste so so good see the steam coming off oh wow hmm you could definitely make these just with blueberries but I love using the mixed berries it's just like a warmer fruity or combination of ingredients I love it mmm that sour cream makes these muffins so moist I used to bake a different blueberry muffin recipe but then my sister shared this with me and I've never looked back because they are so moist and just flavorful and it's delicious nice and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside I think you and your kids are really gonna love these make sure you visit Jenn's channel when with Jen to check out her

selection of keto goodies so make sure you check them out down below in the description after this video thank you thrive market for the continued support on this channel as well all right we're going to jump right into it so with meat the first thing that i would recommend their organic ground beef is very very good and a very good value okay great grass fed great selection overall and really good quality i also recommend their bison if you can get that as well okay then the organic chicken breast is also a great find great price great overall value the real good bacon wrapped chicken this is technically in the frozen section so it's from the company called real good foods i'll show some footage so you can see where it is and what it looks like a very good clean profile ultimately and something that i would honestly recommend overall just as a good viable source of protein on keto the don lee farms chicken patties when it comes down to something that's pre-made pretty darn clean there's a few things in there i might be a little bit hesitant on to eat every day but overall great okay prosciutto de parma okay this is their parma ham their prosciutto which is in the refrigerated section as well their only ingredients are going to be ham and salt which makes it tremendous pork and salt center cut bacon if you go for the bacon go for their center cut bacon it's going to be a little bit cleaner it's going to be a little bit better fat profile and it's just the one that i usually lean towards in terms of flavor and overall effectiveness on my ketogenic diet anything in the egg category the kirkland organic pasture-raised eggs and remember i'm not a fan of eating tons and tons of eggs i have maybe three eggs every other day or so you don't come across pasture raised very often let alone organic and pasture raised so great tremendous value there the organic hard boiled eggs at costco phenomenal if you're breaking a fast just something on the go right then the three bridges egg bites these are the egg bites that are in the perishable section so they're along with like kind of the rotisserie chickens in that whole area great little on the go thing okay they're not like the starbucks egg bites that have a bunch of potato starch and stuff in them these are actually straight up eggs along with cottage cheese and a few other things then the egg thins the cropinis these are also in the refrigerated sort of perishable section tremendous to make a quesadilla with or anything like that they're just like a little thin that you can use as almost a like a tortilla i consider them eggs though because the primary constituent is eggs but also just to make things a little bit easier i'll put a downloadable version in the description that way you can just click on the link and i can give you a downloadable pdf version of this grocery list but i still think you should watch all this so that you actually see where the items are and learn why you're consuming them so there's a link down below you can just get a downloadable version in the description moving into the seafood category the bulk of what i recommend from costco seafood is actually in the frozen section because it's a lot more affordable and it's just flash frozen right when they catch it the kirkland tail on frozen shrimp the cooked ones not the not the raw okay so the kirkland cooked tail on frozen shrimp get the medium size then the kirkland wild halibut okay you can also get that in the frozen section very good value the chilean sea bass it's also either frozen or if you can get it fresh when it's on sale chilean sea bass is a great fatty acid profile and a very tremendous protein essential amino acid profile pacific cod if you go frozen route i know for a fact it's coming from a company called alaskan leader which does a very good job sourcing their cod in a very clean sustainable and very very health focused factor way and then we have wild sockeye salmon this one get fresh okay their sockeye salmon is great definitely lean into that at costco then for the oils and the fats okay the chosen foods avocado oil spray is a staple i always have it in my pantry okay then i have the kirkland extra virgin coconut oil it's like the big tub with the orange lid it is such a bang-up value for that so definitely lean into that one plus the taste is phenomenal uh the sports research brand mct oil it's over in the supplements section okay so it's with the protein powders and all of that marianne's avocado oil okay that is a very good avocado oil that actually passed the uc davis avocado oil scrutiny test okay last year they did this whole on study where they broke down a lot of different brands and debunked the fact that a lot of them weren't even pure olive oil mary anne's makes the cut and costco has it uh the kirkland brand extra virgin olive oil you want to get the dark bottle of the excuse me the mylopotamus okay so that is a specific region that's like the greek olive oil so i recommend that one it's a great value then when we go to the dairy we have kerrygold butter okay made from grass-fed grass finished cows okay which always helps a lot there's some question you know do they finish them on grass everything like that we don't really know but in the grand scheme of things you know they're still probably one of the best options that are out there and costco has them if you can get feta that is sheep feta 100 pure sheep's milk kirkland goat cheese okay they've got their own brand goat cheese there okay the folios cheese wraps these are like the tortilla-like cheese wraps they're in the perishable section not with the rest of the cheeses they're usually across the aisle but they are straight-up parmesan cheese and they're very good to just to make a quesadilla or to make some kind of wrap okay well you don't wanna make a quesadilla cause the whole thing will melt but if you made like a cold cheese wrap or something uh the kirkland brand peccarino romano which is aged goat cheese this stuff is the jam and that's a good price cacarino romano it's the best cheese that you can get as the most ketogenic friendly cheese in like a parmesan style fashion heavy cream do not go for half and half use heavy cream add that to your coffee instead the green mountain greek yogurt very high protein content low carbohydrate value which is great and then the optimum nutrition whey protein isolate the black and green bag 40 servings i hope you're not having like more than that a month okay i think this is more like a two-month supply this is going to be in the supplement area but i put it with dairy because it is after all dairy okay produce you may notice i don't have a lot of the costco produce because well i don't know i get a lot of my produce frozen and i don't know just don't have to get a whole lot there at costco the avocados are great though great value straight up avocados the kirkland brand broccoli florets that are in the frozen little cubicle you have to go into blueberries and raspberries lean into raspberries because they're lower carbohydrate and they have some tannins in them that actually slow the absorption of the carbohydrates in the first place making them a great keto fruit then there's a brand called the perfect bite that in the perishable section that is a pre-cooked brussels sprouts with apples and bacon the apples add some carbs to it but you can pull the chunks of apples out they're not the cheapest thing but they are a delicious treat and honestly a couple grams of carbs but it's worth it to just enjoy something good on keto like that it's so good and then the holy guacamole brand spelled like that w-h-o-l-l-y holy guacamole they have like these individual and also larger sized guacamole little packets okay it makes it super convenient then we move on down the list into the pantry items and the snacks now i know there's a few things in dairy and meat and stuff that i could have gone into detail but i'm trying to give you the basics so that you can just get this grocery grocery haul all done right and by the way i put a link down below also if you want to download this grocery list i'll give you like a printable version of it like i mentioned that way you can just download it and take it with you to the store okay then we have the seasoned brand sardines okay that's a very very good one they are the boneless skinless and olive oil they don't have an in water option but still very good chunk light tuna instead of albacore albacore has a higher mercury content the kirkland organic almond butter is a great choice as well as well as the nutso nutso is going to have some chia some flax things like that in it that give you a little bit more omega-3 and a little bit more soluble fiber so get the nutso if you can this is quite a bit more pricey then we got the kirkland brand pecans in the baking section okay pecans higher omega-3 content easier to digest as well as well as the kirkland walnuts okay organic peanut butter don't recommend peanut butter all the time but the kirkland brand is pretty darn good and no added sugar or no hydrogenated fats or anything the from hawaii brand dry roasted macadamia nuts the that's a an orange bag i don't see it anywhere and it's hit and miss okay you don't always find it though so lean into that if you can get that tremendous pulmonary acid profile the best nut that you can eat on keto next to a peely nut which is hard to get at most grocery stores cholula sauce i love me some cholula sauce tabasco also good to go and then victoria marinara okay there is no sugar added to this marinara so make yourself a bolognese cook up some of that ground beef that you got with this marinara okay then we also have the primal kitchen avocado oil mayonnaise which is great on keto none of that soybean oil none of that canola oil garbage raw cacao powder which they have in a big bag in the baking section as well and then kirkland hemp hearts the kirkland signature hemp hearts you can make these into like an oatmeal you can it's a perfect thing to have on kita just to give it a little bit of variety so mix that with some flax meal anyway it's just a great little thing to add to all kinds of different dishes then we have like the snacks using sparingly parmesan wisps those are delicious then we have the moon cheese okay the moon cheese is a pure cheese it's just a snack right it's just like these little hard balls of cheese really we have the dukes shorties which are little beef sticks but they don't have any carbs they only have like one or two carbs in them super low 4505 pork rind 6.69 for a huge bag of probably the best tasting pork rind definitely have to get yourself some of these they are so delicious and they are i can't even describe like it is a whole different world with pork rinds and they are rich in monounsaturated fats pork is a higher monounsaturated fat profile so actually a pretty good fat to have on keto then we have the miss jones brownie mix which is awesome this stuff is so dang good they have cornbread they have all these other ones but costco is carrying their brownie mix and then we also have the sea salt and caramel ice cream bars the keto ice cream bars in the frozen section go easy on these maybe have one or two a week but they definitely make the cut they're pretty darn clean they have some erythritol in them a few things but not bad at all okay so as always keep it locked here in my channel do not forget to check out thrive market to get some of this stuff delivered directly to your doorstep so you don't have to go to costco if you don't have to but also check out the downloadable version of this as well thank you for watching and i'll see

of no refined sugar and daily green smoothies so you'll see in this video what my weight is and with a picture of me I just got back from the gym and you can take a look at what I look like a little bit of pugs going on here I put on a few pounds in the last few months broke my tailbone recently so I haven't been exercising then kind of lazy sort of fell out of that routine anyway I guess like a lot of people I have a sweet tooth and giving up sugar I've done it before but I could never really keep it long-term and I'm definitely a sucker for sugary sweets and I know a lot of you are as well so one of the things that I'm going to try is the nature wild berry so this is the product here and you can see that if you look really closely they're very halves and you only need about half theory it's really really great the first thing I did the first thing I ate was a strawberry and that sort of sour acid taste is completely eliminated and it was like eating a strawberry that had been marinating and some kind of sugar syrup for about two days it was really really really sweet so I'm hoping this will help me cut down on some more unhealthy habits that I have I've got a couple of organic cucumbers I like to always wash things before I my tooth we're smoothing or whatever you want to do I'm going to start with a couple of cucumber let's charge so I can I like to rinse everything home throw it into carrot one of the reasons that I wanted to make the juice right here in front of you is so that you can see that there's no additives no preservatives no sort of trickery and I'm actually just take a sip of this stuff before I eat the very few connections see how it works first time red kale you can see all beautiful purple lines and that's a long looks I think I'm going to need another glass make sure that we have everything healthy my daughter Sin Eater apple slices okay so it's so good I haven't turned brown nothing major and I go the arms with you this looks disgusting I have no idea how people do this so smells very earthy and yeah so we'll see what happens it's got a very little tiny bit of sweetness from the apple juice and the carrot but it's pretty bad for me to drink this whole thing I don't think I could do it oh yeah um that's not gonna work it's just like oh I'm gonna try this other one actually that has more apple in it too and that just tastes like really horrible apple juice like apple juice is gone horribly bad so at this point I'm going to grab one of the berries and I'm only going to eat one half right there what you want to do is you want to put at your mouth and sort of under freeze-dried so you kind of want to let the saliva melt a little bit and sort of coat your tongue and see how it goes from there so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to put my mouth I'm your weight as you can see nothing's happened it's the same drink that I just made right in front you and I will give you my honest opinion so oh my god um I can definitely drink this a big difference it's almost because it's so frothy I don't know if you can see on the top um it's almost like a bit of a milkshake it's very very sweet so ah Wow it's um it's very intense so I'm just gonna drink this and I could choke this easily and it's very very very very sweet um I'm shocked I taste like um apple juice I mean you can still get a little bit of the earthy taste from the the kale and the chard and the carrots but the apple juice it tastes like the same principle that I have the strawberries the Apple tastes like it's been sitting in some kind of very sugary syrup so it tastes um again like a very earthy apple juice with a very high sugar content it's unreal oh so I can definitely drink this this other one that has more apple in it that was a bit more tolerable Wow oh that's like drinking um you know what this one actually reminds me of ism you know um when my norm would make like Apple brown Betty with the brown sugar and this is really this is almost too sweet for me it's like this one is much better mmm and I can easily finish this no problem so these little things are quite magical nature's wild berries so again you can take a look at my progress through my Fitbit and I'll be charting what I eat if you want a more detailed explanation nation to sort of see how the 30-day journey goes this is day one I'm hoping that it works out really well hey again mind blowing have a very and this is it's like drinking a very sugary um juice like if somebody had tried to sell a health drink but put tons of sugar this is basically what it could be still again you have that earthy flavor but it's fantastic so hmm this I could do every morning no problem cucumbers to that cucumber taste is just BAM so I'm going to try different recipes and you guys can take a look and see roughly what I did I don't have too many quantities because I realize not everyone's into juicing some people prefer smoothies but if you just want to get an idea of the quality of the taste what it's like if I come across something that just isn't working I'll be sure to tell I'll be sure to let you know that maybe the taste wasn't greatest but so far this one yeah I could do one of these a day so sorry I'm just chugging that's right after my workout is done before the berry I don't think I could have done that be sure to like nature's wild berry on Facebook and on LinkedIn and on Instagram and Twitter and hopefully I'll see you next time have a good one everybody stay healthy", "VhRPlczHTqU": "today Kevin and I are gonna be trying these Welch's a fruit and yogurt sinaitic I've never seen them before and then we were in Target and I spot them they were to nineteen out of I you do not that cheap but it feels like you get over there and they might have been out for a while and I've just never seen it before and they may have other flavors as well these are just the chewy picked up I have these strawberry blueberry and they are made with real fruit surrounded by eye yogurt and they're low-fat gluten free it says 20 pieces are 110 calories thank you and they are made in New Jersey Allendale New Jersey and they have a refillable baggage I really like mmm smells really good they're smaller than I would have thought there's 20 pizzas though yeah they're they're very very small they're but doesn't yeah I guess I'm flying in an airplane chocolate or are skittles or something like a good soft mm-hmm no I was expecting a little toughness like a little chewing up stuff gummy those are much softer mm-hmm that's all for hitting up the strawberry flavor is actually pretty strong mm-hmm mark those I'm not a younger person because I don't like sour that's not sour at all that's what we really go and that tastes like candy I mean you can eat that you could eat 20 of those before you know it those are really really good 15 grams of sugar they're very good well you open that up wait a lot we don't do that drink hi they lead to the blueberry ones in the same calories on 4/20 yeah and you can tell the strawberry and when you see the picture of the end the strawberry Oh red the blueberry are literally glowing weirdly same side mm-hmm thanks Sam strong smell very very good very strong blueberry those are good very strong well they knocked us over better yes the blueberry too strong for you know to see you like the final flavor of the strawberry hmm whatever you want to get them together that could be interesting yeah a strawberry and a blueberry meddlesome it does to kind of get true a little bit yeah and they might have a mixed fruit don't mix very they really go when you when you mix them they don't have like you would think that the blueberry says it's so strong would be like a more prominent and it's not it's a good all-around berry flavor but those are good bad I don't really like those a lot I have they much you see the picture you'll see that it's like the berry has been wrapped in this white yogurt coating but you can see the balloons and the read through it like a little sorry which is exactly what it shows yeah and it's perfectly glue in there these arms like a jelly bean well they're a little smaller though I mean they're small they're tiny little things so and what I will do is I will they're only inherent in calories so I wouldn't double that so that I can eat like 40 pieces and only have 220 calories so it's supposed to give you they're supposed to be seven and a half servings in the bag so it you know it'll be half that for me but that's how it happens 30 drinks I really like these though and I will definitely keep so many candy though yeah so I hope you enjoyed the review if you have seen other flavors please let us know because we truly don't know we just stumbled upon these and and they may be new I don't know they don't say new so but I hope you enjoyed the review and thanks for watching [Music]", "Z1JMUkfdIJA": "and it starts right now what starts right now the Black Friday sale did you already push that yeah what's the big deal you know Black Friday's not till next week next week yeah it's not a leap year or something like that nope well it's the power gloves fault then I didn't do it hey guys welcome to gear tasting today we're gonna talk about something that everybody has issues with with and that's keys so keys may not be the sexiest topic but I think it's worthwhile and it's one that I have kind of been chasing the dream on for many years now so I've been dealing with some way shape or form of key management for years and trying to perfect what I like to carry and what works for me and that's what I wanted to share with you today so I've pretty much bought everything on the market there is four key management kind of a nerd about organizing keys and the best solution that I've came up with so far is a product called the key smart I've been through a lot of different things we've written articles on ETS about this kind of stuff before - everything from the like the XO tack free key system to key smarts to the original blade key which was an old Kickstarter project that we had done an article on a while back and I've even tried out kind of some of the newer stuff on the market like a key bar so there's no there's nothing wrong with any of these products just to put that out there it really is what works for you so that's what I'm gonna talk about today is what's worked for me so far so this is what I started off with XO tech came out with the freaky system which we sell a night es I think it's a great product I stand behind it too because I use it for other things so they came out with a free key system which is which are these little small rings attached to a larger ring which is no new concept in in key management but what they developed was this this kind of patented technology it's almost like a I don't know what you call it kind of like a clamshell opening so they developed a way to take traditional keyring and basically make a little arch in one of the sections so that it's easy to open it up like this and get your keys out so I find that very easy and I use that for a long time but you still kind of have the jingle jangle of keys and it can be bulky in your pocket with you know kind of an unlimited amount of keys what I like about some of these management systems like the blade key and key bar and key smart is that it kind of forces you to tone down your key chain so it really makes you focus on well do I really need that key do I really have to carry that around with me every day so you know I went I mean these are not my keys but I went from something that was probably even bigger than this you know and the amount of keys that I was carrying to something streamlined and small like this and as you can maybe see from this I'm like you smart I've taped up my keys because I know how you guys do on the Internet you know you're gonna copy my keys and try to break into my [ __ ] so anyway that's what I did but this is how I carry my keys so you know I have my main fob key which is my to my FJ Cruiser on you know kind of the end of this this key system so it's not integrated with all the other keys because it would never fit you know when you have something that has an unlock button and a remote on it you know obviously it's too bulky for you know anything even like the blade key or the key bar that's just it's just not gonna fit so you have to have some other way of carrying that type of key and this is what I found works best for me so with the the key smart they give you this little bar right there and I feel I feel like it fits really well with one of the small inner rings of the key smart so that's what I use on that so I use that X attack free key system I said key smart free key system and I use one of those smaller rings too to make that liaison between my car key and the main keys but what I keep coming back to is that I like the key smarts profile it's really super small it's it takes up virtually no width in terms of the keys that you put in it so you know when you make your little key sandwich with what you want to carry around with you it you know you can see that they've got these little small their own they're not even rubber they're like a composite material but those are the little gaskets that fit between the keys super small and you have them stacked between shared keys which gives you a little bit of an offset when you put this kind of carriage bolt system together on that so I think it's called a carriage bolt I can't remember it's called something different anyway sorry someone's gonna tell me out there but once you put these together it gives you a nice way to kind of move your keys around like this and they kind of fillet open in this regard so you can access each one of your keys and I like this because you can kind of set the tension yourself on these you can go back to the key smart - and put a drop of you know a lot like blue loctite or something on it to keep it from spinning out because I do find myself constantly reaching into my pocket and you know pulling out a little tool here and actually tightening that up so that's kind of its that that's the titanium pocket tool - it's also a little razor blade so I like that I've got a little flat-head screwdriver on that because I find myself using it all the time to tighten that up and like I said I could put lock down on it but you know it makes it easy to kind of change the adjustment on it which I like - so and also like that as I when I have these in here the two keys that I use most are kind of offset from each other so you know I kind of flip these open apart from each other so pushing up this side Oh actually flips up that side and vice versa you know I can kind of get to my keys easily that way too by just pushing different ways on the on the key smart so that's what keeps me coming back to this as my preferred method so the blade key there's certainly nothing wrong with that either like I said I carry one around with me for a long time and the blade keys nice because as you stack your keys in here you can kind of do that same thing you know you can flip them up like that but I just found this to be kind of bulky when I put the keys that I wanted in here and and kind of manage that I mean I've been I was carrying a Blakey for a long time all the way from there you know prototype version that they had they had a zip tie that used to run through here so that was I feel that was one of the first key management devices that was really on the market in terms of like a fob type device to store keys on was the blade key and you know experimental with the key bar - for a while and there's there's certainly nothing wrong with them I think that they're a great option they have a lot of different customization options for the key bar but you know I kept coming back to the bulk - so I feel you know my personal opinion I feel like the key bar is a little more bulky than the key smart which led me to keep coming back to this I'm I'm kind of a lightweight junkie - so I like to kind of count ounces because ounce is equal pounds and pounds equal pain so I kind of keep that in mind - and I'm I'm looking at stuff so and you know this is not a huge promotional thing - because I feel like each one of these products by themselves has their own merits but since I kind of settled on the key smart after my years of you know messing around with this stuff we started to get some key smarts customized - so now we have these with the little IPS logo on them - if you were interested in picking them up they're launching today actually on the site but I've wanted to do something on key management for a long time and you know this this product offering with key smarts been been a long time coming so it's a it's kind of an interesting it's kind of been an interesting road with with getting these key smarts so anyhow that's kind of the gist of the offering here with with with the key management systems one thing I want to mention too is that I used to or I still carry around kind of a USB device on my keys - this is a I don't know how you pronounce this LaCie la CIE I guess that's how you said but that's what I use for a USB Drive so I carry that around as in a key slot - which I like because it means that I always have a USB Drive on me if I need it you know with Apple now changing their computers over to pure Thunderbolt or what is that USB 3 or C USB C so you know that may not be an option anymore but for now I have an upgrade so I've still got access to USBs and the words the world kind of still operates on USB so you know there's many different options out there for little USB sticks on a in a key size so that would be my recommendation - is picking something like that up - if if you like having that data storage on your key device hey guys next thing I want to talk about is the fee we have been partnering with them for quite a while to offer a selection of nutritious delicious snacks free to sample and that's what the feeds good at so working with them over the past few years I've curated a couple of boxes of content from them of snacks that you can try out so I revamp that from time to time as you know my taste change I like to experiment with new snacks and things like that too so from time to time I'll build a new iteration of our box we call it like the fuel for adventure so what I have today is kind of the newest iteration of what I've kind of hand selected to to appear in this so the feed kind of sent us this so you could check it out they had to send me another box with the contents because I ate them all on the last one so that's kind of how I get through what I want to put into the new one so first off I want to mention this is a Camelback podium bottle and if you enter the code welcome if you pick up one of our boxes it's linked below but you can get a free Camelback bottle if you want one of those too so I like to kind of break this down into a couple of different things that did I do when I select this kind of stuff I am outside doing different different events and hiking and things like that too so you know I like to I like to make sure that I always have you know kind of protein and snacks and things like that with me to kind of help get me through and that's where kind of the feed steps in I've always just enjoyed this kind of stuff too so in the past we've had you know I've was really big on Stinger waffles for a while I've been huge on perfect food bars for a long time too and and just anything that kind of provides nutrition out in the field and things like that too so that's kind of what I selected a buddy of mine turned me on to these rx bars I've been really enjoying these for a while now so I wanted to make sure I include those this was a new flavor I hadn't tried yet this is called mint chocolate it's actually really good some of the others that they make on these rx bars are not as flavorful but I did enjoy this one more than others it's kind of why I selected it too and then we've got some I'm kind of a big I like to say energy juice but I really like gummy stuff so I'm a big fan I like Haribo gummy bears and I don't I try not to eat them because I will eat all of them guys that mustard bribed me this year on the FTX with some Haribo gummy bears i don't know how they found out that i like gummy bears but that's what they used to bribe me and they might have helped them out a little bit they didn't wind up winning but you know anyway it did help them in their event so these are the scratch fruit drop Caesar Energy Chews these are orange but they have other flavors too I like different I like the other different flavors that they have as well there's like wild berry and things like that I'm more of a berry kind of flavor guy so even though these are orange you can select different stuff so basically before I get too far into this our whole box offering that we have this is like 35 bucks for all this which i think is a pretty good deal and you after you kind of see everything that I have in here as a sampling you'll kind of see that you get a wide selection of different stuff to try and then you can kind of figure out whether you like that kind of stuff and then go back and pick those items up individually or so on and so forth or pick them up even at the store if you find them so like I said I originally liked the honey stinger waffles but there's been so many different waffle brands on the market now I think kind of playing off the success of what honey stingers done and there's like Rip Van waffles there's these Dutch waffles there's even these stroopwafels from goo now so I wanted to kind of check them all out to see what else was on the market and how they tasted I really loved this coconut waffle for some reason I'm kind of a big coconut person Kelly doesn't really like coconut she thinks it's gross she doesn't like coconut but I'm a big coconut guy so yeah I like it a lot and there's a blueberry waffle which I thought was pretty good and this is just a wild berry flavor so put all those in there so you could kind of try those out too I think they're pretty good this was interesting this was a kind of a pack of coffee that they had kind of for the field so I've been making I've made coffee like camp coffee sometimes too and I whipped this up in the jet pool and it's actually pretty good I have a little French press insert for the Jetboil which I've got something coming up in a future gear tasting because I'm starting to assemble my gear that I'll be taking to that man the sniper challenge again and and coffee is obviously a big concern to me out in the field you know I kind of like coffee so and today I'm drinking Spartan coffee but this was something that I like this gyeo by little red wagon is kind of an individual serving a coffee and I French press one of these and it was pretty good so I've included that too and then these are bars or these they're kind of a natural foods bar there I was reading alongside granola bar that's what was I enjoy those two I like granola and oatmeal and stuff like that some guys don't like that some people don't but I do which is why I kind of have this oatmeal in here too it's really weird eating oatmeal from one of these things it's kind of a kind of a weird texture thing but overall I think it tastes really good it's apple cinnamon oatmeal and you know suck in oatmeal through a straw isn't really everybody's dream when they're out in the field but hey it's a it's nutritious and I like it then I've also got I like these energy gels from time to time to sometimes throw a couple of these in my pack if I'm doing something strenuous like riding a bike or you know kind of hiking a long distance I'll down one of these about every 45 minutes kind of helps keep my energy up I like those a lot and then I've also included these fig bars I'm I like I guess with it what were they fruit Newton's I kind of grew up with those and these are kind of like a healthier version of fruit Newton's so put those in there as well and then what comes included in a little bag here because it's kind of temperature sensitive is a perfect foods bar and I know I've told the story of these before but I started eating these when they were selling them in San Diego out of a little plastic ziplock bag I mean they were kind of making these out of their house whoever invented these the perfect foods company but they think they were called perfect foods bars back then now it's just perfect more but this is the fruit and nut which that's one of their original recipes from way back in the days was like circa 2004 I guess is when I started munching on those so now they're kind of available everywhere they're in like the the refrigerated section of grocery stores even but feed has them and they ship them in those kind of protected things I think they're delicious so and then I wanted to start trying like a protein from the feed too because they offer that a lot too so I was start to experiment with like this whey protein I'm a big whey protein person I don't like getting into some of the other things like creatine and crap like that Isis tend to tick whips tend to stick with protein powders that are natural like ways and stuff like that too but I'll make shakes in the morning sometimes and I'd dump a little bit of protein into that this is obviously kind of a single-serving but I used like a tablespoon at a time when I make a shake in the morning so one of these lasts me longer than that and then last but not least you either love it or you hate it but this is salmon jerky and I think it was pretty good I don't know I think by the time I kind of ate through the whole package I was I was kind of ready to be done with salmon jerky but at the same time it was delicious I'm a big fish eater so that was that was pretty good to me and I wanted to try it and I think you might like it too all right guys thanks for watching your

some fresh raspberries some blackberries blueberries they're nice big blueberries and some small little wild Maine blueberries so we've got a nice variety here berries so what we're going to do is we're gonna we've already washed rinsed and washed off our berries so they're all ready to go right into the pot and this is a really simple quick easy recipe one that I use for most of my jellies that's super easy so all you're going to need is your berries and I've got about ten cups here so this is a bigger batch you can cut this down definitely so you're gonna need your berries you're gonna need some sugar whatever sugar that you like to use some pectin whatever kind you use I use the dry and the liquid whatever I have on hand you're also going to need jars ring and I just picked these up at this store we noticed this year they came out excuse me ball came out with some new lids these are called sure tight and if you look at the back you can see these are good for 18 months you can assess store seal jars in pantry for up to 18 months so these are six months longer than the previous lids that they had before so I can I am a hundred percent positive this jelly is not gonna last eighteen months in this house so but if it did they would be safe with these lids and and I'm sure they would go a little bit longer to but that's what their new lids ours for 18 months so they're always changing it excuse me so always check and make sure if there's anything different you don't use them differently you don't have to do anything different to them just want to make sure they're clean before you put them on you gonna need some jar tongs a funnel masher and a ladle to get it into your jar so all we're gonna do is we're gonna take our berries we'll get started real quick here we're just gonna take our berries and dump them right into the pot pretty simple and we're gonna use our masher and we're gonna mash these down a little bit I'm not sure where my tripod is I share it with my husband and son so not really sure where it went - can't seem to locate it this morning so we're just gonna get these cooking and we're gonna mash them with our potato masher and just to get the juices flowing and we don't want them whole in the jelly we want them a little mash top so mmm that's it so we're gonna get this up up to temperature where I'm gonna put it on high to get started I'm gonna stay right with it so once we get this bubbling and mash down a little bit I will bring you back when we're ready for the next step all right so our Jam is just starting to boil it's boiling for a couple minutes and we've just been smashing it away we've still got some chunks in there but we're gonna take part of this out and put it in a food mill because this is so so seedy as you can see it's super seedy and I love the seeds in it but my family does not so where I'm gonna take some of these out so I don't have to eat all this Jam although I would eat all this Jam and I'd be very happy about it but I feel like I have to share with the rest of my family you know sometimes you got to do that but so we're gonna take this we're gonna take about half of our jam and put it through the food mill and the other half and we're gonna leave because some seeds are okay for my family and I I just love seeds alright so we've got about half out oh this is getting steamy so we've got it in the food mill and I can't really turn this but as you turn this it presses all the juices out as you can see it's going down in the bottom so I'm just gonna run this through the food mill and then I'll bring you back together tie them back up to a boil and we are going to add our sugar and so this is so pretty seedy but my family will be ok with this as long as it's not the full seeds because then it's super CD so we have measured out 6 cups of sugar and we're just going to dump that right in to go with our 10 cups of berries and we are gonna have a big pot of jam here so we're just going to cook this down once all that sugar is nice and melted in there we're going to let this we're going to bring it back to a boil and we're gonna let it cook for when we let it boil for about 10 minutes so I will bring you back once we're ready for the next step well we have our jam cooking down it's almost coming up to a boil right now but while we're doing that I am getting my can't my water back in or out and get my jar nice and hot and ready in there and also I'm getting my lids in warm water you do not have to bring these to a boil you don't have to simmer I mean just cover them with hot water and all you're doing is making this seal kind of rubbery and I think the Box even says you know just use them out of the box but I like to put them in hot water makes me feel like they're clean and it's how I've always done it I just put it on low and it just keeps them nice and warm so I know they're clean and sterilized and I got my jars I put my jars right in my canner and so everything is heated up together I'll just pull my jars out when it's time to fill them up so now we've got this back to a boil we're gonna let it boil for about ten minutes and I will bring you back in ten minutes this is just gonna help that sugar get all melted and make sure it's all completely melted and start thickening up our jam that's all this has been boiling for about ten minutes and you can see around the edges it's starting to get a little foamy what I do is put a tablespoon of butter in and that will help take care of the phone we're just gonna melt that down in there and it will help reduce the foam and so you don't have to skim so much on sometimes you don't have to skim anything off it depends on the jam so but we're just gonna melt that down and then we are going to add our while that's melting I'm gonna get the pectin and get that ready so we can put that I'm using this liquid pectin from share gel I don't always use this sometimes I use the powdered it just whatever you have whatever is handy but hey pokey Oh puppy likes to talk so we're just gonna mix this and really good get it all in there and mix it in really good and we're gonna bring it back to a boil because this is gonna stop boiling once I get it mixed in just for a minute and we're gonna let this boil for about three or four minutes maybe five and then we're gonna test our gel our jam and see if it's ready and cooking for about four minutes with the pectin in it and it's starting to get thick so I'm gonna give this a quick test and I'm just gonna take a little tablespoon and I'm gonna put some on a plate just a little bit like that and we're going to for one minute and see the consistency one minute will give it enough to tell us how thick the jelly is we're just pulling our jam out of the freezer and we're just gonna take our plate all I do is I take my plate and I tip it sideways and see how fast the GM runs and that Jam is sticking there you can see me see if I can get this in better light but if you hold the plate right up like that see how fast the jam runs and that is gonna be some serious Jam alright so we're gonna pop this off we're gonna turn the heat off we're gonna pull our jars out of the canner we're gonna fill them up get our lids and rings on and get this baby cannon okay so he's done and we're gonna put it in the jars you can see here that the foam is all gone from that little bit of butter you don't have to do that you can skim the foam off but you really don't want the foam in your jars so all we're gonna do is fill up our jaws and I'm using 8 ounce jars cuz that works for us we like to really have a variety of jellies when we're eating it so one jar last a little while gives everybody a couple servings so and then we um and then we switched to a different kind so we grab like a different kind every time cuz you know one of the most important steps now that we've got our jars filled and I've left about a half inch headspace which is what I normally use for jellies I'm gonna take a wet paper towel or cloth and we're gonna wipe this rim and you can see I got some Jam on there so anything on this rim is gonna can it can mess up your seal so you just want to take a wet cloth and just give every rim a quick wipe and get all that jam off because you know even though you use a funnel some it sticks to the funnel and you drip it and I'm a slob when I cook I can't help it and that's just the way it is but the kitchen always looks like a bomb went off when I got done when I get done cooking anything so we are just wiping all our rims and we're gonna put our lids on we got our nice warm lids I'm gonna put that right on and put our rims rape ring on and we're just going to do those finger tight and then we're gonna pop them right in the canner and process them for 10 minutes in a water bath okay I'm out of the canner it was in there for 10 full minutes while it scan while it's processing which helps create that vacuum seal the boiling water and so it'll keep your jams good for up to 18 months with the new lids which is nice so I'll be right back once this is cooled down I'll come back and I'll show you the consistency of this Jam because you know I want to taste some p.m. all cooled down and it is ready to go and we're just gonna take a little bit out and put it on an English muffin cuz I love some jam on an English muffin and this is such a nice consistency it's really nice and thick it's got quite a bit of seeds and then not too bad but it's nice Jam mm-hmm yummy if you liked this video give us a

trip down memory lane and enjoy this list of the\ntop 10 snacks that will take you back to the 90s bite my butterfinger\ntricks yogurt yogurt is amazing why have i never tried yogurt you may have been\nmore familiar with its cereal counterpart but trixx yogurt holds its\nown as a snack staple for 90s kids everywhere the gimmick for\ntrixx yogurt was the fact that it had two different flavors that you could mix\nand the corresponding colors would swirl together vanilla yogurt is good\nbut pair it with a blueberry yogurt and both of them taste even better\nthe commercials for trixx yogurt way back when made it seem like swirling the\ntwo flavors together would hypnotize your enemies and enter you and your\nfriends into a yogurt-flavored alternate dimension\nbut what actually happened was much more anticlimactic\nthe darker of the two colors would overpower the lighter one causing it to\nlook more like a muddled mess than a fun spiral of color\nthis looks like barf even so the flavors would still combine nicely and taste\ngood together even though the yogurt appeared\nradioactive in color the mild flavor and fun colors made it good for lunch time\nat school but the street cred you'd get when\npulling out a trix yogurt definitely wouldn't hold a candle to some of the\nother entries on this list though the yogurt itself may not have\ntasted like anything special the commercials that were shown on saturday\nmornings have definitely made an impression that will stick with 90s kids\nforever fruit roll-ups do you think we talk\nabout our relationship enough yeah do we have any fruit roll-ups all\nthe cool kids at the lunch table in elementary school had these tangy sweet\ndelights so it's no wonder that they've made\ntheir impression on those who grew up in the era in which they were at the peak\nof their popularity if you've never had a fruit roll up\nbefore it's pretty hard to describe what these snack oddities really\nare sticky fruit-flavored strips that were rolled onto a waxy paper in a\nspiral shape when you unwrapped them they'd have\nprinted patterns on the inside that would transfer to your tongue if you\nstuck them there first sold in 1983 fruit roll-ups\noriginally came in four different flavors\nstrawberry apricot apple and cherry since then they've expanded to include\nflavors such as strawberry kiwi lemon lime and cola\nwhat's cola poison water considering that last one it's hard to believe that\nmothers accepted this snack food as a fruity and nutritious\noption to put in their kids lunch bags fruit roll-ups were a unique and fun\nsnack when they were introduced and created an entirely new genre of\nsnack alongside other fruity trailblazers\nfruit roll-ups fruit by the foot and gushers were all part of this family\nyou kids still eat a lot of sugar sticky tangy snacks that weren't your average\nfruit gummies but weren't really candy either luckily betty crocker still\nmakes fruit roll-ups so you can pick some up during your next\ntrip to the grocery store and try them for yourself if you're\nlooking to relive some of your childhood memories planters\ncheese balls you know what'll cheer you up a cheese ball\neverything about the way the planters cheese balls were packaged made it a\ngood snack from the fact that they came in a\nconvenient little can that protected the contents inside from going stale to the\nmr peanut pictured on the label who was adorably unfitting to represent cheese\nballs as a mascot you look like mr peanut fans of this\nsnack declare that it's the best cheese ball available on the market claiming\nthat the cheesy flavor blows utz's rendition of cheese balls out of the\nwater luckily you can still find them online\nthe planter's cheese balls are available on amazon not only in their original\nflavor but in white cheddar and nacho flavors\nas well they've even added a new blazin hot\nvariation if you're in the mood for something spicy\nkeep it splashy oh yeah they'll arrive in bulk\ntoo with most flavors selling in packs of 12.\nenough to tide you over until the next time you decide to make an impulsive\namazon purchase better grab them before they're\ngone cosmic brownies would go into space\nfinding one of these at the bottom of your lunchbox was like finding buried\ntreasure cosmic brownies along with other little\ndebbie snack cakes made their mark in the 90s as the\nperfect snacks to share with friends during picnics or play dates\nthese sweets have a brownie base sprinkled with multi-colored chocolate\nchips wow chocolate with sprinkles\nmy favorite sure they might not have been anything other than candy coated\nchocolate but any cosmic brownie enthusiast will tell you that those\nchocolate chips make a world of difference in how they taste\nchances are you thought these arguably average brownies were out of this world\nas a kid thanks to the way little debbie marketed\nthem but the magic of cosmic brownies has still managed to persist today\neating one now will not only satisfy your sweet tooth\nbut take you back to the days where you'd beg your mom to buy a box of these\nwhenever you took a trip to the grocery store\nas an attempt to market themselves little debbie's cosmic cupcake\na cream-filled cousin of the brownie we know and love actually went to space in\n2014 as a marketing campaign houston we have a problem the cupcake\nwas attached to a weather balloon which was equipped with gopro cameras and a\ngps system people anticipated that the cupcake\nwould climb up to 98 000 feet in the air essentially sending\nit to space who knew the cosmic marketing ploy would\nactually grow to live up to its name butterfinger bbs nobody\nbetter lay a finger on my butterfinger although the og butterfinger bar is\nstill around today nothing will beat these snack\nsized bites of chocolate and flaky peanut butter that were all over the\nplace in the 1990s whether you ate them simply because you\nliked butterfinger or because you saw bart simpson eat them on tv\nsomething about making an already tasty candy bar bite size made it all the more\ntempting and delicious the one downside of the butterfinger bbs\nseemed to be their ridiculously low melting point\nyou could have a pack of them in your pocket for just a few minutes and they\nwould be a drippy and chocolatey mess as soon as you tried to eat one you've\ngot chocolate all over your face like a child but you're an adult\nadorable butterfinger discontinued them in 2006\nand the reaction from fans was overwhelmingly negative the bbs have\nmade countless entries on lists of snack foods people\nwished were brought back from the dead and there was even a petition made by\nfans of the chocolate snack to resurrect the butterfinger bbs\nalthough the bbs won't be returning anytime soon you can still get their\nmovie cedar equivalent butterfinger bites online or in some\nstores shark bites who wants a shark\neach package contained different fruit flavors that corresponded to the species\nof shark if you ate these at the lunch table in\nthe 90s you probably bragged to your friends about what colors and species\nyou got especially if you got your hands on the\nfeatured special species the great white sharks are the ones most\nkids will remember fondly but shark bites also had special pieces that\nlooked like sharks teeth and could be placed over your own teeth if you wanted\nto play around with them before eating them\nshark tooth the tigers maybe the great white sharks didn't last\nforever though they disappeared along with the other flavors when betty\ncrocker agreed not to use artificial colors in their products\nfood coloring the most poisonous substance known to robots\nthe correspondence of flavors to different types of sharks made eating\nshark bites a uniquely educational and fun experience and the taste of the\nfruit snacks themselves was different from similar ones on the market\nalthough you can still find them today if you look hard enough online\nthe flavors and recipe of shark bites have changed\nmaking them a lot different from the bites you knew and\nloved in the 1990s string thing i now present to you super string\nstring thing consisted of thin spaghetti-like strands of fruit-flavored\nsticky stuff that was formed into kid-friendly shapes\nto eat it you'd have to peel the string and if you wanted to take full advantage\nof the occasion slurp it up like you would with your\nspaghetti at dinner time slurp spaghetti this made it super messy\nand inconvenient to eat but that would be overshadowed by the\nfun experience that came with eating it string thing made it clear that in the\n1990s kids snacks placed more of an emphasis on\nentertainment value than nutritional value\nplaying with your food may be considered taboo now but\nit's all anyone ever did at the lunch table in elementary school\nespecially if a string thing was involved even though they probably\nweren't healthy and always got stuck in your teeth the\nstring thing has still managed to wiggle its way into the hearts of anyone who\nused to eat it although some news sources have reported\nto find dupes of the string thing for sale online\nit doesn't seem like there are any that can be bought from amazon in 2020.\n30 years later it's pretty safe to say that stringy fruit spaghetti\nis better off remaining a memory than making a comeback\nflavor ice freeze pops nothing a popsicle can't fix\nwhether you ate them at your school's field day or on a hot afternoon at\nsummer camp freeze pops remain a fond memory in the\nmind of anyone who grew up in the 1990s the composition is super basic but\nsuper effective a sugary juicy base that when frozen makes a refreshingly cold\nsnack to munch on in the summer you couldn't really get\nfull from eating only freeze pops but they'd be tasty and cold enough for you\nto want to pop open more of them anyways you must have some more they also came\nin a variety of flavors orange lemon lime berry punch and\nstrawberry to name a few no matter which flavor you got though\neach one tasted really good a rarity among fruit flavored kids\nsnacks although these frozen delights were a highlight at any block party in\nthe 1990s they're still sold nearly everywhere in\nsummertime proving that keeping it simple is a\nsurefire way to stay in business deceptively simple yet elegant picking\nup a box may seem like a good idea but don't expect any crazy flashbacks to\nyour childhood immediately the almost magical experience of opening\nup a neighbor's cooler and seeing it filled to the brim with ice-cold freeze\npops is kind of lost when you have to freeze them yourself\nif you're a die-hard fan of these though it may be worth picking up a box and\npassing along your childhood experience to someone who might not have had the\npleasure of enjoying one of these before with huge boxes of these

and before we get into this I feel like I need to address up front like I know that there's gonna be somebody swinging in to the comments well actually sure Quito use a French term for horse meats and cafes well I know I know but the modern usage of the term can also be applied to just a platter of cured meats and cheeses and a bunch of other stuff so we're not going to get nitpicky about the name we're just gonna make something awesome that we can share with people we care about [Music] so what I want to do today is basically just show what I feel are some very important and great things to add to a charcuterie board that you are making for company or even for yourself I'm gonna do a few different sizes some small ones and big ones and just put some things together but I wanted to show you different types of stuff that you want to have represented in a charcuterie platter because what makes a good one is the variety you want sweet you want salty you want some fat you want something to cut through the fat a little bit of you know sharpness something pickled brined stuff like that so let's start here this is our pickled and brined tray so we have just some basic things of course olives always always a great thing I always have olives on my shorts pretty sharp cutter eboard there's a lot of different types that you can use the Castelvetrano olive is really gaining in popularity it's a green olive but doesn't taste like a green olive it's very very briny salty delicious and of course Greek olives Greek green olives and kalamata olives those are a little bit more potent those I also very much love one thing I will say with olives is either have all of your olives pitted or none of them pitted you don't want somebody to grab and pit it olive and eat it then grab another one assuming it's pitted by it into it and rip their teeth apart along with the pickled and brined and I mean obviously some gherkins and I found a brand of gherkin that's not like super sweet but it's more just salty tastes like a regular olive I'll link it in the the post for this but I'm hooked on them I can't stop eating them the next thing that I always have to have represented is some kind of crunch and you can do this a couple different ways of course there's crackers classic baguette which is really really great I always try and have some kind of gluten-free cracker if I'm doing this for a really large group especially these flax crackers really really great nuts are an awesome option as well and for me you know every once in a while I do about of keto and during those times chicharones I don't have the right accent to say that I'll just say pork rinds that's the American breed and cured meats can't get away from that of course we got sopressata which is a little bit more fatty and a salami also pepperoni classic I never make one or I would say rarely make one without prosciutto that's my favorite uh-huh timeout shoo break so good fruit also another great thing to add berries are awesome and then whatever is seasonal you know grapes are usually you know you can find good grapes most of the time but like right now peaches plums really really great pairs will be coming up as well as pomegranates [Music] I love a good mix of treat of cheese and I try and have a good ratio of meat to cheese but having a mix of something that's creamy something that's soft and spreadable of something a little more hard but still easy to eat which is like this is manchego right here that is my favorite charcuterie hard cheese because it's not super hard holds together really well but it doesn't crumble and fall apart like a parmesan wood and then you have like if you want a blue cheese do something like a Stilton which is a little bit harder won't fall apart or be creamy and sticky then we have specialty cheese's this is tete de moi I don't know how to say it but it's a French cheese very potent and so a lot of times you'll find it in these little shaved flower shapes which is a nice presentation and it tastes really really yummy condiments something fruity like a fruit spread fig spread you can't go wrong with that a whole-grain mustard I find that just a plain whole-grain mustard is a little bit harsh so I'm going to show you how to soften this up a bit make it a little more appealing to the masses and it goes with all the stuff that's on here even fruit it's super delicious and then I have another fruit spread this is a cherry spread that I'm going to use to make a fruit Chev which is goat cheese short for to shove it in my mouth because it's so delicious there are countless things that you could put on your charcuterie board but these are just some of my favorites I'm going to show you how we put them together make them look

meal prepping your lunch for the week and i can't wait for y'all to try today's recipes because they're all so good and really easy to make now lunch meal prep is really important because when you're at work during the week especially if you don't work from home and you haven't prepped a healthy nutritious lunch to take with you it's going to be more tempting to go get that fast food or to eat whatever's at the office and this can really sabotage your clean eating routine and so by planning and prepping your lunch in advance it's really just going to set you up for success and help you to reach your health and your weight loss goals a lot faster so to make your lunch meal prep a little bit easier i've come up with five make ahead lunch box ideas that are not only going to help you to stay on track with your healthy eating but i have everything from sweet to savory so it's also going to satisfy all of your cravings and i'm excited to partner with monbinto for today's video they make really cool bento boxes that are perfect for prepping your lunch and your snacks on the go their lunch boxes come in different sizes and designs as you can see here this is their mb original which is rectangular in shape and a bit smaller but still plenty of room for both lunch and snacks and then i also have their mb square which as you can see is a little taller and larger personally i like to have both on hand depending on what i'm packing for lunch that day but they have lots of different designs and they're super functional so each of the bento boxes comes with two trays which gives you plenty of room for packing lunch in one and snacks in the other and you also get an extra container included to add things like nuts and dips and you can even add on extras and really customize your lunchbox one of my favorites is their sauce cups which are great for salad dressings and nut butters and you can add on other little containers as well that fit perfectly inside their lunch boxes their bento boxes are leak proof and airtight when you close the seal and they're bpa free but i just love how they stack together perfectly and even leave room under the lid for the cutlery of course they have a whole lot of other really cool items in addition to their bento boxes they literally have everything you need to customize the perfect on-the-go meal prepping system so i'll go ahead and leave my bento's website linked for you all in the description box below along with my discount code they're giving y'all 10 off the entire website including promotions until the end

recipe as well the link will be listed in the description box below but anyway let's head to the kitchen and get started for the first lunch box i'm making my creamy turkey bacon ranch pasta salad and by the way this is one of my new favorite lunch meal preps so to keep it gluten-free i'm using this chickpea pasta with only three simple ingredients i usually use the cassava flour pasta to keep it paleo but it was sold out but with this recipe any type of healthy fusilli noodles will work so the first thing you want to do is cook the noodles according to the package instructions and by the way with the chickpea noodles it is normal for them to foam up a little bit while they're cooking all right while those noodles are cooking i'm going to start with the turkey bacon and since turkey bacon is so lean i do like to brush the pan with a little bit of avocado oil you're gonna need four slices for this recipe but i'm gonna go ahead and cook a total of six so that way i'll have a couple slices extra to put on top of my carrot soup which we will be making later in this video and by the way yes you can use regular bacon for this recipe all right while the noodles and turkey bacon are cooking let's go ahead and chop up the vegetables starting with a cucumber i like to cut it into fourths and you're gonna need about two-thirds of a cup go ahead and transfer that to a large mixing bowl and let's do the same with some cherry tomatoes go ahead and cut them into halves or into fourths you're going to need two thirds of a cup of those as well [Music] as well as two-thirds of a cup of chopped carrots [Music] 1 4 cup of diced purple onion and 2 3 of a cup of broccoli florets don't forget to go check on the pasta and once it's done you'll want to drain it and give it a good rinse with some cold water once the bacon's done go ahead and drain the grease on a paper towel and then cut it up into small pieces let's transfer those to the mixing bowl and lastly we need to prep the homemade ranch dressing so to keep it clean and dairy free i'm using one cup of coconut cream which is the cream that sits on top of a can of full fat coconut milk and one cup of primal kitchen avocado mayonnaise mix that all up until it's fully combined and for the ranch seasoning i'm gonna add in two teaspoons of dried dill two teaspoons of garlic powder one teaspoon of onion powder a pinch of sea salt or himalayan salt and two teaspoons of lemon juice mix that all up i also like to add in about three to four tablespoons of water just to thin out the consistency a little bit and this recipe makes about two cups of french dressing now you're only going to need one cup for the pasta salad so you will have some left over and it will stay fresh in the fridge for up to one week so let's go ahead and add in the ranch dressing along with some sea salt and pepper go ahead and mix that all up and just look how creamy and delicious it is i'm telling you this one is a must try and once it's done it's as simple as adding a portion of it to your lunch box of course you can store the rest of it in the fridge to have throughout the week add the leak-proof lid and make sure you close that seal and for the other container i'm going to add in a few snacks including a bold egg some almonds and some fresh berries and just like that this lunch box is ready to go go ahead and stack the containers add your cutlery add this adorable lid with the elastic strap and lunch meal prep number one is done for the next lunch box i'm making my go-to avocado egg salad sandwich along with this honey lime fruit salad and these three ingredient date energy balls to have as a healthy snack let's start with the date energy balls because these are super easy to make in a food processor i'm going to add 10 pitted dates half a cup of raw almonds two tablespoons of unsweetened shredded coconut and this is optional but i like to add in a pinch of sea salt and just blend that for a few minutes until the mixture comes together into a large bowl like this then take a small portion roll it into a tight bowl and just repeat this process until all of the mixture is gone and this recipe should yield about 10 energy balls and not only are these a great snack for yourself but kids love them too and setting those aside let's go ahead and make the honey lime fruit salad first you want to cut up all the fruits starting with four kiwis and i like to cut them into fourths and just transfer them to a large mixing bowl and fun fact about kiwis they actually help to reduce high blood pressure thanks to their high potassium content i'm also going to add in one pound of fresh strawberries and i like to cut those either into halves or into fourths depending on how big the strawberry is as well as half of a large cantaloupe make sure you remove all the seeds and of course you can just cut them into small bite-sized pieces but i'm going to use my melon bowler to get those cute little melon balls and one pint of fresh blueberries go ahead and mix all that up for the honey lime dressing all you need is 1 4 cup of raw honey the zest from one lime and the juice from that same lime and just mix that until the honey is fully incorporated and then drizzle it over your fruit salad mix all that up and this is a super simple fruit salad recipe that you can whip up in minutes it's loaded with antioxidants and vitamins i mean just look at this vibrant color and it's perfect for meal prepping all right so now let's make the avocado egg salad and this is one of my go-to super easy lunch recipes first you'll want to hard boil six eggs once they're done give them an ice bath so that way they'll peel easier and then roughly chop those eggs you do want them to be a little bit chunkier for this recipe and in a mixing bowl go ahead and mash up two ripe avocados with a fork next chop up 1 4 cup of celery 1 4 cup of purple onion 2 to 4 tablespoons of fresh dill and 2 to 4 tablespoons of green onion add those to the bowl along with the chopped eggs and the juice from one to two fresh lemons mix all that up and don't forget to season with some sea salt and pepper to taste and then i'm just going to transfer a portion of that to some gluten-free bread of course you can eat this with healthy crackers vegetable sticks or eat it on its own because it's just that good and for this lunch meal prep i'm going to be using the larger mb square lunch box because it fits things like sandwiches really well so in the bottom container i'm going to add the avocado egg salad sandwich along with some cucumber wedges for an extra crunch and in the top container i'm going to add a portion of the honey lime fruit salad along with three of the date energy balls [Music] and lunch meal prep number two is ready to go [Music] next up i'm making a simple quinoa olive salad and i'm gonna pair that with a grilled chicken breast so let's get that quinoa cooking i'm going to add two cups of water to a saucepan over high heat along with one cup of dried quinoa bring that water to a boil and then reduce it to low medium cover the pan with a lid and let that simmer for about 15 minutes or until all of the water is absorbed and while that's cooking i'm going to prep the chicken let's season it with some garlic powder italian seasoning black pepper paprika and sea salt or himalayan salt rub that seasoning all over the chicken and bake it at 400 degrees fahrenheit for about 20 minutes or until it's fully cooked through now let's chop up the vegetables starting with half a cup of purple onion one red bell pepper half of a cucumber cut into fourths and about one cup of finely chopped fresh parsley fun fact about parsley is that it actually helps to get rid of onion breath all right i'm also going to add in 1 15 ounce can of chickpeas make sure you drain and rinse them and half a cup of olives and any variety of olives is fine going back to the quinoa once it's done you'll want to turn off the heat leave the cover on for five minutes and then gently fluff it up with a fork let's go ahead and add that to the bowl and for the dressing i'm going to mix up 1 4 cup of extra virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons of lemon juice 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar 1 4 teaspoon each of sea salt and pepper 1 teaspoon of italian seasoning and 2 minced garlic cloves add that dressing over top and then mix all of that together until it's fully combined and feel free to add a little bit more sea salt and pepper to taste but this quinoa salad is so light and refreshing and it'll stay fresh in the fridge all week and because i love olives so much i'm going to add some extras to take with me and then add a portion of the quinoa salad on the side and in the other container i'm going to pack the chicken breast over some spinach along with some fresh berries [Music] and just that fast you have another healthy lunch prepped and ready to go for the next lunchbox i'm making my grain free chicken meatball marinara over zucchini noodles and this is another great meal prep idea especially if you're craving something savory let's start with the chicken meatballs you're going to need one pound of ground chicken along with half a cup of almond flour 1 tablespoon of italian seasoning half a teaspoon of garlic powder half a teaspoon of sea salt 1 4 teaspoon of black pepper and 1 egg and just mix all that up until it's fully combined and then you're going to take a small portion of the chicken mixture roll it into a ball and then place it onto a lined baking sheet now when it comes to ground chicken or ground turkey it does get a little bit sticky when you're working with it so what i like to do is wet my hands and that keeps it from sticking to my hands and this recipe makes about 14 meatballs and yes you can freeze them for up to a month if you want to work them into your meal prep routine all right let's bake those meatballs at 400 degrees fahrenheit for about 20 minutes while those are cooking let's prep the marinara in a small saucepan over medium heat add one teaspoon of avocado oil along with two minced garlic cloves and just saute that garlic for about a minute then add in 1 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes along with one teaspoon of italian seasoning and half a teaspoon of sea salt give that a good stir and i also like to add in half a teaspoon of either coconut sugar or roll cane sugar just to cut the acidity a little bit but this is optional and you're just gonna let that simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes and while we're waiting let's go ahead and make the zucchini noodles and it's as simple as running your zucchini through a spiralizer and i will link the one that i'm using for y'all in the description box below and then in a skillet over medium heat i'm going to add in 1 to 2 tablespoons of avocado oil along with the zucchini noodles and just saute those until they reach your desired texture personally i like mine to be pretty soft but not to the point where they're too mushy once everything's done it's time to put it all together in our meal prep container let's add in the zucchini noodles first along with some of the marinara and then top it with the chicken meatballs and in the top container i'm going to pack some celery sticks with almond butter to have as a snack and i love these sauce cups because they're perfect for things like nut butters and salad dressings i'm also going to add three of the date energy balls that we made earlier and lunch meal prep number four is done and i just love how you can conveniently pack everything for the day into one single lunch box and lastly i'm making this dairy-free creamy carrot blender soup let's start by chopping up one pound of carrots make sure you rinse them first and cool fact about carrots that many people don't know is that eating them on a regular basis can actually help to detox excess estrogen out of the body [Music] all right go ahead and dice one small yellow onion or half of a large one and then in a large pot over medium-high heat i'm going to add two tablespoons of avocado oil along with the onions and the carrots as well as three minced garlic cloves and just toss those around a bit to make sure that they're coated with the oil and continue to cook that until the onions are translucent then let's add in 1 4 teaspoon of cumin along with some sea salt and pepper to taste give that a good mix and now i'm going to add in 4 cups of chicken broth you can also use vegetable broth bring that to a boil and then reduce it to low medium heat and let that simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes or until the carrots are super soft once those carrots are soft just transfer the soup to a blender and blend it until it's extra smooth [Music] now let's transfer it back to the pot and add in one 15 ounce can of full fat coconut milk this is going to make it super creamy and extra filling and now we're just going to transfer a portion of that to our meal prep container and i'm using the mb element which is their insulated lunch box it's great for soups or anything that you want to keep warm or cool and let's top that soup with some of the turkey bacon that we made earlier as well as some fresh green onion and using the envy extras i'm going to pack some healthy seed crackers to go with my soup along with some of the fruit salad that we made earlier to have as a snack and you now have five easy and healthy lunchbox meal prep ideas to serve throughout the week to help you reach your health and your weight loss

then you can have some snacks snacks means any food taken in between men meal it could be after breakfast before lunch or sometimes after lunch but still a long way before dinner or if you hate your dinner early you could be hungry before bedtime taking some snacks will help you feel better no not this one choose a good snacks good snacks is the nutritious snacks some people thought that snacks are bad for children and always blame for making kids become unhealthy the fact is not all snacks are bad some are good snacks that can help with energy keeping you alert and engaged in school and providing enough flow to be active throughout the day this is what we call a good snack growing up is a process that needs a lot of energy some children cannot eat much at the time so i would encourage to take small frequent meals for example taking two snacks in addition to three main meals other children might eat less of fruits and vegetables so take this group of food and snacks are highly recommended choosing fruits as snacks doesn't mean you need to take it the same way all the time although taking it fresh is really good as fruits are usually delicious by itself but you could be more creative who knows that experimenting with your food can bring out the junior master chef in you but one thing for sure it's going to be fun try making smoothies without that additional sugar of course or ice cream by adding fresh fruit into full cream milk and freeze it overnight what a delicious treat on a hot day right fruit salad is another good option instead of using mayonnaise or cream you can opt for natural yogurt flavor have you tried a carrot stick or carrot crackers before it's really yummy and crunchy too suitable for munching throughout the day grill or boil corn is another good option make your own wrap use a cabbage leaf fill it up with some chicken or eggs would sure to make that hunger go away some local dessert like crepe aldu is also a good option for your snack as they contain some carbohydrates and protein from the egg mix in the recipe do you know a cup of warm milk green before sleep is also a good snack this can help you to sleep better at night time but always be careful with the choice that you make avoid taking high energy but low nutrient value food and drinks are you talking about me yes tea coffee sweetened condensed milk syrup cordials and carbonated rings although they look so tasty but it's really bad for you same goes with most processed food that are high in sugar salt and fat if you make them as sometimes wood that get taken occasionally maybe once a month it's not that bad but never make it an everyday food do you know how much calorie in a bag of medium fries is more than calories that's equal to more than four scoops of rice let's talk about pizza [Music] what why can't i eat pizza every day one slice of pizza could provide almost 250 calories with around 10 grams of fat and don't forget about all the cookies with chocolate chips and cream in between cookies are in the list but not all cookies are bad for you there are some healthy cookies like oat cookies same goes with pizza the more vegetables on the pizza the healthier it is that's true enough it's not wrong as we talked earlier it's not only the type of food but the amount as well as long as you mind the amount and not taking too much it should be alright taking it occasionally maybe during celebration of festive season and in a small amount should be the way to enjoy your sometimes favorite snack what happens if i take a lot of this sometimes food first of all it's going to affect your growth you see at your age nutritious would help you cook healthy but if taking too much calorie way more than your body needed it can cause an extra weight on the other hand if you are not taking enough of a certain nutrient like protein and calcium you might not grow as tall as you should for your age [Music] [Music] foreign this time be foreign tuna [Music] then salad branches foreign nutella [Music] my [Music] to foreign bye [Music] [Music] [Music] my so stay tuned [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] foreign um foreign [Music] [Music] disimpan freezes [Music] machamp foreign sprinkles chocolate chips boy cherry and then chocolate syrup then chocolate syrup um [Music] [Music] food [Music] hello everyone welcome back to gastrospace and for this slot i'm gonna show you how to do a fruit parfait okay before that what is fruit parfait fruit parfait is where you put some fruits and layer of cream layer of fruits and layer of cream on top so it's like a mixture of sweet and some other flavors of the fruit and when you eat it together it tastes really really good okay so what do you need to do fruit parfait first of course you need a kind of clear plastic cup with a dome lid like this okay and then you're going to need some yogurt i chose some mixed berries yogurt and then for the fruits i've chosen some fresh fruits i have some grapes some kiwis and some dragon fruits and then i have some canned fruits as well these are just peaches pineapple these are peaches and pineapple and then you're going to need some toppings for the toppings you can choose your own here i have some colorful sprinkles and some chocolate chips and then you can choose other toppings as well here i have some chocolate syrup some honey and some whipped cream okay let's start before we start of course we're going to prepare some fruits so here i have dragon fruit a kiwi and some grapes okay once you have your own fruits you have to cut them into dice like this to smaller dices so that it will fit in the clear plastic cup i'm going to show you a little bit of demonstration on how you can cut your fruits into smaller dices as for the kiwi you can cut the shell of the kiwi into half and then you use a spoon to scoop out the flesh and then you cut it in half then cut it the other way around and then from here you can chop it into smaller dices here you already have some smaller dices from half of the kiwi okay you can include it in your plate next we have a dragon fruit you do the same thing but for dragon fruit you can cut the fruit in half cut this in half and then you can peel off the skin because the skin is really really soft and the flesh is really soft as well okay this is when the fruit is already cut into quarter pieces so from here just do like this [Music] and get some triangles it is best to use fresh fruits just because they have some natural sugar in them you don't have to add any sugar into this recipe so it is very easy you can just get some fresh fruits some cream and you eat it together it's just really nice it's really refreshing as well after you put it into the fridge okay so this is what the diced dragon fruit looks like you can add it together on your plate be careful by using a knife if you can please ask your parents to do so or your elder brother or sister as for the grapes i just cut it into half because it's nice to have a bigger chunk of grape or crunch it's very crunchy and it's really sweet and yeah it's a good texture to be added into the parfait okay i think we can start assemble the parfait now okay before we start assembling our parfait this is a yogurt i chose the mixed berries one which is supposed to have a really nice mix of berries flavor and i don't have any berries here so it is a good plus so just open it up don't forget to check the expiry date it's really important for your health you should not risk yourself eating something that's out of date wow smells so good all right get your yogurt get your clear cup with a dome lid grab a spoon and your fruits and start assembling okay first grab some yogurt put it at the bottom that much as much as you want actually but i just do this for demonstrating purposes okay then you can choose your fruits which you have diced right on top like so and then add some more yogurt you can't see the fruit anymore but it's there okay let's add some grapes it's a huge chunk of grape add more yogurt just have fun with it just layer as much fruit as you want as much yogurt as you want because they're both really healthy really fruity and really refreshing so it's good to have a mix of both almost there i'm almost at the top right yogurt is really really runny so it doesn't create that layer but it's there so okay then to top it off add some whipped cream we are using this tatwa dairy whip whipped cream you can get it anywhere in the supermarket whipped cream on and from here you can stop there or you can add some sprinkles [Music] this is done i'm gonna show you another type of fruit parfait this is why you need the dome lid so that the whipped cream doesn't um doesn't being it's not being pressed by a flat top so yeah okay for the second one i'm gonna layer some canned fruits try my best to add some lip green [Music] if you haven't had any dragon fruits you should it's not just exotic it looks really nice it looks really unique and it's so soft okay then i'm gonna add some yogurt then i'm gonna add a little bit of grapes i love grapes especially black grapes and besides whipped cream we can add some chocolate syrup second fruit parfait done okay as you can see this has small layers it is more obvious compared to the first one we have some fruit we have some cream another layer of fruit and some chocolate syrup on top as well as sprinkles okay these are the fruit parfait done it is really simple it is really easy you can choose any fruits that you like and any toppings that you like you can enjoy it by putting it in fridge and eat it on a hot day it is really refreshing and i hope you guys can try for yourself and enjoy foreign so you", "FaDhUo5Eaoo": "hi Mike Kennedy we're continuing on with our little series about making your own MREs first I want to mention this iPhone I originally started using this product to make cranberry bread with cranberry orange bread basically you take a raisin bread recipe you substitute the cranberries you take out the cinnamon and you put in a zest of let's say a large orange and that makes a really nice cranberry orange bread so what's different about these compared to say like raisins as these are sweetened so they're actually put in a an amount of sugar before they're dried or after they dried I'm not quite sure how they do it but they're saying here that this contains about nine servings per container so 1/3 of a cup or 40 grams will give you a hundred thirty calories 2 grams of dietary fiber it cludes 27 grams of added sugar which is quite a bit no protein so basically you're talking about something here that has so basically you're talking about something here this is a fruit and it doesn't actually can have much in that other than calories but as far as what's listed but every flavorful they're very good you can put them with other things but you know they kind of look fat and smushed flat and smushed but they have a lot of flavor to them this sweet you could put these with any mix that you have of nuts and things like that which will make a really good flavor for a trail bike trail food you know we've talking about trying to add some vegetable matter as opposed to just doing your finding that there seems to be a lot more products in the enemy or Department like excuse me like this sort of thing we tried I was really surprised that I really liked this polar kippered snacks naturally smoked boneless fillet of herring it's kind of a milder flavor than I thought it was going to be but telling the question on fruit we could add the dried cranberries then a viewer sent me this here we have free stride they include and free of course it's the fruit so they want to be included in it I suppose it's good that they warned you non-gmo this is 20 grams let's look on the back serving size is one whole package 70 calories only 3 grams of fiber protector even grams of sugar got a minuscule amount of do you vitamin D one nope vitamin D one very small amount let's try these out haven't tried to tell ya the advantage to dehydrate foodists that unlike dr if we have some dried vegetable matter i mean you're not going to try to reconstitute cranberries probably these will reconstitute much much quicker then a dehydrated item and what you'll find these tastes really good and I've noticed this with apples too that if you go to jihad but they especially the freezer I don't mean that happens to some extent the dehydrator to the fruit it becomes much sweeter because the sugar in there is concentrated to a smaller area that's really good really strong peach flavor so natural peach freeze-dried slices a special way to snack keep sealed and store in a cool place I was surprised that this kind of has a date code on it that I can't decipher in other words see this pack of cranberry is good till that November 4 2020 so we got under a year there it's more but I just walked to continue with this is just day later no Erica 2020 so it's not an extremely long time as and of course these are best used by dates to typically some of these dehydrated foods can last for a decade or even two or three sometimes but once you open them oh you generally have to eat them or seal them up in them another container because what will happen is they will absorb moisture from the air but it has been dehydrated properly or freeze-dried you'll notice that it will really snap like a cracker would and it isn't Bend it doesn't have a lot of bend in it so usually that's the test for if you've removed in a fishing mound a sufficient amount of water from them to allow them to be stored long-term of course the ban is also - this is a lot of foods are they can be like ninety percent water so by the time you remove the water from them you have a very light package of thing I would guess by the looks of this I would think there has to be at least one or two Bowl beaches in there so there we go peaches then you remember all your things like dried cranberries dried raisins there's a most economical you know you look at things like dried blueberries and the price goes through the roof when you do that they tend to cost quite a bit but the the raisins and then the cranberries seemed to be pretty inexpensive but like I say you're gonna have to watch the expiration date on them so there we go throw some fruit into your meal ready to eat and you'll be happier and healthier by", "pLw1-phEapc": "guys its Llewellyn here with a super quick follow-up video to the market pantry deal I'm the mixed fruit fruit snacks now I showed you guys earlier in the week how these were available on target.com as well as in the store for only a dollar 69 and this is for the 50 pouch box so I snagged a picture on my phone because the store was out at the time when I went so I always take a picture when they go out or if I think it's something super low that they're gonna give me a problem with it the register and in this case I wanted to go ahead and get that rain check because they were out so 50 count it clearly says they're a dollar 69 went there today and these are priced at 6.64 cents now the sign is gone check target.com they're not available on target.com so I noticed that the shelves had three boxes so somehow they restocked them so I took them to the customer service desk I showed her my phone with the pricing that clearly states that the offer is good through the 21st of February for the 50 count box and she went ahead and they priced it down for me for the you can see right there regular price 664 price them down three at a dollar 69 apiece so I'm gonna go ahead and post all of this on my facebook page and blog along with the picture of the ad showing that the sale was clearly good till this Saturday the 21st so hopefully if you guys can grab this deal at your target before the end of day on Saturday it's huge savings on these fruit snacks they are the 50 count pouches so huge savings it's a great price and the cool thing for me was I mean if your store doesn't have it try and get a rain check this is the rain check that I got earlier in the week I have it good for 8:00 at a dollar 69 and it's good through April 3rd of 2015 so just a little tip for me to you guys what I always do is like I showed you on my phone take a picture if the deal seems too good to be true take a picture keep it and bring it to customer service so if they're out you can get a rain check or if it's a different sale item that they're out of take a picture of the the ad like I did and bring it up to the desk so that they can go into the system and get you a rain check a couple of other cool things today is they had a lot of winter clearance so like gloves and stuff like that and I picked up some gloves for my son really cheap because it seems like we're always losing those and in the dollar spot section at the front of the store they have a ton of stuff at 70% off so a lot of its Valentine related and I really didn't need any of that stuff but check that out but they have like these 2015 planners they're normally just a dollar but they were 30 cents apiece so that was a pretty good deal that was a really good deal and then one other tip that I wanted to give my savvy shoppers was on the candy Clarence now the candy at my store is at 50% off so backs of M&Ms are a dollar fifty nine piece which if I wanted to buy two and use the coupon it would be like a dollar sixty for two bags or eighty cents each which is a good price but I won't pick them up until they go

subscribe and I'll check out my facebook page savvy coupon shopper you have a great night guys bye bye", "lCxriVYg3Hw": "[Music] all right this is john kohler with okraw.com to another exciting episode for you in this episode i'm going to show you guys my favorite fruits some of them anyways in the world and how you may not be able to find these but you guys can find a more amazing alternative that actually will be lower in cost well for one of these guys anyways uh here we have some cool fruits this is actually known as a durian you can see the spikes on there this could be like a medieval weapon and this could really hurt you if it fell on you this is the durian this one's from thailand month variety and over here we got the almighty jackfruit i love jackfruit way more than i do during especially when you guys hear about the price luckily i live in a city where both these are available at this time which is january when it's a fruit dry spell you mostly have apples bananas and citrus which i'm not a super huge fan of so i'm so glad i was able to find the jackfruit the jackfruit this fruit here it was a dollar nineteen a pound and this fruit was about 22 bucks right here looks pretty ripe to me nice and soft hopefully it'll taste pretty good okay over on this side we got the almighty durian this is extremely rare to find and i was really impressed i could actually find one to buy at all that's fresh normally i bought them in like a plastic where they've been actually airshipped in plastic fresh but it was not ripe check my ig for information on that but at a local market the ranch 99 market i was able to find a fresh durian now this guy was pricey guys it was a 11.99 a pound and this guy was 66 bucks so you guys do the math i personally would rather have like three these guys but i can only find one ripe one instead of one of these but the reason for this episode today is because i want to share with you guys even if you are not able to find fresh durian near you which most parts of the country or even the world you can't you may be able to find the frozen durian um you know that has been frozen but to me there that means a big difference between frozen and fresh and that stuff might run i know about five dollars a pound uh but even better than that for right now a limited time till it runs out you guys can get something even better in my opinion that's not going to expire like a fresh durian like this guy if i don't eat it pretty soon it's going to go molded it's going to look bad and actually maybe we'll open this up you guys can see it's actually already splitting on me and we're gonna go ahead and open this baby up on the camera here for you guys you can see it's already splitting so we're just gonna go ahead and open the seam up look at that fruit goodness oh my god this smells so good i think it's gonna be super ripe all right so there's a one nice pod and we got a little bit of dud pods but we'll talk more about the uh durian and i'll try it on camera for you guys in a minute but even if you guys can't find the fresh one i'll show you guys how you can get actually the second best thing after fresh so the next best thing after fresh durian is freeze dried durian now if i was over in asia or chiang mai or some crazy southeast asian country i'd probably love the fresh dirt because i'd be able to actually get good stuff that's actually ripe but here in the states it is extremely difficult to get actually good durian that's actually fresh and ripe right and so i would hate to have you by guys buy durian and have it not be ripe have it be crunchy chewy wow this one's actually quite soft so i'm really looking forward to eating that after this episode so the way you can ensure you get the best durian is not actually even to get it fresh maybe if it's frozen it might be picked when it's ripe and then frozen but sometimes i've gotten frozen durians that actually aren't so great so that's a better way but the problem with frozen durian is once you've thought out you lose the texture you lose really some of the flavor it's kind of like you get a banana a ripe banana you freeze it then you thought it and then you try to eat it that's kind of like how eating a frozen durian is to me you really kind of lose the the delicate you know essence and flavor and texture of the fruit because it's basically now been frozen and thought out so instead of that actually i prefer this and what this is you guys can see the label but it says uh fd durian small size 1kg so this is from thailand this is actually freeze dry durian i buy it in one kilo bags and this is available right now but not for long because after this video hits um the seller that's selling this stuff is going to run out i will put a link down below it's actually to matt monarch.com i have me and matt go way back i've had lots of stories good and bad with matt but i will say this i appreciate matt because he is importing the durian in one kilo bags like nobody else in america is most people are selling the durian smell it in small bags and it's really expensive can be over 80 to 100 per pound if you buy it that way like on amazon you know matt's offering it for less with my coupon code that i'll share with you guys it's basically 30 bucks a pound which is actually one of the cheapest freeze-dried fruits you can get plus it's also the rarest so it'll give you the opportunity to try it plus the other thing i like actually even better than the fresh fruits which you know has its own texture and complexity this stuff is actually even crunchy so let's go ahead and pull this out of the bag and share with you guys what it looks like all right so uh most important thing freeze dried foods can store up to 25 years this one probably not wasn't packed openly and i don't know if they have an oxygen absorber in there so i'd maybe say at least five years if you want to repack yourself proper and oxygen is over remove the excess air and put a thick mylar thicker mylar bag on it you know you could probably easily get 10 years out of it which is amazing so this could be literally this is like astronaut food guys like freeze-dried food is astronaut food so we're just going to go ahead and cut it open the most important thing is once you cut this open you want to eat it or reseal it especially if you live in like a humid place like florida if you leave this bag open these fruits will rehydrate because the freeze drying process can remove basically uh 98 to 99 moisture and that's why it can store so long so we're just going to go ahead and pour these out oh yeah it's got an oxygen dropper in there i don't know how good quality it is but yeah there's there's some freeze-dried durian totally crazy so what happens is over in thailand when these guys are ripe they take these they cut them up into pieces and they basically put it in the freezer and you could tell i mean i can see the texture on that and they basically freeze dried i've gotten some freeze-dried dirt because i bought lots of freeze-dried during my day trust me it's one of my binge foods you know and that's actually how i've been gaining weight lately because i'll just come home and eat freeze-dried durian when i'm hungry and this is this is the way you guys could literally seriously pack on the calories because hey fresh durian is great it's already high in calories because it has a good fat percentage but when you remove the water you concentrate it so you intensify the flavors it's also crunchy when you eat it and it is so easy to overeat so if you guys have like overeating issues maybe don't get this stuff but if you want to gain some weight this is good for you because it will definitely put some weight on you because it's high fast calories especially if you're not burning them all right so yeah this is the freeze dry durian and this is the fresh durian right here now some of you guys might not be able to get matt's freeze-dried durian while he has it in stock so i'm going to share with you guys some alternatives for you guys and those alternatives are simply at your local trader joe's right this is some freeze-dried food available at trader joe's and actually through matt his freeze-dried durian is actually less expensive than some of this freeze-dried fruit from trader joe's you know so uh trader joe's has a bunch of different freeze-dried fruit you can get freeze-dried fruit like whole paycheck and what not in other health food stores but they can be quite spendy and quite costly so that's why i recommend going at trader joe's for their freeze-dried fruit and they have a bunch of different kinds but most of i won't eat because they're not organic uh that being said the berries the freeze-dried berries at trader joe's are organic this is actually 3.99 and you for that you get 1.2 ounces of freeze-dried berries so let's go ahead and open this up and show you guys what this looks like this is 1.2 ounces and this is 3.99 i really have a cool episode that i did many years ago down below put a link and it's actually uh basically raw cereal where i basically combined freeze-dried fruits and i made basically fresh coconut milk which is completely amazing last freeze-dried fruit um i like is the freeze-dried mango from trader joe's this stuff is actually less expensive this is actually uh 3.29 and it's 1.7 ounces whereas these guys are 3.99 for 1.2 ounces so it's actually quite spendy but let's go ahead and uh open this guys up this this guy is really cool um they look like little chips like little french fries these guys are so good i mean if i had to choose between these three you know durian mango and berries i mean well for the taste and flavor i'm gonna go for the freeze dry durian every single time for the nutrition quality if you're trying to eat as nutrient dense as possible which is one of my goals i'm gonna go for the berries every single time less calories than the other two not quite as sweet and if you just kind of want to go for just like you know plain jane but still good and you can't get the durian go for the mangoes so here's how the numbers work out for those of you guys that are spend thrifts on the spent thrift but i still bought my freeze dried durian um with my coupon code that i'll provide you guys the durian is basically 69.70 per kilo which is 2.2 pounds which works out to be about 31.68 per pound now that may sound like a lot of money but this durian that i bought right here was 11.99 per pound and look at this most of this durian that i bought for 11 a pound is not edible because it is actually the shell although my bacteria and microbes will eat it better when it goes in my compost pile i'm sure they will appreciate some tropical fruit peels the berries they reach an all-time high based on the 3.99 at 1.2 ounces of 53 dollars and 20 cents per pound so that's actually quite expensive and if you just get the freeze dried mango that stuff runs about 30 and 96 cents a pound based on the 329 price and the 1.7 ounces and actually i want to comment too like for this these strawberries i mean i've experienced a lot of freeze-dried fruit in my time these strawberries like don't look super like optimal neither do these berries like they just kind of look i don't know kind of messed up and then same thing with the mangoes like these mangoes i don't know they don't look quite as clean or as neat as they should be they look a little bit overly processed but they are 100 fruit whereas these uh this freeze-dried durian does look pretty solid man i mean this stuff looks pretty good to me the other thing is i've gotten freeze-dried um durian on am on ebay when matt was out and i bought like basically durian i think it was pureed and then freeze-dried and cut into symmetrical blocks and i'm like what else is in here but i really like match stuff because this basically might be smaller pieces instead of the big pieces so it's more economy but that's all right because that's one of the reasons why it's cheaper so i would encourage you guys to support matt so we continue to bring in the freeze dried durian because it is actually one of the best snack foods on the entire planet if you're raw vegan or if you're just into eating lots of fruit peace loving fruit guys chris kendall raw advantage so before i try the fresh durian and the freeze-dried durian and ruin my dinner i want to show you guys some of the more some of the benefits of the freeze drying so number one freeze drying keeps way more flavor than dehydration right it also keeps the nice texture i mean here's these mangoes i mean we can do this to any of the fruit we can take this and listen carefully you can hear that snap these guys it's me harder to crack one of these durians because it's smaller but listen these guys are basically have 98 to 99 of the water removed so they're gonna store along but also they're crunchy this is very important texture is very important on our raw foods diet you know normally if you want crunch you got to eat some carrot sticks or some jicama chips or something like that but this is crunchy to the next level aside from abiba's crazy crackers like crazy cracker later those are dehydrated now dehydrated foods can only remove up to 70 to 90 percent of the water content so they're going to be a lot more flippy a lot more floppy a lot more chewy normally it's very difficult to get freeze dried jackfruit especially good freeze-dried jackfruit normally when they freeze dried jackfruit that i bought from trade and commerce they freeze dry it when they're not exactly ripe and they don't taste so good most jackfruit that you will buy will be dehydrated and then it's chewy and it loses lots of flavor and you know you don't have that nice crunchy texture now the other reason why i love freeze-dried fruit and other foods is because it retains more nutrients freeze-dried food is at least 30 percent more nutritious than dehydrated foods and you know you're thinking why john it's all dried it's it's not good it's dried you know hey i'm gonna always say freshest is bestest but there's a place for freeze-dried foods if you're camping and you're hiking and you want to take something that's light that's high calorie man this is the best stuff maybe aside from some dates and nuts but actually dates have higher water content than this so this would be lower weight and easier to pack and carry and you could pack in more of it but the freeze-dried foods are at least 30 percent more nutritious and that's because it's how it is made all right think about it how does a dehydrator make many you guys own dehydrators right well you have a heating element and a fan the heating element comes on and it could easily go over 100 10 100 15 118 degrees whatever you think the raw food magic number is and then they basically blow hot air across it so i don't know about you but when you cut open an apple and you hold it out the window and you're driving 55 miles an hour on the freeway which i've never done it'll turn brown faster because you're basically bombarding with air when you're using a high speed juicer or high speed blender such as a vitamix right you're bombarding that those foods with air particles you're lowering nutrition content especially those antioxidant nutrients as well as polyphenols that are so valuable for us to include the way freeze drying works is first they freeze the food right once they freeze it all the nutrition is locked in in the freezing process and then they basically sublimate so they carefully remove the excess moisture off the food while under a vacuum at significantly lower temperatures that dehydration occurs so because it's done in a vacuum without the oxygen it's similar to like vacuum blending versus traditional blending watch my videos for that if you're not familiar with it and you save you keep up to 30 more nutrition so what does this mean in the end it means crunchier flavor and more nutrition which means better taste because when you taste things you're tasting the nutrients the phytochemicals polyphenols antioxidants in the foods that if something is more tasty and good it is more nutritious and that's why simply as you just see freeze-dried durian even instead of fresh when i could get it plus the cost difference all the you don't understand that although this is like 31.68 cents a pound this was me cost me 12 bucks a pound this is much more concentrated so really if you have to expand this because only the water's removed you know you would have a lot more fresh durian here for the price so here let's go ahead and read off this bag the eastern region of thailand grows some of the sweetest most flavorful mango in the world that that mango which is used for freeze dry product on this package is freeze-dried in the growing region and retains its perfect flavor one process in this matter to make 1.7 ounces contained in this bag over 10 ounces of perfectly right fresh cut mango are freeze dried so literally 1.7 to 10 ounces so with the mangoes anyways it took basically 10 ounces of fresh mango to get 1.7 ounces of the freeze-dried mango so if you use the same ratio which is about a 5.5 multiplier we would divide the price of 31.68 cents divided by 5.5 because literally it took five times or five and a half times as much durian fresh to get it into the freeze-dried state so what does that mean that means basically our cost overall if we were as if we were buying fresh because this is concentrated fresh durian it would cost about five dollars and fifty cents maybe six bucks right per pound so that's literally half the price of the fresh one plus you got all the crunch plus its stores you could pack it and you could eat it at a later date unlike the fresh that will spoil and go bad on you furthermore i didn't tell you guys and i'm not going to do in this episode because i hate ruining my freeze-dried food like this but you could just basically put this in water under a vacuum or just in water alone let it sit for a while and this will actually rehydrate and the texture will be very similar to the fresh not exactly the same as the fresh but very similar to the fresh with all the flavor fresh would have i don't like to spoil my dried stuff by making it a soggy texture i just like to eat it fresh with the crunch and all all right so yeah so that way you know so for me personally i would much once again freeze dried durian in fresh equivalence is about five fifty to six bucks per pound which actually if you buy a frozen durian it's five bucks a pound and then once again you got to deal with the shell that you're not eating so that would make actually freeze dried during even cheaper than the frozen and actually significant significantly cheaper than the fresh stuff if you live here in the states now if you love if you're over in southeast asia don't mess with freeze-dried durian you guys got the fresh stuff all right so with that i'm gonna go ahead and taste the fresh and the freeze dry let's see what should i taste first you choose fresh or freeze-dried yell it out all righty i heard fresh somewheres so let's go ahead and try the fresh one first we're going to take up this pot out well it's been a while since that fresh durian i think it had it like last year um or the year before actually when i was in visiting hawaii i was visiting kauai and we're going to go ahead and try this fresh durian man that's a good one you kind of i love the texture of this man this is not like frozen thought out during it's like fresh during not just good stuff i had in kauai but man it's like uh but they get for those of you guys that never had before it's like eating like uh it's like like the good stuff is like really like pudding and then you got more fibers near the seed man i gotta say this is a solid dirt i gotta pack my pat myself on the back for picking this good one because i had about four or five of them at the store and like this is my baby we got a nice golden color it's already starting to split this is the one i'm buying and i did and it's really great that being said i got to eat it pretty quick it'll go bad so i know what that tasted like now we're going to go ahead and try uh the freeze-dried durian for you this is really cool i mean you can see the pods that they just cut up into little pieces and listen to this oh my god that stuff's insane all right i've never done this test before i did freeze dried versus fresh and i did it on camera for you guys i've had them at separate times but what i will say is this you lose some of the delicacy of the durian straight up you lose some of the delicious because some of the delicacy is in the texture it's in like the mild flavor overtones if you guys have had durian you guys will know what i'm talking about with the freeze dried it just hits you like boom this stuff is sweet and this stuff you get that durian flavor in your mouth and it's not quite as connoisseur-ish but you get the idea but it is crunchy and while i do love the texture of the the fresh durian which is kind of like kind of like pudding so it's like really soft like eating pudding i really love the crunchiness of the freeze dried but yeah this stuff sweeter not quite as delicate but you get the flavor and you understand what durian could taste like and once again this is available basically anywhere in the united states or you could order from matt monarch.com for fun i'm gonna go ahead and try the uh freeze dried mango on the camera for you guys because if you can't get the freeze dried durian mango is my next go-to high calorie freeze-dried fruit because it is available at trader joe's and this one after having a durian this one is even more sickly sweet so i've actually made raw food pies using just freeze-dried mango fresh mango and flax seeds acid crust and that's one amazing recipe using very few ingredients but yeah i love using the dried fruits and freeze-dried fruits as a sweetener instead of something like coconut sugar or palm nectar and all these things that are more highly processed i mean seriously guys this is just seriously just fruit and this is the best way to eat fruit that has been preserved without the water content in its freeze-dried form the big negative of course is the price all right last we're gonna go ahead and try the freeze-dried organic berries none of the other two were organic but you know i try to eat mostly all organic although there are some exceptions such as freeze-dried durian fresh durian jackfruit and even the mangoes i do want to mention that actually this year for the first time 2021 i've seen more irradiated mangoes in grocery stores than i ever have before from mexico so watch for that red dura symbol anyways we're going to go ahead and try the strawberries freeze-dried strawberries out of that multi-pack it's freeze-dries raspberry strawberries and blueberries i mean these are just strawberries like intensified for freeze-dried strawberries i mean the taste is good i have definitely tasted better freeze-dried strawberries for sure but yeah these are for those of you guys that are on like low sugar diets and want higher nutrients this is what you guys should get the berries rule out over mangoes and durian for phytochemicals and phytonutrients okay next let's go ahead and try organic freeze-dried blueberry i've gotten many freeze-dried blueberries in my day actually i like the freeze-dried blueberries a lot more than the freeze-dried strawberries and finally we're going to show you guys a freeze-dried raspberries these guys look like they've been really shrunk and freeze-dried because they're like seemingly smaller than they should be and they're not sweet at all they're crunchy and pretty dry but not that sweet so i had to rate the blueberries i liked the most strawberries and then the raspberries of course we mixed all three of these together and then poured some coconut milk fresh made in there you'd have one amazing raw food cereal which i did show i don't even know how many years ago now put a link down below that video oh yeah so if you guys want to order the freeze dried durian i don't get any money i'm just referring you to matt because number one i appreciate that matt is importing these he didn't have him for a while so i hope this is a stock item that he will regularly carry because he'll see wow there's a demand for this and unless you're some kind of connoisseur guy like me and know about these things you might just never buy them but hopefully after this video you guys gonna see like whoa i gotta get that freeze-dried durian it's a good food for storage in case world war iii happens i'm a raw foodist and i can't get fresh stuff i got the dried stuff because

eating your fresh fruits and vegetables and some freeze-dried durian sometimes they're always the best [Music] you", "aYa1ul4De-Y": "- One of my favorite ways to use up fruit at the end of the week is to make fruit leather,\nor homemade fruit roll ups. Both names totally apply to this recipe. This easy recipe is inside my cookbook, The Best Homemade Snacks on the Planet. There are over 170\nfavorite snacks and treats you can easily make at home. Now the first thing you wanna do is preheat your oven\nto your lowest setting, anywhere between 150 and\n200 degrees Fahrenheit. Now at this low setting you are essentially dehydrating\nthe moisture from the fruit and making sure that the fiber\nand all the deliciousness stays intact in every single bite. Now what I love about this recipe is that it literally has two ingredients, my fresh strawberries, or any fresh fruit that you wanna use, and a little bit of honey. If you want printed directions, I always leave them\nright below this video. Now just gonna put my top\non my blender and blend. (whirring)\n(bouncy, playful music) Now once you have a smooth texture, you're gonna wanna pour\nyour pureed strawberries right onto a parchment lined sheet pan. Now if you have a silicon mat\nyou can totally use that too. So what I like to do is I\nlike to pour it in the middle, and with a spatula, or\nthe back of a spoon, spread it around my pan. By the way, you know that fruit\nthat you have sitting there in the back of your freezer that you thought you were\ngonna use for smoothies? Take that out and make\nthese fruit rollups. You can totally use frozen fruit. Just let it sit out on\nthe counter for 10 minutes until it gets somewhat\nsquishy and thawed out, blend it, make it smooth. Now that's gonna take a little\nbit longer than fresh fruit because it has a lot more moisture, but fruit leather it is. The sheet pan goes in the\noven for about four hours. See how the back is looking a\nlittle dryer than the front? You'll notice that the front\nleaves a wet spot right there, but the back is dry. That's what you're looking\nfor all throughout. You know it's ready because the leather peels\neasily from the parchment paper. We're gonna let this sheet pan fully cool down to room temperature. Now I often let is just dry\novernight on the counter and when you're ready, you're just gonna cut them with scissors into strips and roll them up. They roll out super easy,\nand they're fun to eat. They're great for an afternoon snack, or to pack in the lunchbox. (beeping) (lid squeaking) (Laura grunts) (beeping) (Laura laughs) (beeping) I can eat the whole sheet pan. (laughs) - [Cameraman] That shouldn't be... (beeping)\nOh yeah. (Laura growls) - Thank you.\n- Oh my gosh, treats! (upbeat, melodic music)", "n5JID9YoBUg": "collecting wild berries is a favorite pastime here in Alaska some people pick berries for fun family tradition or to spend time in the outdoors regardless of whatever reason you choose to pick berries you'll end up with a fresh wholesome tasty and nutritious food that your family will love I'm Helen I'd Zorich and this is Marsha Munson we are nutrition educators with the Cooperative Extension Service this lesson will help you decide what berries are available where to look for them and what to do with them once they are picked first let's look at what you need to take with you when you go you'll need to take shallow containers with lids if the containers are too large berries on the bottom will be crushed by the weight of those on top a cooler to keep berries cool on the trip home take boots to protect your feet a jacket to keep you warm and dry water to drink and some snacks pack all of these items in your backpack along with the insect repellent insects are particularly pesky during berry seasons remember to pick a combination of ripe and under ripe berries especially if you're making gelled products under ripe berries have a higher level of pectin and will ensure that jellies and jams that can properly berries ripen differently depending on the weather during any certain year cooler temperatures heavy rains or lots of sunshine can hasten or slow the ripening process here is a general calendar of the order that berries ripen wild strawberry raspberry black currants red currant cloudberry salmon berry blueberry highbush cranberry new gyoon berry service berry crowberry glow bush cranberries most berries are best when picked at the height of their ripeness during the summer though some berries such as low Bush cranberries crow berries and rose hips may be picked after frost this is a matter of personal choice some people feel that these berries are sweeter after the frost though we often want to wait for the frost to pick by Bush cranberries they actually have a better flavor in late summer before the frost another thing to keep in mind while you are berry picking is to keep watch for wildlife bears like berries too and a watchful eye is very important while you are in the berry patch make noise as you go through the woods most wildlife will scurry out of your way if they see or hear you coming sing talk and yell to make sure you don't surprise a bear so where do you look for berries many berry pickers won't tell you where their favorite picking spots are but here are some general information about where to begin look for areas where the ground has been disturbed for building or where a fire has occurred there is a natural progression following a wildfire when the fire burns off the brush and trees the berries returning are the first step in reforestation so look at areas of recent burns first check out the edges of the road for favorites like raspberries bogs for those berries that like their feet wet and south-facing sunny slopes each berry has a different habitat so let's take a quick look at the ten most sought after berries in Alaska and describe their habitats as we begin discussing these berries and their habitats there are a few definitions that may help you to identify different types of plants juniper like leaves are thin with glossy green needle shaped leaves lobed leaves are thin and have several points toothed leaves are thin as well but have a jagged edge a bog is an area with moist spongy ground often with standing water Alpine is defined as an area where plants grow above the Timberline tundra is treeless land oftentimes it is damp but can also be dry and rocky now let's take a look at our favorite berries blueberries grow on an erect shrub up to two feet high the leaves are small and oval there are three main types of blueberries in Alaska the bug blueberry grows in the bogs Woodlands as well as tundra up into the alpine areas flowers are bell-shaped and light pink early blueberries are found in the moist coastal forests and meadows the Alaska blueberry grows on a shrub upright to 6 feet tall in the southeast and in south-central look for dark fruit that has a whitish bloom on the surface cloud berries are an aggregate fruit similar to the raspberry but have a soft orange color they grow in bogs wet woodlands and moist Tundra the plant is very short usually no more than 5 inches tall the leaves are rounded with three to five lobes and have toothed to edges it grows in all parts of Alaska crowberries crowberries look similar to the blueberry but the plant has almost juniper like needles it grows in woods bogs and wet and dry Tundra the shrub is a low trailing evergreen that forms mats on the ground it is found throughout Alaska on the alpine muskeg of southeastern Alaska north to Yakutat and west to Kodiak the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands and on the tundra throughout interior Alaska north to the Arctic currents you can find both red and black varieties of currants red currants can grow from one and a half to five feet high with reddish brown shredding bark on the twigs they have three to five lobed toothed leaves they grow in moist woodlands and clearings the black currant grows in southeastern Alaska north to Skagway and Yakutat Kenai and central Alaska it grows in woods and rocky outcroppings up into the alpine high bush cranberries hi bush cranberries grow on a shrub up to eight feet high with slender grey branches leaves are almost maple leaf like with either three lobes or not lobe two all with the edges coarsely toothed it grows in woods and in Meadows from lowlands into alpine area high Bush cranberries have a distinctive musty odor and flavor the fruit has a single cream-colored disc shaped seed Lingnan berries Lingnan berries or lowbush cranberries grow on an evergreen vine that has small dick oval leaves with a whitish underside and edges that roll under this is a very small plant that is usually less than six inches tall it can be found in bogs woods and dry Tundra stems are very slender often creeping through the moss Nagumo Rees Nagumo Aries are another short plant that grow only 5 to 6 inches tall each leaf has three tooth leaflets and coarse veins it is found in damp or wet woody places in coastal and interior Alaska as well as coastal districts of southeastern Alaska the Gulf of Alaska the Alaska Peninsula and the Bering Sea raspberries raspberries grow in clearings dry meadows and on the edges of woods about two to four feet high leaves have three to five leaflets and a whitish hairy underside the raspberry looks very similar to those that are grown commercially with small droops and fine white hairs salmon berries salmon berries grow on a shrub from one and a half to seven feet tall the stem is woody and the bark is yellowish brown be careful when picking because shrubs may have some prickles leaves have three to five leaflets the fruit is similar to raspberries in appearance but is usually larger and may vary from yellow to dark red service berries service berries grow on a shrub or tree from 6 to 16 feet tall leaves are 1 to 2 inches long with toothed edges and a thin prominent vein they grow in dry exposed areas from sea level up to the sub Alpine it grows in thickets and borders of woods soapberry or Shilpa Lally the soapberry or Shilpa Lally is a red berry that grows in dry areas as well as woodlands and on gravel bars next to rivers the shrub can be up to 4 feet high with brownish scaly bark the leaves are oval with dark green leaves near the top of the bush and lighter green leaves toward the bottom the fruit is somewhat bitter but is used in many areas of Alaska the berry froths when beaten it is traditionally used as a dessert topping with the addition of sugar to the froth wild strawberries wild strawberries look very much like regular strawberries but the plants aren't as large or robust as commercial strawberries leaves are on long slender stalks there are 3 leaves in a group with margins sharply and deeply toothed the fruit is oval and small and up to 1 inch long watermelon berries watermelon berries are red berries that grow on a shrub from 18 to 40 inches tall the leaves are sharply pointed but have smooth edges and parallel veins the fruit is oval juicy and sweet the berry grows in the moist woods and meadows from sea level to low alpine mostly in the southern part of the state more berries will be shown at the end of the module okay now the berries have been picked what do we do with those berries for long and short-term storage as soon as you get home refrigerate the berries or keep them in the cooler to keep them fresh until you're able to process them remember that more nutrients are preserved when you process the berries quickly so aim to get them in the refrigerator or freezer the same day that they were picked next we'll move on to equipment cleaning and preparing berries for storage is a simple process you'll need a cutting board or a cookie sheet a towel plastic freezer containers freezer bags and a marker berry should be cleaned as soon as possible it is not necessary to wash them unless they were growing near a road or populated area where there is a danger of dust or other impurities clean the berries by wrapping a towel around a board or cookie sheet elevating one end and rolling the berries down the surface leaves and other debris will stick to the towel proper hold the board at a fairly low angle so you don't bruise the berries gentle rolling is the key to removing the debris but not harming the berries we'll be back when we finish cleaning these berries now that the berries are cleaned they are ready to store by freezing drying or canning will be referring to Alaska's wild berries for specific information on how to preserve your berries so let's talk about freezing one of the most popular ways to save your berries is to freeze them berries may be packed with syrup sugar or dry packed work in small quantities this will prevent loss of quality and nutrients most berries have a better texture and flavor if packed in sugar or syrup however the sugar is not necessary to safely preserve the fruit if you are watching your sugar intake choose to do a dry pack the type of pack you choose should be based on the intended use those pectin syrup are great for uncooked desserts those dry packed or packed in sugar are best for cooking purposes since there is less liquid in the product so you'll need berries sugar water freezer containers or bags spoons and a marker for labeling when preparing berries don't use galvanized copper or iron equipment the acid in the berries could react with the metals forming off flavors there is a difference in plastic storage bags the freezer bags are considerably thicker than storage bags always choose the freezer thickness to protect your product from freezer burn if you can only get the thinner bags use two bags for extra protection next we'll discuss packing berries in syrup a syrup pack is a good way to preserve berries that are to be eaten uncooked the proportion of sugar to water depends on the sweetness of the berries for most of our Alaska berries we recommend a medium syrup mix and dissolve two and a half cups sugar in four cups of water it's easiest to dissolve the sugar in lukewarm water but then chill the syrup before using warm syrup will deteriorate the berries you'll need one cup of syrup for four cups of prepared berries put berries in the container and pour syrup over until the berries are covered leaving one inch headspace seal tightly label with the berry named amount and date get the berries in the freezer quickly to preserve both the quality and the flavor a sugar pack is a good way to freeze berries that are to be cooked sprinkle 1/2 cup sugar over 4 cups of berries you can mix gently until the juice is drawn out and the sugar dissolves but with delicate berries such as raspberries it's easiest to layer the sugar in the berries and then let them stand for 15 minutes don't stir the berries they will deteriorate you can see the difference between the berries that have just been sprinkled with sugar and these that have been sitting fill pint or quart sized freezer bags three to four inches from their tops squeeze out the air and seal tightly label with the very name the amount and the date now they're ready for freezing next let's talk about how to dry pack a dry pack is a good way to freeze whole fruits that give a good quality product without sugar we recommend this method for raspberries and strawberries place dry fresh berries in plastic freezer bags or containers seal tightly and label containers berries frozen in this manner may need to be used in recipes where hole separated berries are not important to keep whole berries separated spread the fruit on a cookie sheet freeze until hard and then transfer to bags or containers this will keep berries frozen individually so they are easier to use a few at a time that's it for freezing we'll be back in a minute to can berries berries are high in acid so are safely canned in the boiling water canner the best source of instructions for home canning are available from the USDA and the Cooperative Extension Service University of Alaska Fairbanks you'll need a boiling water canner or similar large pot a large spoon a jar lifter a magnetic lid lifter a ladle a canning funnel jars two piece lids clean towels or paper towels and clean hot pads to begin canning wash jars and prepare lids according to manufacturer's directions jars should be clean but it isn't necessary to sterilize them if they are processed for at least 10 minutes berries may be covered with your choice of apple or white grape juice syrup or water a hot or a raw pack may be used let's go through each method for a hot pack method place berries in a boiling syrup juice or water and boil for 30 seconds fill clean jars with the hot berries and the juice or syrup leaving 1/2 inch headspace wipe the edge of the jar with a clean paper towel or cotton towel and attached prepared lids and rings hand tighten and then process in a boiling water Tanner fill your canner with hot water and preheat to 180 degrees Fahrenheit 140 degrees Fahrenheit for raw pax load hot filled jars into the canner making sure that the jars have at least one inch of water over the top of the jars add hot water if needed cover with canner lid when the water boils vigorously lower heat to maintain a gentle steady boil then start the timer for the recommended processing time half pints pints or quarts when hot pact are processed for 15 minutes for raw pact process the pints for 15 minutes when processing quarts using the raw Peck method process for 20 minutes if you need additional information on hot water processing refer to our module for specific information after processing time is completed remove jars from the canner with a lifter and place on a towel or rack do not retighten rings air-cool jars for 12 to 24 hours and then check seals an indented top indicates sealing use a spoon and tap gently on the lid a clear ringing sound indicates a sealed jar while a dull thud tells us it hasn't sealed labeled jars and store them in a clean cool dark place if the lid did not seal the jar maybe reprocess using a fresh lid or it can be refrigerated and used immediately or the headspace can be adjusted to one inch and the product can be frozen berries are best if consumed within one year and safe as long as lives remain vacuum sealed let's take a look at other berries that you may find during your berry picking outings this is a list of the palatable berries bearberry timber berry bunchberry rose hips elderberry crabapple thimble berry now let's take a thorough look at those berries that are poisonous there are only a few but they should be avoided at all costs Bain berry grows in the woods and on dry hillsides the leaves are sharply pointed with three or five leaflets the berries are red or white and opaque with a shiny surface and a black dot the berries are on a stalk separated from the leaves a few berries if eaten by a child can kill Devil's club grows in coastal forests and forms a shrub up to twelve feet tall the leaves are large and maple shaped with spines on the leaves the berries are bright red on a separate stalk wild callow lives in shallow water along the edges of lakes and slow-moving streams the leaves are heart-shaped and have a thick stem the very fruits with a soft red berry the entire plant contains poisonous acids never eat a barrier you can't positively identify if you don't have a good Barry identification book be sure to purchase one as with many wild products the production of berries is dependent on the weather rainfall and even the presence of insects so one year there may be an abundance of blueberries and the next there may be none ask your friends and neighbors about the berries they've seen and you'll know what to plan for each year whether you find lots of berries or just a few berry picking is always a great way to see the beautiful Alaskan countryside get some exercise and some good fresh air happy picking [Music]", "_B3NvN1oKBU": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] if you love having healthy smoothies in the morning but sometimes find it a real pain to put them together every day this video is for you today i'm going to be showing you how to meal prep protein-packed and micronutrient-rich smoothies for a healthy and hassle-free [Music] [Applause] week [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the metabolic living youtube channel my name is bella i'm the lead nutritionist and recipe developer here at metabolic living so today i'm going to be showing you how to meal prep smoothies i'm going to be diving straight in and this is the first big thing what do you use for a container how on earth do you meal prep a smoothie is that even possible well yes so there are two primary ways to go about this there are probably more ways but these are kind of the two that i use the first one and this is great for those of you who are plastic conscious eco-friendly and just try to reduce any of the plastic and the bpas and all that stuff that comes with it in your life so the first option is to use a mason jar or a glass jar just like this one um just make sure that it has a lid now it can either be a kind of pop-off lid like this or a securable lid either works fine little tip if you're struggling to find mason jars for like an affordable price go to your local thrift store they have a bunch i can guarantee you i've never been to a thrift store and not been able to find mason jars so i have a bunch of these a really really great way to prep smoothies um and it's waste free which is awesome if that just seems a little bit stressful and intense for you no worries totally get it the other option is to use big old ziploc baggies like this what's actually quite nice about these two and you can do this with a label on the glass ones but you can actually write what is in the pack and what you need to add so maybe a great one if you're a beginner at this um or if you just find that a little bit more convenient totally fine whichever one you choose um is going to be great and i'm going to show you how to do both today in this video okay so general rule of thumb here when you're creating your smoothie is to always start off with the dry ingredients so at the bottom of you know the jar or the bag whatever you're using it's always going to go things like flaxseed chia seed and then you start to add on your spices so maybe some cinnamon maybe some cocoa powder would also go in there nutmeg turmeric ginger all the um essentially dry ingredients they're going to go at the bottom of either your baggy or your jar then what you're going to do is add your produce whether this is fresh or pre-frozen it doesn't matter that's going to go up the top so i'm adding things like spinach um frozen berries organic of course avocado is awesome even my little secret smoothie tip riced cauliflower we'll be getting that uh to that in a little bit don't be freaked out i promise it's fabulous so yeah that's kind of the general order if you want to roll your own as we call it here at metabolic living but just create your own smoothie um i am going to show you two different recipes today so let's go ahead and dive in with the recipe number one it's our coconut mixed berry smoothie i'm gonna be making this one in our good old friend the mason jar really really delicious one very very simple low in the glycemic index and packed with nutrients so i'm going to do this one as i mentioned in my mason jar so just quite simply pop off the lid and i'm going to be starting off by adding one tablespoon of ground flax seed really great way just to add some fiber in here which of course can be lost with smoothies so popping in one tablespoon that's going at the bottom of our jar then i'm going to be adding half a cup of shredded coconut flakes again these are going to go at the bottom because they're dry ingredients so popping them on top of the flax then i'm going to be adding one ounce of spinach i do try and add dark leafy greens to every single smoothie it's a really great way to kind of disguise um dark greens which of course are so packed with micronutrients however i know some people kind of turn their nose up and they're like ooh so just pack that in there really nicely let me move this you guys can see just pack in that spinach i like to do about one ounce so really get it in there nicely and then the last ingredient for this very simple but very delicious smoothie is one cup of organic mixed berries so one cup and this is just gonna go at the top in fact just like fill up your mason jar if you can't see it press it on in there i've got berry hands now okay so there's your freezer pack ready to rock what you're going to do is pop this into the freezer and then just leave it until you want it and then when you're ready to eat it and i will show you an example of this later basically just pop on the lid i actually like to pour my milk directly in there and then pour it into the blender because it just helps it get out a little bit but i like to use one cup of unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk or whatever milk you fancy and then of course and this is really really important to making this a nicely balanced meal and including protein in every single dish which is such an important concept of making dishes metabolic which is what we do here at metabolic living you do need to add some protein powder now i do love to use the metabolic super protein it's just a phenomenal um product honestly from really the main reason is it's just really really high quality sourcing and that's very very important to me it's from grass-fed cows um which is crucial and it also has it's not just protein basically it has all sorts of other things um it fuels the metabolism it enhances your performance it supports your joints which is really really important and it tastes amazing so what i would then do is pour one cup of unsweetened nut milk into here pop it all into my bitter mix and then add a big old scoop of metabolic super protein in vanilla for this one so i'm gonna pop the lid on and pop it in the freezer and then we're gonna make smoothie number two in the ziploc baggie all right now we're gonna be making smoothie number two i don't actually think i have a name for this smoothie so i'm gonna just call it the bella special because it's an absolute favorite of mine at the moment i go through stages with smoothies um i love my immune boosting smoothie so definitely go check out that youtube video if you haven't but this one at the moment is just my go-to i think it's because it tastes like a chocolate frosty maybe i should call it a chocolate frosty smoothie i don't know but it's really really thick the texture is spot on with this one anyway for this one you are going to need the ziploc baggie we're going to be popping it in here today and i'm going to start off by adding one tablespoon of chia seeds so popping those in the bottom of my ziploc baggie there they are it's funny you can like hardly see them in there but they're in there moving that off to the side then i'm gonna be adding one tablespoon of um cocoa powder this is organic just please make sure it's unsweetened i know a lot of cocoa powders have like added sugars and actually like um dried milk and things so just make sure that you're getting one ingredient organic natural cocoa all right popping that off to the side then we've got our greens and our veggies in fact there's no fruit in this one so if you're following a low carb or ketogenic diet this one is perfect for you um one thing i always like to add is an avocado to smoothies because it really as i said just makes the texture spot on so pop in an entire half of an avocado oh gosh this is a risky business okay popping it in we're going to be adding again one ounce of organic spinach this can be frozen or fresh popping that in there and then my secret weapon organic riced cauliflower i know some of you are probably like oh this girl is so weird but just trust me on this you can't taste it at all and what it does it makes it so thick and creamy so i'm gonna add half a cup of cauliflower rice into the ziploc baggie there we go love it okay popping it off to the side oh and then we are actually done with this smoothie so now what i do is just push out all the air you don't really want air in there and seal it up and there it is my smoothie ready to roll and just like the other one what you do is freeze this until you're ready to use it open it up it's a lot easier just to get the contents out into the vitamix here but you can add the milk too so i like to dump this into the vitamix add again one cup of unsweetened almond milk or whatever nut milk you fancy and then of course our good old friend metabolic super protein definitely recommend this one and you pop in one scoop juice it up and you'll be ready to go here is one i made earlier our coconut berry smoothie so as mentioned what i'm gonna do is my nice bitter mix i'm gonna pour in one cup of unsweetened almond milk so pouring that in as i mentioned i like to just kind of pour mine directly in like that then i'm pouring this entire thing into my there it is all coming out like so sometimes the flax and stuff gets stuck on the bottom not a problem at all that's what spoons and spatulas are for so just kind of scoop that out make sure you're getting every last drop of goodness popping that off to the side putting in our good old friend metabolic super protein big old scoop be generous with this because it really makes the smoothie delish and actually makes it filling which is really important now all we have to do is pop on the lid just it up until it's nice and smooth and creamy pour it into a glass and we can enjoy it straight away okay we are looking good oh it's so delicious i love this one okay so all you have to do pour obviously into your glass i have a little bit of extra which is always nice and there we have it a meal prep smoothie

berries and enjoy lidless snack is a staple in my kitchen in something I eat almost every week some salty and healthy popcorns you can either cook them on the stovetop with a little bit of olive oil or make them completely oil-free by cooking them in a microwave so for the stovetop version you will add two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to a medium pan and let it heat for two to three minutes on low heat when hots add half a cup of kernels give him a shake and cover the pan in the meantime prepare the seasoning mixing half of a teaspoon each of garlic powder oregano and onion powder and a quarter of a teaspoon each of pepper cumin chili powder and a pinch of salt on a small bowl if you have you can also add one tablespoon of nutritional yeast to the mix to a delicious

"[Music] now what you want to do with raspberries is you want to make sure that you don't soak them in water or anything like that prior to dehydrate them you want them to be extremely dry so if you rinse them off you're going to want to set them up and let them all dry so what I like to do is I like to take my raspberries and I like to put them on the tray like this and the reason I set them up like this is what we keep their shape if you put them on the side they tend to flatten down and they lose their shape and you want to look pretty when you're done setting them all up like that you can you can take a little bit of fun lemon spread it just might be missed them lightly missed them just like that that's all they need these aren't really nice and firm raspberries they're not mushy as you can see I have them in my hand and I'm pushing on them nice and firm those are the ones you want if they're older raspberries they'll tend to turn darker in color and they won't be as nice as this so if you really want a really fresh raspberry you'll get a better end product if you start the really fresh one now these raspberries will probably take about 18 to 20 hours and that's how long it takes about 125 is what I put them on and I think them in there for about 18 to 20 hours these raspberries have been in there for 20 hours and as you're gonna see if it turned out really nice they're really lightweight and really crunchy and hearing if I crunch up see how they fall apart okay this is what an older raspberry looks like and here you have a fresher raspberry so you want to start off with a fresher product but if they're not that's okay if they taste just as fine like this but they look a lot nicer like that they're great on cereal the greatest snacks kids love them and there you have it that's how you do raspberries [Music] you", "9mr2hrvNClE": "hey guys welcome back to episode 5 of the summer shred series today I'm going to show you some vegan vacation snacks that don't

lug around a jug of protein powder the amazing grass company the Garden of Life company and Vega are all three great brands that make individual packets you can also opt for a ready to drink protein drink like the kale natural brand or the or game brand and of course protein bars are super tasty and very convenient des naturals no cow bar and the fermented vegan proteins brand are both great replacements for the quest fire they are both made with the IMO syrup and have a high protein low carbohydrate macronutrient ratio but a few other great brands would be the 22 days nutrition brand PGX Santa's fast in bar and rice bar single serving yogurts like hemp yogurt soy yogurt coconut yogurt and almond yogurt are also an easy and convenient snack to bring along with you while they do need some refrigeration you can easily place them in a cooler with some ice packs mix in some berries nuts and seeds a little bit of protein powder if you choose a great healthy tasty snack to bring along

rice cakes are easy and tasty they come in a variety of different flavors and require no refrigeration though they can get a bit messy in the car sweet potato chips or freeze dried veggies and fruits are great for munching on likewise you can also bring freeze dried vegetables the Explorer Asian brand bean noodles or even instant rice and simply add the hot water from the coffee pot to those if

to show you how to prepare this do the trivet we're going to cook it we're going to rest it and we're going to carve it and it's going to be absolutely amazing i've got three cuts of beef here that are very very common i've got the top side of beef that's the most affordable and it's leaner we've got the sirloin beef here now you know the sirloin steak but this is a chunk to roast it's easy to carve quicker to cook and it's always tender and then roast four rib of beef it will easily serve 10 people and the leftovers of all of this is amazing so the preparation is the same for all three cuts top side of beef i'm gonna do and what's really important is get your meat out of the fridge one hour before you want to cook it and that way it will stay juicier and more tender give it a little drizzle with some olive oil give it a nice little rub up and then i want to season it quite generously with salt and pepper rub it over and just roll the meat all over the seasoning put a little oil into a tray let's get that on a high heat and first of all i just want to get some color on this beef and start to sear it now what you'll notice is the top side is very lean but if we look at the sirloin and the four rib i wouldn't have to add oil to that i would score the fat like this and i will place it fat side down in a pan and render the beef fat once you feel you've got a little bit of color get some tongs and turn it over now while this is browning off i want to make a trivet just clank up some celery about half a celery one onion a whole bowl of garlic and then two carrots just cut into big chunks and then herb-wise i love using a few bay leaves and some rosemary all of this goes in now this trivet is gonna do two things first of all it soaks up all the juices from the beef and it creates the basis for the most incredible gravy or ju to go with your roast beef secondly you can see you put the beef on top so that way it's not frying on the bottom of the tray this top side of beef is going to go straight into the oven at 180 degrees celsius which is 350 fahrenheit for an hour and a quarter so for all the cooking times for the beef or any other cut of meat then just click over to jamielev.com and i've got a whole load of stuff that will support you get it absolutely right every single time so look at that really beautiful let it rest for half an hour if it's an even bigger cut of meat let it go 40 minutes 45 minutes when you're roasting meats or even grilling meats you know that heat is pushing the moisture into the middle right so you need to let it rest just so the moisture comes back right so it's juicier and more tender and it just lets it get to a better temperature have a look in this tray all this love is going to be the basis of your gravy put it onto a high heat add some flour a heaped tablespoon will go in so we get a nice thick gravy then just squeeze all the beautiful garlic out of the skins i can mush up the onions i'm going to use a little red wine just a little half glass goes in roast beef red wine it makes sense right the smell is absolutely amazing the little secret ingredient that i love is just some beautiful jam that little sweetness really helps the gravy sing really really nicely about a liter of stock goes in bring this to the boil and then simmer this for about half an hour the same time you rest the meat and it's going to be delicious in the half an hour that it's taken for the beef to rest lots of beautiful things happen if you see in our little platter here you get juices that come out you put those juices into your gravy pour that gravy through a coarse sieve look how gorgeous and thick and wonderful that gravy is one little tip on the gravy if you just pull it to the side of the gas hob as it boils it will push any kind of fatty bits or any scummy bits to one side and you can get rid of that and we've got lovely boiling gravy then let's talk about the meat now when it comes to the carving you know with a sirloin or a forum it's very very tender you know with a topside it will be tender but it is a little bit leaner so we want to go nice and fine you need to invest in a nice long carving knife so get the carbon knife and do nice long strokes go as thin as you can so you can see this beef is nice juicy and blushing if you cook it 15 minutes less you can go medium rare this is medium look at that what a joy absolutely beautiful and of course no roast is finished without roast potatoes and yorkshire pudding this is the kind of food that just makes you so happy i've got some horseradish sauce which is one of my favorites beautiful and then hot gravy gorgeous dark rich gravy so good it's not right unless you fill up the yolks you put in with gravy come on so look at that guys the most incredible roast beef with all the trimmings if you want the recipes for the yorkshire puddings the perfect roast potato the horse radish then go at jamielav.com where the recipes are and thousands more there you go guys fill your boots and get cooking everyone knows how to roast a chicken but i've got a method that takes it up three notches are you interested let's do this royal style let's talk about the shopping chicken this is a hundred day old chicken you'll easily serve six to eight people beautifully slightly smaller this is a label on glaze it's been corn fed a little bit you can see the color we've got a little pusan here right corn fed again and then here we've got an organic chicken delicious so the one i'm gonna do is a nice little label on glaze first up finely chop some herbs i've got some marjoram here parsley basil season with salt and pepper add a nice couple of lugs of olive oil mix it up the oil will help bring out all the natural flavors and oils from the herbs and then we're going to get our chicken if you can get a dry plant chicken the skin is so crispy and it's delicious what i want to do is just run my knife around the top of the legs and score that skin like that and then just pop that little ball joint take the end of the chicken leg off and when it cooks and roasts it just looks beautiful put the chicken on its side and i want this thigh meat to cook at the same rate and speed as the breast meat so i'm simply just going to do three confident slices down to the bone and it also allows your flavoured oil to get in there with the breast right i want you to be very very careful here is the end of the skin i want you to pull it towards you so you don't tear it and just get your finger in between the skin and the breast make a little pouch and then i'll use a little spatula to get right down there divide these herbs by half and again i don't want to tear that chicken skin wonderful look at that just get two slices of butter and i'll ram these down the chicken breast so that's gonna make your chicken breast juicier than ever it's going to make that skin crispier than ever there's one other trick that i've got lemon now if i put a cold lemon in there the hot air is not going to get in and it's not going to be kind of cooking as even as i'd like it so we've got a hot lemon that i'm going to just stab and this is basically a boiling hot citrus thyme bomb now we're going to tie this bird up take a little bit of our butcher's string get it in half put it just under the legs like this take it up to these little notches here and i'm going to do a little knot tighten it up go in between the breasts and the legs turn it over you do another little knot and it's just going to keep it in shape and it means you get a nice neat even cook with all the kind of remnants of the oil and the herbs you rub that all over the chicken and it's really a spectacular thing into a tray we go a whole bowl of garlic two onions cut those in half i'm gonna cook it at 225 degrees celsius for one hour it's gonna be spectacular [Music] look look look at that you know it makes sense so good the string holds it all together but you know that that chicken's done when you can pull the meat off the bone and when the juices run nice and brown if you look in here you can just take skins off these bits of onion we're going to have the best best gravy i'll put this heat on add just a heap tablespoon of flour just mush it all up you don't even need stock just top it up with some water bring that to the boil this of course is the time where you let the chicken rest you finish your gravy and that's when you bring your salads or your greens or your potatoes all together so let's sieve out all of those chunks mega flavor take a little ladle and push it through look at that bring it back up to the boil and you're gonna have an amazing gravy let's look at our lovely chicken see how crispy that skin is how the herbs are trapped really really nice let's have a little carve up first up run the knife around the back of the leg and just click it and it will just fall apart cut it across like that giving you that beautiful drumstick and that wonderful thigh meat if there's any little juices that come out don't be afraid just to pour those back into your gravy because it's all flavour juices galore when it comes of course to the breast let's just take a nice little chunk here you can see the herbs underneath you can see the gorgeous crispy golden skin you can see that the breast meat is juicy juicy juicy that's what it's about guys the smell at this point from the lemon is phenomenal it's fragranced the whole of this amazing chicken this lovely gravy over the top of the chicken like this wonderful so that my friends is a classic roast chicken to savor and enjoy the gravy is amazing the skin is crispy the herbs and that juicy juicy meat enjoy happy roasting take care [Music] this pork recipe will change your cooking it's incredible let's crack on first things first find yourself a piece of pork that's gorgeous this will feed easily 15 people let's show you how to prep this pork what i'm doing is just cut in between the skin and the low in the pork so you can just whip that off your butcher will do this for you we've got the skin here our cracklings to be let's just look back at the pork we've got this lovely white fat i'm just going to score that all over i'm going to go for a herb kind of rub here so i've chopped up thyme and rosemary to flavor our skin and our pig salt and pepper all the way around just a little oil just helps all those herbs and salt stick to it for scoring crackling i have a little cooking stanley knife you want it to be shareable i'm just going to put the skin backside down first take this out i'm going to go back in with the skin side of the pork there i'm gonna brown this off turn it around and build up that beautiful caramelized flavor gorgeous with this recipe i promise you have the capacity to get people talking for years about what was that pork fish you did with the vinegar it's incredible so i'm going to put half a bottle of balsamic in here that vinegar before you think it is not smacking you around the head is soft it's mild it's gorgeous look at that this is going to create the most heavenly flavor so i'm going to put this into a tray pour all of this balsamic over the pork get some garlic cloves easily you know 12 cloves cut them in half or smash them and i'm going to put that in and around that juice so this goes into the oven here's the other little twist in the tail i'm going to put the pork skin straight onto the bars of the oven okay remember the heat's coming from the bottom and the top and then it's dripping on our pork down below which is creating the most amazing simple gravy that's going to really look after your pork guaranteeing juiciness that is going to be one of the most amazing pork dishes of your life promise i promise you promise you can go to one side the pork is rested already boom look at that dark gnarly gorgeous and then another little trick here with gravy if you pour it all out you can start seeing it separate and then what i like to do is just get a little jar skim off that fat and if a little bit of the juice comes with it it doesn't matter because when that's firmed up in the fridge that pork fat has got more flavor potential than any stock cube on the planet so you know next time you're doing some roasted carrots or roasted potatoes a little teaspoon of that a month later that's what cooking is all about this is a little friend that will look after your cooking that goes in the fridge here's your balsamic sauce use a little sieve oh and chuck it all over the place sorry guys i'm just going to squash the garlic cloves through that's going to add flavor you didn't see me make this mess fast forward it so you don't see it yeah so that just went in there perfect i've got an amazing side dish to go with this pork it's my fabulous uzi belotti beans and italian a gritty click on the link and i'll take you straight to the video with the crackling people fight over this stuff so i put this in and around the board that is what it's all about gorgeous moist delicious pork clean and juicy inside but notice here it's gnarly and dark and caramelized and garlic and balsamic it's been having a little bit of a fight up and a caramelise up so brothers and sisters from around the world this is a beautifully cooked pork loin with gorgeous natural gravy this dish will definitely change the way you look at sunday roasts delicious tasty and very yummy we're going to cook a whole fish in salt it's a bonkers old school method you can do it at home and also great to cook for a lot of people let's do it this dish is a showstopper your friends and family are going to love these fresh and bright flavors a five kilo whopper like this will feed about 20 people i've bought a whole load of rock salt get yourself like four or five kilos or enough to cover up the fish you're gonna cook so first up a little water so just a couple of eggs just cracked in like that just scrunch it up just a little egg is gonna allow the salt to kind of really go firm like a shell the salt will completely encase the fish sealing all the juices inside let's talk about our fish i'm going to cook a nice big one a salmon just look at that the gills are super red the eyes look at those you know it's fresh leave the scales on for cooking and salt always i've had it gutted we do not want the salt to go into this cavity so we're going to take any fresh herb we can get our hands on so i've got fennel here just rip it up i've got some marjoram some parsley some chives then grab some lemon that's just going to create a little humidity in the air it's that simple get yourself a nice big tray create a little base for the fish to go in this is a big old boy so i'm gonna go at an angle corner to corner then simply go over the top with the salt you want about two centimeters of salt under the fish and over and around the fish because when you kind of heat up that salt it's just going to bake hard it kind of creates like a kind of cocoon a cave and then you take it out of the oven it still carries on cooking in the salt because this is an oven this will be an oven so when you look inside that you're gonna have the most silky melt-in-your-mouth juicy fish ever and you're gonna think i'm mad but when you see what it looks like when it's cooked everything's gonna change let's whack it in the oven 40 minutes and we'll have a look bye-bye fish while that cooks at 200 degrees celsius i'm gonna make the ultimate accompaniment let's make proper mayonnaise i'm gonna go in with one egg yolk we're gonna start whisking this up i'm gonna go in with one teaspoon of mustard you wanna add about half a pint of oil if you add it too quick it will split trust me after the mild oil start to add some good punchy extra virgin olive oil to perk it up and whatever you do keep whisking but when you start doing this you will go through the threshold of pain and you can hold it differently and go for more of a shoulder whisk right and you'll get knackered again and then you go for more a little wrist section shoulder brisk now squeeze in some lemon juice add a splash of good quality vinegar and then season to taste but there's a secret bit i've got a little trick to make this mayo stand out from the crowd basil what i want to do is get the essence of basil okay so i'm just going to rip it up a good pinch of salt and bash it up i'll put a little bit of oil in there and then i need to sieve all those bits out we'll squeeze all the goodness out of it normally i'm a bit lazy bash it up smash it up big flavor get it in oh i don't mind all that pork chop but we ain't in that place today i just did an impression of myself and it was bang on okay back to this mayonnaise and look at the change of color homemade basil mayo nice now back to the fish it's had 40 minutes so test it with a knife hold it up to your lip if it's kind of warm and i mean sort of like cup of tea out for 10 minutes sort of warm beautiful you don't want it hot because that means you've overcooked it then leave the fish to continue gently cooking in its own salt cave for another 30 minutes time for a killer salsa you've guessed it i know chilli the punchy kick of the chili will work beautifully with the fresh meat kind of almost equal quantities yin and yang hit it with vinegar and olive oil and season have a little taste yeah now when it comes to serving up this meal really makes an entrance what's for dinner fishing salt sorry what you're fishing salt and you just go and everyone's like what's going on and then you start dismantling this cocoon and everyone's freaked out and then you start peeling back the skin and everyone's like ah and then you just start portioning up and everyone's like ooh anyway moving on the herbs here have stopped any salt getting inside and then just peel that skin back absolutely amazing and just look at that by cooking it in the salt all the moisture has been sealed inside it really is the juiciest fish you'll ever have absolutely gorgeous basil mayo taking it to the next level and then our chili oil every party's got to have someone that's a little bit uncoofed you know what i mean a few dirty jokes and this is our friend here you don't want him everywhere but just on a little corner of the table next to your mother-in-law is good and that my friends is fish cooked in salt with a badass ninja mayo [Music] hello you lovely people we're gonna make beautiful crispy juicy tasty perfect crackling you're either a lover or a hater but if you love a my lure people go mad for them crispy savoury salty explosive little mouthfuls of joy which i'm going to give you some simple tips to guarantee you the best cracklings every single time and often cracklings are a byproduct of roasting a joint of meat but not today we're going to do dedicated crackling so let me show you a foolproof way to do it first thing that's very important is get yourself some good skin from a lovely free-range pig it does make a difference in the flavour for everyday cracklings about a centimetre of fat is perfect any less than that it's going to go dry and leathery any more than that and it might just be a little bit kind of wobbly we don't want that either you see this bit's a little fatter than this so we'll get a knife just like that you can get your butcher to do this for you and if you get that little bit of fat like that you can just slice that up and that will render in this tray and melt away and just help everything fry up beautifully so secondly slicing so we want to slice this crackling about a centimeter thick so lay your skin out fat side down and that way it's going to render much quicker there's little gaps in between and then get a second tray this is the first tip and put it on top and press it down right it'll just stop it kind of bending up too soon so this goes in an oven at full whack so this is 250 degrees celsius which is 500 fahrenheit for 10 minutes and then i'll show you what to do next right time for a little clean down so you can hear it frying it's had 10 minutes the reason for that tray was to weigh down that fatty side to render that back quick now we close that oven door right it's sizzling in there and what we want to happen is this kind of sort of souffle like puffing like popcorn so 10 minutes maybe 15 minutes but it's a perfect time to make some flavored salt now flavored salt is the it's the next level it's a brilliant thing so let's do this a little bit of chili fennel seeds just take a little bit of lemon zest one little nick makes all the difference have a nice little bash up it already smells amazing but get it as fine as you like and that is the potential for amazing seasoning we're going to get our salt muddle it up can you see it changing color and then we would shake this on a tray just leave it overnight the humidity from the citrus it would go then we can smash it up put it in a jar and it's good for months so there is our little seasoning and if we just taste a little bit oh brilliant now coming up look at this popping crackling that is texture that is an explosion in your mouth this is the critical stage you know if you forget it you'll burn it right and literally when i do this at home i just watch it like tv and my kids think i'm so weird but when i take the crackling out and i season it up and i put it over there to cool down every single time i go and do another job i come back it's all gone just crumbs right so the kids might mock me and they might mock you but they're gonna love your cracklings that's all i can say this my friends is perfect cracking look at that look how beautiful they are just amazing for all your mates that might have enjoyed crackling down the pub they have never tried anything as beautiful as this so it's kind of the magic of taking something that's really not edible and creating into something that's not just edible but delicious i would even say like a glass of champagne and some fresh cracklings and then last but not least it's seasoning with the salt now the fat don't go throwing that down the drain a because it'll block the drain up but b that's good fat there you know that's from a healthy really really beautiful animal right so that fat is gold dust in the world of cooking that goes on your roast potatoes or even that and cooking some scampi or some scallops you know that is really really good stuff so what i love to do is get yourself a little heat proof glass jar let this cool down a little bit take a herb like sage or rosemary use those herbs to flavor that fat we can just pour this into our jar very carefully and that will offer up so much flavor to future cooking so do not throw that away ladies and gentlemen homemade cracklings a thing of beauty very decadent and a lot of love in there the question is do you like it straight or do you like it curly i think i like it curly right and that's not sound effects that is proper true crunchiness joyful always good what you waiting for nip out down the butchers buy some skin yeah let your hair down have some fun enjoy let's just let's just talk about the perfect yorkshire pudding that beautiful little thing that you can put gravy in it's great with roast dinners you know crispy on the outside bit chewy down here let's do it first up big bowl whisk and i need four eggs i'm using beautiful fresh free-range eggs and we're gonna whisk those up i'm using a big bowl so we can get some nice air in there then i'm gonna go in with 200 milliliters of whole milk 200 grams of plain flour now you can sift it you know when you sift it it just makes it nice and light and no lumps we don't want lumps in there so just whisk up your batter as you can see now it's nicely whipped up i'm just going to add a little pinch of salt and nothing else that's basically it now we want it to just coat the back of the spoon it should just stick nicely to it [Music] that's the batter made what i do want to do is get it from a bowl which is perfect for making it into a jug because that's perfect for pouring it quickly because that is another important part that i'll talk about in a minute we are using a sunflower oil you can use a ground nut oil or a sunseed oil absolutely these are oils that can handle high heat we want one centimeter in each mold so i'm going to fill up these three and what i like to do is then just gently but evenly pour the oil all the way along and by the time you hit the bottom you'll have absolutely perfect exact measurement across every single one and i know what you're thinking i know i invented it or at least i think i did now we are going to preheat our oven to 190 degrees celsius i've got one in there already okay it's been in there for about 15 minutes so my preheated oil comes out this is very hot i'm going to go in with my batter here i'm going to use a spoon what you don't want is loads of batter touching the side if you have batter in between what's going to happen is that will drag your yorkshire pudding down and it will stop it rising as efficiently and what's happening now you can see the hot oil is starting to cook the batter on the outside and as we put this in the oven the heat of the oil is going to push the batter up the side to create that lift okay we're going to go straight back into the oven and we're going to close the door and we're going to leave it you want to dedicate the whole oven just to yorkshire puddings they're going to cook for about 20 to 25 minutes until golden and crispy and gorgeous you're gonna love it ah come on baby yeah so for me guys this really is the perfect yorkshire pudding you can go bigger you can put more batter in but then i think it goes too crispy and too dry i like this kind of size i like the kind of balance of crispiness around here and the chewiness from inside look what you got there absolutely gorgeous i want to show you guys something even more incredible uh to go with yorkshire puddings that's not the usual thing so i've got some nice smoked salmon i'm gonna put it down onto a beautiful board or platter to complement that i want a little simple sauce now you could use sour cream yogurt or creme fraiche just beat it up and i'm going to add just the juice of one lemon here's a fresh horse radish so we're gonna peel the horseradish the little grating over the salmon just like snow what i like about this is it's contrast fire and lightness it's beautiful just mix it up just going to take some of this dill and from a height just pick it and then freshly cooked hot yorkshire puddings loading it with that hot sour cream and horseradish sauce a nice bit of smoked salmon and then just find a quiet little moment where you and that beautiful combination can just tuck in okay guys we're going to bring together two of the most incredible things in the world the roast and the curry yes you know it makes sense this is a proper weekend treat an amazing alternative to a sunday roast so here i have the beautiful shoulder of lamb beautiful sweet meat that over the course of time will just reward you with tenderness and beautiful pulled meat it's gonna be epic so first up we need a spice paste let's get some flavors going i want to go in with one thumb size piece of ginger my thumb not yours add a whole bowl of garlic a pinch of salt and pepper and one red onion just peeled and quartered and thrown into here as well next up some serious lamb loving spices mustard seeds just a tablespoon these are going to give great flavor almonds the nice little handful goes in a nice generous pinch of cumin what we want to do is we want to flavor the lamb kind of marinate the lamb but create like a crust that's just outrageous so next pick it up with some fresh chilies i'm going to go in with two but you spice it as you like it we're then gonna whiz this up now add a lug of olive oil a tablespoon of vinegar and two tablespoons of lovely yogurt i can smell that already now have a little taste oh oh even raw absolutely delicious i'm packing a curry into a roast so these flavors need to go deep into the meat get yourself a knife and go about two inches deep as you go in just sort of twist in twist in twist in twist twist twist twist twist twist that secret ingredient number one okay curry leaves they're like little mini bay leaves just run your hands down the stalks and you get these the smell is phenomenal now stuff those leaves right into the meat and that's what i call proper flavor happening there spread your marinade under and over your joint it's going to stick to the lamb to kind of be this lovely kind of encrustment look at the colors so beautiful just going to put some water in there to sort of give a little bit of moisture to the air and you're going to get incredible sort of sticky goodness in the bottom of that tray give it a little drizzle of olive oil and just look at that what a pitcher that's going to go into a hot oven let's say about 220 degrees celsius for about 20-30 minutes just to kind of get this kind of crusting up then i'm going to turn the oven right down to about 130 degrees celsius nice and low cook it for three to four hours until it's sort of pullable and you can just pull it all apart and in the bottom of this tray we're gonna make the best gravy ever so three and a half hours has passed that last little moment when it just kind of dances that's what i'm after boom look at it gorgeous and just like your sunday roast the best gravy comes from the tray you want to save all of this lovely goodness and just pour away that pure fat okay bring it to the boil and give it a makeover with some fresh flavors so we're going to go back with our friend mr mustard seeds just find a little spot of fat and then just put a little heaped teaspoon in they're going to start popping they have wonderful flavor we're going to go back in with some fresh curry leaves just for sort of vivaciousness and freshness then we're going to go in with the sliced red onions nice fast heat aggressive quick give it a stir i love the way it's so immediate in with the ginger then we're gonna go in with some green chili again nice and fresh a small bunch of coriander half to go on my dish and half the stalks washed to get chopped up and put into this sauce it's almost like stir frying now we're moving it around and then last but not least some tomatoes this is like the best of roast gravy this is the best of a curry sauce i'm just gonna add a very important ingredient coconut milk as soon as this comes to the boil it's ready let's have a go that's naughty that's very naughty needs a nice pinch of salt he's gagging just for a little bit of lemon just to lift it all that's left is to platter it up your sunday roast will never be the same again i'm serving it up with a lemony green salad crunchy poppadoms and some fluffy basmati rice that as a feast is really amazing let's not forget that naughty sauce look at that guys you have to say that is a celebration if you did this at the weekend i think people are just going to go absolutely mad for it and that is going to be a precious little mouthful that outside layer of the lamb is so good the inside is sweet and juicy tender and with the gravy or the sauce outrageous so next time do something a bit different yum the maris piper is an incredible incredible potato fluffy and starchy the peeling of the potatoes you don't need to see that i've got them par boiling in here in salted boiling water they're kind of that size cook them for about 10 minutes the best roast potatoes i've ever made have come from a time when i almost felt i'd overcook them and create a mashed potato okay so you need to tread that line very very very carefully so i can see they're just kind of thinking about breaking up pour it into the colander this steaming part here now is also incredibly incredibly important it's starting to get starchy see it go kind of fluffy and white and little kind of flecks and flakes of broken bits of potato these are the things that are going to give you crispy bits and we love crispy bits and a crispy outside okay really really important in tray number one cold pressed extra virgin olive oil three tablespoons lower in saturated fats so we love that we're going to move on butter and olive oil half as much and then a nice knob of butter butter is going to give you incredible flavor and a sort of lovely sweetness but also a strong contender for gorgeousness is goose fat you can get it in all the supermarkets three or four tablespoons in there you're going to get a richer flavor it could be pork fat it could be beef tallow i love all of them but i generally sway for the butter and the olive oil but at christmas i kind of go for the goose fat because it's so good a little secret ingredient that i do a swig tablespoon of red wine vinegar it will disappear and what's left is a really subtle kind of tang it just helps make the perfect roast potato then herbs so let's go to the olive oil here get in some lovely rosemary put it under a hot tap if you put it under a hot tap it just wakes up the natural oils in the rosemary okay so rosemary goes in and of course best friends with garlic leave the skin on the skin will protect the garlic and it will release the garlic-ness very gently the whole bulb of garlic trust me guys then we're going to go to the olive oil and butter sage is a classic beautiful beautiful fragrant herb that goes in and then we've got clementine you could use any citrus fruit but at christmas uh clementine's particularly good just the zest lovely that will make a difference it's gonna be really really good last but not least goose fat just go brave on bay leaves dried ones are okay fresh amazing four five six and then go in with some thyme we're gonna hit these up with some salt and pepper olive oil rosemary garlic clementine butter olive oil and sage and bay thyme and goose fat delicious now back over here while these little bad boys are steaming hot right we need to chuff them up scratching and scraping the edge chuffing right i've made it up okay look what i'm doing look what i'm doing you see how i've beaten that up right so that's good so we're gonna go in while they're hot just mix up all of these absolutely gorgeous so i'm gonna cook these in an oven about 180 190 which is about 350 fahrenheit over the period of about 50 minutes maybe an hour they're going to get gorgeous and golden and crispy but after about 40 minutes i want to show you the last little tip to make these incredible take the tray out of the oven after 40 minutes place the potato masher on top and then just let it pop and let the lovely starchy inside just puff out and then create a flatter surface area on the bottom and the top just do that around the whole tray and then pop it back in for another 10 minutes you can hear the sizzle have a little shake up you can see and you can hear there is crispy perfection in the house goosebumps potatoes the butter potatoes with the clementine the smell in this room is off the chart and last but not least the rosemary garlic and extra virgin olive oil crispy fluffy perfect tangy little gorgeous roast potatoes so obviously roast potatoes are only one part of the meal if you want to look at the other parts of the meal the gravy the meat different veggie options then click the link and we've got loads of wonderful recipes on jamielev.com and on foodtube that celebrate all things that go with roast potatoes but let's be honest guys everything in the world goes with roast potatoes hi guys hope you're well so i am going to hold your hand through preparing making and roasting tan with black pepper and marmalade which is a classic it's delicious so what we have here is a four four and a half kilo chunk of gammon this has already been salted but it's not cooked so what we do is we put it in a massive pot let it sit in that water for maybe an hour or two get rid of that water and that's not cooked right so we need to poach that put it on a heat with some root vegetables carrots celery you can put garlic in there if you want a little bouquet garni or a mixture of herbs i've got some orange zest in mine peppercorns and we'll slowly poach that for an hour and a half now i've done that so what we have here now is the skin attached to the fat so i'll remove the string like that and then i need to just pull them out like this now what we're going to try and do is keep as much as the fat on this as possible we're now just going to take a little pride in removing the skin but also evening out the fat so it's basically about that much all the way around so we've trimmed that skin off now i want to use the knife to lightly score the fat and what that's going to do is two things it's going to give you this kind of texture that allows the oven to render the fat quicker and go crispier and once you've gone across the whole ham then simply turn it across the other way and we'll go in at crisscross it's really easy it's really fun don't spend hours and hours doing this you've got way too much to do at this time of year so now i'm going to put this in the oven for about 20 minutes just to get the fat going and sizzling right so the oven is at 170 degrees celsius which is three to five fahrenheit and then i'll come back and i'll show you what to do next okay lovely people so it's had 20 minutes and in that 20 minutes it's just enough time to get a sizzle on we're gonna take our little spoon out you can angle the tray a little bit so we've already got juices coming out and we can start the basting process what we've done is just open up this texture to receive flavor now you can see i'm dusting this quite generously with black pepper and i like that kick salt is already in this story so we don't need to go anywhere near salt so on the marmalade just get that on the top and the heat will just start to naturally melt it anyway so as time goes on it gets thicker and thicker until it can't run off anymore and that is when you achieve perfection you can see now can't you that by creating those little crisscrosses it's clinging on black pepper and marmalade an amazing combination with that beautiful ham look at that so this goes in the oven now for an hour and it's going to go back in at 170 degrees celsius 325 fahrenheit and that temperature is a good one because it's not too hot it's not too cool and over the hour it's slowly gonna caramelize and kind of get tighter and thicker and stick to it more and keep glazing it until it is a thing of beauty right back in the oven okay so this bad boy has been going for about half an hour let's have a look come on look at that let's get basting you can get some of those juices going with a spoon by all means what i've done is get a load of rosemary and tie it up and create a rosemary brush now you might think i'm mad but i'm going to use the rosemary brush to not only impart flavor but also pick up that lovely marmalade and put it back on the hand it smells amazing oh my lord back in you go another 20 minutes to go [Music] so that beautiful ham has had a lot of love care and attention it's been poached and it's been roasted and glazed here we are oh my lord look look at that guys look at it absolutely stunning shining salty sweet gorgeousness so let's get this onto a board now while that is still warm just put the last remnants of that amazing marmalade on top as it cools down it will kind of firm up i want you to go back to your black pepper and trust me a beautiful dusting is gonna make a massive difference it's gonna be so good guys look at that come on that's what we wanted juicy juicy inside and that gnarly caramelized golden outside and no matter how you serve that whether it's with a big old buffet salads cheeses breads or with some mashed potato or fried egg or some bubbling squeak that my friends is one hell of a beautiful roast ham enjoy [Music] i've got a heaped tablespoon of grated chili grated garlic whole bowl there and a big old thumb size piece of ginger then one heaped tablespoon of tomato puree and then i'm going to start adding the spices [Music] now i'm gonna do what i swore i'd never do i will never be that person that puts on rubber all right gloves or outfit nothing there'd be people watching this around the globe jealous of this chicken [Laughter] the legs take longer than the breasts so score right into them but also it lets flavour in so i can get that beautiful marinade and rub it into all the cracks marinate the chicken for half a day if you can to really make it taste good we can speed up cooking by putting a really hot lemon in there boil the lemon for 10 minutes stab it all over and stick it up the jessie i want to add a few things to make the gravy or the sauce absolutely delicious [Music] put the bird straight on the bars for an hour and a quarter at 200 degrees celsius or 400 degrees fahrenheit let's have a little look what's going on here then get it on a board with some wedged up lemons fresh coriander over the top and then served with pickle yogurt poppadoms and a bit of crunchy salad [Music] and then let's have a look at our gravy action this is awesome flavor you've done all the hard work all you've got to do now is put it for an old sieve and just push it through a little bit of yogurt now just cut off this bad boy fresh inside attitude on the outside and for me the nut roast is about a beautiful dinner a beautiful meal textures contrast sweetness savouriness it's a wonderful opportunity to love your veg we're using some interesting things like quinoa nuts chestnuts spices dried fruit and i'm gonna put it together with a sauce and some melted cheese and lovely herbs you're gonna love it okay so first job preheat your oven to 180 degrees celsius 350 fahrenheit next let's chop up the squash i want to just dice up the squash into roughly one centimeter chunks i'm going to add a couple of tablespoons of oil let's get the squash straight in we're not going to completely cook stuff in the pan we're just going to take the rawness out and start sharing some flavors i'm using vac pack chestnuts here you can get them in all the supermarkets and if you put them in whole and bring them back to life by roasting them with things like rosemary okay they're absolutely delicious i want one onion let's just finely chop that two cloves of garlic celery we definitely want to start the process of seasoning with sea salt and pepper about half a teaspoon of cayenne a little pinch of smoked paprika i want one level teaspoon of dried oregano so i'm just going to quite crudely cut up a lovely couple of filled mushrooms about 40 grams of butter just a little bit of lemon zest gives a really nice contrast our veg here is off the heat now over here we've got 100 grams of mixed nuts brazil's walnuts hazelnuts cashew nuts next job i need to bash my nuts which is a lovely opportunity for you to get all the frustration in your life out but with good reason and purpose ah nice bashed up nuts i'm gonna put this into the bowl next in with the quinoa and the dry fruit four lovely large free-range eggs obviously the eggs are going to really help to bind the dish we're going to go straight in like that all the juices and we'll mix that up i've rubbed this dish with butter and i've just lined it with some greaseproof paper just to make it doubly safe that it just pops out nice and easy so i'm just going to pour this in with the nut roast like this squeeze as much as you can into there so now i'm going to whack this in the oven for 45 to 50 minutes i'm going to cook that until it goes golden and crisp and gorgeous then next i'm going to show you how to make a brilliant sauce that i'm going to sit that on so it's kind of cooking into each other with some melted cheese herbs and this sauce is called salsa rosa picante it's gorgeous so i'm going to put a little olive oil into the tray i'm going to get two chilies i'm gonna prick it if you don't prick it they'll explode in your face and i just wanna put the chillies in whole i'm also gonna go in with a stick of cinnamon some garlic just two cloves i'm just gonna get a small onion here cut it into quarters and then into eighths i'm going to go for this next part of the recipe with some thyme and just take the lovely little leaves off the stalk i'm going to put this on top of the nut roast just move that time around so it's coated in the fat and then it's going to crispen up and go gorgeous i'm going to put it to one side out of the heat go in with my tomatoes what we can also do is add just a little bit of balsamic vinegar one tablespoon and i'll turn the heat down to really low simmer it for 10 50 20 minutes to really develop the flavors and then i'll show you what to do with the nut roast next it's going to be gorgeous look at that tip it onto its side like so we could take that greaseproof paper off place this in to this amazing sauce and i'm just going to grate some nice bits of cheddar and that's going to give it amazing flavor it'll obviously melt and go gorgeous we can then put our chili on the top put the cinnamon on the top as well i've got those time tips remember put that over the whole tray pop it back in the oven now for about 10 minutes okay so let's have a little look at that i've purposefully

site you'll notice a few changes I'm desperately trying to roll some stuff in before we get even busier and also I build all that stuff so you will find Clara is now a payment option at checkout we're sort of trialing this but we've had half a dozen people use it already and I barely know how this thing works so um yeah I'm guessing this quite a lot of familiarity with it so it's basically you can pay now and then they give it depending on the size of your order you can do pay in three chunks so let's set hundred pounds you could pay in three chunks would be 33 pounds times three it's not very easy one two divided by three but you can pay just just to soften the blow of doing a a larger checkout and getting more of the goodies you want right now so it's it's kind of casual credit really and the other one probably the more popular one is just pay later so you buy now you pick now we send it out and everything and you can pay well anytime you want really but up to 30 days later and this is with Clara so we - you get to get your goodies now and it just gives you a little bit of a buffer if you're waiting for payday and you desperately want something exciting new things or supplements you need and the rest so that's on site now and we'll put in more details as a landing page about it if you follow the links I might add it to the product pages but I find it a little bit distasteful when they're sort of buy and purchase and credit banners everywhere and we're not that kind of store so I'd rather it were there as cover nice to have as an option if you're really strapped for cash or you're really desperate for something and you want yeah whatever it works use these things I don't want to try and twist your arm into buying stuff and then taking credit and then getting in trouble about it so it's there anyway it seems to be popular so far the search engines the various category pages sorry I know I shouldn't lead into these videos with the boring stuff but they they no longer page they should do the what they call infinite loading so the pages will just keep adding items to it as you scroll down and then there's our so load more options so you're probably very used to this it's sort of how the Facebook newsfeed works it just keeps going right it's like that so that might make things a bit easier and you can also quick Add to Cart from those pages so from the search pages and the brand pages the category pages instead of adding an item and it going to the shopping cart and then you having to go back to where you were you can just click add an item and unless it's a bundle one where you have to choose other things it'll just add that thing and then you can change the numbers or remove them from cards from basket at the end of the day so yeah that's my boring techy stuff there's other bits that we hit in site as well and I'm gonna try and speed the whole thing up a mobile and I've got a whole raft of things I want to do but yeah if I leave that stuff till the end it doesn't get a doesn't give it a proper introduction to you guys doing it and some of these features are worth doing and they're dreadfully boring to put online or to put into emails and you might miss it on site so I think if I fire it at you now you've got that in there anyway with that in mind that's a few minutes of boring stuff there so sorry if you've sat through that and you don't use the site or you're not in any way interested um it's a protein pick-and-mix dog code at UK as if you couldn't a guest right we'll get on with the new thing so we'll start with food as always and oh we've got a good variety of things here we're going to start with the outright bars because this is something I particularly have been excited about for a long long time it is hugely overdue so only makes sense to lead him with it here outline bars have been in the mix for or a year or so now I mean I'm time flies obviously they seem fairly new but I think they've just grown very quickly and a lot of flavors and supper arrived the brandings come along a long way in a short space of times this mark lobe liner of MTS's mts nutritions feigns mts nutrition's of mgs nutrition fame it's bar huh I haven't something like that and it's a functional foodie sort of one but it's a real food it's a whole food bar so a little bit unlike let's say from the USN bar we've got there the grenade bars the bevels bars all of the best-selling bars in the sort of sports nutrition industry this is far closer to handmade home bake sort of things so it's using you know tried-and-true ingredients yeah not the lowest calorie ingredients not the lowest sugar ingredients so it's it's oats so it's gonna be good source of carbs there but yes higher carbs excuse me peanut butter and who doesn't like peanuts those healthy fats it's good protein there as well keeps it moist makes it very decadent and enjoyable and he doesn't almond butter one as well so nut butters at the moment he's actually doing a sunflower seed one so it's gonna be nut butter Frese oh yeah those more stuff already lined up for 2024 mark and then chop chips flavoring accessory texture and the sweetness comes from not refined sugar but honey or in the case of vegan ones we've just got here maple syrup which is very exciting so this is a good source of like no GI energy and stuff so it did the sugars in here a great certainly if you're refueling after a workout he'll if you're using it as a pre-workout even but the really cool thing is there's none of the the crazy high fiber syrupy sort of stuff that goes into a lot of the bars at the moment like the quest bars back in the day the isomalt oligosaccharides and there's not a ton of sugar alcohols and stuff so essentially sugar alcohol-free which basically means nothing in here should cause any stomach distress they are higher calorie so it's about 300 calories for earn and our 60-gram bar and the proteins are tad lower so it's more like 15 16 17 grams so I think 18 on the banana walnuts the dairy one so it's not too bad but the protein slightly lower obviously the sugars are higher thanks to the maple into the honey but it's just yet you'll feel pretty good on these bars and because they're real food ingredients they're actually really satisfying so you won't you won't really feel that you need to stuff a couple of bars into a whole cookie or whatever you actually get a hell of a macro ticking kind of kick from these bars they they do they do feel good and it's obviously something that's suitable for everyone so in America they've had a lot of luck marks had a lot of luck breaking into like Costco and things so like more consumer stores because they are instantly familiar I mean months could give their kids for lunch boxes and stuff like that there's nothing scary in there at all like they are protein but they're not high protein they're not protein bars they just happen to have a good amount of protein in so it's interesting what the branding is obviously very very colorful and friendly it's getting better and better I don't think we've got any the old star yeah I mean this is an interesting one just because they started life like this and in fact the earliest batch had a glossy label so they went matte which was nicer but then they've morphed into things like this which is is obviously phenomenal it's so much nicer and it looks as outright delicious as it now tastes including the boxes they didn't come in boxes in the first place that's that's how crazy the whole setup was with mark giving us to market and making this kitchen with the family in every so you don't need a big long spiel we've been over it basically the big first here is the vegan so these are the first two vegan bars he's done there's banana walnut so it's a vegan version of the wave banana walnut we've had four sometimes one of my favorites so good candy banana taste comes through and there's a straight up choc chip so chop chip in the peanut butter in the almond butter have always been bestsellers they're kind of the classic the default the de-facto the yeah the the ones that are really going to sell the idea the outright bar idea so it's these the fundamental base tarted-up with chopped chips and you can't really beat it is a classic so we've got that in the vegan too and then there's the toffee so we're gonna start with vegan I'll show you this first and I'll take you through the toffee which is pretty spectacular but for the vegan I did debate not even showing you this because to be honest there's not a lot certainly visually between this and the way version of the same thing the original outright Barban and all that but I think that's a good thing I mean you might say you're boring and only see it then but the fact that there's no significant compromise between the dairy free version and the dairy version so yes mark had to lose the honey because I mean not being so easy to move to maple syrup which is which is great it's actually quite subtle in this dough I thought there'd be more maple flavor but yeah either way you would really tell the difference between the honey and the maple version so that's great and the who else has he done obviously the protein source has moved from sort of isolate way to largely P frog gene but again yellow split peas it's that highest-quality P protein as well there so obviously marks very fussy about this stuff there's no real compromised in terms of texture I guess because the peanut butters and stuff and add it in there is it's no drier yeah um I'll show you I'll talk as I might be actually waving it around so it doesn't smell vegan doesn't smell plant base you still get the same instant hit of sweetness the same instant kind of decadence right out of the packet it's kind of you can see its moist it's going straight up my fingers that's the nut butter doing that but also he keeps it what makes it very very easy to eat and enjoy so there you go very cute packages yes the the common obligatory vegan green and there are leaves kind of water marked on it but yeah very very nicely done subtle eye catching yeah it's a fantastic job really brought for something that you know marks put together himself and then in multiple iterations have improved on each other so yeah there's the bar it looks kind of like a sort of flat Jacky peanut buttery sort of blob aesthetically none of these things are too pretty but there's no coating or anything as you see it's just straight up kind of you know minimal ingredients on the label trustworthy enjoyable I mean with things this this kind of rich and flavorful you don't need to tart it up too much is that good so yeah so big dried banana chunks lovely you can see the walnuts in there real walnuts as well yep all natural and all that jazz yeah not a huge amount more to see than that but it's soft its chewy its satisfying this is bursting full of flavor um the banana is my favorite topic I think firstly because banana and maple or a classic combo go really well I've been on a maple french toast anything like that that's a winner but you get texture at the actual bar itself is sort of fudgy it's squishy it's yeah it's very pleasant it's a sort of thing that you imagine same with all these planets you imagine well the outright ones you could wedge together yourself at home but I think that's that's the wonder it's just in a convenient form factor it's cute it's not a bad price for it you get again real ingredients and the rest and it will not leave you feeling kind of bloated there's this minimal chance for actually reacting with you so that's what's really cool about these bars so it I think people are realizing the extra calories you tend to get for this and the slightly lower protein is worth it given how how clean it feels so they go pea protein right I this is a funny one I don't know I can taste pea protein in this but it's a million miles from offensive it's incredibly close to the original one but I I either I'm not sure that is part of me thinks because I'm eating this from a sort of academic perspective and I try all these snacks and I've been thinking about them for years and over analyzing them and doing all the ant stuff that I usually do that I'm I'm hunting that vegan that sort of savory taste to it and then saying yes it's in the bar because we've tried it with the team here and yes they know it's vegan too but the there seems to be some debate about whether or not there's there's any you can actually tell I think if you look for it it's there but I wonder if might the fact that I am looking for it has made me think it's there whereas if I gave it to someone who was unaware it was a vegan bar they'd probably be none the wiser I mean the fact is vegan plant-based or otherwise this is a delicious bar the fact that it's got pee in there doesn't really matter and if you are looking to avoid dairy for whatever reason forget the vegan thing you've suddenly got another sort of intolerance avoided with these wonderful outlined bars so yeah the maple I expected it tastes a little bit more and the P I'm I'm pleased it's a recessive as it is some of you may not even realize a significant difference but either way there's enough sweetness there to counteract any kind of slight savory tone you'd get from the pea obviously saying you know quality protein source there is actually rice protein in there too I think so it's actually going to be quite a complete protein thing usually they have to get a blend of the pea and the rice to simulate the dairy protein is a complete molecule and stuff with all the amino acids you want but yep it's lovely it's really really nice so Marc's been very excited about these partially because he scored a vegan bar that actually tastes really good but also just because it's something new and it expansion to the line so obviously he's there now looking at doing vegan friendly and no nut butter which is gonna be real first because these are always peanut butter based bars fundamentally and he's just launched a announced a higher protein like a chocolate brownie one with protein crisps in it so that's getting it closer to the 20 grams that you're more used to with the protein while so he's really taking all the boxes which is very cool so but I love on that trop chip hmm these are in the same outright delicious bundle you can buy it alongside the way ones and uh yeah I don't think anyone's gonna have any problem with doing that you won't big its Regan there is none of that at all it's a lovely bath I'll be ever so slightly high calorie so you get an extra sort of 20 calories I think versus the way versions of the same but the proteins roughly equivalent 17 grams in the banana and it's 16 gram from the top chip but yeah long time coming they're finally in the mix now so now even more people can enjoy these phenomenal bars next one you know type in mind you knockout I'll take you through this in a bit we've got the ice soda so if you're not go enough you need to try this guy so we'll come back to that right out right about one more time we've got toffee so let's bring this straight in no more ado I'll just kick the shelf top EE okay okay action stance yep this looks great we've got a butterscotch in it already we obviously got chopped chips we've got white chocolate cranberry we've got oatmeal raisin there's a ton of different flavors toffee when I heard about it I was that worth just much more much just like what's the big difference between the butterscotch and the topping actually there is quite a difference and what's really cool about it is I'm gonna say eight is probably my favourite I really do like the the dairy banana walnuts because I love the sort of phone Bonar or overtone to it with this one oh oh this is mad this is crack guys um with this one it's probably the sweetest and I have that rampant sweet tooth the same thing that made me create this company and this is probably the sweetest outright bar of them all butterscotch is up there the banana is up there to be honest and what's the other one that's pretty sweet the s'mores well it's sweet by virtue of what's in it but it's not inherently it's not as sweet as a base anyway so it's shut up you can see the same thing that same sort of flaky fudgy chewy part flapjack part kind of nut butter bar texture going on see what I'm trying to show you is rough these aren't decorated they have actual toffee chunks in them and they are so nice you can just about see it there's a toffee chip and I get the thing to focus see you at the corner there right there there yeah it's full of those so um we actually did a peanut butter common what we called it actually toffee peanut butter chunk or something like that but we had back in the day I think was the last pick-and-mix when we actually launched it was full of these they are when I usually get them on okay you know the cart door ice cream with a caramel can't do ice cream it's the chunks all over that so they're very soft there's no hard chewy it's not like taffy or anything it's not hard candy it's not like a word there's original crunch of toffee it's very very soft very very giving like you know you bite it and it just it melts away but it adds to the fundamental sweetness the decadence of this thing it's I mean yeah toffee but you could call it a fudge bar or something basically I'm thinking oh you know all Marc would've needed to do was put some sprinkles on this and it would have been a birthday cake bar he hasn't done a birthday coke on yet I wouldn't be surprised if one appears at some point giving me a number of flavors he's banging out we got cursing creaming before too long white chocolate peppermint bark I think's coming before too long we did manage to score some of those I think fingers crossed sorry um anyway yeah this is the sweetest of them all yeah they're so it gets my vote there but I love the toffee chunks in it so it's it's kind of powerfully flavored but understates at the same time if you like the sweeter side of these things if you're a big friend of the butterscotch and stuff all right you're gonna love this one too if you are kind of more on the slightly less I mean all sweet but the the choc chip the oatmeal raisin side of things just grab one or two of these in your next out work bar 12 bar mix on the site and I think you will I think you will thank me because this was an instant kind of opened the packet by tear oh my god yes he did it he pulled this one off so yeah very excited about this it doesn't really much more than that it's the same fundamental outright barbed magic but with extra toffee chunks and it doesn't get any sweeter and more over-the-top so I'm telling everyone to buy this one now and it provided you like things mad sweet and you're not gonna find a nicer bar so yeah 70 grams of protein in that 300 calories so again slightly higher for the outright ones on the dairy side but yeah it does it does taste phenomenal and you're not gonna be able to eat more than one of these because it's gonna hit that sweetness spot so nicely okay that's out right done I am oh bloody hell probably 18 minutes in well okay so I sold a knockout let's do this one here so I'm ready for an energy drink slightly odd one for me today because I was I think I mentioned the last video going to see a concert last night so I saw slipknot finally and so he goes the I so does the brand new flavor of NACO to me I'll take you through you know not going so it's the BCAA fortified it is fundamentally an energy drink they have some caffeine free versions but you get 180 milligrams of caffeine in just three hundred and thirty milliliters which actually gives it quite a good kick it's a little bit fizzy so it's not still like some of the 3ds and things like that it does keep a little bit extra effervescence but because it's actually less liquid here and the liquid itself is kind of more crammed with caffeine you can sip it more slowly and still get that kick from it so even doing Crossfit it's a big market they target with this you're not going to have any it's not gonna be to unsettle from having the knocker so no Coke no carbs company don't back the the origins of the name there it has BCA's 4:1 ratio leucine Bravo even you know the you Jam there so we've been doing knock over ages always been a best-seller in the mix I think Miami main tonight remains the bestseller but going back tropical Zoe's done well passions always done well red berries or is done quite well Caribbeans always done quite well some of them the flavors are too sharp for some we do get that feedback in like almost bitter but I think it's because the amount of caffeine in the drink they have to lean quite heavily on the flavors too to make up for the sort of caffeine bitterness and that works for some people but not for others which is why also the caffeine free varieties the citrucel the clown and the Apple are particularly popular because they don't have to cover up quite such a tang of caffeine so yeah if you find some of the other flavors 2-mile but you still want to prove that you're not go enough then the caffeine free the stim free ones are actually really nice soft drinks anyway this one caffeine one good one to kick off the year it's got a kind of frosted label iced soda we're in the deepest darkest depths of winter right now so it's quite appropriate thing is it's a kind of tropical flavor it's quite a mild one so it's not gross concern which makes this one of my absolute favorites it's sort of tutti fruity so I actually get banana weirdly but it's a kind of exotic banana we taste there's probably a hint of lemonade underneath the whole thing mmm yeah it's some reminds me ever so slightly of Malabar chewing gum I don't know if you you know that is it chewing gum or Malabar choose I think you get them in um this would I remember then holidays to France and stuff but the kind of yellow sticks I used to buy tutti frutti here as a kid I think they were like 5p i mean they'd probably be like 5 pounds now god knows what the inflation is on it but this is sort of like a taffy banana flavoured fruity sticks taste just like that anyway wasn't what I was expecting it's much nice than I was expecting I thought it would just be a lemonade it's actually this tropical tutti fruity thing so yeah best served ice cold rock as we've said this is actually a yeah right up there for me in terms of the knockout flavors this is possibly my favorite certainly the first one I'd reached for at the moment and we'll see how it did does going into the summer but if anything I'd say it's a more summer appropriate flavor so thank you knock over this he was nice to work with the guys that hooking us up with some stuff and it's just rain companies Barry bells as you guys know bitumen wells have mentioned this before bear bells we don't have anything new for you at the moment obviously we prefer bars to energy drinks so much as we love our energy rings bear bells I think April I think they're targeting some exciting stuff coming so look out for that and yeah they're in the mix now so you can there's a knocko ice soda specific listing so you can buy cases on their single cans obviously the more you buy the cheaper it gets so you can do or if you want to mix and match them you can go on the sort of general knock oh there's a separate it's a bit confusing there's a separate list with all the knockout flavours are sort of dropped down and again there's the 24 I think per can is one pound 45 when you buy a case of 24 so we've put a keen price and because we like sharing these things and you can mix and match your trace you can do six six if you know you really it's just to make up your 24 or more so yeah they're in the mix right now and yeah doing very very well indeed so that was a pleasant surprise to see my nice my favorite not Co flavor for a while and being as busy as we are all the energy we can get it's always popular right now oh okay oh I done not go done okay two more service brands I think you can call them slightly more run-of-the-mill certainly in the UK brands you're seeing all over the place yes there's grenade now but things like PhD and USA and we will start with we've done bars we're gonna jump to the the PhD this is a bit of a novel one they're calling it a cake so I'm gonna bring this one in I say they're calling it a cake you'll see what I mean it isn't really a cake it's cakey but it's a cookie of anything so yeah as you notice it doesn't look like a big story cake it is a flat cookie thing so yeah there you go I'll open it up and you can see what I mean so it's still very very nice 15 grams of protein less than 2 grams of sugar wants two grams of sugar across the four flavors we have of these so we've got birthday cake we have got where are they let's take it we'll go through you going there there's a carrot cake whoa I'll show you that one as well because I do want to highlight something on that the salted caramel obviously the classic yeah there has to be a salted caramel and under here there is a jaffa cakes that's a chocolate orange anyway birthday I'm gonna show you and I'll show you the carrot cake you know it's a bit weird that one so ready that's not a cake it's probably a cake in the Jaffa sense right so yes it's got the obligatory sprinkles we love to see that it's got a kind of white chocolatey fondant sweet coating and inside here's the novelty break it open gate the whole Wow look at that this is probably gonna fall out ow mmm okay sorry okay okay very pink very cute this is what we're looking at so with a film that's a pretty cool novelty so coated filled and pinky doesn't make sure you don't you see this there you go now I mean let's break it up let's make a mess but yeah I mean really really quite nice and really really quite unusual so I mean it just looks like a cookie - cookie you like the seen fit cookies we have for example but you could call this a come on focus you could call this a noise just not doing it you could call it a cookie cake I suppose but it is lighter is kind of it's dense cake it's it's closer to dangerously easy to eat it's closer to Madeira cake I suppose or those kind of little fairy cakes you get multipacks in the supermarket maybe it in a soft French sense again like mandolins so yeah very very light sponge it's fairly dry which makes it sort of flaky but obviously the the sweetness is happy by the coating which is very nice and the the jammy sort of filling so all four flavors have a filling of a sort and so yeah it might be purple but it's a sort of raspberry zingy flavor so makes a sort of Victoria sponge sort of thing in the birthday cake one you get little crunchy sprinkles on top they're fairly inoffensive they're kind of like the ones on the the grenade birthday cake bar in fact they don't taste it much themselves but they add to the experience and we love sprinkles ah um so I'm going to show you the carrot cake as well this is a little bit mad okay because this is actually a negative thing I'm gonna take you through here but when I was eating these I was so disappointed that I have to find some way to sort of give some of you guys a heads up I'm sure you'll get your head around it but it's a shame I love carrot cake in the mix we love any carrot cake flavors we love any cinnamon spice flavors broadly speaking tis the season for it as well and it looks cool right so ready for it bit smash this one there you go see you got PhD smart cake here I should say they're about 200 30 calories just over 200 calories 1516 grams of protein and say listen to grams of sugars or he said so pretty good justifiable macros they're a good size they're fairly satisfying very novel everything anyway with this one the carrot cake smells absolutely amazing smells like hot cross buns so really nice Easter appropriate coming up let's ditch that but as you notice they put some weird stuff on top so I don't know they look honestly a being unkind they look a bit like bacon bits they're not they are dried carrot so they've tried to be super authentic they've done a carrot cake with real grind carrots on top the problem is the carrot in it the carrot is too dry so the actual actual stuff inside very nice you can see it's got a sort of buttercream cream cheesy filling and there's a cinnamon kind of you know cakey bassy center sort of thing the coating is a kind of cinnamon a white chocolate again I guess as well there's a pleasing level of sweetness nice texture to it except on the pieces so hmm it's not awful but the carrot things are just quite hard and the cake is quite soft so it gives us a Swede clash of things in the middle and the carrot pieces end up remaining after you finish the rather nice tasting cookie cake thing you followed that you've got chewy carrot pieces and I think for my money um yeah I mean and the rest of it it's so nice it's just I think it's a shame because it distracts from the there's no flavor added by those carrot pieces they're sort of redundant flavor-wise I think it's just decoration but they're a fair size and they're quite tough so I actually actually find it taking away from what is that otherwise would be a really really Pleasant cookie slash cake sort of thing so without those that would be a 9 out of 10 from me with those I think he pulls it right down to a 5 out of 10 because ie they're quite stubborn they're quite stubborn as well so it's not that you can brush them off some of them will fall off but I don't know it's like you'll see it when you you know you try these things and I do suggest it one does I think they're a very novel product we have nothing else quite like it and we always give kudos for that I've no doubt if PhD you pulled it off the manufacturer will probably find a way to get it to some other brands as well that's what tends to happen and so you will probably see these cookie cakey type things popping up with a few other brands maybe even you SN grenade whatever but yeah you SN first blood on these first to the punch and the four flavors that ticked a load of classics they're all really really nice I've shown in my favorites the carrot cake in terms of the base cookie is a favorite and the birthday cake with the sprinkles in the jam in the middle is a favorite salted caramel it's a very intense deep salted caramel almost a coffee overtone to it so it's good it's this one you'd enjoy in moderation I suppose but I really liked it it some people will pick up coffee and then not like it but yeah otherwise pretty safe bet and the Jaffa Cake it's got the same sort of jaffa filling obvious the texture is quite close to that of an actual jaffa cake so in many ways it's closest to what it's actually called so yeah points for that so full flavors we've got a sort of beef smart eat cake mix so you pick and mix 12 of these as usual they're sort of two pounds two pounds 15 something like that but pretty cool snacks it's just I'd say carrot cake and you're gonna love the flavor you might like me struggle with the current pieces on top find them a bit chewy stuck in your teeth etc they just don't need to be there so yeah if you were going to follow my advice I've kept the cookie brush off pull off the carrot things and then enjoy it otherwise you might have a little bit of a shock when you bite into it ah I've still got power okay Peters oh yeah the flavour spectacular though really good character hmm oh yeah half an hour so actually that's not so bad okay one more thing on the snack front I'll whip thee through this USN wheel of the trust crunch here we've gone on about it a bunch why do we like it well nutritionally it's about the same as many of our other bestsellers packaging wise yeah it's quite striking but it's kind of so-so nope the reason we really like it it's not leave the look of it or anything it's not the price of it it is the amount of caramel so it's not that different in format to many of the other bars on the market and certainly the best selling ones I could add Maribel's but there does seem to be extra caramel in there and there's along with the name trust crunch there's a good crunch in the coating so it's a good mixture of textures it's a fun one it's very satisfying it's a bar we'd say oh you might not try these and you might not even think to one of them USN but this bars worth a look actually like that cookies too she said you were send are doing well on the snacks at the moment but bar wise I'm not gonna pretend we've got the cherry chocolate I should say so I will come in um some of these you might find in acid Oh incidentally I think somehow they got stopped before it actually went to distributors and stuff which is not unusual I mean a lot of these brands are doing more with convenience and supermarkets nowadays so it's all good any chance to get these great snacks and obviously you'll always find us online at I've seen bigger mixed ok UK where you can pick and mix them and get hopefully the best selection variety of flavors and yeah sales pitch blah blah blah blah blah but yeah cherry chocolate I actually saw a couple of people share these on Instagram from the supermarkets probably two weeks ago and then it took a little bit longer to actually turn up with the sports nutrition distributors but boom they are now here so yeah cherry chocolate not chocolate cherry and this is probably apt because it's a lot more cherry than it is chocolate the actual flavor as we've said in the listing is along the lines of a Black Forest gateau so you usually get kind of mushy no cherries is it all sort of Kirsch II type things is a very intense almost you know boozy sozzled cherry flavor with a dark chocolate it's kind of meeting in the coating on this is milk chocolate not dark chocolate so actually I'd say it's probably not intense enough to fully balance the cherry they have gone fully down the cherry root so if you love cherry this is the bar for you cherry is all out the experience from the thing so it's much more like a cherry sort of truffle than it is I don't know like the Black Forest gateau cake in terms of the cherry it's quite intense quite boozy as I say so it's less cherry Bakewell as well so it is more the gateau it is an after-dinner one it is a little bit naughty and it's a little bit heavy but it does make a statement it's pretty cool and you get the great texture as you do with the Trust Crunch Bars so yeah enough nonsense I'll show you lovely knobbly texture kind of drizzle on top as well which is a nice touch you can see they're sort of shooting for a truffle thing there and well there you go the really striking thing about this let's break it open is that so you are getting a ton of caramel there you go tons of the stuff comes out you get the protein crispy crunches on the top it's a milk chocolate coating it but it's got a blood-red blood-red let's say cherry made that's more appropriate cherry red coral and the thing so that's a little bit weird an out of place but it does indicate the strength of the cherry flavor within this bar yeah so it is pretty fearsome hmm yeah that covers it so quite a novelty on that and then all the other usual I don't have a lot to eat off this yeah I'm just on dead lifts I do deadlifts every Sunday deadlift Sunday um so it's actually a good reward and obviously do the videos on Saturday as I said making up a lost time here so apologies this is going to hit YouTube a little bit late but I'll dash back and try make up a lost time anyway yeah long sweet the trust crunch there I'm not going to say it's my favorite I'm not a mad cherry fan personally I probably preferred the raspberry cheesecake overall it's a sweeter bar and it's a it's more of a kind of I don't know birthday cake mix with fruit it yeah it's more of a birthday cake experience and I am a sucker for those cheesy kind of corny birthday cake flavors but the the raspberry cheesecake was also vegetarian so a couple of grams less protein nah this is not a vegetarian one unfortunately so this I think collagen in there as per usual but it does get the protein back up to 2 grams the sugars are just a couple of grams very very citing very very not being self as per usual um yeah I just there are little chocolatey sort of cherry flecks and stuff inside as well yeah it's a nice bar but I mean some of you will dodge fruity flavors and this is a very very heavy cherry one so it's another one of those it's worth a try I don't think it's going to be up there with the you know the peanut butter white chocolatey one or the cookie dough ones and the indeed the triple chocolate that's really nice from them but if yes a worthy addition to the trust crunch range and it's in our trust crunch trust in the crunch 12 bar mix pick and mix bundle on site now as usual yeah it's a good nology one but yeah so it's a real kind of Oh what can I liken it to like the flavor the the fruit of social someone's like a cherry chewing young type thing the chocolate backs off into the background but yeah it's uh it's good only the textures obvious oh yeah okay oh that's all the snacky food bits done I mean mmm I say it's done I'm pretty sure there's other stuff I haven't even covered here but these are the kind of the big hitters and I don't want to make this mad mad long and we're at 35 minutes so okay we're gonna jump onto I've kind of done the knock oh so you've seen that they were on site now and I'll keep enjoying that but one of my favorite knockos to date definitely try that one mmm okay supplements let's try and clear up a little bit on the end here we have it we have ghosts I will do that one afterwards I kind of mentioned it last ooh last video because we just got the stock in then so I was gonna do a bigger feature on it as well but you'll see in the post on site for now I'm gonna cover PS to begin just because it's been a little while before we've had too much to shout about on the P signs front so I have said bits and pieces are coming we're hoping to rekindle things a bit this year and get some more of the stock in and better stock all the proteins maybe even look at the pricing and bring that back down those are other stuff but for now we have got an extra flavor across pretty much the entire range you probably are interested in in sour green apples so it's taken a while for PE s to sort of get on board with doing candy flavors they're always quite sweet but they don't really run after the candy thing sour green apple in terms of that magical sweet sour combo it's always quite a good flavor system and we now have it in high volume which is the PE s is best selling stem free pump product it has been one of our best sellers in the mix for Oh three years now and it's one of those like don't mess with a classic it's you know they're probably more like highly ghost products on the market they probably started cheaper pump products on the market but it just works it's a fantastic formula that's tried and tested trusted worldwide bloggers right even Dan when he was formulating the ghost pump product said I consider the PS one to well up to this point mines now better I probably consider the PE as high to be the best on the market so they did nail it with this product and you can stack it obviously so you can have it with your existing pre-workout you could have it with obviously prolific or indeed alpha mean that's the other ps1 that's what they want you to do but yeah we've got high volume Intel green apple and this is great obviously if you're training late and the rest of it there's no stims and you do get that great Bane spliting pump and pump up the volume in order so the hashtag you stuff that goes with this products am i touching the mic product is that one yeah the other one I'll bring in anyway so that's your high volume whoo so yeah sour green apple so very very zing tart flavor very nice and refreshing and we've got the same in prolific prolific is actually equally a popular product for us it's a very it's again it's a bit like the ghost legend but maybe a tad weaker so if you don't want beta-alanine which is the this the the tingling stuff right so some people absolutely love it some people find it very distracting some people find it scary they think there's something wrong with the product p/es boycott that ingredient entirely it's not a particularly effective ingredient certainly not workout to workout is it has some benefits when you have it in your system over an extended period the same way creatine does right you have to have it in your system for a few weeks hitting a certain dosage before it is sort of yields its best results same with beta alanine like instantly you will get the kind of nerve tingly thing but to actually have anything significantly affect your performance it's best to have it on the Reg as it were if you're having in your pre-workout every day every other day over how often you workout yes you will have enough in your system to actually reap some benefits but in the instant you're having it every now and then for a workout you're probably not getting much from it so losing the beta alanine not really a bad call and indeed ghosts have done the same in the ghost burn no beta alanine there no tingles so prolific very popular pre-workout for us actually low caffeine but they've pushed up in the nootropics and the the sort of feelgood factor there so you get really really good mental clarity and focus you feel pretty good on this product there's enough caffeine 160 milligrams that are serving there to give you a bit of a kick to know you've taken something to sort of warm you up and get your heart going but not nearly enough to give you some sort of horrible crash so you get the the focus that mood boosting kind of things you go a little bit of stimulation from it you can get a little bit caffeine hit and it's got some pump stuff in it too so it's taps brilliantly with the high volume but it has citrulline in there as well four grams that not citrulline malate full-on citrulline so good hit from that as well so it does a little bit of everything in in a package that's what pretty affordable but it's got great flavors it'll make you feel pretty good you're not you know it's this sort of product you want to take again again again so there you go ah it's an easy sell because it's if you know you're used to high stim products it's not going to cut it for you you'd have to do a couple of servings it's a great workout in a couple of servings that's what I tend to do but it does make it slightly less value but for some people who are more casual going to the gym or who just year they don't want to be kept up half the night or want to clean a workout it's a good product for that so these have always been bestsellers PS is great for doing sort of trustworthy products that you just gonna want to buy again again which is why we've done so well there's a saying with ghosts to be honest so we got that in salqeen Apple as well and last but not least we have their amino complex online again let's keep it fair sound green apple were tasty splash yeah so the cool thing I mean they're all vegan friendly these supplements are PS but again I mean I would be for BCAAs it's less common being vegan friendly so you get BCAAs it's got added EAS as well it's it's not probably the most complete package in terms of like a full-on amino drink but they again they focused on what's the most effective their focus of actually delivering stuff that's gonna do something for you and they do promise the leucine so it's a full five grams of leucine in there and in terms of on the nerdy techie stuff as much as I understand it spurring on promoting muscle protein synthesis leucine seems to be the key component yes it works in concert with the other BCAAs but leucine is the key thing you want to make sure you get in there so give me a good hitter the leucine that's cool and then they've added in taurine and a couple of other bits as well and cool it's got electrolytes and things so it will even be on the recovery boosting that you'll get with this it's actually going to help with endurance and avoiding cramps and I'm just keeping you hydrated for a workout which is always a good thing kids so there you go we've got all of them in there at the moment first batch of these we didn't get tons of tubs in it's not hard to sort of fall you launched as yet with the distributors but we had to bring some in ourselves so your high volume prolific amino IV sound green apples in there now um so yeah I mean I will say on the amino IV in particular pef are going through a process of phasing out a lot of flavors so you'll notice on our site we have a few dated tubs these are still perfectly good - usually for a fantastic price on them so if you want to get a bargain on this product with these flavors whilst they still exist and this is no more batches after this and now's your chance to jump on I think when all is said and done the dust is settled there will be four or five flavors instead of this sort of eight or nine we were up to and it's the same I think we've lost sunrise in the prolific and we I think we've lost the paradise cooler in the high-volume I might be wrong on that but there have been whittling it down a little bit and there there you go so PS done so jumping on to ghost of us keep mentioning ghost the Pina Colada I'll show you this one so if you like pina coladas and being subjected to my singing um its yeah an easy and easy hook marketing-wise to sell this product is the Pina Colada song everyone knows that it's one of the sort of favorite cheesy classics pina colada yes it's probably more of a summer appropriate one but this is again a very good ghost II take on it they already have a very nice pineapple sort of flavoring system in their pump product so it does pick up a lot from that but I think Byrne has a natural well I hate to use the word burn because it will put people off but it it has a pepperiness thanks to the ingredients in there the same ingredients that kind of raise your metabolic level raise your your core temperature make you sweat and actually let this product work its magic it's um it needs a little bit more TLC to cover that and make it a pleasant drink so the pineapple flavor the the juiciness of that is very authentic juice flavor as always with ghost cuts through quite sharply and then there is the pepperiness in the background but the coconut that you get from the pina colada and side of things actually offsets that quite nicely as well so it smoothes the whole package out and it makes it a thoroughly enjoyable Cox that cocktail style flavor even in this product where you go oh so it's um it does taste quite similar to the pineapple pump but there is definitely the coconut flavor in the background there and then the the slight pep you know they're kind of hit from the pepperiness which personally I quite enjoy and indeed this product is best drunk long and usually drink the legend quite short this is designed to be drunk long so you might notice it is a bit fiery if you're just having it 100 mils as a sort of pre-workout but it's more often used ok sitting at your desk as sort of going through your day or if you're doing low intensity solid-state cardio you're doing steps or something or you're sipping it through your workouts if you feel a shaker with it then the flavor will be lows mild or there'll be no peppery burns with at all and it's just quite a pleasant drink and it's even better served over ice and stuff so you can do that with a little cocktail umbrella and a straw in the summer or in the spring as you're as you're thinking about getting your um beach bodies ready but it's in the mix now and so a few tubs have gone out but it's probably not the ideal time of year for something like this but yeah that's the latest thing we've got in from ghost terms of ghosts we are low on a few bits and pieces but we should have another restock shoe in the week ahead so a little bit more vegan hopefully coming in because I think half the flavours have gone out they're all very nearly gone we are completely out of the green apple legend so we have the sour watermelon we have the lemon line everything else I think is in but yet we do have a few more bits and pieces coming goes to be very busy they've got gamer coming they've got greens coming yet they won't be too long now at all I've got for a called glow coming so they are looking at more of the sort of a Lari new style kind of beauty lifestyles and you know sort of thing and yeah so keep an eye on suik starting products on this year those more collab stuff including collab ways so yeah we'll get as much as we can as quickly as we can in the mix as always oh okay I'm still alive and we're talking so on 40 46 minutes so shorter than last week that's great so this basically covers it what's coming up ahead swole sim has been hammered again maddie is running way behind I'm sorry to say but whilst we won't have a restock probably this coming week we should have early the week and it should come with two if not three new flavors obviously we are coming up on Valentine's Day so it's always a nice man he's always done stuff for that so there will be a new bar for that and we have a couple of other bars kind of for the new year flavor of the month star things kind of a spring tried them all all spectacular you're in for a real treat so as they say good things come to those who wait so you should have to wait a little bit longer on that I've also been to Maddie for some birthday cake back so we haven't had our picky mix exclusive birthday cake flavor as that sort of white chocolate one with the UM oh god the the pink and silver sort of you know sprinkle E glitter crunchy balls on top and it's a jam filling and look another core we haven't had that for years six weeks two months so it's been way way too long and we did say ah should we just forget about it but we've had so many requests we're certainly doing one more batch we'll have some of those in we'll have some more of the caramel Shortcake vegan e ones in yeah well we're doing what we can but Maddie's kind of maxed out that's the problem but it's nice to be too busy right um what else oh yeah restock wise we did finally get the got7 one and we got some new bits this comes in from Germany we have got their new flavor drops so up until now we've been doing their glossy bottles here are sort of posh ones a tiny bit more expensive very very intense flavors butter biscuit is back everyone loves this one we have got their 30ml drops you might instantly think oh that looks like a Frankie's bakery drop I think to be honest it's pretty much the same thing so all vegan friendly sugar-free calorie free the rest but it's a different take on it they're actually slightly better price and the Frankie's bakery ones we have a better relationship with the got seven guys and hopefully whilst it's not quite the range of flavors all the big hitters are ticked off like caramel vanilla there's a lemon cake there is cookies and cream there's a raspberry tart it's a whole bunch of flavors there's coconut I was about eight or nine we've got so far coming these cute display box as well so we can put them out in the shop but yeah Franky's bakeries ones are always really hard to get hold of we will hopefully have a better supply of these so give these a try and see what you think they're to my taste they're coming very close to Mikey's bakery ones but slightly cheaper than the glossy bottles here slightly different range of flavors but way to go got7 he's a good night launch for the year we've also got all of the chips and crisps back so these are my favorite the protein snack is essentially nacho so it got lovely spice to them there's like good value that big full banks for these so all the got7 such a fantastic price and yeah these are these are my absolute favorite paprika flavored ones here and then we've got the I think four or five flavors five flavors of the protein chips so yeah again big generous bags in there you get Oh what is it I think 50 gram bags so two servings per bag technically and that's 20 grams of protein in the bag of these and they're like really one pound 50 or something so yes that's actually really spectacular but very satisfying kind of protein II disky things you've seen this before Greek stars one of my favorites but we've got sour cream bat we've got barbeque back we've got paprika back yeah all in the mix now and we've also finally finally got more of their classic sauces back so I think this one was out the spicy garlic the garlic Thousand Island was pretty much out BBQ was pretty much out I only was pretty much out so then they're all back in the mix as well love these ones they are ever so slightly higher calorie I mean still three calories apportions essentially nothing right but they are distinctly thicker than many of the other calorie free low calorie sources we've got and certainly when you come into barbecue and some of the more salad dressing you want that's that's really nice oh yeah it actually makes these for my money these are the ones I take home basically so yeah tip for the top then also there's slightly smaller bottles but they're also slightly better price so I think they're 379 or 350 and sort of the 399 we usually have on the Walden's and the skinny food go so yeah if you have not been wowed by the skinny food Co I certainly try this barbecues a winner spicy burgers awesome my dad's addicted to the Thousand Island and I'm even do weird ones like pesto but this spicy garlic's good the IO Lee's good hotels they do a sweet tomato it was actually quite probably sauce or ketchup one the ketchups quite a good texture and they do a tomato basil that people like it tastes a bit like pasta sauce to me so I mean it's probably good stirred in with something but then on itself maybe not great but yeah the the spicy burger I say try that if you haven't and the BBQ is probably the nicest barbecue we do anyway they're all back in got massive pallet of stuff right super late on a Friday we have got what's coming in the week ahead we'll have more of these we only have one small batch to start we've got tons more coming we will have oh I don't know that's it that's probably about all you're gonna get from me productively at this point so I'm gonna shut up so yeah all these new snacks in the mix right now we'll do a big proper launch on the PhD smart cakes in the week ahead we're going to do a proper launch on the blender bottles with the new styles in the week ahead there should be or on the website now yes we just did the post of these so they're in there in the moment and that's it yeah Jeremy's been a whirlwind guy so thank you for sticking with us and keeping us so busy as well check out some of the new functionality on site again DMR a DMS email us from a technical side of things upon me getting back to you but I'm always interested in other than more features or anything else you'd like to have added or any massive bugs I mean sometimes we find people have got horrible glitches they found in the site and they just disappear so they they just go to other websites or give up or say I'll try again later and they don't actually tell us oh wait this is completely knackered so we'd always rather know when there's a glitch or it looks like there's a glitch because we can under fix it I can fix it or we can accept or actually it's supposed to work like this or maybe we've built something in a slightly confusing way but yeah there are new functionalities going to the site I'm going to add some more stuff as well you'll see more review widgets going around more notification things will be sending out as well we're going to do more dedicated tracking page we're going to be targeting up some of the terms conditions and stuff as well you'll notice me leave started doing snapshots and sub shots on the Instagram so if you jump over to our Instagram you'll see this and you highlight for them but these are kind of little bite-sized chunks where we put sort of one of these sexy food porn nice style images and give you some of the USP so those products it's just at a glance and serve me being mega long-winded you can see why you'd pick certain products yeah we've tried a whole bunch of stuff anyway but thank you for watching guys have a fantastic week hope you had a fantastic week as how this one goes live and yet look forward to seeing you guys in the mix soon to try some of these new bits and pieces and don't forget it letters that don't forget to let us know what you think so [Music]", "0fGZ1FaoFJ0": "and this is Hank co-founder of nature's wildberry hey guys thanks for having me Jerry so I've been wanting to bring them on to have a longer talk and here we are so an Inc tell me about yourself how did you stumble on this crazy berry that changes people's taste buds which by the way he has some here oh yeah that's a little that's some behind the scenes where yeah we're gonna be having that probably at some grocery stores in the near future yeah anyway so the berry came to me because my friend Giuliano had a braw restaurant and I went to him asking for help to lose some of the weight that I had and eat of my fruits and veggies which to me just didn't taste appealing I was addicted to a junk food diet and he hint he gave me this berry and made the healthiest smoothie I've ever seen made and it tasted awful to him it made him wince and if I knew if it made a healthy guy like Juliana Wentz well then it would taste awful to me and then the I had the very first and then to my surprise the berry made it taste great like the drink tasted amazing so that was something I could see me doing long-term and very quickly in about six months I lost about 60 pounds down from 250 and then I had the idea I could cut you right there because you were 250 yes he was 250 look at this this is back to 50 anymore look at that thank you yeah so like before he like round cheeks and everything yeah so you went from 250 to hellish to about 190 and then I took the berry and made sugar kind of out of my diet and the and the berry helped me do that by replacing the sweetness and I lost another 20 pounds just cutting sugar Wow you went from 250 to 170 170 85 Wow and you're 6 foot tall right yep so yeah so like on a good day 170 that's a healthy weight yeah this is right yeah yeah look at that he had the double chin and everything back in the day I had the quadruple quadruple chin so basically what happened was you are one of those people I was like that too in high school where you would get kind of stressed and you would just eat right yeah so you a stress eater so and then I didn't know what it was called it's called emotional eating the emotional eating it yeah like this this is him with his dog Max so you see you got the chin and everything round-faced that was 250 yeah that was a 2013 basically you managed to turn these into a product that everyone can buy everyone can use right right here and bam so tell me about the process of how you found these berries how did you go from okay I want these berries I want people to have it - okay let's manufacture them so Giuliano had a rule he doesn't do business with friends he had tried doing business with friends for like four or five times and they all failed miserably because he was doing all of the work and he didn't feel like getting mad at his friend so they just dissolved a business so by the time I came around to him and asked him if he wanted to join me in business he said no and so the berries were working on me though and I would go online looking for anybody else who was using the berries for more than a novelty because they did they were known for like flavor tripping parties but for me I was using it and in my diet and after like my six months was up and I lost 60 pounds I went to him and I said would you go into business with me and he said no like I already told you once and I said but they're working on me and he said I just can't do it so I would give him to all my friends my co-workers my bosses my customers cuz I worked in retail and I loved retail and it would give me new people all the time to share it with and every single time I would blow their mind they would say why isn't this a thing right and so uh you know another six months would go by Jerry and I would ask Giuliano like would you go in business with me and he said I don't do business with friends and and it wasn't until I saw the movie fat sick and nearly dead to the sequel that he wouldn't he said no but I wouldn't take no for an answer at that time because the movie I'm gonna ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen right now but the movie talks to the person that he helped in the first film and he put the weight back on because the green juice that he was having just didn't taste as good as the junk food but I knew that the green juice that I was having tasted like Jolly Rancher candy because they had the berry because I had the berry Emily tongue every time I did it and that's why I didn't put the weight back on so it touched me emotionally on a deep level and I talked to Giuliano and I was like man I'm not gonna take no I'll fight you if I have to what you're gonna go into business with me and he said yeah I've actually seen the documentary the first one I haven't seen the second one the first one fat sick and nearly dead and the first one was a very very emotional and motivating journey because it was a guy he was having all these problems I believe he had skin allergies and everything which I did too so and he just went on this juicing diet I didn't buy juicers what I tried to go more vegan for a little bit me just couldn't do it yeah now I have a juicer makes shake sometimes but even now because I I don't have the berries around me I think I would probably still not be drinking those juices every day yeah but he actually so I used to work at Fox 29 and he came to our morning show and I talked to him because I none of the reporters knew of him but I do it what like dude you have the Jesus yeah you're the guy he came this book and everything I just have this book I never read hey I'm so sorry I'll get you to read yeah yeah give it to read it so you just convince Giuliano to go into business with you um was the step after that to secure the supply line the supply chain or tell me more well we I was using these perishable berries and our farmer wouldn't keep it but by principle he wouldn't keep a credit card on file so every two weeks as the berries would go bad because they're so perishable they would go back bad really soon after I put him in the freezer and I'd have to keep reordering them and they're so expensive because they have to get shipped overnight and they have to have an ice pack and then on top of that I'd be wasting berries because they go bad so fast and so Giuliano told me that if we were going to go into business we'd have to figure out how to preserve the berries so it was more research and development mm-hmm I see and so you did Ardi and then did you try different ways before you got to your current method yeah I took it took about ten months for us to actually find a product that we can sell had to figure out how to preserve it chemical free because if I was going to have it multiple times in a day I didn't want to preserve it with chemicals yeah because I made this product for me just because it didn't exist in the world and once we had the product Julianna said ok now we can form a company and we filed for the patent on how to preserve it and which is still pending and and we just started selling it on Amazon Wow so that's how you started the first online marketplace you did was Amazon and ok and did you also sell through your own website too or is that afterwards yeah so Amazon came after our website we Amazon we were forced to do Amazon I would like to say because no one knew to come to nature's wildberry but people type in a search bar on Amazon's website just to search for anything like more than more often than Google so we put our berry up there figured out how the keywords worked and it was just little by little and then the word-of-mouth got out and then we started putting in grocery stores direct grocery stores and co-ops and and then youtubers like you picked it up and started doing reaction videos and unboxing videos and then that got the word out even more and all in all it's probably been seen about 25 million times on YouTube YouTube Instagram and how did you come up with natures well bury this name so we knew that we didn't want to have natural in the name you know anytime you see something natural it's like natural flavor anything natural you can almost predict it's bad for you or now when you think natural and health foods you think fake yes like fake healthy right it's like let's name it the opposite of what it should be but um so we came up with nature because we wanted to give and let people know that this is something that we didn't do manufacture ourselves this is something that Mother Nature gave us and then I asked Juliana like what do you think really describes the experience and he said it's a wild experience and it never gets old you know it's been about six or seven years that I've had the bearing now personally and every time I have a meal anytime I have a drink I'm still blown away I still can't believe that what I'm tasting is real yeah so it's a wild experience and of course it's a barian you've heard of wild berries before but you can't think of like well there's just one wild berry so we could kind of capitalize on the fact that it was such a general term I like that so that's a keeper now you mentioned people's experiences when they first taste about how it just feels wild who is like the biggest skeptic that you offer like oh you know I was very skeptical there's no way this girl no yeah yeah I said if it could work it would work on anyone but me and that's why we came out with the individual pack because when I first started ordering the berry it cost about a hundred and thirty dollars just to get a pack of 70 which was way too expensive we thought for anyone to believe us in business especially since no one's ever heard of this product before so we came out with a five-dollar packet five dollars you can prove it to yourself before you buy the jars before you want to subscribe to anything you could say well I want to make sure it works for me I want to make sure it fits my lifestyle so we're the only company in the world that sells the ladida berry individually Wow that's pretty cool and have you talked to schools or you know college these professors I the reason I gravitated towards this when I first met him I met him randomly one day and when he told me about this berry and we work exactly I had a professor neuroscience professor that told me about a similar berry that's how I found a bunch of have you approached like scientists or any of these like snobby professors not snobbiest regular for professor snobby my dad was a neurosurgeon neuroscience of people are fascinated with the berry we work with the neuroscience program at UCLA oh that's awesome yeah we get kids from all around Los and they bus in on a field trip to UCLA and we get to do demonstrations with the berry blow their minds and you know kids are special you brought us something that makes me smile all the time like seeing people's reactions never gets old just like the berry but especially when they're young you know especially you know you can reach them at an age where you know they can prove it to themselves that it works and then and then the idea the passion is to have the kids educate their parents on how to eat healthier so that's that's our aim that's why we want to get into cafeterias why we want to get into schools around the country mm-hmm so that's actually a perfect segue so one of your plans is to slow get into the schools and make things healthier for the school what are some other plainness for you whether it's for expanding the market or maybe new products tell me more about that sure we just got back from Expo West a couple months ago in March and we sat down with uNFI and recorded their reaction and got their experience firsthand they absolutely loved it we're in talks with getting and distribution through the restaurants and the chains actually doctors they supply hospitals but they also supply whole foods so the more direct grocery stores that were in involved with the easier will be for them to distribute our berries but also we want to provide the berries for programs like WIC women different children you know women who are pregnant are very anxious to make sure that they're eating healthy because they're eating for two and we've had so much great positive feedback on the berry helping you know their diets kind of transform into a more whole food plant-based process diet away from the processed diets that they were kind of used to which is exactly my story so it relates on so many levels but athletes we've gotten great feedback from athletes you know that's kind of your arena and so it's pretty much meant for anyone who really is a foodie who likes to taste you know a lot of people eat the same thing over and over every day and they're just bored with food and that should be a crime you know because with the berry it like I said it just never gets old and you have to try it yeah I always tell people I've been try and learn to cook and I realize this whole process of putting things in your mouth it should be fun and part of it is cooking yeah right you learn to cook you're like oh I know how my foods made now and it turns out good Wow so it's like you shouldn't be eating the same thing every day ever totally agree with you but from another angle and I know one of the things you guys do on your Instagram and I don't know about Facebook definitely on Instagram is you guys give recipes and stuff like that where you guys can use the Buried yeah and usually the recipes are like my own crazy inventions stuff that I have in the kitchen that I would never think of putting together you know the probably would taste awful without the berry but I know how to tweak it just so that it's a little bit tart or a little bit sour and then all of a sudden it comes alive yeah exactly I think one of my favorite things to do with the berry is you take a fruit that's kind of a little sour and then it turns super super sweet like candy like Jolly Rancher so you know I would take like a raspberry or take like a blueberry yeah and then I I need the berry you know put this in your mouth for 30 seconds me hungry yeah I know give me hungry for fruit too and then you put the blueberries in and then and in fact Kurt I might tag you on this I showed you that method by the way I don't know if you want to leave a comment but I took tangerines and I had Curt eat the berry and then I had him like I didn't record his reaction fun though sharing it like when you see your friends have that experience it's like I just give it out to my friends just to watch the Maria yeah but um I was I was with a stoical crowd they were kind of like I knew they were impressed but they didn't show god that's Noah cross on my favor Noah cry because I just try and just have him crack a smile because I'm the one who's like very laid back I'm the one who kind of listens more than I thought you wouldn't know it now because I'm really excited about the berry that's what I'm talking so much but usually I'm the guy who's just like watching and observing and but to get my friends to just kind of like have a moment where they don't even say anything some times they'll close their eyes and they'll just be like is this real as this life is up up or down right you know black white what's happening I'll very briefly explain how this works basically your taste buds you have five tastes you can taste sweet you can taste sour you can taste saltiness and then you can taste umami you mommy's the taste of protein now what happens is when you put this in your mouth and chew it it releases a chemical that binds to your tongues sour receptors and like that exactly so as he's chewing it it binds to a sour receptors and then what happens is after a while anything sour that comes in instead triggers the sweet taste right so recently it doesn't permanently this is the key it doesn't permanently reverse the taste it's just temporarily right because there's there's this berries naturally occurring antioxidant chemical on your tongue it it just temporarily changes the sour into sweet and it doesn't change the sweet in to sour so you know you can still taste other sweet things it's just like only the sour stuff that normally made go you know that lemon face the Clark you know so it takes that and then you will feel sweet right yeah anything that you would normally add sugar to so if you leave the sugar out it will enhance the sweetness from sour things and will also curb bitterness so if coffee is one of the things you like to have then you don't need to add sugar two thirds of coffee drinkers in the u.s. add sugar for their coffee I do right and so you can have a berry beforehand and your coffee your cold brew your espresso czar completely smooth without it you know you can just add lemon to your tea and it tastes like it's Arnold Palmer that's right lemon to your water you know how many people don't like drinking water yeah and one of those yeah it makes it taste like your you know it's sugary most sugary lemonade ever so it's great if you like hosting like I like hosting it's great to provide something that's cheap and easy and fun the most important thing is that it tastes great and you get a reaction out of your guests - yeah and one thing I will warn though is that limes the sour they are like lemons the sweeter they're gonna taste once you take the berry so a temptation lob you'll have just start eating lemons in life don't do that too much abuse is bad for your teeth you're in the mo is something you want to protect right we went if we're gonna live a long time we want to eat well yeah and so dr. Greger over at nutrition tax or highly recommend that guy site because he doesn't take any of the profits he donates all of his work to charity and he writes books and he's just a great doctor that you can trust because he uses fat you know studies and he shows the studies to you so it's not like his opinion or professional opinion it's like what the studies say anyway he teaches people to brush an hour after eating but rinse immediately after so switched out your mouth right make sure that the water gets it off your teeth but then an hour later you put a solid brush I like that because the stuff you're eating there's acidic stuff there's basic stuff you don't want it remaining on your enamel I really like that so that's a good when you after you eat immediately just rinse sprint it'll

note from Dollar Tree their lunch they're like in a pack I'll show them later cool a jammer and great these are it's basically a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i squish it then I cut it into threes then I roll it and it kind of looks like a sushi roll but it's a peanut butter and jelly so peanut butter and jelly sushi rolls if y'all ever hear me say that that's basically how you make it Pirate's Booty like five chocolate chip cookies some watches fruit snacks some green grapes and some I think it's like three strawberries there so that's for lunch for me today I know most likely she'll eat everything but we'll show y'all whenever she makes it home happy Tuesday everyone today she's taking her cool a jammer and grape and gogo squeeZ yogurts and strawberries she just brought her water tease me umm Ritz crackers and cheese and ham so basically like a DIY lunchable I know there's like a lot of crackers here but there's quite a few and she really likes the crackers and these I actually just cut with using like a cookie cutter or anything so I just used the shot glass I actually saw it on Facebook so I thought I would let you all know like a little trick if you don't have cookie cutters or anything and you want to do something like this use a shot glass you don't have to put them together I put them together like a sandwich just so that she's doesn't melt together so and it's easier she just like grabs it and puts it on the cracker and because the cheese will stick together so that's just faster basically underneath here underneath these Scooby Snacks she loves the Scooby Snacks on top and it's not the whole thing she only has a few and then underneath is the raisins the golden raisins sour for punch he smells so good and then two mandarin oranges just because I didn't put any other fruit so I did do two or two they're tiny oranges and I already said that so yeah that's her lunch for today she ate everything yesterday I don't think I showed that but she did eat everything yesterday and this is the good bin container that I had show job and inside these little cookie silicon cookie or a cupcake liners are from Ikea so yeah I just wanted to let y'all know but you can find them anywhere the Amazon has a time they have different shapes but those were from my can they're very sturdy we've had them for a long time so she just made it home and

vanilla with the chocolate graham sticks do you like these she says she likes these and then this I cut up I sliced up some ham and then I cut up the cheese stick and then I put it on a little skewer these are from the Dollar Tree not a skewer their pick cuz I think that's what they label them as but they just have hearts on top and it's one cheese stick and then two pieces of ham it looks like a lot but the way you cut it makes it look a lot and it's a pineapple what she's eating right now some strawberries I think there's about three or four strawberries in there I also put the pineapple on these skewers just so it's easier for her to eat some of the Skippy peanut butter balls with pretzels inside some goldfish and two Oreo cookies I know this and this seems like it's very sweet but I didn't know what to put here I was like well already have like a cracker so I don't know I just put that there for her and her water as always so yeah that is her she's doing a thumbs up that is her lunch for today and she absolutely everything how was it Michaela happy Thursday everyone she ate everything yesterday I don't remember if I showed it or not so she's taking a grape kool-aid jammer a yogurt mixed berry some pepperoni slices and a string cheese with some Ritz crackers I did the pepperonis instead of the ham today so it's gala apple with a lemon juice squeezed over it some green grapes that are already certain to go back see that one's not too good sometimes they don't know but yeah so that's the last day she'll take groups some of the rice krispies poppers yeah the cookies and cream I think this is about 1/2 mandarin orange so yeah that's her lunch for today it's pretty basic she really enjoys the Ritz crackers with she likes like the DIY lunchable because we don't buy Lunchables so you all will see probably a lot of that this year or at least right now that we have rice crisps or Ritz crackers I was looking at the rice paper this is the back if anyone's looking for those poppers it's basically just a rice krispy dipped in they have vanilla chocolate and then cookies and cream I'm not sure what other things they have so yeah that's real lunch for today we'll see what she ate whenever she makes it home so we made it home and this was Mikayla's lunches she had leftover she says she ran out of time did you run out of time or did you just not want your mandarin oranges yeah I believe her that she ran out of time because she has these and she loves these she just has a couple of apples you didn't eat that either the pupper I just hurry up and stuff in but nothing it could it you don't hurt your belly but you did pretty good she just didn't eat that and it's still cold so she can eat it now yeah it's cold because there's an ice pack at the bottom I

enjoy I'm also going to share with you guys how I organize my meals for the week and I want to apologize in advance because my allergies have been so bad even though I take medicine I am sniffling in these clips the end time for you guys a Costco haul as well as a Trader Joe's haul and what I have right here is our menu for the week along with some items that I needed and then I like to put this store that I'm going to need those items from right next to it so I know what to pick up but as you can see on Monday we're gonna have chicken rotisserie yes on Tuesday we're gonna have sandwiches with chips and of course I need my coke on Wednesday we're gonna have chicken and broccoli like teriyaki juice dish with some white rice on Thursday I'm going to make some Trader Joe's orange chicken and then I'm going to use some of that leftover white rice that I will have already made in the fridge from Wednesday on Friday either takeout or sandwiches and not sure which one yet but we shall see on Saturday my husband likes to grow so we might do some steaks with the baked potato and Sunday the popeyes chicken sandwich is supposedly back for good so that's gonna be our Sunday meal and if it's not back then we'll probably just get some chicken and some mashed potatoes with gravy because on Sunday is my church day my cleanup day and my laundry day so I don't not like to be in the kitchen on Sunday so it's either leftovers or it is takeout and papaya juice sounds good so let's start our hall with Costco so these are the items that I got from Costco let's try it out with this right here this was not on my list but when I walked into Costco this mad like pumpkin heaven if there's such a place and when I passed by this Iowa I cannot say no to these but I plan on giving one to a relative that lives near and they also love these so that we don't eat three pumpkin rolls in one week so I'll probably have that tonight after dinner with some coffee actually yes I like to drink some coffee at nighttime just to unwind and clean up I was really excited when I saw these these are a seasonal item at Costco then I asked they were having samples of the roast beef in broth and it was actually pretty tasty so I figured I would pick this up for the day that I don't feel like cooking the lady had put in some barbecue and she paired that up with a dinner roll and it was pretty good so I'm just gonna have these on here and just in case I'm feeling lazy one day and then my husband loves his french vanilla coffee creamer we always need to have this in stock it's like a must and then they had a like I love these they snack on these yeah and then I believe on Wednesday we're going to have chicken and broccoli with some teriyaki sauce and white rice so I put that baby bag of broccoli florets so we'll probably use half of this with some chicken and then I'll save the other half of this bag for next week's dinner ideas I'm not sure yet but I'm gonna use half and save the other half for next week and then on our menu we also have sandwiches so I thought that some of this daily bread and I can love this bread I have tried so many brides with those kiddos and this is the bread that they always want to go back to it and I like it because it does not no no by fructose or artificial colors or flavors and it is the golden week and it's actually really tasty so I also picked up a packet of turkey breasts honey ham and smoked turkey my favorite is the smoked turkey my husband loves the ham and the kids pretty much like food whichever one so this is gonna be dinner for Tuesday and then with that I've also got some cheddar cheese this is actually my favorite bread and my favorite cheese it's a real key so and also the key also like what I make them um I can't think of the word I'm not gonna just afraid for um what is going on with my brain right now grilled cheese sandwiches oh my goodness so grilled cheese they also like that I'm so I'm going I'll just get some butter some some of these cheese and I will throw it on a skillet and that is probably gonna be their lunch for Saturday and I also picked up these which is like a week we must have I mean a packet last us about two weeks so it's just a fully cooked bacon and my husband likes to add these interviews sandwiches is like like these a lot with scrambled eggs so I like to pick this up it makes my life a whole lot easier and then my middle son Alexei he always calls me Mom don't forget my seaweed so it's just the organic roasted seaweed snack that I pick up pretty much every week this is a must-have for him he really enjoys chips so this is like a good alternative with that and then I also got the kids some Stonyfield organic yogurt and the flavors of strawberry and mixed berry they really enjoy this with their lunch with their dinner or just as a snack and then after school they really like to come home and pick these up out of the fridge it's the gogo squeeZ organic food on the go and the flavors are pineapple pineapple oh my goodness sleep deprivation over here Apple Apple strawberry apple banana and apple cinnamon apple cinnamon one is actually really good actually that one and it's um no sugar added which is always a plus in my book and then this cheese will literally last us I freeze one and then I leave the other one out and this relaxes I like to look at the expiration date which I do with these numbered somewhere on you oh yeah I normally freeze one and I keep the other one in the fridge and I believe on Monday we're gonna have chicken kiss either yes so I like to use this cheese and as use apostle Corinth Orpheus and then I like to combine that with D which are really really good the chicken skewers these are really tasty so this is our dinner for money some chicken chaos ideas and I just gotta with the cheese and bread for fear and I might make a side of Mexican rice not too sure yet oh yeah next we have some bananas it goes okay not right and then I was all out of our fabric softener I love this fabric softener it does the child quite well and I also got the Costco bound fabric softener and I also got the Costco this one was on sale actually it's people like $10 and that will last us the whole month on the Costco laundry detergent and then I also got a box of these fun flavor mix chips and I normally like to either pack this in the kids lunch boxes or I serve this up with their sandwiches which is on the menu this week but this box I have to hide it in my laundry room because if my kids find this box they will literally eat this whole box in one night that's how obsessed they are with chips so that's why I like to have that seaweed on hand so so that when they are having that salty craving they could go ahead and have some seaweed I also have some cheez-its and some goldfish in the pantry but there's just something about chips that my boys will get eat this in one day so I like to hide this box and then just have a couple up and they're gonna have it with their meals and that is about it for Costco next we're going to go ahead and get into our trader Joe Falls and I put away all of our hostel stuff and I wanna show you guys what I picked up from Trader Joe's I picked this up I've never tried it but my trainer recommended it it is sprouted grain tortillas and I'm supposed to be a whole lot healthier so why don't you give this a try my daughter wanted to this and sriracha ranch dressing to eat the first ballot I really like better steel-cut oatmeal this is frozen but I also bought on this one to make for the kiddos and then this is just when I'm in a rush and I need to eat something quickly and then ice I've got some brown rice that I'm going to make I believe on Tuesday or Wednesday along with some teriyaki chicken and serve luckily I picked up some feta cheese that's really good with a salad I picked this up for the pup a Bentley he really likes this so that's just a treat for him and then some macaroni and cheeses these are really good they're banana chips they're really tasty and then this was recommended to me as well it's corn and quinoa salad with cotija cheese roasted poblano and cilantro dressing select assign a really yummy and then the kids also really enjoy them Joe's oohs and then I've also picked up some of these Halloween snacks for the boys and this I actually really like quick toast it is some flour butter that's really good as I picked up a bag of the organic coin chip dippers it's really good my daughter like sees their machi balls or something like that I don't know I've never tried him I'm not a fan of them I mean I have tried it I just don't like the texture so she really likes that and then I picked up a cauliflower cheese pizza then I've also got the kids a little on the cookie kick for Halloween and then I picked these up as a quick dinner just to have in the freezer for nice that I just don't feel like doing nothing those are really good and these are also yummy here similar to that sake but they are just rolled tortilla chips the flavor is chili and lime and this is really good this is actually what I used in our teriyaki chicken Oscar from Trader and I can't forget I've picked up some coffee cups and this was also recommended to me by this gal oxygen it's the chicken tikka masala she said this was pretty good so I'm learning I got one just to give it a try and I'll probably share it with either my daughter or my husband my boys are really pretty so I know they you know maybe they'll eat the rice that's about it and yeah that's my little Trader Joe's law of the week [Music] so I want to share with you guys one of our meals for this week it is really easy it takes about 20 minutes and dinner is done all you need is some broccoli some rice this is my first time using this brown rice we normally get the white rice but it says ready in 15 minutes so I was like huh let's give that a try cuz normally brown rice takes a while so I'm gonna give this a try I just like all of the addresses on the back you basically just bring rice in water to boil and you let it sit for 10 to 12 minutes and we'll see how that turns out if you're a mom of multiple like I am these come in oh my goodness I can't even like talk about how amazing that this is it is raw chicken breast and it's already cut up into pieces so you don't have to chop and it's frozen I get to send my local Costco I love it I a bag will last us about a month depending on how many meals I use it for because it has about four pounds so yeah and I'm also going to add in some I think I'm saying right Trader Joe's so yaki sauce I'm gonna add that into the dish as well and as you can tell we really enjoy that here so we're gonna pick up another one so let me show you guys a quick 20 minute meal that my family seems to really enjoy so when I recorded this I didn't realize that the simmering of the chicken would be so loud and it is so basically I'm just going to brown the chicken and I'm going to let the white rice come up to a boil and it would it be mom life it if I didn't show you that I am doing the babies laundry as I am making dinner time so once your chicken is fully cooked us is gonna add in some broccoli and then you just gonna mix it all together I would say about five minutes to about eight minutes on medium high simmer for about six minutes and then I added some the wraps a rocky sauce about and now I'm just letting that sauce simmer in the [Music] so in this clip I also realized that it was so loud so I basically threw in there that some of that sake sauce about 1/4 of a cup and I mixed it up and I just let it simmer for about five minutes and I checked on my rice thank you so much for watching again this is her 20 minute meal it was so yummy it was filling it was healthy it was fast I want to thank you guys for watching my video if you like videos like these please give it a thumbs up and I will make sure to make more bye bye", "EM81V9sgdos": "get closer because we're outdoors I have to project a lot and we're gonna become fast friends today thank you so much for coming first of all my name is Sergey I've been studying plants for a very long time and that's kind of what makes me credible to talk about this I'm not a botanist I don't claim to be I've just been doing it a really long time my family threw me into this is the short version of the story when I was just 13 years old my mom decided to hike from Mexico to Canada on the Pacific Crest Trail and we had no business hiking we'd never hiked more than a day before they took me to like a played against or invested what little money we had into really crappy backpacks and then on April mid-april in 1998 we had a friend drop us off on the Mexican border to start hiking as an adult I realize like how crazy this is but when I was a kid I was like oh I guess everybody's family does this okay when you hike that far you obviously can't pack all the food on your back right so you have to make arrangements beforehand to pack parcels of food that you ship to yourself and then every time you pass a little town you resupply again we had no experience hiking we sort of started guessing well how much food could five hungry hikers really eat in a week because the resupply points were about a week apart and I said five so as my mom my dad my sister me and then my cousin from Russia came to visit us for a year because my uncle wanted her to get a full rounded experience right so for six months of that year we took her into the woods to give her the American experience but that's a different story we get on the trail and within a few short days we understand that our calculations were off we just sort of figured all like how many dates can you really eat we allotted five dates per person per day small bottle of olive oil we're also raw food vegans at the time so we had a lot to think about a week into the trip we started running out of food so we have two more days left to hike and yet our food is gone how many people have tried fasting before by a show hands anybody it's not very fun right you always think about food now imagine fasting when you're expending 4,000 calories a day even less fun so we had a little family meeting we had to either decide whether we quit the trail and stop doing this or improvise and my mom's all about improvisation so you know she got some input we the kids were like well let's quit and my mom's like yeah let's not quit we picked up a little book upon wild edibles and we started just learning about different plants that was one of our little solutions that we came up with that first week was really scary and slowly we started learning new plants we used to test all plants on my father because he didn't speak English so my mom said that if we lost him it wouldn't be as big of an impact on the family that's Russian black humor long story short we successfully completed the trail at a certain point we were eating 60 to 70% wild edibles by volume so we were able to stretch the food parcels that we prepackaged and just put a bunch of wild food in them fill them up and so from a very early age I got to see that it's doable it's realistic just like any new skill it's hard at first but you perpetually get better and so today is going to be about perpetually getting better one of the things I really hope to accomplish is that through repetition we're just gonna learn at least three new plants and that's my goal for today that each one of you walks away knowing how to identify at least three plants if you learn 10 great but let's keep the bar low because my motto is always keep it simple stupid let's do like 10 minutes of theory because I think that's important in the parking lot and then the second part we'll go into the park to Jefferson Park right over there and we're just going to do hands-on looking at plants studying them talking about how you would eat them I propose that today we're not going to eat anything in fact maybe we can make that agreement simply because I've been here for about a month exploring and it's not the cleanest park so in the in the interest of keeping everybody safe let's just look at plants let's talk about them you know sniff them but let's not put them in our mouth sound good promise pinky promise okay and the reason for that is because outside of you know they're being plants that you shouldn't eat human pollutants are actually almost as big of a concern in fact maybe more so pesticides herbicides various chemicals railroad ties that's something we're going to talk about as well so why is it important to learn about plants the main reason is because it enriches our life it teaches us about our environment and actually that I recently learned from expand yoga because I started coming here and doing more yoga and I I know there's a whole list of various benefits like you get more limber and psychologically you rest but also I realized that yoga teaches you about about your immediate surroundings right so when liz and matt tell us to get in warrior 2 if you've never done warrior 2 before now you know you can do warrior 2 and then they say like we'll reach around and grab you know clasp your hands behind your back and you're like holy moly I didn't know I could do that now I have that as a skill it's in my repertoire so you've just expanded your life because now you know you could squat down like this and if you ever needed to you could do it right in that same sense plants do the same thing you go to the park and you're completely novice and it just looks like greenery you have no idea what it is then you start crouching down you start slowly examining every tiny little morsel every plant and your world gets so much bigger you know you think the world is huge because there's seven continents and you can fly for 11 hours and end up in Russia or wherever how much bigger is the world when you start looking at all the little microcosms so to me one of the biggest benefits of wild edibles is that it literally enriches your life it makes it bigger and how fortuitous that expand yoga is sponsoring this it's like a symbiotic relationship almost let's figure out if our worlds need expanding I made some handouts take one pass it around I'm gonna quiz you remember college anybody pop quiz this right here is a test that I came up with um it's in my book I have a wild edibles book shameless plug I have a couple copies that will be for sale afterwards but this is a test that's going to help us figure out how much we know about the natural world versus how much we know about the technological modern world so when everybody gets it we're gonna take it together I made this in 2012 so some of the knit brand names are now becoming obsolete but let's start from the left the top left and let's just shout it out what's that first T Twitter no cheating by the way no looking at the bottom how about the next one next one this is where everybody gets dumped MySpace how about the check mark next one McDonald's Mercedes Lacoste a French tennis brand right now it gets harder now let's look at the the names of the plants what's a oak well I'm impressed how about the next one for I like fur see how many people say clover raise your hand nice and high how many people say sorrel it's sort of good job all right dee not maple great ii maple seed pod or helicopter 8f Douglas fir cone see how the voices are kind of like getting okay gee I like the Christmas tree what type of Christmas tree it's a fern yeah so fir tree H Aspen good and I that's a maple okay so you guys did better than most but we could still expand our world a little bit more the second handout is what I call Sergei's wild edibles cheat sheet so it's basically a little printout I made to PDF and it on the front it has nine of my favorite plants and on the back it has some nutritional data and stuff and so I'm going to give you the paper version which you can laminate or you could use it and love it on this hike and then if you want to laminate it later because I'm emanated this for Liz and Mac there you go present you could go to my website which is on here print this off for free take it to the print shop get it laminated stick it in your car or your backpack and now you have a little field guide alright so there's some major benefits to wild edibles and I want to quickly run through those as well as how to stay safe benefit number one free food everybody knows that people kind of that's synonymous with wild edibles but when you look at it in depth food costs are continuously rising every year they go up three to five percent when I wrote my book in 2013 they were already expensive but in 2019 grocery store food bills are even higher than before especially if you want to eat healthy you go to met market or you go to a co-op you can barely get out of there for less than a hundred bucks right the food that we are gonna learn how to harvest and eat today is significantly going to reduce your monthly expenditure on food so during the summer months May through November I can offset easily forty percent of my food cost just by harvesting food out of my backyard you don't even have to go far some people think oh wild edibles it's a big pain in the butt you got to get in your car you got to take an entire day off of work go somewhere far it's literally stuff that's growing all around your house in a neighborhood park that kind of thing so wild edibles equal free food wild edibles are also healthier for you as well as the planet so because these plants are wild they're as nature intended they have longer root systems that can go down below depleted topsoil and draw out vital minerals and they also often grow in soils that haven't been depleted Janice Schofield an author that I deeply respect she also says that wild edibles have stronger immune systems for the area where they grow so for example if you live in Tacoma Washington and you harvest a dandelion that also lives in Tacoma Washington you can boost your immune system in the local region additionally when you eat chips or crackers from the store they come in plastic triple wrapped in plastic and the sole purpose of that plastic is to be thrown away that bothers me every time I do it like that's the only use for that thing it's for cleanliness and to be thrown away when you eat plants anything that's left over goes in your compost turns into soil it it reduces waste so healthier for you in the planet benefit number three is the epitome of local food the average food the average produce travels roughly about 2,500 miles to get from where it's grown to your plate a dandelion grows in your backyard so literally you walk out the back door and that's textbook local food so less of a carbon footprint it also diversifies your food Michael Pollan in his book in defense of food writes that hundreds of you ago we used to eat up to 80,000 different species of things and when I say species I'm not just talking about like elk and deer different plants thousands of different plants thousands of different nuts and seeds and grains and then over time that's reduced reduced reduced to roughly he says three thousand I actually think it's closer to three hundred so we think we live this diverse life where one day we have Italian food then we have Mexican food then we have Russian food and really all we're eating is wheat corn corn byproducts rice sugar and a few different things why do you think it's important to have a diverse diet anyone so diversity is important because all food is comprised of different micronutrients and the more diversity we get in our diet the more likely we're to meet all of our recommended daily allowances we eat some miner's lettuce it gives us some vitamin C we eat some kale it gives us some protein and some other minerals and so on and so forth and when we eat a very diverse diet our bodies get enough and I really think that the first person that coined the phrase eat a balanced diet he or she probably like pointed at everything and said you know here's some Lakes eat some food from there some algie's here's the ocean eat some more seaweed from there eat some pine nuts from the mountains eat a diverse balanced diet so wild edibles will help us expand our food options exponentially they also prepare us for unfortunate events should ever should a disaster ever happen you'll actually know what to eat and to other benefits that are worth mentioning is a they're gonna help you bond and make memories with your friends and family it really kind of important have you ever cooked a meal together you laugh you play now imagine going outside and harvesting the food and then making the meal it's it just kind of adds another layer and finally we're all here outside it's becoming more and more of a commodity these days we're standing we're getting vitamin D probably a little bit too much for our liking at the moment but we're getting vitamin D from the Sun we're breathing in fresh air and we're gonna crouch and we're gonna dig and that's going to lead to a benefit we call exercise that's my spiel I could talk more on this but I think we should just get at it start talking about plants a little warning we're gonna be very repetitive today and I do that systematically because I want you to remember one of my wild edibles teachers she actually lives in Issaquah her name is Karen Sherwood of Earth walks Northwest and that's one of the lessons I took away from her is that if you are repetitive you strengthen a muscle and then you'll remember it for the rest of your life so that's how we're gonna remember a lot of plants on that note let's go this is the only one I found I've been coming to this park for about a month now like every couple days and this is the only wild sweet pea that I found this is a very controversial plant so at every wild edibles class I've ever done somebody's always like but what about the guy and into the wild he supposedly died from eating sweet peas a version of this plant the first thing I want to say about that is that story is very inaccurate you read the book it says one thing you watch the movie it's a completely different story Jon Krakauer has been criticized heavily for a lot of his books but while into the wild is probably the biggest criticism he's received there's an author his name is Samuel Thayer really awesome dude a forger I respect in his book nature's garden he has a great account of into the wild kind of the true story basically what ended up happening is Chris McCandless he starved to death that was the official coroner's like what the coroner determined but it wasn't a very good story because you know this kid going out into the woods and for many many months not getting enough calories and then starving to death how are you gonna sell that it's a much more interesting story to sell this sort of scary fable about how plants he just ate a plant and it killed him so he supposedly mistook wild sweet pea for wild potato after he died both wild sweet peas and wild potatoes were studied extensively and neither the plants were found to be poisonous in fact one of the botanists that studied the plant said that I would eat both plants so this is a very lovely tasty plant that tastes just like a bean sprout and it grows all over it develops purple flowers sometimes they're yellow kind of looks like a house P it's a vine right today a lot of what we're gonna be doing is I'm gonna say please describe it to me please describe it to me so just take it take a look pass it around take one pass it around so what does it look like it looks like a sweet pea I need more information than that that rabbit ears for leaves ah I like curly Q's and tendrils so initially when you go out and you look for plants they all look green as hard to differentiate between the two and this is where we get scared because we're like oh look well how do I learn what a sweet pea is versus a sweet potato or whatever you learn about it in the same way that you learn how to identify a cabbage versus a head of iceberg lettuce our brains have folders in our heads and the folders just start storing information and that information is called a search image so when you're very young you probably didn't know the difference between a lemon and an orange right your parents could show you a lemon in an orange you'd be like I don't know they both look round and they both have a skin and eventually as you came in contact with lemons and oranges you started differentiating one in the other the same thing is gonna happen when we talk about plants so when I say what does it look like in somebody says oh it has tendrils that's a very good identifying characteristic that's going to help you recognize the plant so we're improving our search image and when you look at a plant long enough the folder gets really full and then for the rest of your life you'll know this is a wild sweet pea the sweet pea also teaches us something called Mary stems and Mary stems are the growing parts of plants so when a plant is growing meristem actually comes from the greek term to divide so when cells divide and split apart those are called meristematic parts so when a plant is young its light green and it's very flexible it's full of sugars it's full of minerals and vitamins and that's when its most nutritious and most delicious as the plant gets taller or longer the plant cannot support itself if it's all flexible so it starts developing a solid foundation very fibrous so you know if you feel this plant the bottom is very stiff compared to the top so this part is meristematic like the tops of asparagus for example you could snap them off they're very flexible they're very delicious but you go down the stem and it's very fibrous not as delicious so as foragers we're gonna want to look for the tops the meristematic bits so on the wild sweet pea in addition to the flower the meristematic part is this tender a little bit on we go there you go my gift to you uh-huh Sergei yep so the whole plant is edible but we're going to talk about that it's it's kind of um it's very objective while you can eat this part how hungry are you more often than not I just go through and I'd harvest like a small bowl of those and that's what I'd throw on a salad okay oh we go my friends get sick of this cuz like they'll take me out on a hike and I'm like there's there's like five things to talk about right here so the next thing that I want to talk about which most of us already know is grass grass is a plant that most people can already identify right there's lots of different varieties of grass and in my book it's probably the best survival food because everybody knows what grass is it's hard to miss I miss that there's some sedges and stuff that kind of looked like grass but more often not people know what grass looks like the grass has all the vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain proper body function which means that if your car ever gets stuck in the forest and you don't know what else to do you're really hungry grass will sustain you now we're not cattle we don't have seven stomachs it's very hard to digest but again if we look for the meristematic bits the light green parts they're kind of chewy and here hold on whenever I do this on camera it never works but boom BAM see so maybe let's let's all try this let's all come over here and just kind of pull on the top and try and expose this light green part so grass is kind of a tube right and if you pull at just the right place you can expose you kind of hear like a little squeak like a whoop yeah so when we were hiking on the trail for example one thing I would do I would get ahead of my family because I was walking them fastest I was a 13 year old boy and had a lot of energy to expend and I would just walk all day and I'd come and throw it away throw it away so by the end of the day maybe I had a thousand pieces of grass you know and this part is actually quite delicious again it's that kind of meristematic asparagus like part and then the other thing that accomplishes is because nature is very wise so when I harvest this eat this little bit and then throw the grass I'm planting more grass the symbiotic relationship and Wigmore does anybody heard the name and Wigmore before she's the lady that popularized wheatgrass so she was a Lithuanian woman who had all kinds of health problems and the medical industry basically said we can't help you and she noticed that her cat was sitting and eating grass every time it was sick and then it would get better so Ann Wigmore started eating grass and her health problems started going away and she was the lady that pioneered wheatgrass so now you go to the store and you pay $4 for a little shot of wheatgrass that's because of her but I have a little secret for you you could just juice the grass in your yard and then it save four dollars how about that it's the same exact quality there's nothing special about wheatgrass other than it grows the fastest I used to grow wheatgrass for a Health Institute and the certain red hard wheat just produces the most grass the quickest but there's lots of other wild grasses that are more nutritious than that now if you're gonna juice grass or blended in a smoothie you have to ensure that it hasn't been sprayed with pesticides so in my own backyard I know for two years we haven't been spraying it I would definitely throw that in a green smoothie or juice it but you know I wouldn't go necessarily to a park to do it the next plant is right over here that I want to talk about anybody know this is I like where you're going you've got you guys are not wrong so this is called sow thistle and I already knows what this looks like so why don't you guys pass it around sow thistle is in the same family as dandelion which is the sunflower family and it's essentially the root of lettuce so thousands of years ago when lettuce didn't exist people just ate dandelions and sow thistle if you've ever chewed on dandelion you know that it's very bitter my guess is how we got lettuce from dandelions as people got really sick of that bitter taste and so they started looking for varieties of dandelion that were less bitter and once they found that variety they started waiting for that variety to go to seed growing those seeds and then again choosing selectively the least bitter variety and growing those seeds and over time we have romaine lettuce which almost looks nothing like dandelion but it's in the same family so both sow thistle and dandelion are extremely good for our inner organs the bitterness kind of the white milky sap which some people say is not good to eat that's pure BS that bitterness is actually really good for cleansing our gall bladder our pancreas our kidneys and it also aids digestion we need bitters to help produce saliva and bile in our stomach and it helps digest food unfortunately now that we donuts and cheesecake and all that stuff bitter just doesn't compete so we throw the dandelions away or we can complain that they're weeds when in fact we should be eating more of this and throwing the donut away the easiest way to eat dandelions is to blend them in a green smoothie because when you blend sweet with bitter the sweetness counteracts the bitter and then the other thing that's good to do with them is put them in a pesto so you make pesto with pine nuts a little parmesan basil just cut out the basil and throw the dandelions in there and then the sweet and or sorry the salty and bitter it just it tastes delicious alright let's keep going there you go thank you absolutely okay thanks for bringing that up yeah what was your name Jenny Jenny that's me - jennice - Ichi today I love it yeah let's talk about it so let's address dandelion I had two questions number one oxalates there's two ways to think about plants number one there's like the botanist toxicology perspective which is like is this plant poisonous or edible based on its chemical build-up and when you look at that almost everything is poisonous so if you read a book about toxicology you find that things like mint are poisonous dandelions have certain alkaloids or oxalates in them that are poisonous in large quantities and the second perspective is more the Native American perspective where nothing is poisonous it's all about dosage certain parts that you can eat and the time of year that you can eat it I tend to side more with the Native American perspective because all the research that I've done sort of points in that and that that is the right direction so oxalates all greens have some trace amounts of either alkaloids oxalates or anti nutrients that it's a mechanism to preserve the the plant so the plant doesn't want you to only eat kale because if we only ate kale the kale would go extinct so kale tells you this it says like you can eat me but if you eat 10 buckets of me you're gonna have some signs of less than perfect health maybe the stomachache maybe you're gonna get a little hives some some relatively minor issues that we would like to avoid but nonetheless it's not going to kill you my mom Victoria Buteyko she came up with the concept of green smoothies and popularized them through her books and people loved it for 10 years and then all of this like don't eat kale and spinach because it has oxalate stuff started coming around because people supposedly would get like gall stones that from that right the trouble with that theory is that chocolate beer wheat and a bunch of other stuff have oxalates in them too and nobody is saying don't eat chocolate wheat or beer at least not at the local brewery but it's the green smoothie that gives you the gall stones right so have many resources online about this subject in particular I actually have a youtube video I'm on YouTube prevalently and and basically it's a non-issue if you eat a diverse diet if you were to eat buckets of kale every single day again you might run into some problems if you rotate your greens if you rotate the food that you eat it's not an issue because those oxalates will get eradicated through your kidneys and liver so it's not a big deal now if you were to eat seasonally this would be even less of an issue because in the springtime you're going to eat lots of dandelion then dandelions go away you're going to eat something else but because we've quote/unquote improved life we're now we have kale all year round at the grocery store you know it's it's more of an issue the second question was do you eat things cooked yeah wild edibles you're gonna cram them in your diet every which way you can throw them in salads and I'll spotlight some of the things that you could do with salads you know put these in smoothies do some you can also put them on your pizzas and saute them up throw them in soups get them into your diet as best as you can because these are superfoods and these are supplements that you don't have to pay for one of my rants on supplements is that it's kind of controversial some people don't like that I say this but I've never taken supplements I've tried many times but I found that there's there's no effect supplements first are sold on a fear-based scheme the nutrients that are around is not enough if you just eat organic food you'll never be healthy that's kind of how that supplement story starts and then if you like oh no man even if I shop at a Whole Foods and buy the best ingredients that I can buy I still don't get enough that's scary maybe I should get your supplement you take the best supplement and best most expensive supplement you twirl it around and read on the ingredients list and what is it made up if yeah most of the time it's like rice protein with some of the good stuff like 90% rice 10% everything else but if it's a really high quality supplement it's made out of fresh organic produce so please explain to me how if lettuce doesn't have enough of what I need but the supplement that I'm buying from you is made from lettuce like how does that make sense okay let's talk about this plant right here everybody grab one when we harvest plants I encourage everybody to engage all of their senses we have five senses because each one of those community is a different form of communication each one of those senses is meant to help keep us safe so sometimes when people get poisoned from eating stuff they're not supposed to it's because they just like and they only engage one sense well that's for other tests that you failed to do and the other thing on that that I want to say is that wild plants are not dangerous the only way that you would get poisoned is if you're just going through the woods and you just start eating stuff before you identify what they are all right there's no like bad dandelion sitting in an alley waiting for you to walk down that alley so they can jump down your throat so number one if you can resist the temptation to just eat foreign foods you'll always be safe then we engage our senses so we we put all plants through five different tests first what does it look like so what does this look like kind of like chamomile I like it you're a professional so it looks like chamomile so already it's telling us hey this looks like a familiar food that I'm accustomed to eating right that's a very good point I'm so glad you brought that up the next test is how what does it feel like it's soft I could conceivably eat this because it feels soft if I were to try and eat that telephone pole maybe my eyes were to get confused I don't think they would but if they left my eyes got confused I'd feel it and my hands would tell me what my eyes missed this is really hard I'd break my teeth if I would eat it right this little plant has now passed the looking test and the feeling test now what does it smell like if if you smash the flower it smells like pineapple and I'm so glad you bring this up because this is called pineapple weed and it's a wild camomile so look at that this is how we learn about plants so it looks like chamomile well lots of plants look like chamomile we feel it it feels soft we smell it oh wow it smells like pineapple so now we just learned looks like chamomile smells like pineapple those are really good identifying characteristics so we have two more senses what does it sound like in Native American lore you would actually talk to the plant and it would talk to you which is a quality that I've lost but I interpret that sense to to be like what does the environment sound like I hear somebody mowing is that as somebody spraying chemicals is there a big roadway nearby is there anything and is there any sound that might jeopardize the edibility of this plant and then the very last test is what does it taste like and so you're not just gonna grab a bunch of it at the at the beginning and just put it in your mouth and go I hope it tastes good you're gonna approach it cautiously and you're gonna just eat a little bit and then you're gonna wait and then if you do this cotton you know cautiously and over time you'll understand though camomile wild wild camomile aka pineapple wheat if you dry this it makes a really good tea chamomile has calming properties if you have any sort of allergic stuff going on because of the seasons or food allergies it'll soothe those and it also helps to improve sleep so what I would do I would actually throw these flowers and tender leaves into salad I would saute them put them on an omelet if you will throw them in soups or just dry the leaves and make a tea out of them so okay so if there was my very first time eating this plant I would just put like a handful on it right and then just see what happens a handful is fine a lot of people get nervous about wild edibles because they think oh if I miss identify it the consequences are huge but the quant the consequence is most of the time are relatively insignificant like you might get a little bit of a stomach upset that being said we want to eliminate as many variables and consequences as possible so we approach new food cautiously and then we eliminate those variables and in fact actually on that sheet that I gave you I have ser gays rules for foraging and it's three simple rules number one don't eat something if you don't know what it is kind of common sense a lot of people actually disregard that surprisingly I get emails all the time people say my kids and I went out and we harvested this plant can you tell us what it is we ate a bunch of it like so I actually made a rap song that's on YouTube called don't eat something if you don't know what it is that plays around with how silly that can be the second rule is eat new foods and small amounts so maybe when you're young everything is foreign to you and your parents are very cautious like what is what happens when he eats sweet potatoes yeah he's good what happens when he eats lettuce oh he's fine and then maybe you get two peanuts and the your parents figure out pretty quickly oh he's not peanuts don't do so well for him so you learn at a young age what you're allergic to and what you're not allergic to well in the interest of staying safe that's essentially what you're doing when you're playing around with new plants so you're gonna approach all new plants as though you're potentially allergic to them so even though Sergei says pineapple weed is 100% edible the first time you eat pineapple weed you're just going to eat a little bit and then rule number three is you don't mix plants because if I made a salad with 15 new wild edibles and then I had an allergic reaction that'd be very hard to weed out what caused it right let's keep gone [Applause] so real quick what do you guys see right now when you look at this part what's the first thing that comes to mind grass dandelions dogs walking I like all those things because look you already just altered your world a little bit you know maybe before this started you would have just seen a park now I already had two different edibles grass and dandelions and three I love that you said dogs walking because that's a really good thing to consider hey there's animals it's a high-traffic area good job one more thing about dandelions these things are really edible and they're delicious the little flowers so when you're at home I invite you to this is your homework just take one of these flowers and plop it in your mouth chew it up you'll notice that it's very sweet kind of has a pleasant green kale like taste these things concentrate vitamin D and guess what in areas where we lack it many months out of the year this is a really good thing to put in your diet now how do you eat it flower fritters you can fry them up in a little bit of oil and batter great you can also take these and stick them and honey and the honey will just concentrate preserve them right so you make like a dandelion infused jam you can throw them on salads raw you can throw them in soups one thing I like to do sometimes is actually take the petals out out of it put them in an ice cube tray fill it with water freeze them now you have flour pedaled infused ice and in a summery drink it looks beautiful makes sense okay we're going to go into the shade over there kind of get a little reprieve from the Sun and talk about some plants oh yeah is it necessary to wash that absolutely you want to wash stuff yeah I like it okay there's been a few follow-ups about dandelion one is about the roots and one about the leaves let's see if we can't get both here so we'll do some digging and careful there's blackberries okay so number one if you can find a dandelion actually I'd love everybody to grab a leaf of dandelion if you can okay everybody has a dandelion leaf right here's a test to identify a true dandelion you're gonna flip it over and you're gonna run your finger along the main vein tell me what you feel smooth fuzz Wow let's see that should be smooth not so so the leaves are a little fuzzy but the vein of a dandelion is smooth that's a true dandelion so that's one great identifying characteristic so the one with fuzz on it is not a dandelion so there's lots of different varieties of dandelions like I already mentioned there in the sunflower family the sunflower family is the largest family of plants there's nearly 24,000 varieties and a lot of those are edible I don't want to speak in absolutes I don't want to say all of them are edible because some people might be allergic to dandelion for example and so for them they're not edible but it's a very good family to get accustom with accustomed to because you could potentially expand your food choices 24 thousand different ways right and I believe there's over 300 varieties of dandelions and all of them are edible you can eat the leaves and smoothies and soups salads you can eat the flowers you can eat the stems and you can also eat the roots but generally I don't Lee eat the roots because when you harvest the roots it kills the plant so in my book I have a chapter called respect the roots with something like a dandelion it's not a big issue because dandelions are extremely resilient so if you see a hundred dandelions growing you can eat 99 of them and they'll be fine but with other plants like wild ginger for example it's really really sensitive so if you start harvesting roots you're gonna wipe out that population and then it won't grow there so in an effort to be more ecological I suppose and responsible I didn't stay away from the roots and just harvest the greens and the fruits because I feel like that's nature's gift to us and I also I'm kind of lazy sometimes I feel like it's a lot easier to harvest some greens than some roots that's kind of where I stand on roots if you were to eat them you could bake them in the same way that you bake like sweet potatoes or potatoes in the south they actually make a coffee substitute out of dandelion roots and chicory roots it does not have caffeine so you get the taste of coffee but you don't get the stimulant what else can I tell you is there any other questions about roots so in this park I probably would not eat the roots because I haven't done my due diligence I haven't called the Parks Service to figure out what they spray or don't spray but in my yard I would eat the roots absolutely yeah okay we're standing under a tree who knows what kind of tree this is horse chestnut so horse chestnuts are not traditionally considered edible but since we're here I just want to point out everybody grab a chestnut so they look very similar to the chestnuts that we eat around Christmastime the one major difference between those and horse chestnuts is that the edible ones have a deep point on one side and these ones are kind of round with no point if you ever want to identify a true chestnut it's gonna look just like this but on the butt of it is going to have a sharp point so why are some edible why are not some not it's kind of an alkaloid issue we talked about oxalates horse chestnuts just concentrate more tannins so they're very bitter they hurt our stomach they're not considered edible so you would not eat these but the other horse or the other chestnuts with the point that have less tannins thus they are more edible and again something like this Native Americans might not consider poisonous because there are ways of extracting tannins for acorns and chestnuts but they're very labor-intensive and like I said I'm a little bit lazy I like to kind of throw something in my blender and get going so I can do it but I generally don't make sense again we have some wild grasses now you can see there's two different varieties at least so you have kind of more of like a wild oat type looking grass which has seeds and then you have like a big you have another variety of grass which probably from a foraging standpoint is going to be a much better thing to spend your time harvesting because look how thick it is versus this then you pull on the top there's more meristematic bits to eat versus this so one thing to think about you know if you're harvesting food you're gonna go for something that gives you more reward right and it'd be the thicker dress the other thing worth pointing out right here is blackberries so blackberries obviously the berries are edible but the leaves on blackberries are also edible and in fact they're really good for things like dysentery for fungus stuff they have antibacterial properties if you're ever traveling for example and you run into stomach issues you can eat charcoal but you can also eat blackberries raspberries thimble berries those leaves will help settle your stomach so how would you eat them good questions so right here check it out another lesson in merry stems so everybody trying and kind of get close and you can see that some as the plant matures the thorns get really stiff and hard but then if you look at the top part you see that it's lighter green that's the meristematic part of the blackberry and now very carefully just feel the thorns and notice how they're not quite developed yet so you can go through with a little knife and peel the thorns and eat the little stems of the blackberry and that's kind of more like you're a little wild asparagus or you can take the young leaves which are pretty much thornless use those in a salad or if you boil them down the thorns become completely not an issue they just go away the best way that I've found to use them is you just dry these leaves crush them up throw them in tea and then take a little bit with you when you've got traveled internationally and now you know that this stuff will help settle your stomach now the one caution about your blackberries and raspberries is you don't want to eat the leaves when they're wilting so you want to eat them fresh or you want to fully dry them because in the wilting process they start releasing like more alkaloids or something and it can sometimes have the opposite effect but if you eat them fresh like within an hour of harvesting or fully dry completely no problem all blackberries and raspberries are in the rose family roses apples blackberries are in the same family and a lot of those relatives are edible and delicious by the way wild roses are delicious in salads just the petals themselves and you know since in Washington you have a lot of them and they grow like weeds eat the weeds right behind you there's another plant I want to talk about it's called common mallow that's it yeah here's well sacrifice this root for the group okay I want to hear it what does it look like geranium good what else I'll tell you a little story so I went to here in Tacoma actually were really lucky cuz two really good foragers live within driving range one of my teachers her name is Karen Sherwood she lives in Issaquah and every Memorial Day holiday she hosts a three-day retreat outside of Yakima where all you do all day long is you harvest plants and then you make food and you harvest plants and you make food really good thing to look up her company's called Earth walks Northwest and then another guy does the same thing out of Portland his name is John Kahless he's another awesome dude so when I went to my first workshop with Karen she said Sara hey here's a big bowl go get a bunch of clovers put it in your salad we're gonna put it in everybody's salad so go out with the bowl and I don't collect anything I can't find a single clover to save my life and I come back deflated I'm like Karen there's no clover she says take this bowl go back to the field squat crawl if you have to but bring it back full of clovers so I go back to the exact same field where I was it was kind of on farm property and I squat and I start looking closely it was an entire field of clover I just wasn't looking close enough so there I learned the importance of describing a plant and when I say what does it look like I'm not looking for anything specific I mean I am because I know what it looks like but I'm looking for key words to hear like how will you remember this plant so when I say what does it look like what I want to hear from you is how will you remember this plant let's try it again what does it look like adora I like it uh-huh what else it's soft I love that very good so look at all these things it looks like a geranium and a doily it's got a soft fuzzy flower and a rough stem great characteristics yes it has lots of stems instead of main ones now if you look at how its growing on the ground what can you tell me do you think it's a creeping plant or do you think it's going to grow straight up very good identifying characteristic so this plant is called mallow common mallow or malva and it's actually a close relative of okra so when you see this plant this is one of the best eats that you can forage and it's a very common weed it likes dry soils so you'll generally find it growing in the Sun every part is edible though the flowers or the the leaves I'm sorry are the most delicious and if you were to eat them they taste just like okra they have like a gelatinous quality to them so what can you do with that you could put it in a gumbo you can make it okra gumbo great in soups sometimes when you make a smoothie and it starts to separate it kind of looks unappetizing you throw a little common mallow in it and it just makes it binds it better in fact in the olden days they used to use this plant in the cheese-making process where they would use it as a binding agent it also has little flowers and the flowers kind of look like they almost look like the little bluebells that grow everywhere and these flowers are delicious and salads if you ever go to a potluck and you bring a salad and sprinkle a handful on top of that people will go bananas and this grows in your backyard any questions about common mallow ma ll o w his name is David Wolfe he's kind of a health nut guy he's been all over social media for many years but when I met the guy it right before we started hiking the trail actually he introduced me to this plant and what we would do is we just take big leaves of mallow roll avocado in them and sprinkle them with lemon juice it was a really delicious snack actually on we go oh we didn't go very far what is this plant right here it's a bottle somebody said said it the dead nettle who would that sounds really scary everybody grab one and let's study it yeah perfect I might sit here for a while there's some over there too this is called purple dead nettle and it has a very ominous name it's actually not poisonous at all this is a wild mint it doesn't smell like mint so we're engaging all our senses everybody smell it it kind of has like a musky smell the reason it's called purple dead nettle is because it kind of looks similar to stinging nettles and because of that people don't like the way that nettles itches I think I guess that's where I got the name all mints have a square stem so just like the dandelion has a smooth stem all mints have a square stem the mint family is full of edible plants it's a good thing to know how would you use this I would just basically take that much of it and throw it in anything whether that that is a a salad this you know it's a little bit fuzzy so I probably wouldn't eat this raw but I mean I I could eat it Rob but because it's a little bit fuzzy I wouldn't enjoy it as much so let's come up with some ways that you would eat this anybody saute I like the tea idea but I mean let's let's get creative here what else could you do with this don't worry if you if you say something I don't like I'll tell you pizza anybody else tempura yeah I like it those are all great you can eat the stem and all mints again help to calm the system so if you have any sort of seasonal allergies or you ate something and it doesn't agree with your belly eating a little bit of mint will help to soothe it so that's like a really good thing to know so maybe if you're going traveling internationally if you want to go above and beyond you take some purple dead nettle and you dry the leaves and you mix it with some blackberries or raspberries and you dry the leaves and you kind of make yourself a little bag of of greens which hopefully customs won't sniff you for I usually put it in like a little supplement bottle I think that's what supplements are good they have like a nice little thing and and then I just make a tea out of them abroad okay who remembers the quiz that I gave them everybody grab some of these these are little baby helicopters and helicopters identify a plant or a tree what's that tree maple very good so this for this forest this Park has lots of different types of trees in it and trees are a class of foods that I would sort of consider as like a survival food because a lot of the common trees that we're used to encountering have edible parts and maple is certainly one of them they're kind of like in that grass area where it's not the best meal that you'll ever have but they are edible so in dire circumstances you could eat these tiny little maple seeds that'll give you some nutrition you can also see how some of these leaves are very tender and actually it's maple so they're very sticky you're I believe feel a leaf and that stickiness is actually maple syrup right the lifeblood of a maple tree is a clear fluid that's like maple juice and then people will go in here and tap the tree and get a big bucket full of this clear maple juice maple blood and then they'll boil it down for about 30 hours I believe it's 30 hours it might even be longer and eventually it'll concentrate and turn in to maple syrup and just like you can do that with maple you could also do it with birch you could do it with Aspen and so like in Europe during World War two when there was food shortages a lot of people in Russia and Germany and France they actually went and they would eat like little buds of maples the seed pods the leaves and they would cook them in their soups just that it's pure nutrition so it's really good to know about that hey you know this is a maple that's a beech that's a birch and all all parts of those things are edible you can actually there's a layer inside the bark called the cambium layer the inner layer it makes for good eatin that would be in the same category as roots though you want to know exactly what you're doing so as not to kill the tree over here okay if I was a wild edibles superhero and I had a tool belt on my tool belt I would certainly include this plant so grab a leaf and pass it around I want to see if I can't find the other there's two varieties of this plant grab belief pass it around this is called plantain and it has no relation to the banana this is a very fun plant this plant has a lot of amino acids in it which is also known like as protein a lot of plant-based protein the reason I would have this on my belt as a superhero is because this plant can literally save your life so plantain has this miraculous quality to drop poison out of your system topically so for example a couple years ago I was showing off in front of some friends and I was doing a handstand I fell in the grass and I got stung on my back by numerous bees and I'm not allergic so it wasn't a big deal but if you are it could have been a really big deal right so it started to hurt and was uncomfortable and I knew what to do I ran around and I found this plant I chewed it up made a poultice spit it into my friends hand and I said can you please rub it on my back within 10 minutes the pain is gone so if you ever get stung by an ant a be a spider if you step on a rusty piece of metal and you can't get to the hospital right away this plant will actually draw toxins out of your skin Janice Sheffield an author that wrote a book called discovering wild plants she talks about how her dad I guess he was accident-prone and so one time he treated a gunshot wound with this stuff and another time he had blood poisoning which is a very serious thing and he was able to not die basically by using applying plantain to the wound have you ever heard of psyllium husk what is psyllium husk it's like oh here you go Liz found it this is a the other variety of Frank jobless so this is lanceleaf plantain this is broadleaf plantain so psyllium husk is a supplement type food that helps digestion it's like natural vegan gelatin right where does psyllium husk come from plantain so wild crafted food so a plantain will develop these seed pods that look very similar to baby corn it's a little too early for it right now but they'll develop these massive long stalks that can have up to twenty thousand seeds on them and those little stalks are delicious when you boil them they taste just like baby corn that's number one when those twenty thousand seeds all develop husks around them people somehow somehow have shake the husk away and that's what psyllium husk is so so what are some of the key identifying characteristics of plantain its fibrous at the bottom very good I love it okay so the top of the leaf is a darker green than the bottom of the leaf can everybody see that there's something very obvious yes so the veins grow out really long you see that they're very easy to distinguish I think that you like greens done so here check this out here's one of my own personal identifying characteristics so if you take the stem stem of plantain and you carefully crush it look at this so try that if you can find plantain near you see if you can expose some of the threads oh here I'll come over here so yeah here play around with that I'm gonna show these folks okay so yeah check it out so if you just see how they have these lateral veins if you just pull really carefully it starts exposing threads like like it's been sound very good so now you know what plantain is like right and so if you're ever in doubt like is that plantain you're gonna say Oh veins that you can easily see long seep seed pods and if you pull on the stock it's gonna reveal threads plantain absolutely you can eat the leaves they're pretty rich in chlorophyll which is not a bad thing but they do taste strong this would be like an advanced green so put it in a soup throw it on a pizza I literally cram wild edibles and everything when I was researching my book I'm sitting there and I'm just like what is this plant good for I have nutritional data in there I kid you not the USDA there's a website called nutritional data calm and is basically USDA information from the 60s when the government just had a bunch of money they were throwing at figuring out what's you know what food is rich in and surprisingly they have quite a few wild edibles on there so I'm sitting there compiling these charts and I'm thinking like well what is plantain good for and it's literally good for everything I kid you not it's not an exaggeration what is dandelion good for it's literally good for everything it's got tons of vitamins and minerals it's got amino acids antioxidants so at that point I was like it's kind of silly to remember exact things because it's literally good for everything okay see this plant with the purple flowers I'll meet you right by it look how pretty this is I don't even know what kind of plant this is but I know that it's a mustard and the reason I know that it's a mustard is because mustards are in the Brassica family which is nearly 2,000 different plants and it includes broccoli cauliflower cabbage and all mustards smell like mustard so sometimes we rely too heavily on our eyes and we can just be like oh I don't really know what this is I don't know what it looks like but then you come over here you grab a leaf you crush it up and if it's a mustard it just starts smelling like mustard so I invite you to come over here and start and do this with me this one's pretty faint there's other characteristics but the leaves on this are pretty faint smelling can anybody get a little hint of mustard look at how big this leaf is does anybody so did we get a little hint on mustard if not there's another mustard over here that you'll definitely smell it look how big this leaf is you can literally wrap make little wraps in this now one thing I like to do I call it gorilla wraps no just kidding you take a banana and you wrap it in a green leaf it could be a Collard leaf it could be a kale leaf it could be a wild mustard leaf and what you'll find is that the greens will complement the fruit and the fruit will complement the greens you could also make a nice dolma out of this you could opt you know if you say you like low calorie diets here's a perfect little tortilla also has these beautiful flowers all mustards have four petals they can be different colors yellow white purple pink and come over here and grab grab one of these all mustards also have 6 stamens stamen or those tiny little antennae that are in the flower so they have 4 petals 6 stamen 4 of those are going to be long and 2 will be short and then this one in particular has its own version of the seed pod which is kind of like a little pea almost and you can eat those too they kind of have a spicy peppery taste so if I was picking this plant for food I'd be like look big leaves I'm gonna do something with those maybe I'll cut them into salad but since they're big I'd probably make a wrap out of this this I'd probably throw on top of the salad because they're nice peppery they would enrich it make it look beautiful and then the seed pods would just add a little bit of crunch they'd be like a wild sweet pea jaune Kahless who has a book called a wild edibles from dirt to plate he says that wild mustards through his research are the most nutritious green on the planet and so it's a really good one to know about now let's go this way because I want to find I want to actually demonstrate how different two mustards can look and yet they still smell like mustard check out this plant if you touch it it starts shooting seeds come on you guys this is a bitter crest which is a mustard yet one of the things I've been criticized for in my book is that I don't have regions for where the plants grow and the reason I did that is because plants just like humans and animals they love to travel and they have different mechanisms for doing this hello this plant it propagates when you touch it it literally shoots out feet away that's the plant saying I'm going to produce a lot of offspring maybe let's go over there so the dog settles down so plants love to travel and in the natural world they get pretty far and I think the regional thing that's just something we humans have made up for convenience but nature isn't here for our convenience let's take one of this and we're gonna crush it up and see if it smells like mustard yep smells like mustard you get it who gets mustard raise your hand if you get mustard yeah but it's a very distinct like so not like the yellow mustard that comes in a can but like arugula mustard thank that you get it so this is called bitter cress and it's a mustard relative who knows what kind of tree this is it looks very similar to an alder in fact if you just look at the leaves they kind of look like alder leaves this is actually a beech tree and one of the tall tales of a beech is that it has elephant like skin so that's a great identifying characteristic the other thing is right beneath your feet let's see if we can figure it out so give yourself a little squat and see if you can't find some nuts beech nuts so this is how this works oh hey I think that's an alder and then you kind of look at your surroundings and you start engaging your other senses and you find beech nuts and right now there's no nuts in it why is that oh yeah there you go we found some nuts so this is a beech nut right here so in nature we also compete with other critters and squirrels are much better at harvesting nuts than we are because they've had lots more practice and it's also not nuts season so right now would be if we lived seasonally right now would be our time to eat mustards and kale and dandelions and grass and then later on in the season we would be eating more nuts things like beech nuts so these are essentially similar to acorns the native tribes used to make meal out of them and make breads and cookies and all kinds of little biscuits out of them like I said there's not a whole lot to talk about because these are last year's nuts and there's it's not great but it is a good food source they're edible require a little bit more food prep than some of the greens again because they have tannins in them and tannins come off as extremely bitter so traditionally you would either soak them or boil them in water Native Americans would actually take a wicker basket put a bunch of nuts in there like acorns and just stick that basket in the stream and it was really ingenious because it didn't there wasn't any extra work for them but the water that was perpetually changing would wash the tannins out and then they would take those nuts after 24 or 48 hours grind them make a flower and then make food out of it so looks like an altar has elephant-like skin and then when you get close and personal you see that it has little nuts and now we just identified beech this is something that all gardeners should know the little white stuff yep that might be one common name for it I know this has chickweed so everybody grab yourself a chickweed this is the macro part of the wild edible Walker chickweed is like a wild lettuce now it's a very common herb it's a very common weed in gardens so when you go and you plant a garden a lot of weeds start growing there and if you weed them out before they really get big before you can identify what they are you miss out on a bunch of free food one of my friends in Missoula runs a garden he just runs a big farm a lot of the stuff that grows in between the rows of corn or onion or whatever is things like chick weed and they're actually more nutritious than the food that's being grown we just forget to look for him so Kylie my girlfriend can attest to this we're planting our garden right now and she really desperately wants to weed and I'm like save that that's really good food this is a vitamin C powerhouse so this is like nature's emergency I believe a cup of this has over 90 milligrams of vitamin C so that's antioxidant rich it's got properties that will help fight off cancer you're gonna be less likely to ever develop cancer if you eat this stuff and it tastes awesome it's like a really mild lettuce let's examine the flowers first tell me what they look like how many pedals does it have can-can any because any buddies vision good enough to count the battles so very good it looks like 10 pedals but it's actually only five but the pedals are very deeply cleft see what I mean so it's like a double pedal the other thing that chickweed has this is very hard to explain but you can see it is it has a mohawk hairline on one side of the stem that alternates in between Leafs so like if this is a section and then that's a section and below that leaf is another section there's a hairline it'll jump to opposite sides of the stem and it's a plant that likes shade look it's growing under a tree that's telling us it's communicating more information to us it likes shade so this Beach is doing that for it and it likes to spread on grass this is like a wild sprout super good raw in sandwiches wraps you know if you ever go to the deli and get a sandwich it's your guilty pleasure just make sure if you throw some chickweed on it there's a lot of Crispus like trees in this world right can be very difficult to tell them apart I'm gonna give you a little trick right here and now pine needles are long generally long spruce needles kind of almost look like mid stems that have four corners so you can spin them in between your fingers right if you can spin it it's probably a spruce if you can't spin it it'll be flat it's a fir so now you just learned all about conifers long needles PI short needles that kind of look like pipe cleaners at first glance could either be spruce or fir and then you do the test it spins it's a spruce it doesn't spin it's a fur so this is your test over here come over here we're gonna do this at least three times while we're in the park grab a needle and it's kind of cheating because that branch probably fell off this tree but what kind of tree is this this is a party trick right here next time you're hiking with your friends just say guess what it's a spruce all evergreens have edible properties they actually also concentrate vitamin C they're really good for respiratory stuff so if you have any sort of cop or phlegm going on the best thing to do for that is to make a tea from the needles so you basically get a pot throw a bunch of needles in there and then heat it up boil it for like two minutes then let it cool so that it's drinkable and pour yourself a nice little glass of pine needle tea kind of has a Christmassy vibe to it but it has a really nice lemony characteristic and it's a great thing to do when you're camping like if you want to engage your kids or your friends or your partners next time you go camping this is Sur gaze homework number two just harvest some either spruce or pine or fir and make some trailside tea for yourself the you can eat the Spruce tips in it and you actually beat me to the punch there's a tree that has them but that's that's cool I'm glad that you pointed that out the only caution on evergreens is if you're pregnant or nursing you don't you want to avoid them because there's something that small kids and fetuses don't like so if you're pregnant avoid that otherwise they're completely edible and beneficial we have a nice little birch here and again this is kind of like a a survival food in my opinion so like all of the little if if I was starving to death I would come over here and I'd eat some of the tender leaves these buds are really good food source this is a little bit past its prime but these little guys when they're green like baby corn you can boil it and so you can imagine if you've got maybe a gallon of these that would be a pretty substantial food source again the inner cambium layer the bark of the tree is edible but if you don't do it right you can kill the tree so I generally avoid that but birches are edible this is probably the most pathetic miner's lettuce specimen I've ever seen but because it's in the park I figured you talked about it I'll let you take a picture look at how unique that looks so it's a this is called a basal rosette this growth pattern where mustards do this too they kind of spread out it's not just one stalk and leaves so everybody grab one of these take one pass it around miner's lettuce is one of the tastiest wild edibles this tastes like butter head lettuce and it also has lots of vitamin C in it we used to do trade shows like health fairs and book conventions and so one of these fairs our neighbor in the and the booth next to us he got on this high horse where he's like I'm gonna make Sergey eat some supplements and I have nothing against supplements other than that they try and sell them people through fear-based tactics so this guy would not let me alone he's like you need to try my supplement you're just not getting enough nutrition in your diet and he had some device that somehow could calculate how many antioxidants were in your system and so he finally he made me a deal he's like I'll leave you alone if you take my test and if I find that you're lacking in antioxidants you have to try my supplement ok whatever so he puts me through the test and his his scale was like zero to ten thousand you know ten thousand I forget his unit of measurement but it's not really important so it as close to ten thousand his ideal as possible right when he measured me I had fifty thousand so I was literally off his chart so then he was like okay well that's gotta be something went wrong so he tested me again same result he tested my mom she had forty five thousand my dad had the most he had seventy and he was like okay wait what do you guys do again so then he was like okay I'm prepared to listen so miner's lettuce is really rich in antioxidants is it's good to get as much as we can in our diet and this will do it as well as all of the greens that we've been talking about and so we've already identified that it grows in a basal rosette the key tell of miner's lettuce is the disc shaped leaves and then the stem goes directly through the middle of the leaf it's a satellite dish yeah it's like a deep deep deep pop quiz how do you identify a true dandelion smooth vein how do i how do you identify a miner's lettuce leaf looks like a satellite dish that's the right answer it has a disk leaf and then the stem goes directly through the leaf how would I eat this this is a great plant to eat raw it it's kind of like spinach if you try and cook it you need to get like pounds of it and then when you cook it down it's gonna go whoop so more more often than not I would just eat it raw in a salad it's really delicious you don't almost don't need to do anything to it it tastes great and the reason they look so puny and pathetic here is because this plant likes shape so it usually grows under trees on hillsides if you go to chambers Bay where you never want to harvest because you don't want to harvest from golf courses but if you do the loop you'll see that along the hillside there's tons of miner's lettuce and there's another variety they're called Siberian miner's lettuce which is a little bit different on we go everybody grab one in fact actually let's take this moment to kind of just chill for a second I know we're getting close but we have like maybe three or four more plants to look at so these are wild daisies and daisies are in the sunflower family and a lot of sunflowers we already discerned our edible there's over almost 24,000 different varieties so these little brown daisies are really good to eat rot in fact actually if you find some leaves and they're pretty hard to get to under the grass but the leaves kind of remind me of like arugula almost they kind of have this slightly skunky smell to them and so I would throw the leaves in a salad I would throw the flowers in a salad because they're beautiful they're edible I would again take the petals and throw them in an ice cube tray and make petal infused ice maybe while I was harvesting dandelion greens and flowers I would take some of the these daisies and mix them with the flowers and throw them and honey our maple syrup and that way when it gets cold cloudy and dreary in Tacoma I'd go to make a piece of toast and I would just spread some of that jam on my toast and get a little boost of vitamin D I mean it's literally that simple and the other thing I want to talk about since we're here is clover so most lawns in the world at this point I've been to 66 countries and I can say with confidence that in every country that I've been to have been able to find clover on a lawn so most lawns have clover on them grab a clover leaf clovers are in the pea family so they're kind of like wild peas which is the first thing that we talked about and peas have a lot of protein in them and they also have B vitamins b1 b2 b3 b6 b12 they also have phosphorus I believe magnesium manganese and zinc so they're very very nutritious and delicious you could just take this little leaf and throw it in your soup salad cook it eat it raw I like smoothies personally because I feel like that's the easiest way to get greens in our diet it's funny one of my comments on my book on Amazon some guy went through my book and counted how many times I say smoothie and I think I say it like 250 times and he's like I didn't realize how much this guy likes smoothies but the only reason I do is because it's just an easy way to get greens in our diet you just wake up make a smoothie for yourself and that ensures that you're gonna get at least two salads and smoothie form in your diet so this is a great thing to do in smoothies let's talk about how to identify this thing so all peas have three leaves unless you're lucky then they have four clover has four sometimes we call that a four-leaf clover did you know that a four-leaf clover is actually more nutritious than the three leaf clover it's 25% more nutritious another identifying characteristic of clover is that the leaf has a crescent-shaped little white part on it it's beautiful right okay now take the leaf really close and personal and look at the edges and tell me what you see it's jagged it almost looks like it has tiny little spines on it those are great identifying characteristics it's literally that easy you just right now what you're doing is you're building your search image of clover we're spending time with these plants intimately and you don't even realize may be fully right now what you're doing but later on you go home or in a month in a year you're gonna be sitting in a park with your friends having a picnic and your hand is gonna wander because you get a little bored and you're gonna pick up a clover and you're gonna be like huh three leaves oval clover and that means I did my job somewhat correctly okay on we go a few more and then we're gonna head home answer some questions and anybody that needs to go can go what kind of tree is this how do we know long needles a fun fact about pines this is this ruin my surprise so another way to identify Pines is they always either have two or five needles so they're gonna be long and then they're either gonna have two or five needles and again you can make tea from these needles just boil these down but what I'm here to look at today is this that's pine pollen so if you're allergic to pollen probably not the best edible for you but if you're not allergic to pollen this is pure protein this is amino acids so how you would harvest this if you put a plastic bag over this and you just shake or you can literally just take these and just eat them or throw them in a smoothie or a soup you know if you're making like some pizza you could put some of that in the dough get creative and that stuff's really nutritious the other thing I want to show you while you're here is this plant that grows underneath it let's all grab one of these I'll get some more grab one pass it around okay this is another one of those plants that we can identify much easier by smell than sight so crush this up and tell me what this smells like so this is called yarrow and yarrow develops a very big like umbrella like flower in late summer sometimes it's white sometimes it's yellow sometimes it's pink and yarrow is another sleep aid so if you have problems with insomnia if you just have trouble falling asleep at night you could take some of that wild camomile that we learned about you could take some of those daisies and you could take some yarrow which smells very sweet almost makes you salivate you could dry it put it in a tea and now you have a foraged sleep aid pretty cool huh the other thing that's nice about yarrow is if you ever cut yourself and you're in the woods you can literally press this into your wound because it has antiseptic antibacterial properties in fact Vikings used to use this they would actually fill their wounds with it when they got battle wounds Native Americans did similar stuff one time when I was on the trail I cut through my palm while trying to cut a piece of fruit that we had in our backpack and obviously I was 50 miles away from a hospital so there was no way that I could stitch it up and what I actually took is rose petals because they're natural bandages and then I would alternate that with yarrow and you can look at my palm later but there's almost no scar it's sealed up really nicely wild edibles can literally save your life sometimes and this is another one of those what kind of tree is this what kind of tree is this how do we know flat needles it's a fern okay on we go boys and girls what kind of tree is this how do we know okay who thinks spruce raise your hand who thinks fir okay you're right it's a fern okay on this one let's also point out the bright little green tips who was talking about those earlier you were so these are awesome eating these are like the springtime green tips and they taste like lemon yeah so these parts you throw straight into salads they concentrate vitamin C they're good for your respiratory they get phlegm out of your system you can pickle them so in the springtime now I've come through here with a little bowl and I just start taking them and before long I'd have enough to really make a meal of you know you can also use these in tea but they're not quite that these are the meristematic bits of the first so they're not going to be as fragrant I think for tea you use the more mature ones and then for eating for salads you use the more nutritious more delicious bits which is the meristematic bits okay what kind of tree is this who said spruce I'm gonna pick on you come over here and grab a needle and this is actually a good example so the last pine had two needles this pine has five needles count them up this will be the last one right here okay take a leaf pass it around and we'll we'll do this take one pass it around take one pass it around first we're gonna do the test and flip it over is this a dandelion it looks like it yes how do we know that it's not a dandelion it's hairy good job so this is in fact is not a dandelion it's a dandelion relative and this is called cat's ears probably because it kind of looks like a little cat ear it's perfectly edible it has similar properties to a dandelion which is that it's good for your inner organs your gallbladder pancreas liver kidneys because it's fuzzy this one is a better green to eat cooked it's much more pleasant so again you throw it in soups and pastas stir-fries this is a great green for stir fries how else you could bake it you could put it in lasagna you could do whatever the heck you want with it but this is a great green and it's literally everywhere in Tacoma the other identifying characteristic is it will develop yellow flowers kind of like a dandelion but a dandelion has one flower four stem and cat's ears will have multiple yellow flowers per stem okay so I promise this will be the last one this will be the last one let's head back to expand if anybody who wants to buy a book I have a couple of those otherwise I'll answer questions and if people need to go they can go or we can kind of linger for a little bit and talk more about plants you", "CxKN-Aab3U0": "[Music] blippi and I was just dancing oh but it's really hot outside I wish I could take a break well no time for breaks when you're dancing oh it's a popsicle cart and I love popsicles I think you and I should get a popsicle let's go hey how are you what's your name I'm Julia would you like a handmade popsicle yeah I love popsicles what flavor do you have this is cha cha cha it's mango pineapple and chia seed that sounds so yummy mango pineapple and chia seeds that is so yummy okay glad you like it do you want to come see how they're made yeah that would be so much fun place it's so cool thanks no first thing you need to gear up Oh check it out this is an apron here we go Wow okay well what do we have here so these are all the ingredients we use to make our popsicles oh it looks like a bunch of fruit vegetables yes you got it we actually use a lot of superfoods in our popsicles so you'll see kale and avocado and spinach and chickpea what's this this it's a coconut whoa that's cool a coconut cool what flavor are we making I thought we could make Popeye Popeye yeah all right that's why I thought Popeye um know what you finished okay spinach I was making it back to earlier so I thought we could just activate okay so here's some

them right a big bucket Wow and you keep the core well you keep the core which is the center out of it because there's a lot of seeds in there speaking of seeds watermelons have seeds okay cut open

it'll make you wanna shout", "ewr38q5PdqU": "hello hello and welcome back to my youtube channel oops if you're new here what's up hello i am link if you are not new here welcome back so i've been saying for ever that i was going to record a full day of eating and i recorded one like last week or the week before but i didn't record the full day and it was just a show so here we are but before we dive in make sure you give this video a thumbs up and subscribe so you never miss a video from me [Music] so i've already got my workout in this morning if you know me you know that my pre-workout is a rice krispie treat so i take her i take i eat a rice krispie treat um right before i take my pre-workout every day before my workout yes it is okay my body uses it very quickly my body loves it so start my morning with a rice krispie 7 a.m i eat rice krispies it is fine so i've already finished my workout now i am going to sip on some greens with collagen if you have i've never tried it i finally it's back in stock so excited i've been wanting to try bucked ups greens for probably like a little bit now but every time i order they were like just sold out these literally fly off the shelves so i highly highly highly recommend you grab yourself some grab yourself some um and then i also threw in some collagen again collagen i've been trying to order i it was available the first not first order but one of my more recent orders i it was in stock but i was like no i don't need it like i have the sample pack still what was i thinking because again it flies off the shelf so i luckily still had some sample packets so i threw a sample packet in and we'll try it out this is like i said my first time trying it so i got the mixed berry flavor wow yeah that's good it doesn't taste like dirt like i have ice in it just because excuse me um i was afraid like if i drank it like room temperature water it'd be weird so i have ice in it but it's pretty good it's not a super strong flavor either so it's not like overwhelming of like oh my god it's dirt you know but sipping on some of that i have my hydro jug full so i'll be drinking that i aim to drink at least one and a half per day if bare minimum i drink one and then some um but i'm gonna be cooking up some turkey bacon and some eggs and i will log that and show you guys the macros for it so let's go [Music] so i was standing here cooking my eggs for probably five to ten minutes and was like why are they cooking it's really helpful when you turn on the stove just a little couple tip bit there okay so i have my breakfast i put together two scrambled eggs three slices of turkey bacon i love my bacon super crispy please excuse my dog crying to go out in the background um but with the eggs you can measure them one of two ways you can either just put in that it was two large eggs whatever or extra large i personally this time measured it by the gram so i just searched in my fitness pal scrambled eggs 77 grams so i log that in and then i added my three slices of turkey bacon again you can either do three slices or measure in grams i always recommend measuring your stuff in grams because then it's more accurate um things can kind of vary like especially like peanut butter a tablespoon a tablespoon you may measure differently each time so i always recommend going with grams whenever possible all right so i guess we'll call this a snack this is what i logged it as i logged it as a snack but every time i go to the bank i bring the dogs with me and we stop at starbucks they get pacinos i get whatever i want and they make a mess of my car with a puppuccinos and then we come home so i got a grande um guava passion fruit drink i think it was um yeah i used to have a passion fruit drink all right so now it is time for lunch no i still haven't showered don't judge me i'm gonna go sweat later today so i figured screw it so for lunch i never took out chicken breast but i did want chicken on my salad so i have here a baby spring mix i believe we got this at sam's club but we always buy like that i love spring mix i don't know what it is but something about a good salad in the summer it just it's different so i have my bb spring mix and then because i'm a grown baby i added some dino nuggets to it so i cooked the rest of our dining and others where it was like 10 nuggets but i figured screw it because i have some lego room today so i added that in there probably should have done less now that i'm thinking about it because it is pretty high in fat so i still have low fat um snacks for the rest of the day so i will be a-okay and i know my dinner is not going to be too too hateful but anyways so i have the dinosaur nuggets i have the baby spring mix and then i added two tablespoons of what the hell is it called balsamic vinaigrette balsamic is my absolute favorite be careful with salad dressing so so i weigh out my salad dressings in grams versus weighing it out in tablespoons just because like i said earlier it's way more accurate so i'll lay mine out in grams it was 32 grams exactly and that's what um two tablespoons is on the label so that's what i went with again fairly high in fat not i mean it's not like ranch it's only like five grams of fat but for only two tablespoons normally we load it up so oh i have the spinach the nuggets and the balsamic vinaigrette it comes out to 51 carbs 20 fat and 29 protein so again fairly high in fat but i'm okay with it because this is life and your girl wanted some dino nuggets in her salad so i'm gonna make it work i'm gonna make it work i'm also gonna start sipping on some popped up drink mix fruit punch flavor this is literally just drink max like it's nothing crazy but only has one gram of carb in it and that's literally it so this is some fruit plush flavor if you get sick of drinking just plain water all the time you can add this to your drink spice it up they have fruit punch grape blue razz pink lemonade and i believe strawberry kiwi they might even have some other ones by now but highly recommend you can use the code link 20 at checkout and it'll save you 20 so i'm gonna go enjoy my salad i'm gonna finish up some work watch scooby-doo with my puppy i put scooby-doo on tv because they have a scooby-doo toy and they love it so i put it on tv for them and my parents dog was actually watching it for a while now my dog's asleep so afternoon snack is going to be bots fruit snacks again i'm a grown baby so i eat fruit snacks and i eat them by their colors so judge me um but these fruit snacks i literally always have three snacks in the house whatever but they're 19 grams of carbs it's crazy to think that this right here is 19 grams of carbs what i don't know but this is my afternoon snack so i am recording this before i go to training but i am not gonna have time to eat right now not super hungry anyway so kind of okay with that so what i was planning to cook prior was some waffle fries which one cup which is 84 grams which i probably would not have had a whole cup seven fat 22 carbs to protein so obviously that's more of my carb source with dinner um and then boneless chicken bites which three ounces is 14 grams of fat 23 carbs and 12 protein so again probably not gonna have three ounces worth but just what i'm thinking for dinner after i get back i won't be home until at least like 7 7 15 tonight so i'm gonna eat something i just don't know what um and if you're busy like i am if you have late night things i don't call it late but it's late for me um give yourself some grace this is where meal planning is super super helpful but i am not started on my cut just yet i'm starting um soon i'm kind of progressing into a cut and then i'm gonna cut from there so during my cut i'll be meal prepping a lot more i'll have a better plan for when i have busier nights um but this week i'm kind of just getting a feel for where i'm currently at really diving and taking that first step to go forward with it so i'm getting back on macro tracking i go on and off of it just because i really love intuitive eating um but i also really freaking love the structure of macros so i use macros um when i have major goals where if i'm just in kind of like a maintenance phase i kind of cycle on and off of them but that's where i'm currently at if you love this video and make sure you give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe so you never miss a video from me um if you have any questions about the food i eat why i eat them anything like that macros you know where to find me", "erp_yvHd3Ig": "[Music] so this morning I'm going to get a coffee at Starbucks right now because tomorrow I'm starting a 10-day smoothie cleanse like a detox cleanse with some of my friends I messaged him and was like yo do you want to do this cleanse with me I feel like that's a really good way to hold yourself accountable is doing it with other people so of course the girls were in on it with me and we're going to start that tomorrow so I'm running to sprouts and possibly Trader Joe's just depending on if they have everything that I need expats or not and then yeah for the ten days it's literally like it's a smoothie Clinton so I'll kind of break it down for you day by day but I can't have any coffee while I'm on the cleanse and coffee is like my saving grace in the morning so I'm getting myself my last morning coffee for ten days right now and then we're gonna head over to sprouts so for this cleanse you literally have green smoothies so for breakfast lunch and dinner you have a smoothie you have to drink 64 ounces of water a day and you can only snack on like vegetables and nuts so I can only have like cucumbers carrots and raw unsalted nuts first snacks for ten days so I feel like I should just splurge a little bit today can I please do a venti almond milk honey flat white court and that's it okay thank you yeah thank you you too so now we're headed to sprouts I have to get a lot of like frozen fruits for my smoothies and a lot of like cream like leafy greens and I want to get them all like organic so I'm thinking sprouts or Trader Joe's is going to be the best option for the Hat I'll see you guys in a little bit when I get to sprouts okay so I just got back into the car finished our sprouts I spent like 93 dollars on all that but literally everything I got was like organic so I'm not like surprised the only thing I could not find was frozen peaches and I think I still have some at home so I don't think I'm gonna need to go to Trader Joe's I think I'll be fine with what I have and if I don't have peaches at home then I will go to Trader Joe's but I think I'm okay for now I'm going to run to the dollar store at home and I'll show you guys everything that I got at sprouts so this cleanse you have to buy five five days worth of food at a time so many leafy greens in this smoothie cleanse that you want your stuff fresh I'm gonna start with the frozen stuff so I can pop that in the freezer we're supposed to get 15 your own size of frozen strawberries I got 10 I have some like frozen strawberries and bananas in my freezer so I just figured I can pop in some extra ones if I need it but these are the organic non-gmo frozen strawberries ten ounces of mixed berries frozen are supposed to get 10 ounces so I was able to find that get 20 ounces of frozen blueberries I was able to find two ten packs two ten ounce packs of those so organic blueberries those get 20 ounces of frozen peaches I have teen so I should be able to get by with this continuing on with what's gonna actually go into the smoothies six organic Honey Crisp apples the cleanse that I'm following says try to get everything organic organic is way more expensive but if you can't buy all organic then I would just look for a veggie or fruit wash and I think you can buy those I'm pretty sure they have them at sprouts I just sent look and t.j.maxx so it washes off like all the pesticides anything that the fruit or veggies may have been sprayed with that is not necessarily great for you especially because you're grinding it up in a smoothie and you're drinking the entire thing you want to go with organic if you can three bananas I grabbed four so I can have one as a snack one bunch of organic kale I didn't realize how much 20 ounces of greens were until I got in there and started looking at packaging so they wanted 20 ounces of baby spinach so this big thing is only 16 so then I got another 5 ounce smaller pack so we're just right at a little over 20 ounces another 20 ounces of organic spring mixed greens so again I got the 16 ounce and then a 5 ounce so how this works is you have a smoothie for breakfast lunch and dinner and then in between those smoothies you can snack on specific snacks so literally only crunchy veggies you can't have any starchy veggies and you can have fruits and unsalted nuts or nut butter so I also picked up some snacks I picked up for organic green apples to snack on and with that I purchased some Maurin awesome maranatha I have no idea natural California raw almond butter I wanted to get the Justin's butter I was looking at the label in the store and it had like a hundred milligrams of sodium and that defeats the purpose you just want raw nuts no salt no additives no sugars nothing added and I picked up some baby carrots some grapes I believe a couple of the recipes call for like a handful of grapes in the smoothies but other than that I'll be snacking on these in between smoothies three cucumbers because you could snack on me organic celery I've never bought organic celery I normally just buy the crap that's in the back but Woolsey two things of blackberries I picked up the raw unsalted nuts so I got cashews and then I got roasted pistachios I wanted to find some fridge organizing containers looked on Amazon they're like $25 for a pack of like three of them but then I was like well shoot I should maybe just check the dollar store and see if they have containers that can go into my fridge like why not and I scored I found these fridge these are like soda cans storage things but I feel like you can use them for anything so I plan on like cutting out my celery carrots putting them in pre like Ziploc bags and then just stacking them in here and I found an egg container and then I got two of just these storage boxes these are just like 5.2 quart storage bins that I think I can just put next to each other all right so I'm gonna show you guys how I ended up organizing the fridge up here I put all of my berries so my blackberries and I have some blueberries under there too that I just had left into the fridge I put my almond butter hard-boiled some eggs here and then these are just just like rags and then moving down here I've stocked my greens I put my raw cashews in one of my jars and into the fridge just because it's supposed to help keep them fresher longer put the rest of the greens behind there one of my favorite things to do is to take the grapes out of the plastic and put them in a bowl lined with paper towels that's just going to kind of absorb the moisture kale I already chopped it just to make it easy and again I put it here in a strainer with a paper towel to kind of absorb the moisture so it'll last longer then over here I use those other two containers and I popped in all of like my snacks but I can have in this first one I have snap peas which I just had leftover from my last brochure and same thing with the mushrooms I also put the paper towels in the mushrooms just because those can go bad easy once they're cut and then in this one I just have carrots portioned out and celery in the back down here in the store I used that last container here to put my cucumbers in I have some asparagus left over I can eat asparagus but I can't eat it with anything so I'll probably actually just end up cooking this for Luke for one of these dinners and then this is literally just all of Luke's like not that you can have cheese sausage and stuff put out of sight so I'm not tempted and then in the freezer I organize everything in here too so I just put the frozen fruit that I have like left over over here of my ice trays here which I just need to fill up tight I got some frozen I got these in like my last grocery run but just some frozen greens that I can have for this too which is just edible money and cut okra and then these are all of the frozen fruits that I got to taste the blueberry you [Music]", "J_e4HIvhnQY": "[Music] good morning guys welcome back today's gonna be a what ie in the day type video it's gonna be basically all the foods that I like what I eat in a typical day and some other favorite like snacks that I've had in the house lately in drinks I did one with Piper a few weeks ago and I'll link hers here in a second but it's nice I'm gonna see the same thing just for me so I'm getting ready to start out and make some breakfast here in a second and then I'm gonna go through and how to show you all my meals and some of the drinks that I am getting prepared for the weekend and I don't think I'm gonna be prepping any food today now yes I am at home so the food will probably different because I'll be like grilling and my face I don't know whether I might cook some salmon I'm not for sure what I'm gonna have for lunch today but during the school year it'll be completely different because I have to pack my lunch so I'll be meal prepping so I'll make sure to share you with those videos whatever time comes and we're back at school but for now she's gonna be summer break what I eat in the day and little bits just gonna be hanging out with us today what you do when you tired you are okay for breakfast I'm just gonna have nature promises free from every basically everything has no hormones is a vegetarian fed diet no antibiotics and it's pretty it's like the best microwavable bacon there's some of the nutrition four slices ninety calories I'm not gonna have to cuz I'm also going to make me some scrambled eggs and I'm gonna top it with everything but the bagel [Music] voila breakfast is served also having a nice big glass of lemon water for breakfast instead of going to Starbucks all the time we just get this now I'll steep four bags and four cups of water and we like it shaken with Splenda so if we went to Starbucks would order like a grande black iced tea with two splendas so instead of going to baht I don't have everything here so we can start doing that here is my beautiful picture which is probably as old as I am so I got it from my grandma but what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to take these teabags and I have 16 ounces of water in here which is two cups if you did not know and I am going to press the bags to get all the extra liquid out which it shouldn't be a whole lot and then I'm going to go in and pour the rest of this in which this is the worst cut because it no it didn't make a whole picture since we're gonna be drinking it just to the weekend but when one doesn't put the lid on it and throw it in the fridge and I'll show you how I make the tea later on it's cooled off I did go the grocery this morning just picked up some treats for like the trip and drinks is that which I'll show you in Wednesday's video but this morning I went to the grocery and I did buy some fresh fruits and veggies I have lemons some squash and zucchini and then I got Straub's and blues which I'm going to show you how I wash those when I watched him I just put them all in a giant bowl and fill it with water and add just a little splash of white vinegar gonna let it sit for a few minutes I'm gonna dump my berries fast here all right all the fruits and veggies have soaked and have been rinsed off and drained so I just throw them on this towel and I'll literally just let them sit in to put them to air dry because I hate putting fruit up that is still somewhat wet so I'm gonna let these air dry and I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna cut the little ends of the strawberries off and put them in the fridge for the weekend I'm gonna go through and show you the snacks and the vitamins and stuff that I like to keep at the house all the time now grant we do not have a lot of food at the house right now because I'm trying not to buy groceries until we get back from our vacation that is coming up but I'm going to show you my vitamins and some of the snacks really quick okay I take these every day this is Juice Plus this is berry and what it is is it has all of these berries in it so you're getting an toxin into this one a full serving of fruits in this one and then a full serving of veggies fruits in this one and veggies in this one sorry so basically you take these every day and it's not a vitamin because it has a nutrition label on the back is basically food in gummy form which I'll put some out and I'll show you all of these here in a second I also take the azo complete feminine balance this is a probiotic which I need to take I start taking probiotics awhile ago and I have to I can tell the biggest difference in my stomach I have really bad stomach issues like on all parts of that so this has really helped me a whole I also take Juice Plus omegas which it has Omega 3 5 6 7 and none I love taking this and doesn't have that fishy smell either and then I also take vitamin d3 for bone teeth muscle and immune health I take one of these a day you can take them every other day I think that I take them every day so I'm going to show you what all of these look like here are the juice plus skim meson you particularly it was just like for beets but I only take two of each because I'm not in school and I'm eating plenty of fruits and vegetables at the house so I'll have dozens when I go back to school I'll go to for a day and this is the probiotic it's very small this is the gel capsule Omega and then this little thing right here is the d3 and it is very very small and they are all easy to take besides from eating fruits and veggies for snacks I'm gonna show you my freshmen it's literally a mess I mean I know I just clean it like the last me to go but it's already crazy again I like to eat corn on the cob a lot we keep a little mini cucumbers chopped up for snacks in here I got sorry I really like these mini pepperonis I'm trying to eat low carb so whatever I can eat that's gonna fill me up I'm gonna eat it this actually does have a carbon 8 these little mini pepperonis quite a bit and I have these I don't eat these we have some fruit cups to always keep hard-boiled eggs so I made those the other day and I just whenever I want to snack eat hard-boiled eggs Kiwis I love regular eggs this is the hibiscus tea that I showed you a while ago which let me pull it out real quick and show you it is the Thais out this passion tea which I also make in put in the freezer nuts phrases refrigerator so I always put lemon maybe some Splenda in it so now that I'm over here to show you the rest my sister-in-law showed me these and they are amazing I've had the orchard valley harvest the chocolate covered blueberries they are so good but these almonds are also really good they're sold out at live area so I got these YUM always keep pecans in the house because they're healthy they're filling I just grabbed a handful when I'm wanting to snack on something I obviously love my teas I have throat comfort detox and all of these popcorn back here I love love love it popcorn I think it's my favorite night no this is not my go-to my go-to is what does that brand called oh my goodness boom chicka pop this sweet and salty that's what I always go for I had to look it up at my brain stop so I have a boom chicka pop usually but if not we'll do the movie theater butter popcorn I love popcorn also favorite snack that I cannot keep in the house because I will eat it all day long as chex mix the regular brand Chex Mix oh my goodness I cannot say out of them absolutely love always keep apples and peanut butter and let me show you the peanut butter that I usually have I have two different types if I am feeling regular I get the natural creamy but if I'm going for a little bit more healthier this it's a lot more oily I use this smokers natural creamy it's very more wheelbase than this one I feel like it sounds a lot more natural than this one because literally in this all there is is peanuts and a little bit of salt like that's it so that's a lot more natural than actual Jif natural but it's still really good so let's throw that back in there let me come down here vanilla almond popcorn not popcorn cereal vanilla almond in Special K cereal is to die for I threw the Box away but I keep my cereal and like containers like this here's Piper's and then here is mine obviously if you've been here on the board of chips absolutely the best thing on the planet and we eat a lot of veggies straws it is that way healthier than regular potato chips so 2 percent less fat there are carbs in it but Piper eats them ie don't even eat them they're just so so good another breakfast option I eat is maple and brown sugar Quaker instant oatmeal I always throw strawberries and blueberries like they show it on here if I have them bananas are really good in it really anything of the sort and I've started to really like some chewy bars like I said I am vlogging local art so I'm not eating a lot of these like if I'm starving starving I'll have one but these are the peanut butter chocolate chip Quaker bars they're pretty dang good and I'm gonna go to my freezer which y'all it's awful so just excuse it I keep for me my sweet treat outshine if you have not had the outshine popsicles they are delicious this one is watermelon and it's really really good and this is like the triple berry but I've recently got a sweet tooth and I bought the no sugar added original phob hot fudge pops there's only 40 calories and seven grams of sugar per one Pop has no added sugar these are really good Piper does not like them steven has not found them yet in the freezer who I'm not showing him because I want them and I'm gonna see what they was barking at I am back I'm going to show you the rest of the freezer really quick I'll even buys me a lot of frozen fruits for smoothies and such just a bunch of frozen fruit there besides that there's not really a lot in here for me besides these I do love these these are my sweet potato fries it's Paul alexia non-gmo these are the best we pay to fries I have had by far store better store-bought so that's pretty much it for right now I promise you whenever I go back to the store I will definitely find you will not find

basically what I do is I got a Walmart where you really get it wherever and I bake like I'm fake I get like a john bag of the frozen thin salmon like salmon and defrosted the night before but no that's what I want for lunch because Stephen won't eat salmon who doesn't love the smell of it because he's very weird about smells so I will do that for me for lunch very light very easy very clean and that's just what I've been doing right now because I guess last week I didn't ever wear myself through that quarantine and I gained like five unnecessary and unneeded pounds so I am on the verge of trying to lose those which I'm already there almost there but we're getting back with it so the healthy eating train is back so meals I will be cooking will be a lot more healthier because you know they're making banana bread Bin's and what kinds of stuff that we don't really need in the house but they were tasty pounds run necessary but that's fine but back on the train today so I'm getting my lunch done here in a second and then I'm going to make a shake and black ice tea for you here in the second as well my squash and zucchini cut very thin on a dish and then this is just a really really small thin piece of salmon it was frozen and I'd defrost it last night because I knew gonna eat this from lunch and I'm gonna bake it on here with this at 400 for about 15 to 20 minutes and it should be ready but I'm going to show you the seasonings and stuff I thought put on it all right here in my season seasoning I'm gonna be using garlic salt pepper you got everything with the bagel lemon pepper and regular pepper so I don't put all this on everything on the salmon I am going to do a little bit of garlic salt a little bit of paprika for a little bit of spice and then my lemon pepper and then on my veggies I don't often say this but spritzed a little bit of oil on these I'm going to put a regular pepper I was I would think more garlic salt but this is pretty good I'm putting on everything on this boom and boom and I think I might I just know I'm not gonna put any pepper again so that's gonna be it I'm gonna throw in the oven at 400 about 20 minutes I know that will be done these might be almost like them pretty thin so they should be done and that's gonna be lunch for today side note we got this on Amazon a while ago and it's the coolest thing ever because it's paint free you just spill these little tubes up with water and it has like letters on them so they can learn to like trace and then it also has it's a color they can reveal the animal like lion with a ail also you can color all in the middle and it changes colors like this is blue and green and over here is red and yellow and it's just water so it dries super fast and they'll be able to go back over and it came with all these little stencils to where they can practice writing his letters and such she loves it zero mess at all and we just have been really enjoying it this summer so I'm gonna link this below we got our own Amazon and I don't think it was very expensive oh it was like $15 if that ever had a shut my blinds because it's getting really hot and the house is getting really hot so blonde just shakes the house low darker but I am making me a tall shaky and black ice tea witch who's slender sweat order at Starbucks on the regular it's like 2 dollars and 13 cents but I actually have all the stuff here like earlier I showed you I brewed that tea it's cold now I have my Splenda and I'm going to show you how to make this is super good it's kind of like sweet tape on the lighter version of it so I have right here my GNC shaker bottle and you can use any shaker ball you want I like this one because it goes up to 12 ounces and 12 ounces is the size of a tall so it's perfect measurement you can really shake it up and whatever you want but you do want it to be shaken not stirred so I'll put my ice in here I'm going to open my Celinda packets pour that on top and I guess that was it all right and then I'm going to fill this up into the 12 ounce mark which is about right here all right 12 ounces lid on now when you shake it you get that phone all right and you want to dump the whole thing you're about to fall off the table and her that right thing a shaken black rice tea which is Splenda when you shake it you get the foam at the top so I'm hoping I'll still have some of this with my lunches today but I'm not to enjoy oh my god so good tastes exactly like it at the Starbucks while my lunch is cooking I'm still drinking that means it's almost gone there's no point I should have just waited hearing it with my lunch but it's it's whatever but I just want to sit down and talk to you really quick and just thank you all so much I am very what are you doing

chocolate more than anything at all it's a dove dark chocolate nothing better I'm gonna give these a little go today and I'm gonna try to get some work done while she's napping we actually went and picked dinner up tonight about grandparents house I got chicken salad and fresh fruit it was really really delicious like I said I'm down trying to eat healthier so I can lose some weight but now that we're home and Piper's already babies and sever kind of hanging out I typically will not anything else the rest of the evening I will usually have like my hot decaffeinated teeth like detox teas and I'd usually would drink it literally when I'm in the morning flushes you got like literally legitly flushes you out so I really love that tea it's a yogi brand and that's fair it's pretty much it's really what I eat and a on a healthier day I would say but I hope you got some I did I will make sure to add food as I go back to the store after our trip because who we have no guards in this house right now but thank you so much for sticking around make sure you like and subscribe and I'll see you next time [Music]", "euI2mwQxqNQ": "hi loves its Emmaline so today we're gonna make some berry jam this was super delicious and insanely easy to make so I'm very excited to share with you guys this recipe so the first thing you guys will be needing are some jars and since we're all stuck at home and don't have access to get new jars I just used what I had and I feel like it taught me a really good lesson to not buy and just try to see if I have anything at home so I had like a pesto jar a relish jar and I just clean those out I'm putting some water in a pot right now and I'm going to put this on the stove and boil the water and I'm just throwing all the jars in and this will help to get all the labels off really easily and it's not gonna leave any of that sticky residue and like I mentioned before I feel like this taught me a really good lesson I always go to Michael's or any type of store that sells me some jars and I would always buy mason jar for something for tick in particular but this taught me to just look in my refrigerator and see if I have anything I could use and I really loved that so I added in a little bit more water and now I'm just going to bring this to a boil and as you guys can see the labels will just peel right off and they just come off so easily it's way easier than sitting in here and trying to scrub these I also added a little bit of soap in towards the end I felt like maybe it would help the labels in just any of the excess residue to come off so as you guys can see the jars come really clean there was only one jar that had a little bit of the label of residues still on it but I'll show you guys that in just a second it was so easy to take off I just took my sponge won over it and it slid right off with no problem and I didn't have to sit there and scrub it for a while so that was really awesome then I washed the jars and I preheated the oven at 200 degrees once it preheated I put all of the jars in there and I turned the oven off and this process is going to help sanitize all of the jars I also put the lids in there too I just let the jars hang out in here until the jam was done so now for the jam you'll be needing six cups of mixed berries a lemon and sugar so I decided to go with frozen berries just because fresh fruit is a little bit hard to find right now in this bag was exactly six cups so it was perfect and I'm also a little bit cautious of buying fresh fruit right now just because I feel like I would have to wash it really really well so I decided to just add in the frozen ones so I put it on low heat just to kind of let the fruit D thaw a little bit and then in the meantime I am just rolling out this lemon and cutting in half and then I'm going to squeeze all of the juice out of it we'll be needing two tablespoons of lemon juice in total [Music] so now I'm just adding in the two tablespoons of lemon juice and at this point I turned up the heat to medium-high and now I'm adding in two cups of sugar and that is it for this recipe it's only three ingredients it is so easy and so simple the thing with this Jam is that it will only last two weeks that's what the blogpost said at least so it's not one of those recipes that is going to last forever and they do recommend keeping it in the refrigerator so I think that if I were to do a recipe that had a lot more ingredients and the typical ingredients it probably would last much longer but this will in total make 32 ounces of Jam so I was able to make 4 8 ounce jars and then I just gave them to my family and I think it was absolutely perfect so once this comes to a boil you can turn your heat down to a medium heat and now what we're gonna do is just let this simmer and we're gonna let it simmer for about 20 minutes and then it'll be done and be prepared for your house to smell like a berry heaven it smells so so amazing here's Willy licking his lips when he smelled it and I just opened up the oven because I knew the jam was almost done so I'm just taking out all of these jars and getting them ready to put the jam in so here I have some spoons that I put in the freezer and these are gonna be the indicator of whether the jam is done or not so you just place the frozen spoon in the jam like that and if all of the jam sticks to it and looks pretty solid then that means it's done if not then you can wait a little bit longer take out your next spoon and try it so again we're just using what we have at home so we cut this ice tea jar and we're using this as our funnel and it actually worked out really well props to Connor for coming up with this idea so here's what the jam looks like and now we're just going to pour it through our makeshift funnel into the jars I think making something like Jam at a time like this is so amazing like I mentioned before I dropped one off on my sister's house and I also dropped one off at my parents house and I just left it at the door for them and they were both so excited about it and I think doing little things like this and just leaving things at people's doors for them is really great because it just helps to bring joy and especially when people know that it's something homemade they just feel really loved and excited we didn't waste any Jam which was great we just kept refilling some of the jars and once they were all filled to the top we were out of jam so it actually worked out really perfectly with all of these different sized jars but like I mentioned before if you just have 4 8 ounce jars that'll be perfect one of these was like 13 1 was sick so it kind of evened it all out but this is what it looked like we did have a little bit of a mess but it wasn't horrible so now I'm just putting the lids back on and once you put the lid on and the jam fully cools the lid will do its thing with suctioning it so I also wanted to share with you guys something you could do because I know if you pick out jars from your refrigerator they might not always be the prettiest so I just wanted to share something you could do so I have some scissors some twine and then some scraps of fabric if you guys even have an old shirt that you don't use anymore or a bandana or just any sort of fabric lying around your house you can just take it and cut it up and then I'm just going to place this over the lid and take that piece of twine and just tie this on it definitely was a two-person job I think you have a rubber band it'll probably be a little bit easier but to actually tie something around it you'll probably need two people but I just felt like this gave the jar is such a cute homemade look and you could also write special notes on it and again leave this at your friend and family's door and I think that they would love it so I just cut off the excess fabric because I thought I liked how it looked a little bit better that way and your Jam is all done you can leave this in the refrigerator for up to two weeks and it is just so delicious I had it on my toast this morning and it tasted so so good I can't believe how easy it was to make so here's what it looks like the next day once it is fully cooled and oh my goodness it is just so so amazing I think you could also add in chia seeds to it and it would make it a little bit thicker and also just give it that amazing chia seed texture that is just so good definitely an option if you guys want so I'm just spreading some onto a piece of pound cake and it just tastes amazing I hope you guys are all having a safe and happy day and I love you guys so so much bye [Music]", "Nn0x5vObcMk": "okay hi everyone i'm nigel heather's husband and uh we're making cheerwine sangria today as my wonderful husband just mentioned we will be using cheerwine for the sangria recipe instead of juice so what exactly is cheerwine cheerwine was the first bottled cherry soda it never contained wine or any kind of alcohol it's made by the oldest continuously operated family-owned soda company in the u.s l.d peeler founded the carolina beverage corporation and cheerwine bottling company in 1917 and when he passed away in 1931 his son clifford took over the company and it has been in family hands ever since cheerwine actually helped in world war ii according to the company's website when the war came clifford peeler donated scrap metal to the war effort including the company's first dixie filler machine old signs and other pieces of memorabilia on the website it also says that rumor has it some soldiers claim to have been able to vaguely make out a cheerwine logo in metal on the whole of the uss intrepid it's considered an official part of a southern handshake barbecue restaurants have been serving icy cold bottles of cheerwine for over a hundred years it's such a natural pairing that it became known as a southern handshake bbq in one hand and cheerwine in the other in 2015 they made it official when the national barbecue association named cheerwine as its official soft drink it was a north carolina specialty until very recently though you could get it pretty much all over the south it wasn't until 2017 a hundred years after the company was founded that people in all 50 states were able to enjoy a cold bottle of cheer wine cheerwine has a very robust active fan following it has an official fan club and every year there is a cheerwine festival and in fact i'm gonna try to show some info about this on the screen because they're gonna try to have it this year and i hope they managed to pull it off today um got all the ingredients set up behind us so uh let's get into it shall we three shots of grand marnier brandy in this case asbac we like this stuff we get this stuff uh in chocolates around christmas time this is made in the black forest where my favorite cake comes from triple sec another orange flavored liqueur this is manufactured by the kuiper they're very good at having uh liqueurs and creme de whatevers we've got some grenadine syrup yeah just to taste in here we've got one cup of frozen mixed berries in this cup we have one cup of frozen pitted black cherries we've also got two bottles of the eponymous sheer wine for the cheerwine sangria this is a southern us soft drink that's basically cherry soda made with none of those artificial things like corn syrup or anything this is just pure old sugar and uh it's caffeinated as well so uh you can get a this is sort of like the jolt cola before jolt colon tastes a lot better too that was good okay and finally for the wet ingredients we have this lovely portuguese red it's called iolus from portugal 2019 vintage and this says ilos is inspired by the vivid colors and flavors of portugal the wine has a bright ruby red color with lively fruit notes very smooth on the palette with soft round tannins and harmonious finish enjoy eyeless with grilled meats and cheese smells nice and fruity segmented oranges with the peels cut off because they tend to make things bitter we've got some sliced up golden dragon fruit that's very nice i like golden dragon fruit and we've got some basil which we will leave in the jug and then skim off the surface in the morning we've got our massive jug let's go to it throwing in all the booze that's the romania the brandy and the triple sec you know kind of thing that doesn't look too bad in terms of uh volume i think we might be able to get this to go [Music] right down to the last drake no cinnamon good stuff one and the two that is a lovely red color it's all fizzy dropping in the basil oh spritz the old yellow there we go oh that tastes absolutely lovely i'm sure it will taste even better when it's been in the fridge overnight to mellow and let all the flavors get to know each other so nigel put some cling wrap on here and we're gonna put this in the fridge like he said overnight i am actually wearing a wig in cheerwine sangria hey uh it's as if this was thematically planned so all right well thank you for making an excellent beverage and showing everybody how to do this this is a recipe that we came up with and nigel executed it beautifully and i look forward to drinking it very much tomorrow so we'll have to let you know on camera how it turned out see you tomorrow bye everybody [Music] so [Music] so [Music] do [Music] you", "bX3V5Eje7vY": "but today I'm gonna be talking about how calorie labels are actually lying to you guys [Music] so the first food is popcorn like popcorn because it's very low in calories and very filling it's very low calorie dense because you get to eat a lot of it and will give me a general pattern so many people engineer you talking about popcorn at you and it's really getting to become a very popular snack people like to use when dieting and just maintaining a good figure but today I manage talking about how calorie labels are actually lying to you guys all right okay but maybe no exactly lying to you guys but I'm doing a very smart and intelligent way of marketing to show most of the population that I hope on is low in calorie soon but in actual fact this is ridiculously high okay so first of course I want to talk about the back of the bed popcorn because of the high calories this is one friend which I feel really uses marketing to scare the customers because if you actually see in a serving size it says so one serving three servings per container industry banks in one box so people are gonna assume of costly service one per container calories 106 of course under sixty a lotta putting Lola well but as realistic it's not like because if you see the serving size thirty grams however look at the top in front of the public she says three bags of three point two ounces which is ninety one friends so actually when I say three servings per container the container they mean isn't my box they mean one bag so one bag of this brand of popcorn is actually 160 times three how much that 480 calories one popcorn for moderation are you kidding me experiment chips I guess but they're definitely fair options let me show you guys better options the 100 easy is wow Towers this can only be bought from fair price I'm sorry cold storage' Singapore and it's the lowest in calories I'm out of popcorn while getting a single bar so for the safari dose is around 91 grams per pack but this one is around 85 grams protect and live it when I show you guys how actually visually looks you're gonna see that the six grams doesn't really matter much and it looks around the same fact this one even looks like there's more popcorn so perfect two point five servings per Bank alright so one bag miss only honest they they also do the same kind of marketing but I'm not saying then I use in the terms of my bags packaging and stock they are saying two tablespoons and pop is hundred and ten calories so actually this hundred ten calories we see Khoda telegrams which is equivalent to the back of hundred and sixty calories of it of their telegrams so actually if you compare some aside 20 grand to 30 this one has only around 50 carry calories lesser but in one bag is two and a half servings so two and a half servings and three servings if you compare it the difference actually adds up more debt being 480 calories this one actually only has 110 calories times 2.5 which is around 275 calories so this is way less the calories calories in one bag and let's be honest as you guys pop popcorn you're eating everything how often do you guys need hot and put it away it's gonna allow long and thick like right so yeah I like this because it's convenient alright guys so this is a quick comparison or the power punch this is what other and this is another brand called stop choreo both of these but pushes about it Singapore this has 175 calories right well this has 480 calories this one definitely better for dieting and we're gonna see how it compares and looks in terms of volume in both yeah hold on [Music] okay I want you guys to know where they actually smallest look exactly the same however it's obvious that a wall harbors popcorn two hundred eighty five calories guys in clutter 75 calories guys 485 this is so much more wordy and honestly to me this tastes more or less the same maybe this is a little bit more flavor but if you see the logo they're exactly the same maybe this one has a little bit more flavor is cheese flavored yes this is cheese because the original one was sold out however the original only has literally 10 calories less per 30 grams so it's just minus 30 calories of this and it looks exactly the same and that's around like 200 calories difference and this is so much more worthy in my opinion so much tastier okay correct myself it tastes around the same standard but I like this a lot and I've been eating this when I diet and overall all the time so guys always be careful when you're buying the popcorn or any any snacks whatsoever cause the calories calorie labels are marketed in a way to sell the products to sell the products and make you guys buy the products of course so though these brands are marketing themselves in a way that they may seem like they are low in calories especially they are way higher so be careful when you're buying us thanks guys and also guys I want you guys to note I popped these to the best of their ability there are almost no kernels at all or actually no kernels whatever popped it for like four minutes straight and they're almost no kernels maybe one or two so this is a legit general genuinely a visual representation of what you're getting from each packets 275 calories 485 calories how is this worded all right I want you guys I'm not gonna sugarcoat it as well because this vessel closed in this packaging because auto races is 2.5 servings per bag which is supposed to be 70 grams and if since I'm really nitpicking and I've told that man apart I have to tear this one apart as well this one says two tablespoons 30 grams to where my servings which is supposed to be 75 grams you wanna be exact over the box right 85 grams pack at the soul I would take the higher count and if I add up the calories it does add up to more however this bag is definitely way lesser and that bag right so I will put the prices down over here and also where to buy them but overall this one is probably the lowest generation expanding Singapore seriously I have to salt pile of this is the lowest aside from the the best pet this month jolly time popcorn so this energy comes in big banks and probably the only alternative other than vaka augas in Singapore in terms of calories they don't really have a bag so I can only niche by the tablespoon so in terms of two tablespoon on top is the same as what hovers so this is a good offensive however the downside is you have to actually make it on a stove or you can't just microwave it you can just put this whole thing and boom you guys can work out yeah so you got a happy nest or a stove top on you and popping things you know I have one of those those head pop machine things maybe one of those this is a good investment it's way cheaper as well I just would be stale it here okay yeah so guys now number two now that you guys have no more artillery labels and a mall where I don't have to emphasize so much do the rest right number two is great little bit green yogurt is an awesome snakes but usually I would like to prepare something else like maybe fruits or protein powder or actually anything because uh really embodies what these are very not very nice so the shoeprints actually recommend me eme rich style yogurt any bread must has to be quick stock Greek yogurt to body and all lastly my favorite farmers union and I went how much Union the most because it's a cheaper simply that's all I saw you guys know when I post push the prices and places you can buy them open here and the reason why you guys ever do get and not not really is simply because it's a protein protein the way of the Malaysia team macro and indeed you can actually feel full longer as compared to a normal over because they're way more cut - much protein and of course if you guys are lifting weights doing sports training protein is essential for a recovery for you guys build muscle and so on so forth so yes green yogurt is an awesome snack heavy with some nuts remember calories grain important you guys are dilating whenever if not berries fruit cb2 many other snacks and you always make sure you try to get a fat-free one low-fat as low as possible it is a very quicker person then read the - Bonnie fat-free Greek yogurt versus the normal one the calories are way different Federman way higher calories what a lower fat one has way lower calories so you guys have to take note of that about that when you guys are buying the yogurt compare the calories compared to protein some humans have wave lower protein way higher passing car of some I'm way higher in protein be honest though those with high protein and low carbon fats I'm not gonna taste as good mice worried once you mix it up with different ingredients and make a sick-ass pudding number three this berries right okay so personally I really like to get frozen berries and I just eat them so they all of my ice popsicles and cute I feel and it's extremely difficult to go over the octillery limit for snacks and stuff because very is actually very low in calories they're not very dense at all the really filling for smooth berries of a shit-ton fiber I personally like blueberries and strawberries however you can definitely buy varies from okay I'm sorry you can buy any berries my raspberries cranberries just make sure calories I'll go alright just drinkin comparison strawberries and blueberries calories are over here so if you guys want to find Barry's trying to make sure they're low in calories and like ara\u00f1as in calories as these - I was gonna say fruits high bar foods are really broad and most even oh yeah I got it already yep our berries are really good for weight loss easy to stop evil wizard for please something actually I found out really recently in Singapore because I feel like in Singapore actually a lot of things that you can redefine especially compared to overseas of course almost after you can find like a lot liquid egg whites and such so much that we can't my dear number four would be corn pins or multi grain brown rice crackers and I really recommend it since those are really thin ones because one piece could be around 20 30 40 calories rounded if you buy those big-ass brown rice crackers and water or 70 calories and I want those in a month using actually more of them you will be eating as much calories and psychologically your thigh area I should be eating more so even if you end up in July 6 kind of them it's not going to be a lot of calories as perpetuating chips how I love our advice being careful of this one also possibly the entire bag of corn things still gonna carry sister gonna adapt you know yeah so one piece is around 20 to 30 calories did we were going up to 40 calories because it's hard to say each team is different size different weight so they're really good to mix with maybe a little bit of sugar-free jam powder peanut butter and it's a really good tonight overall can even mix your protein ice cream which I'll show you guys to make it soon and yeah I mean mixed with PB 2 personally will be my favorite so your make it into a butter and jelly yeah and it's pretty expensive as far as downsides number 5 my movies number 5 is protein powder yeah sorry I know it's not revolutionary but a person really feels really good snack okay hear me out you guys have protein powder you do not have to only drink it as a shake in the form of a shape you can make protein ice cream you can kick booty cookies protein banana bread and that this goes on and on you don't have to only stick to making shakes I personally love chocolate but I do not know why I do not like making chocolate shakes at all I love making chocolate protein ice cream protein shakes protein brownies all sorts so the last one is more more advice very lettering we can put it all this great cause you can make a ton of recipes with it but this is important you have to make it you have to make recipes you can stick to recipes you actually and join and not just post it sharply tilapia and broccoli chicken and broccoli every single day because that diet is not sustainable having protein powder making things you actually enjoy that is horizontal biggest diet sustainable as for me anyway I feel that's gonna happen both of you guys as well poutine can be bought from places like AI hub and very different websites and lots more so don't anything about it in Singapore the only place I knew I came back with the product boundary ENC and cold storage yeah I don't know anywhere else so yeah that's my five list of snacks you can eat when you're on a diet which are really low in calories and will help you guys do wait remember anyone goes - you guys want to lose weight you gotta stick to a color deficit and nothing else I hope you guys can I mean one it's awful today and thank you guys for watching goodbye [Music]", "oklv1MmztSk": "hello everyone my name is lindsay if you're old thank you so much for coming back to my channel if you're new i hope you will stick around and consider subscribing if you don't already know on the 25th of july so this past saturday was my six year diabetic anniversary or diversary as we diabetics like to call it i have been thinking a lot about how much i have learned and how much i have changed over the past six years since being diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic it has not been an easy journey but i can firmly say and firmly believe that i have been changed for the better i am healthier i'm more aware of what i'm putting into my body i am very aware of the nutritional facts of different foods and being a diabetic has just inspired me to make healthier and better choices today's video i'm going to be showing you my favorite high and low blood sugar snacks as i'm showing you my preferences for high and low blood sugar snacks keep in mind that every diabetic is different every diabetic responds in a different way to both food and insulin and no diabetic is the same so let's get started we are going to start off with low blood sugar so i consider a low blood sugar 69 and below when my sugar is low one of the things that is my go-to snack are fruit snacks and i get different kinds of fruit snacks almost every time i go to the grocery store my absolute favorite kind of fruit snacks and what i get the most are the mozz fruit snacks but the last time i went to the store they were completely sold out of my favorites so bummer but the welch's fruit snacks are really really good um me personally when i start dropping i will eat two fruit snacks and that usually is enough to bring me up to a stable blood sugar until i'm about to eat again one pack of fruit snacks contains 19 grams of carbs so for some of you that might be too littles for some of you that might be a lot but for me it is the perfect amount so fruit snacks are my go-to the second choice i have for low blood sugar are granola bars and my absolute favorite are the nature valley peanut bars my dad started eating these when i was in high school and whenever we would be out at the mall or just walking around town i would get hungry often and i would say hey dad you have any food and he would always pull out these granola bars and they quickly became my favorite if you're not a fan of peanut butter or you're allergic i would not recommend these granola bars but this is my absolute favorite it contains 20 grams of carbs which i feel is the perfect amount to help bring your blood sugar back up and it is also like the perfect combination of salty and sweet which i really appreciate so get yourself a nature valley granola bar this next item you guys are going to laugh at me because i threw away the container but these are peanut butter pretzel bites my husband and i love and adore these if we're hungry throughout the day we'll just grab a couple of these and they are the perfect snack so they are they are these little pretzel bites that contain peanut butter within the pretzel they are about 17 grams per serving so if you grab a handful that would add up to about 17 grams of carbs i love these these are a perfect snack for when i get home from work and i'm really hungry and i just want something quick but will sustain me until dinner i would highly recommend these pretzel bites if you are sensitive to gluten or you have an allergy to peanut butter i would not go for these but i do not so i love these the next snack choice i have i don't really go for very often if it's an emergency i will but i try to avoid this as much as i can but it is cereal my preference since sixth or seventh grade has always been the special k red berry cereal i have tried a lot of their cereals and they are really good but the red berries is my favorite my family is probably laughing at me because they know how obsessed i was with this when i was in middle school and high school looking on the nutrition packs the cereal itself is 34 grams of carbs and with 3 4 of a cup of skim milk it adds up to 43 grams of carbs if i wake up in my sugars low and i don't really feel like my typical yogurt fruit and granola i will go for some cereal but because this is so high in carb my sugar tends to go a little bit higher after i eat this so i try to avoid it but it is really good to indulge in every once in a while and last but certainly not least i have trail mix now my husband knows i am a trail mix fiend i just really love trail mix my favorite is the fruit and nut trail mix i get this from kroger for 1 4 cup it is 23 grams of carbs so that is usually the perfect amount to bring me back up sometimes i go a little overboard because i just love the dried pineapple and the dried papaya in this it contains a lot of really healthy nutritional fruits and nuts in here hence the name but i also really like just your standard typical trail mix with peanuts and m m's and raisins and craisins and all that great stuff because i try to be healthier on a daily basis the fruit and nutrient mix is my go-to moving on to high blood sugar everyone has different standards for high blood sugar but what i would consider high blood sugar is any time my blood sugar is above 200 my range is typically 80 to 180 high blood sugar is tricky because sometimes you're hungry with a high blood sugar and you don't want to eat because you don't want to increase your blood sugar and feel sick later but thankfully there are foods that are considered free foods that don't contain a lot of carbs and are perfectly fine to eat when your blood sugar is high my first favorite high blood sugar snack is almonds now i am not a salty person i don't like a lot of salt so the sea salt coated almonds are not my preference i usually go for the unsalted almonds these are six grams of carbs for 1 4 cup so i just have the typical unsalted almonds but i also have the honey roasted almonds which contain 8 grams of carbs the honey roasted almonds are absolutely delicious and this is what they look like they have they do have a little bit of sea salt and sugar on them but they are very light and just the perfect snack when my blood sugar is high next up is cheese sticks i love these kraft mozzarella cheese sticks my husband just gets them in a standard pack for me i will just have a cheese stick and maybe some almonds as a mid-afternoon snack when i'm getting hungry and it's not yet time for dinner these are just really delicious these are great to take with you if you are traveling or just on the go next up if you haven't guessed i am a big peanut butter fan so i am going to say peanut butter this kind of peanut butter my husband and i get from kroger they usually are on a two for four or three for five deal i absolutely love this kind of peanut butter it's creamy i'm not a big fan of the crunchy peanut butter this contains two tablespoons equals seven grams of carbs which is not bad at all so sometimes you can just eat this straight from the jar um however i have put it on crackers before so if your sugar is a little low putting a little bit of peanut butter on some crackers will help stabilize your blood sugar it is important to always have a protein and a carb with your snacks and your meals so if i need that little bit of protein with my meals i will just add a little bit of peanut butter and it is delicious since i found out i was pregnant i have discovered a new love of mine and that is pickles i have always liked pickles but i've never been a huge pickle freak but i am just obsessed with vinegar and pretty much everything savory in my pregnancy so the mount olive kosher pickles are the way to go they have less than one gram of carb for two-thirds of a sphere which is not bad at all and they are just so tangy and delicious and i find it super refreshing so guys those are all my favorite high-end low blood sugar snacks it is almost lunch time and looking at all this food is making me very very hungry so i think i'm gonna go if you like this video please give it a thumbs up subscribe if you haven't already please leave down below in the comments your favorite high and low blood sugar snacks i would love to know i'm always on the hunt for new snacks and treats and i would just love to hear from you guys what you're enjoying thank you so much for watching i will see you guys in the next video [Music] bye", "0tcSVXYyC6U": "hey guys it's Ken from Cuba D productions TV welcome back to a kendama k-- thirsty Thursdays just for you I was in a convenience store this morning and noticed these Jolly Rancher drinks and remembered that a bunch of guys told me about them that they existed I just never seen them before until today soon as I saw them there's a whole shelf of different flavors in the fridge section this one is strawberry and this one's while oh sorry blueberry blue raspberry if I was gonna be a wild berry for a second there and this is a 20 ounce 20 fluid ounce bottle or 591 milliliters and it's a hundred and ten calories per serving and their serving is eight fluid ounces or 240 so it's probably like 220 plus calories per bottle if you drink the whole thing obviously let's go in quickly to do the blue raspberry artificially flavored nose 0% fruit juice and it's a 31 grams of sugar probably again per serving in 35 milligrams of sodium carbohydrates just 31 I don't think it's good I don't think it's going to be oh it is I didn't think it was gonna be carbonated you're that whoa it tastes like you just bit into a raspberry it's got that sour raspberry flavor not overly carbonated Wow artificially flavored a listen tastes like ice artificially flavored tastes like it's got the real juice in there all right let's go into the strawberry there's no name beside strawberry no it's just straight-up strawberry since I opened it up whoa that smells like artificially flavored that doesn't smell like artificially flavored this one's like almost overly scented artificially scented not too keen on the strawberry this should have bought some actual Jolly Ranchers just to compare but this this doesn't taste that good I don't know why whatever flavor they used whatever chemically flavored stuff they used to make it taste like strawberry it didn't do a very good job at all look ingredients carbonated water is the number one thing high fructose corn fructose corn syrup natural and artificial flavor and well it wasn't that good this one's definitely better I'd buy this one over that one any day red loses this would be a would not recommend doesn't really taste like strawberry it just it tastes like a horribly flavoured drink I don't know what I've had better strawberry flavored things that had no juice in it but that would be a would not recommend but this would be a total recommend a Sinkin mate would it be a go out and get it now it's not like blow in my mind for the fact that be like oh my gosh I gotta go and get another one of these it is very good again way better than that not to go out and get it out compared to that but that is a very very nice flavored Jolly Rancher soda so guys there you go if you're interested in grabbing a quick whoa beverage next time you're in a convenience store I totally recommend the Jolly Rancher blue whoo raspberry I keep wanting to say wild and I know that's wrong so blue raspberry give it a shot my recommendation from me to you if you've had them and you have a better idea of a better flavor all there goes my cat if you think there's a better flavor out there let me know in the comments below I'll read through them and I'll go and buy two more flavors and we'll do it in the next couple weeks coming up to do some more reviews of Jolly Ranchers make sure you give me two to

hitting you with another health lesson of the week all right so today it's kind of a fun topic to talk about a little bit interesting definitely impacts me a lot we're going to talk about breakfast and why it is the most important meal of the day and why is it called breakfast you guys ever wondered about that do you ever think about that why is breakfast called breakfast well guess what i'm gonna tell you today so you're gonna be a little bit wiser after this video thanks to me you're welcome all right so start it off breakfast we all know has always been called the most important meal of the day right everybody always wants us to eat breakfast it's good for us right but a lot of us are guilty of not doing so including myself i'm not gonna lie i don't always eat breakfast because coach is kind of bad and coach likes to sleep so coach chooses to sleep rather than to eat so if coach eats coach is going to be late for work and coach got to be late for work so i tend to skip breakfast a lot of the time which is bad bad coach is bad i know i know i'm sorry don't yell at me stop yelling at me i'm going to eat breakfast i actually ate breakfast this morning so thank you yes thank you thank you thank you thank you appreciate it see making baby steps guys baby steps if i can do them you can do them too but i do know a lot of you may have the same circumstances you know maybe you're always running late for school or you don't have breakfast ready for you in the morning or you don't have anything at home that's you know a quick breakfast for you or a quick healthy breakfast for you or maybe some of you and you just can't don't have access to breakfast items and so it makes it hard for us to have breakfast in the morning and that's okay i understand um things are gonna happen life isn't always perfect but as long as you try your best and if you have the opportunity to eat breakfast every single day in the morning eat breakfast come on guys if i can do it you can do it so let's get into why it is so important for you to actually eat breakfast and why it's called breakfast okay so check this out breakfast is the most important meal of the day because it is the first meal that you eat in the morning it's the first meal you eat starting your day it is what gets you going it is called breakfast break fast because this meal it breaks your overnight fasting period what's an overnight fasting period you ask well let me tell you guys it is basically you not eating throughout the entire night okay we don't eat when we're sleeping right unless we got a couple sleepwalkers in here and you sleepwalk and go and raid the fridge but i don't think there's any of us that do that so a lot of us are going throughout the night you know without eating we're going 10 plus hours without food 10 plus hours guys without food man that's making my stomach growl right now just thinking about it that's bad you know that's not good for us and me coach likes to sleep a lot and sometimes we don't eat right before bed so some of us are going maybe 12 plus hours without food i know i'm guilty of doing that i'm probably 15 plus sometimes which is definitely a no bueno so that's why they call breakfast breakfast because it's the meal that breaks your fasting period okay and it is very very important because breakfast is what gets your brain going in the morning okay a lot of the time when we wake up in the morning we're sluggish we're groggy we're tired the alarm is going off mom's waking us up wake up wake up and we're like no mom stop it five more minutes mom five more minutes yeah it's because we haven't ate all night so we're gonna continue feeling like that unless we eat some breakfast and the whole reason why breakfast is going to fix that problem is because when we eat breakfast it gives us what you call glucose and it replenishes our glucose levels which boosts our energy levels and our alertness so we can stay awake in class not feel tired throughout the day and be able to go outside and play and do all the activities like that we like to do like play football or soccer or basketball or play on the jungle gym with me or go skateboarding or do karate or mma or whatever it is you'd like to do and also so you can participate and pe with me instead of sitting there like no coach i'm tired no should have a breakfast then so that's why it's important it gets you ready to go it gets you going throughout the day all right so the breakfast basically it gives you brain power by giving it glucose i know you're probably you've heard it twice already heard me say it twice glucose glucose glucose probably thinking coach what the heck is glucose well let me tell you what glucose is and you know terms that you guys are it's easy for you guys to understand um glucose is basically good sugar for your body okay your body turns um what you call carbs from food into energy glucose sugar basically but it's a good sugar okay it's not the sugar that are in your fruit snacks or in your kool-aid that's not glucose it's a different kind of glucose that your body makes itself okay and that glucose is what powers our brains okay so when we eat the when we eat our breakfast and we get glucose from our breakfast uh it makes us alert and it's what gets us going that's what that's what our brain needs in order to focus throughout the day you know so we're not falling asleep in class you know um or kind of spacing out a lot being little space cadets i know i'm guilty of that not gonna lie um so we're able to pay attention do our homework do our class work and do good at it and be able to understand what our teachers are going through because we're able to focus better okay this glucose that we get from breakfast breakfast it really affects our memory our intention and our ability to concentrate okay guys so if basically if our brain is sleepy our bodies are going to be sleepy too so it's very important that we eat breakfast so that not only are our brains ready to go but our bodies are ready to go and we're ready to go throughout the day and take it on whatever the day decides to throw at us okay um i'm gonna give you a few uh breakfast ideas um that maybe some of you can wanna try out or so um i personally really like breakfast it's probably my favorite meal of the day even though i don't eat it as often it's just i like the fruits that it offers they're not always great health-wise but they all taste fantastic let me tell you but i'm only gonna give you some of the healthy ideas okay because i can't be giving you bad ideas no i'm not gonna tell you go eat some chocolate chip pancakes no no no no no don't eat chocolate chip pancakes okay what i like to eat what i normally make in the morning what i used to what i'm gonna start doing actually is i'm gonna make oatmeal it's plain oatmeal though okay it's not like the little packets of oatmeal um that you get in the box that are flavored like the apple cinnamon or the cinnamon regular cinnamon or whatever other flavors that they have those are bad because those have added sugar in it and extra sugar is not good for the body i know i mentioned that glucose is sugar but like i told you glucose is a good sugar that your body makes itself okay otherwise if glucose was in your food they wouldn't call the sugar sugar they would call it glucose put some glucose in your kool-aid but no they don't it's called sugar so it's something completely different okay um so the oatmeal it has to be plain steel cut oats or rolled oats it doesn't matter both of them are good just as long as it's plain and you can add some fruits in there that's what i like to do i like to add some strawberries if i have some if they're available fresh fruit fresh fruit don't put frozen that's kind of weird it will kind of taste weird um but yeah i like to put i like to cut up some strawberries and put it in my oatmeal or if i have blueberries i'll put some blueberries in there um you can even put some bananas in there get crazy whatever type of fruit that you have and you want to throw it in there throw it in there it's your breakfast it's your oatmeal mix it in why not make it how you want it make it enjoyable for you so you will want to eat it in the morning okay um another another healthy breakfast that you can have is and this is also pretty quick too is um some whole grain cereal okay with low-fat milk or regular milk i know a bunch of us have regular two percent milk and that's totally fine just as long as you're not drinking eating your cereal with heavy cream we're good so don't worry about it okay and then maybe you can have um some yogurt or fruit with your cereal you know that sounds good too that's what i like to do sometimes um or you can just eat the fresh fruits and yogurts by themselves fresh fruit and yogurt are the best for you those are awesome okay because fruit has a bunch of vitamins and minerals that you need in it as well as a healthy natural amount of sugar and yogurts they also have a bunch of good vitamins and mineral in it that you need and they also have probiotics probiotics are what keep your insides healthy so that's definitely good as well yogurts are awesome for you my personal favorite breakfast snack that i like to make it's easy and it's easy to take anywhere too you can take it on the go is smoothies fruit smoothies i love my fruit smoothies i love berry fruit smoothies those are the ones that i make so how i make mine is i get frozen fruit i get frozen fruit excuse me um and mostly it's like blueberries strawberries raspberries cherries i put it in a blender i get some yogurt if i have some yogurt i like to get greek yogurt that's good it has a lot of protein and it's pretty good for you um i get the greek yogurt i'll put some peanut butter in there um i'll put some spinach in there put some milk sometimes i'll put a banana in there any other type of stuff that i might have laying around that's good for me i'll throw in there uh one of my friends would make my smoothies with avocados what i've never heard of a smoothie with avocados have you well i had one and i had no idea there was an avocado in it she told me after i drank it she was like how'd you like it and i was like it's good i liked it why why are you asking she's like oh cause i put avocado in it and i was just like what i didn't even taste it but avocados are super good for you so i'm glad she did that for me she's helping me out she's helping me be even healthier and that's the good thing about smoothies if you're someone who doesn't really like vegetables too much you can throw them in there with the fruit mix it up and you won't even taste it like i said i put spinach spinach is a vegetable and i put that in my smoothie sometimes i would put apples in my smoothies too along with my berries and stuff and if you don't like berries that's fine you can maybe put mangoes or pineapple for a more tropical type of smoothie in the morning any type of smoothie with any type of fruit any type of vegetable it's good it's good for you put yogurt or milk in there you're set and it's an awesome breakfast you're going to get a lot of good vitamins and minerals and it's going to fill you up your brain is going to be happy your body's going to be happy and you're going to be ready to go out there and take on whatever the world throws at you you're going to be sitting there in class like oh yeah i got this i got this i got this oh i know the answer you're going to feel good about yourself all right mentally and physically so please if you take anything from today take that breakfast is good for you you need to eat breakfast in the morning no matter how hard it is you gotta try coach is trying so you gotta try too okay guys breakfast is super super important your brain wants it your brain needs it your brain loves it your body loves it and it's also delicious i know like i said earlier it's hard for us to sometimes eat breakfast but let's do our best to try and eat breakfast every day so we can grow up big healthy and strong and not be tired throughout the day because that's not a great feeling i know from experience but coach is being a good coach now and i'm going to be eating breakfast every single day so i hope you guys too alrighty that's it for our health lesson today and i will see you guys later hopefully the wind doesn't blow me away over here", "ePuG54vs73k": "hey guys welcome back to another video i'm super excited to film this one this is vlogmas day one i'm so excited for vlogmas um today's video is gonna be an unboxing video and i actually found this box on amazon which i was really surprised about i did some black friday cyber monday shopping and i found this box on amazon that is a bunch of vegan snacks and i was like what what is this so i got it and i'm gonna unbox it for you guys and try everything and let you know what i think if you like this video give it a thumbs up um and if you feel inclined you can subscribe and join the fam the videos i do are a lot of vegan stuff so anything from unboxing vegan snacks trying new things that are vegan and i also do recipe videos and like what i eat in a days so stay tuned for that and vlogmas is gonna be awesome i'm so excited i'm gonna have so many different kinds of recipes for christmas and like christmas themed stuff so get excited because i'm so pumped alright so let's get into the video okay so this is what the box looks like it's pretty big actually and it's by mr bunnies mr bunny james i don't know anything about this i literally just like bought it cause i was like this is so cool i want to try this all right so i'll show you like what it looks like inside this is what it looks like inside there's a bunch of snackies [Music] there's so many things in here we're gonna try them all today there's like a ridiculous amount of stuff in here but i'm so excited i'm gonna show you each snack as we go and i'll put a link of all the stuff below and if they still have that box up on amazon i will definitely link that too but let's get into trying this i'm so hungry and i'm super excited so first we have this bean fields lean chips this is the nacho flavor they smell like healthy let's see with it what's in these like black beans yeah black beans is like the first ingredient and that's kind of what it smells like and this is kind of what they look like these are so weird they're like bean chips black bean chips it's like i get what they were doing with this they wanted like alternative chip but bean chips are kind of weird like it's literally it does kind of taste like a nacho but it's very subtly nacho flavored and it's so much more just black bean i don't know i would eat these if i guess like i had nothing else to eat i mean they're okay they're not the best i'll put a rating out of 10 of how i feel about them of like each of the products this one is like say like a five it's not the best it's okay okay next are these k-pop these are the cheddar flavor they're vegan gluten-free allergen 12 allergen free so they kind of look like popcorn chips kind of they smell like earthy which is weird uh these this is what they kind of look like it looks like a rice cake but like a chip if that makes sense those are actually good what the heck like nothing really in here like there's not much in these bags but pretty good i rate these guys probably like a seven i think if they were a little bit saltier it would be like way better but they're pretty good all right next are these paleo puffs these are the nose no cheese cheesy cheesiness and they're grain free they have coconut right now and they look like a cheeto but like a white colored cheeto those do not taste like cheese i'm just getting a lot of coconut oil like they're not really flavored much i don't really like these because i've had hippies which are so much better these are okay i give this one like um a five out of ten it's okay it's like me next one [Music] bobos i've had some bobo stuff but i haven't had this this is a toaster pastry what are they trying to do like this is like a pop-tart like a vegan pop tart what so funny and it like comes out like this what literally like a pop-tart what all right let me break some off oh i forgot to say the flavor chocolate peanut butter this is so good this is like a pop tart but healthy and actually tastes good what the heck that's so good all right that one's definitely getting little bubbles toaster pantry is definitely an 8 out of 10. that's like pretty good i would love if it would have like the frosting on it though i've had frosting on it it would definitely be like 10 all the time okay something in this box that i'm not really um super excited about is this i like chia seeds are great i love chia seeds but she is squeezed just gives me like uh it just sounds gross because i just don't like that consistency but okay okay this one's raspberry one the textures is so weird chia seeds are so good i like them in stuff but like i don't like chia seed pudding like itself just the consistency so weird but like this is good it's like kind of tastes like a raspberry apple sauce or like a raspberry sauce is that what you would say i don't know it's like an applesauce but it's good i wouldn't say that's amazing um but as a snack and a healthy snack and a really quick like pinch whatever i would give it like for taste definitely like eight out of ten totally but just consistently alone i'm gonna make it seven out of ten because it's it's just so weird i don't know i could just feel like i'm eating snot okay next is another bobo's product they definitely like bobos this is a oat bite it's like a little muffin it's like a muffin and this is the lemon poppy seed flavor so thick oh my god i love bow with products okay this is really good like definitely i did this one and i had 10 like this is really really good i like that a lot i always thought like lemon in like muffins was weird but this is like so good that's definitely really really good i highly recommend that one sounds good okay next is bubba's nana chips and they're kettle cooked so i guess they're like banana chips which i do like banana chips but i don't like when they have flavorings on them so i'm hoping this is just like a plain one it looks like it's a plain one except i can't open it so it's a banana chip ew what did they put up oh there's garlic parmesan [Music] ew the i don't like sweet and like savory ew no i give this like a three i really don't like it why did i still eat it we don't waste food ew this is also weird i don't know how to feel this vegan jerky this is primal spirit brand this is a teriyaki flavor i don't like i never liked jerky and before i was vegan or anything so i don't think i like this but at the same time i'm up to try whatever okay vegan jerky ew it smells like meat boom ooh was made with vital wheat glutens would taste like has the consistency of meat i don't like this this is so bad one out of ten would never eat unless i was starving ew i i like can't understand that why do people like that i don't know like even regular like meat jerky okay next is by jana banana it is the original banana bar interesting people like love vegan stuff like banana flavor like that's what they put in everything it looks like this just like kind of like a regular bar that's good it's just sun ripe bananas coconut and less than one percent of lime juice that's really good i like that i also just like love banana stuff so definitely 8 out of 10 for me i wish there was chocolate on it that's my only thing okay oh well go macro bar i'm actually not going to eat this on camera because i've had these before and this is the exact flavor that i had the protein pleasure it is peanut butter chocolate chip i ate a whole like box of these in like two weeks no i probably a week i probably ate it in like a week probably less than that was probably four days it was so good and like the go macro bars i like love i'm obsessed with them 10 out of 10 so good especially that flavor peanut butter chocolate okay this is nut raw this is a whole thing it says just three ingredients it's just dates figs almonds okay let's see how it tastes um i wouldn't say it tastes like amazing but i really like dates so like i like it i feel like i would eat this if like it was like something snacky um but there wouldn't be something like i grabbed because it doesn't have chocolate on it i love chocolate so this one's good i would give it like a 7 out of 10. wood snack again um but wish it had chocolate on it maybe i would dip it in chocolate i feel like there's a theme here if it's not chocolate i don't love it i'll eat it though okay i have had these two things before as well nature's bakery fig bars um raspberry is good i liked it um i would probably rate it at like a 7 out of 10 again because i wish there was a little bit more like it's okay it's just i wish there was more chocolate there's not even chocolate on it i don't even know what i'm saying and then this is the original fig this one is good too but like it's very similar to this bar it's just thicker so i'd also rate it like a 7 out of 10. put chocolate on it okay this is by nature's bandits it's mixed berry apple veggie fruit stick so i'm assuming that this is like i don't know what like a gummy kind of thing let's see i mean i guess it's kind of like a gummy thing it smells good i like the berry scent not like super like a gummy bear but it's like tastes kind of like that i think i would like this better if it was like grape or something maybe not like this this particular flavor is probably taking me off but i like the consistency and i like where they're going with this i just wish it wasn't this flavor i think a different flavor would be so much better so i would give this like a i don't know like a six out of ten i just don't like the flavoring but i do like like the consistency of it i feel like it's like a like a mini fruit roll up kind of thing you know like a gummy that you used to have when you're a kid i can't think of the exact thing i'm thinking of leave a comment if you know what i'm talking about but it's okay so we'll see um they like their chia bar things um this one is health warrior chia bar apple cinnamon flavor i feel like it's just gonna be like the same bar as the other ones this one's really good though apple cinnamon's good that's good chia bar i like it i give this one probably i said seven out of ten again i like it it's not top tier though all right dark chocolate brownie siren protein bites oh these look good because they have chocolate so they look like little protein balls so they're kind of stuck together in here but they're good [Music] the only thing about this that's not going to give it a 10 or 10 it's a 9 out of 10 is that it has protein powder in it and a lot of protein powders kind of leave that like after weird taste you know um it's really good though like without the like gritty bits of the um protein like aftertaste it's pretty good i would definitely eat this before like after workout or like before workout or something something like quick snacks i love these i love larry and lenny's cookies they're so good i haven't had this flavor though the snickerdoodle but i love their cookies [Music] i give this one a um 10 out of 10. um i love larry's and lenny's cookies they're always really good source of protein and super good this is the munch pack protein cookie soft baked this is the double chart double dark chocolate double dark chocolate okay this one looks like this so soft wow oh my god what is in this it's so good because there's peanut butter in it too that's why i love it so good i like that so much this one is also a ton of time because it has peanut butter chocolate and more chocolate what's not to like about that this is the next thing iq bar peanut butter chip it has six brain nutrients it says whatever that means 12 grams of plant-based protein less than one gram of sugar and three net carbs so i guess it's like a really a bar towards people are really counting like macros and calories and stuff look like that it was like a freaking candy bar no what how do they do this that's pretty good again it has a weird like aftertaste i think from protein lion's mane extract wild that's crazy it does have like a weird like protein aftertaste but i

bye", "LXWQ-_hFuLU": "there's only one thing i hate more than lying skim milk which is water that's lying about being milk welcome to watch mojo and today we're counting down our picks for the top 10 unhealthy health foods the first thing i would do is say okay whole foods is this really organic and how do you know it's organic it's not a cookie it's a fat-free mutant battery i'm sure we can wait him out when you read the ingredient list on most of these packages the first ingredient is potato so you can read that as potato chips for this list we're looking at food items that are often touted as being healthy when in reality they can be anything but a note evidence-based science is always evolving so take everything with a grain of salt but just a little not too much sodium can you think of any more so-called healthy food items if so sound off in the comments below number 20 gluten-free snacks gluten-free is one of those buzzy terms that makes a food item sound super healthy if it's free of something that makes it better right well not exactly it's true that if you have a gluten intolerance of any kind then you should absolutely stick to gluten-free options the thing is modern research suggests a very low percentage of americans suffer from celiac disease mayo clinic gastroenterologist dr joseph murray says only about one percent of americans have celiac disease and should not eat gluten the protein found in wheat barley and rye but a 2011 study reported gluten also made some people who did not have celiac disease feel sick for the rest of us without this or any other gluten intolerance ordering the gluten-free option isn't doing much good as they often have the same effect on your body as their gluten-filled counterpart but eliminating gluten from your diet if you don't need to can actually pose risks to your health gluten-free flours are usually very low in fiber they also lack b vitamins and iron which are added to traditional wheat flour and when we go on a gluten-free diet especially if we don't need to those nutrients start to fall off in fact food manufacturers often add a lot of unhealthy fillers like sugars and fats to simulate the effects of gluten number 19 veggie patties and burgers red robin caters to a lot of different tastes they even have a garden burger just in case your teenage daughter is going through a phase this meat alternative is a quick solution for both seasoned vegetarians and those wanting to avoid red meat at their next barbecue but don't be fooled meat free doesn't always mean healthy oh i see what it is their veggie burger is basically a hamburger with nothing in it it's just all the toppings so so a veggie burger is just veggies which is interesting i was i was totally expecting a type of patty or something while veggie burgers might be lower in calories and fat than their meat-based counterparts many commercial brands are not actually all that high in veggie content and are instead packed with chemicals preservatives unhealthy oils or fillers to make them more burger like if you really want a healthy alternative avoid the processing by making your own with beans and grains or just use a big portobello mushroom instead these are so juicy and good we got it all over me number 18 froyo this is a cute term for frozen yogurt which is intended to make the snack sound fancier and healthier than it actually is hey this yogurt is really something huh and it's non-fat i've been waiting for something like this my whole life and it's finally here frozen yogurt is essentially just ice cream only a bit more tart lower in fat and sometimes containing some potentially beneficial bacteria but just because it's lower in fat doesn't mean it's healthy but what are we talking about that's 500 calories before you add any toppings to it it's still loaded with sugar especially when you add all the yummy accoutrement it can also be more processed than ice cream especially with non-fat varieties adding things like cellulose and carrageenan when it comes to froyo it really depends on what kind you get it can be a decent treat if you put the effort in but most of the time it's just ice cream number 17 sports drinks 50 more let's do it again we've all seen the advertising that claims these products will help you rehydrate after a killer workout try power thirst energy drinks for people who need gratuitous amounts of energy and thanks to their added electrolytes like sodium or potassium they might just do that however we said a killer workout we did not say a leisurely stroll around the block with your dog clinical scientists say they couldn't find specific backing for much of sports drink advertising and much of what they could find they characterize as flawed science due to their often high calorie counts these beverages are often not worth it for non-athletes i know what it tastes like championship that's what's up yeah one more drink and i'm done plus with those artificial dyes they add to create the drinks vibrant appearances and the often mounds of sugar added you're more often than not just better off sticking with high quality h2o number 16 trail mix this beautiful and tasty concoction is a favorite of hikers runners and bodybuilders it usually contains some combination of nuts often peanuts dried fruit and oats or granola basically a lot of carb protein and fat rich food that provides a burst of energy it's a great although sometimes high-calorie snack provided you make it yourself store-bought trail mixes are often loaded with added sugars and sodium which is the last thing you need on a long hot walk in the blazing sun with raisins peanuts and candy coated chocolatey bits in the mix nobody can wait to hit the trail various brands also contain chocolate candy like m m's which obviously isn't very healthy when it comes to trail mix you should really just make your own and stick to the natural unsalted dried fruits and nuts i'm allergic to peanut butter since when birth number 15 processed organic foods like gluten-free organic has become a healthy buzzword in recent years organic essentially means natural and isn't natural always better nearly half of organic fruits and vegetables tested in ontario have traces of pesticides and a little over one percent of the samples exceeded canada's maximum allowed limits for pesticides the only thing is organic is not necessarily interchangeable with natural organic foods can still contain artificial colors flavors and preservatives and also ingredients that are virtually identical to their non-organic counterparts like sugar and organic raw cane sugar certification standards for organic can also vary this is made especially worse when it comes to processed organic food remember just because it's labeled organic doesn't necessarily make it healthier although sometimes it may be in fact you're often paying outrageous prices for a product that is virtually identical to the regular thing the first thing i would do is say okay whole foods is this really organic and how do you know it's organic because i don't know number bran muffins what would you like for breakfast johnny muffins that's right while they seem harmless they can add inches to your waistline and pounds to the scale if consumed on the regular don't let their plain appearance fool you depending on how they're made bran muffins can pack as much sugar as a donut they're big they have a lot of fat and they have a lot of sugar and that's because even though it sounds healthy and has some fiber they put all that fat and sugar in there to make that bran muffin taste really good but the worst part of this seemingly smart snack portion size restaurant or store-bought brand muffins are often far bigger than those your grandmother made and therefore the golden rule of moderation falls by the wayside holy cow that's a huge muffin where the heck did you find it i don't know add an extra smear of jammer butter to the mix and you've got one healthy looking snack that is anything but the smart alternative is to just make your own oh i got plenty of muffin and muffin got plenty of me you can't beat a good muffin first thing in the morning number 13 protein bars like trail mix protein bars are a favorite for bodybuilders as it provides a yummy and convenient dose of protein but if you're looking to ingest pure protein you're really better off just buying a tub of the good stuff on the downside look at the ingredients first thing you got to do if they're too high in sugar there's not much separating a protein bar than a candy bar protein bars often come equipped with high fructose corn syrup crazy amounts of sugar trans fats and unhealthy fillers making them little more than funny tasting chocolate bars you're arguably doing more harm than good by eating these after every workout but some of these bars also have as much sugar as candy bars while others use loads of low calorie sweeteners if you want a good source of protein without shelling out for the expensive stuff stick to healthier and more natural options like eggs beans fish and legumes number 12. packaged salads it's a trap that many people fall into you're looking for a healthy option for lunch so you grab one of the prepared salads from a supermarket or a fast food joint now think about this 15 years ago bagged salads didn't even exist and now they account for 70 percent of lettuce sales salad is healthy there's no doubt about that but not take out salads a simple pre-packaged salad can contain up to 1000 calories which is largely owing to ingredients like cheese meat and croutons not to mention the salad dressing that is loaded with trans fats and sugar it's really crisp and fresh my taste buds just went crazy the meat croutons and cheese also contain a ton of sodium to help boost the flavor of the salad if you're looking for a healthy takeout salad opt for one without the fancy fixings and throw away the dressing number eleven dried fruit now we got dried peaches dried apricots dried raisins and dried prunes you know mrs turns you got to keep regular if you want to be happy but it's fruit how bad can it be well these bite-sized morsels are considered a healthy alternative to chips or candy in reality though sometimes that's deceptive as they can be processed and full of preservatives and artificial sweeteners plus since dried food is so easy to eat you'll eat more have you ever considered eating a dozen apricots in one sitting absolutely stuffed probably not but you wouldn't hesitate to eat that many dried banana chips are the worst offenders however because they're often deep fried like regular potato chips you're better off grabbing fresh fruit next time you've got a craving for something sweet dried fruit lacks water so it can make you feel dehydrated hence you will need to drink great amounts of water number 10 veggie chips these air sats potato chips are made with thinly sliced vegetables or just potatoes and vegetable powders which are then either deep fried or baked until crispy if you own a dehydrator it's best to make your own vegetable chips to ensure proper production you see this tomato you see green it looks all veggie filled when you read the ingredient list on most of these packages the first ingredient is potato so you can read that as potato chips if made correctly veggie chips can be a very healthy alternative to regular potato chips unfortunately most store-bought brands other brands are far better and are just actual vegetables are composed of mostly potato starch and corn flour and they're both fried and heavily salted to increase flavor in the end many mass-produced veggie chips are nothing more than regular potato chips or crisps or crackers coated in colorful veggie powder they do have a dash of vegetable powder which seems mostly bad color but they have about as much fat and calories as potato chips and a lot more sodium number nine smoothies drinking a smoothie with no vegetable nutrition strawberry banana mixing some fruits and veggies in a blender seems like a healthy option for a quick snack or a vitamin boosting beverage on the go but be warned depending how they're made these drinks can pack tons of calories and sugar that might not leave you feeling satisfied for long hope that blends up i don't know if it will yes the fruit's healthy but added sugary fruit juice scoops of sorbet and frozen yogurt will all contribute to your waistline and cheat you out of nutritious vitamins to carry you throughout your day you might even find that some ready-made versions pack as much of a caloric punch as soda so making your own with quality ingredients is definitely the way to go and then we're gonna add a handful of greens and you won't even taste them because of this beautiful kiwi number eight margarine this is a product that is often touted as a healthy butter substitute fun fact margarine was developed in france in the 19th century and was used a lot by both the armed forces and poorer citizens margarine's likely gonna have more unsaturated fat where butter is going to have saturated fat and while it can be as healthy or arguably healthier than butter this is a very contentious issue many margarine brands contain loads of truly terrible and unhealthy trans fats which greatly increase blood cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease in fact the framingham heart study found that those who replaced butter with margarine were more likely to die from heart disease so if you choose margarine over butter be sure to get the one without trans fats number seven fat-free products what about this did you lose weight actually i have been trying this new fat-free diet i invented all i've had to eat for the past six days are gummy bears jelly beans and candy corns god i wish i had your discipline fat is bad right then fat free must always be a good thing well neither of those statements is actually necessarily true the science is in flux and there are many healthy fats like salmon which have a place in a balanced diet but of course since a low-fat diet is advocated for many by health authorities fat-free foods must be a godsend but they're not many products bearing this label are highly processed with chemicals and artificial flavors inserted to amp up their taste it's not a cookie it's a fat-free newton fat-free i'm sure we can wait him out even worse fat-free doesn't mean calorie-free so it's best to educate yourself about their ingredients and nutritional properties to see if they're really worth eating i'd be careful those fat-free chips that cause anal leakage you pods ain't a lake says so on the bank number six energy bars looking large hey you want the rest of my power bar no i got a nitro bar how about an energy bar no i got a muscle triplicator bar these packaged treats claim to be packed with vitamins and nutrition but have been referred to as glorified candy bars by many of the world's leading voices in the health community [Music] it's their use of unhealthy add-ons like white flour saturated fats and added sugars that make these so-called health foods unhealthy plus most of them don't even boast as much fiber as you might think you can see that it is delicious looking yum one bar might satisfy a craving but it can add an additional 400 calories to your day even as a pre-workout snack it seems this health food is better left on the shelf 20 grams of pro caliber protein from the locker rooms of the pros now in yours number five fruit juice you have the option of buying soda or some type of fruit juice logic tells you that the healthier option is the fruit juice and while it is the healthier option it's not exactly healthy at all a lot of the cheap fruit juice you see in supermarkets is really just fruit flavored sugar water as there's no actual fruit to be found within them even though something contains 100 fruit juice it may be very processed and refined so what ends up in the glass is not what came from the fruit itself but even real fruit juice is loaded with sugar and all the benefits of the actual fruit like the fiber have been stripped clean you're getting all the negatives of fruit and none of the benefits in the end fruit juices are likely to leave you feeling tired hungry and irritable owing to their high sugar content number four cereal granola so can you send other things say like breakfast cereal do you have any idea what breakfast cereal is made of it's those little curly wooden shavings you find in pencil sharp sure we know those sugary cereals packed with marshmallows are unhealthy but surely those brands filled with bran and grains make for a good start to your day well our advice is always read the labels carefully for this go-to breakfast option six yummy colors fruity yellow berry purple tasty orange and blue pizzeria very green and red rooty duty these tricks taste mega fruity in many cases they're produced in ways that diminish most or any potential nutrition and many cereals are also full of sugar and refined carbohydrates that will lead you on a one-way street towards a midday sugar crash granola on the other hand is relatively healthy in terms of its fiber minerals and vitamin contents but it can pack a huge punch fat and sugar-wise so moderation is key a circus of fun to eat so you crinkle on down to the store for post sugar rice crinkles the greatest cereal treat on earth number three yogurt yogurt parfaits as is the case with frozen yogurt regular yogurt varies wildly depending on what kind or brand you buy and how you eat it plain natural yogurt is great and it's a good source of protein calcium vitamins and probiotics however not all yogurt is equal and some of the cheaper options may come loaded with additives flavoring and high sugar content certain types of fruit aren't colorful enough on their own so the factory adds artificial coloring next come two types of sugar fructose and sucrose and forget about yogurt parfaits as these contain fruit syrup and sugar-rich granola the result is a crazy amount of sugar and carbs that all but negate the positive effects of the yogurt itself and will have you crashing within the hour number two skim low-fat milk i see you're drinking one percent is that because you think you're fat because you're not you could be drinking whole if you wanted to like fat-free products skim and low-fat milk purport to be healthy options for those trying to lose weight and stay healthy and some health nuts have vilified full-fat milk as an extravagance that has no place in a healthy diet if you take the fat out of yogurt or dairy what's left sugar yeah right you're turning it into a sugar plus the fats in dairy actually tell your fat cells relax you gotta cover you guys can let go and release some of your stores but be warned regular milk may be healthier for you on the whole than its lower fat counterparts there's only one thing i hate more than lying skim milk which is water that's lying about being milk some science suggests whole milk may ironically be better for a person's overall cholesterol levels even though non-fat milk has less cholesterol plus important vitamins like a d e and k are much more prominent in the full fat variety so perhaps it's best to guzzle an ice cold glass of whole milk to maximize the nutritional value kids at age 12 i weighed 319 pounds i had bad skin low self-esteem and no self-respect now i eat success for breakfast with skim milk before we continue be sure to subscribe to our channel and ring the bell to get notified about our latest videos you'll have the option to be notified for

evil you're the diet coke of evil just one calorie there's a rule of thumb that suggests you shouldn't drink your calories great advice and diet soda is a great option to avoid wasting your daily caloric intake on liquid right wrong while sugar-free diet soda is an option for those with diabetes it's best to be avoided by those of us without the disease because it boasts no redeeming health qualities worse than that these drinks contain tons of additives chemicals and dyes with some studies potentially linking consumption of diet soda to obesity and other issues this is one so-called health food you should avoid [Music] do you agree with our picks check out this other recent clip from watchmojo and be sure to subscribe and ring the bell to be notified about our latest videos", "YMEkefgZI98": "you can pile so much food in those things you know uh i'll run i i won't fill all nine trays with like if i'm doing chili i'll i'll go every other one just just to make sure there's good airflow [Music] what's up everybody uh mark here jimmy to my right across from us virtually once again special guest joey pyburn from outdoor line radio as well as raise bait we were just actually talking fishing and bait and things like that so if you need some bait go to raise uh joey for the listeners who may not have listened to one of your last great podcasts that you did with us i know we did one on packing your backpack um i can i know we did another one as well in there i think somewhere but uh tell them a little bit about yourself what you got going on what you've been up to i'm the owner of ray's bait so we produce fishing bait here in washington and sell it all over washington oregon and california and i co-host the outdoor line radio show which is a local am radio show on saturday morning six to eight o'clock uh here in seattle and where we discover basically whatever's happening in washington fishing hunting wise um and uh tried to promote the sport of hunting and fishing you know um and then i just do a ton of that stuff um i've kind of ended up in a position where um the bait business allows me to be on the water fishing a lot the radio show i kind of have to go out and be experiencing this the stuff uh so that i can talk about it so it's been pretty fun the last couple of years being on the show um with rob and tom and uh you know like i think this year rob and i were trying to figure out you know he's like man you've spent so many days in the in the duck blind how many think you how many days was it and i think we figured out probably 60 days in the duck blind and another maybe 20 days pheasant hunting um this time of the year the bait business is pretty slow so not a lot of whole lot of fishing going on so i'm either sitting around here bugging my wife or i'm out chasing birds and fish so i'll be honest joey a lot of that that sounds pretty torturous i mean uh yeah it's pretty bro what's your name i catch a lot of flack from my buddies who are like do you even work what's your deal yeah i mean i mean what's your mental state like right now you need a vacation uh seriously actually it's pretty good trust me did the duck season on sunday with uh spencer and zach and my buddy james petker it was a great season you know we spent a ton of days together in the blind it's just such a cool uh cool thing to do you know once big game hunting's done so uh i'm a pretty happy dude to be quite honest you know summertime comes and we're really busy but um i get a lot of time off in the fall to to do what i love yeah i i i try to keep up with you on the uh on the old instagram machine and it does appear and you obviously you've alluded to that or not even uh you you were pretty mad at the ducks this year i uh i'm not sure you did well your your freezer is probably doing all right with uh with the old duck meat which is delicious and actually i'm gonna segue myself here jim look at you double segway here double i think i don't know you call we were talking earlier about hey you know season's winding down how do you feel your time well a lot of these seasons that are winding down have left you with some game meat in your freezer that you need to consume there's a lot of ways to do it but even though it's in your freezer there's probably a step that you can take to preserve it even further now what sprung the idea of this podcast and i'll just tell people what we're going to talk about here we're going to talk about dehydrating food or dehydrating meals yes but i got this idea in my head jim so personal story that's a quote from one of jim's favorite uh videos anyway uh i got a wild game admittedly around my house other than myself not the most popular choice right so then i'm left with this wild game i need to do something with it i do eat lunch every day so i got in my head that i could make entire meals utilizing my wild game dehydrate it i'm thinking probably put it in like mason jars then i can bring those jars to work pour water on it boom i've got lunch and i'm not eating all the crappy lunches that i always eat okay that's what i was about to say because you were you you just brought the fact i you said and i quote i do eat lunch and i was thinking in what capacity it depends on what we all call lunch if it's just something that goes in your mouth and eventually into your stomach sometime during the middle of the day then yes you eat lunch if it's something that actually looks pleasant to consume then no you don't eat lunch it's really most of my lunches are exercise and foraging and when i say crappy lunch i'm not saying like i'm eating like uh candy bars for lunch or four monsters it's generally some combination of like nuts cheese a beef stick if you found one yeah a yogurt maybe a banana none of which are refrigerated yeah generally not i generally let it get to room temp and then and then consume it so walk all the way to the fridge it's just extensive you can take all the way down in the morning it's down the hall jim there's work to do then it's already hard yeah anyway so long-winded however i think this plan could work and also maybe i'll even expand that or we can talk about expanding that and then maybe you're going to dehydrate your own backpacking meals or maybe you've got a garden you're like what do i do with all my tomatoes that's what we're going to cover today with joey because he is an expert dehydrator and he also hangs out he's talking about duck hunting with spencer who is an expert at preserving foods in dried form is that good segway it was long but we made it it was long you did the trick a lot of background there yo we found out we found out you're kind of a garbage eater yeah just playing around you'll eat it yeah yeah i mean picture like a carp like swimming along and that's kind of how it is but you know what you're gonna be better off for it when we do finally hit like a full-on apocalypse and everybody else is like uh i can't i can't live with this just scavenging constantly and you'll just think nothing else mark will thrive yeah not only do i have the ability to scavenge but i'll have all these meals prepped already that's right we're good just need some hot water joey give what's what's your what's your background in dehydrating food how did you get started and why well boy i've kind of always dehydrated um in some capacity you know way back uh for christmas one year i got one of those just round um stackable cylinder type dehydrators and um jerky that's kind of where it started just you know you you have all this wild game in the freezer uh and i eat you know a ton of jerky when i'm hunting in all season long in the duck blind all year i always have jerky there's four or five bags of jerky in the in the cupboard right now um so i always had a dehydrator but you know as a young guy it's not like i was cooking a lot um so as i got older uh i started dehydrating you know all my snacks fruit jerky and then then kind of moved into the garden thing where i was growing a garden and you have all this food you make kale chips and you know all this fun stuff you can do with the dehydrator uh and every year buying mountain house to eat in the mountains right um and my so my cousin ryan and i uh we figured it out that we could start dehydrating our own meals and we we both love to cook at this point um so i upgraded to an excalibur uh dehydrator which is a square mine's a 9 tray way more capacity just way better machine temperature control way better big fan and then just start playing around with food man like different stuff and you know you start reading on the internet um and you know what you like from like the mountain house stuff and then obviously off-grid food heather's choice all these companies came along and uh you know you like their chili or you like you know this particular meal and you just try to replicate that um and that was kind of the first thing i did was chili you know i made a big thing of chili it's super easy to dehydrate you spread it out on um the dehydrator it dehydrates quick it rehydrates really quick too everything in there is pretty small um but then you know you can't just eat chili all season long so uh spaghetti um like stroganoff moved into like quinoa stuff um quinoa is awesome it also dehydrates super fast rehydrates really easily um so that just kind of started getting into it and then it just got totally spun out on it and like if i go in my room right now i could bring a toad out here that has 50 dehydrated meals in it you know left over from the season that's awesome are you just dehydrating them whatever you've got going there you come up with some recipe or whatever dehydrate and then you vacuum seal that in a vacuum bag then and then yeah so um like when i i'll usually start my hunting meals in like july uh i have a lot of stuff in the garden at that point um and like i started adding like carrots and kale and way more vegetables into every meal i made right uh beets carrots kale spinach all the stuff that was in my garden if i was making chili it's not just beans and meat it has all that stuff in it right so i'll start in july start you know putting those meals away for when i start hunting in august right and then just kind of throughout the season i'm making meals um so i backpack those i don't know that you necessarily need to um a lot of the meals that you buy off the shelf they're not vacuum packed some are um you can buy the little oxygen absorbers throw them in there i bought a bunch of the actual bags like off-grid would would use you know you can just buy them on amazon um [Music] but at a certain point i have so much of it i'm just take it to the shop backpack it throw it in a tote and it lasts forever man i i started out my season this year eating meals that were from the summer before oh wow yeah nice and then when when you're backpacking it can you are you also rehydrating it and heating it in that bag are you transferring that to something else when you're actually going to use it yeah well so the one thing about dehydrating that's a little bit different than freeze drying is it does take a little bit longer to rehydrate the food okay so the way i do it um now like heather's choice she's dehydrated um you know guys are pouring boiling water right in the bag itself uh sometimes it takes a long time sometimes things don't quite get rehydrated so you have little hard bits of stuff in there meat can be a little tricky so what i do is i have a jetboil minimo and it's kind of the fatter squattier pot and that minimo dials down super i mean it's like you can get it down to like just barely a flame so um i like quite a bit of food like when i get back to my tan i'm hungry i usually eat about two it's two cups of dry food and i usually start with about two cups of water so two cups of water into my jet boil crank it up get it boiling as soon as it's boiling dump the dry food in give it a stir and turn it off and just then you know get my gear ready for the next day mike might make my lunch for the next day um just like anything yep turn it on simmer it again just bring it to where it's simmering uh and then crank it all the way down and let it sit with just a little bit of flame just simmer um and then it gets completely rehydrated right and i'm not i know it's another step but trust me it's not that big of a deal and i think it's a way better meal when you're finally done right there's nothing worse than going to eat and now it's cooled you know in the bag it's cooled down because it's been having to sit there for so long and then there's like little hard things in there so uh that extra step for me is kind of key i like a nice hot meal and i want everything rehydrated properly okay that makes sense nice now i guess this is more of like a backcountry whatever uh sanitation question but now you've got a dirty pot right i mean one of the nice things that's nice about like when you got the bag is you eat the food out of the bag press the air out of the bag put it in your you know little ziploc storage trash bag whatever you got with you and your pot is clean because you just had boiling water in it how are you how are you kind of cleaning that pot every day so you don't have like rotten food and or stinky food for a week yeah so even on a you know whatever 7-10 day hunt i use my jetboil twice a day right i make my breakfast and my coffee um and you know i always have like i pack paper towels with me it takes a half a paper towel in the morning to wipe out my jet boil and the other half the messier meal is obviously your dinner when you're actually cooking chili or spaghetti or something in your jet boil i eat out of my jet boil as soon as i'm done i pour just like a half an inch of water in the bottom of it put it on blast it and let it boil in there and it kind of steams the inside of it and then i roll it around in there dump it out and wipe it out with that other half of the paper towel that's that stuff goes in the bag that my food came out of tuck it up nice and tight and at the end of the you know at the end of the week you have basically seven paper towels they're all shoved inside the bag your food was in it's clean and easy it's not that big of a deal sweet quite the system that is quite the system all the way down to the half paper towel oh dude i've i do enough hunts every year and have been doing this for so long that you just dial everything down like you're like a robot on those hunts everything is the same it's like breakfast coffee hunt all day back you know that meal is so important to you and obviously uh keeping your stuff your you know your jet boil clean um you're living back there dude that's it that's your that's your kitchen that one little thing so it's not that difficult you know think about after a meal with your family you got to go clean the kitchen you have all these dishes you got one little pot it's not i know guys are like good want to do that but it's not that hard and i i just think it makes for a better experience yeah i mean it sounds like you obviously are customizing like a really really good healthy meal um you know everything that's in there you know what you like you can make it what it is you can utilize you know i mean sometimes you don't want to eat chili for a week right so yeah yeah well some maybe sometimes about depends on the chili well i was gonna i was gonna ask joey too when he said you can't eat chili for a week is that something that uh you self-policed or is that something that you were told is that like a challenge no i mean well because i have i have eaten chili for a week my chili is good and i could eat it for a week but i i choose not to just because uh you know i don't want to burn myself out on my delicious chili so it's good um you mix it up you know that's a good point i'm curious if we go back and rewind a little bit to the dehydration process itself now it seems like you can kind of take any good food and dehydrate it somehow um i'm i'm curious too about the difference between dehydrating and freeze drying so there's like a bunch of different things in this but um well actually can you go into that you because you mentioned freeze drying earlier and i am curious now about the difference between dehydrating and freeze drying what what is what is that well so freeze drying uses obviously cold um to suck the moisture out of the food right so the food actually uh it goes in one size it comes out the same size it doesn't actually shrink up so if you've ever like dehydrated like a raisin right that's what a raisin is it's a grape that is dehydrated it um freeze drying doesn't shrink the food so that's one benefit to dehydrating is it actually makes everything smaller so if you're concerned with you know how much room you have in your backpack dehydrating is it's smaller um but as far as like the nutritional value of dehydrated versus freeze-dried i think you know they're they're pretty much the same um and yeah you can pretty much dehydrate anything the one thing that doesn't hold real well would be like stuff that with a lot of fat in it you know oh again yeah i was gonna say like when you're dehydrating like when you buy like a commercial grade dehydrated meal or or a uh uh commercial grade uh uh freeze-dried meal i mean it seems like you know good for the year you know 50 years in the future right when you're doing it yourself what are you generally finding is like kind of that shelf life well like i said i usually have enough meals to get through my whole hunting season and then like right now i i made way too many this year so there's a bunch of them in there um i'll i probably won't have to make nearly as many moving into the the 2021 season um when we go on our bear hunt i'll probably bring a lot of that stuff oh nice just so we have it we can you know burn some of it up but um i don't know i've had meals in there that i've probably they're a year and a half old at least you know yeah if they're back i don't know man i'm sure they're good for 10 years i don't know what would go wrong with them as long as you get all the moisture out that's the key yeah you know if you if you dehydrate something and you you know i'll go out and i'll check it um if you feel it and it's gummy or tacky at all it's not done it's got to be like crispy dried like cereal yeah exactly yeah otherwise it's gonna it's gonna spoil yeah when it like on the machine so you can't because we're on a webcam here you can't see just uh immediately to what would be your right we have a dehydrator here that mr mark got and uh and you alluded to this earlier so he has this square one that's got a bunch of trays on it sounds similar to like what you're using and it's got things like temperature time you know you said you they got this like like a fan in there how are you determining what settings work best with various different foods does it depend on the food that you're dehydrating yeah okay yeah so i mean there there are guys who i think uh prefer to dehydrate the meat separately from the meal so if you were gonna make spaghetti you would cook the meat um [Music] set it aside maybe get it in the dehydrator uh because you're typically gonna run that at like 160 165 the temperature um and and then with something like noodles and tomatoes you would probably run that a little like 135 right i just mix it all together though and it it turns out fine obviously you're running your vegetables probably a little higher so for the first like eight hours i'll put it at 150 kind of in that middle zone right and then crank it up at the end and finish it um but i i've tried the whole do everything separately and uh it's just a pain in the butt and and i don't think you get the flavor in the food right if you just have like beans and meat and chili sauce and then you add it together in in the bag it's just not the same as cooking it all together there's probably some stuff that you want to dehydrate separately from the meal maybe chicken um just you know i don't know the meals that i do i don't have any issues with like the rehydration process with the vegetables that are in the meal being dehydrated at a little higher temperature what would be a couple examples of like your your go-to meals then that you're just you're putting them all together you're making them you're cooking them and then you're hooking them on the dehydrator uh definitely the chili um spaghetti is an easy one everybody knows how to make spaghetti um and then with the spaghetti sometimes like if you're doing chili and spaghetti everything is kind of tomato based that you know maybe you want something a little bit different than that you can make like uh make your spaghetti but just bought you can just go buy like alfredo sauce and put that in there and then you have like you know a different flavor a creamier sauce sometimes with that stuff um you know with a fattier cream-based sauce i'll make sure that like if i want that i'm going to eat it up that month like i'm going to make it and i got two hunts planned and between those two hunts those ten meals are gonna get eaten gotcha gotcha so yeah i mean it sounds like fats are kind of something that can be a little bit a little bit tricky there are there any other things like i mean one thing that i was even surprised to see you see it all the time are eggs in this in this style of meal is that something is that like a freeze dry only can you dehydrate eggs as well you know if you didn't want to make like a breakfast that's a that's a freeze dry thing for for the most part so with a freeze dryer you can you can freeze dry anything you could freeze dry butter you can freeze dry ice cream whatever right it it um for whatever reason doesn't uh affect the fat like and it's because of the heat right you know you're using heat to dehydrate and you're just not going to dehydrate the fat out of the out of the meal but the freeze drying you know you see ice cream bars like freeze you know right mountain house ice cream bars yeah they're just the fruit the cold process is different than the heating process so eggs i've never tried uh spencer you know he he's switched from a freeze dryer to dehydrators now but i i know you had his uh his breakfast scramble like amazing it's not one of my favorite meals they made um but that that was made with the the freeze dryer you could yeah you could serve that meal in the diner and somebody oh that's delicious i would eat it for dinner all the time it was so good i think i actually just have a thing about you know i haven't done obviously any homemade dehydrated meals but i have a thing about like mountain houses and all those i mean sometimes i'm i get excited to be out in the woods or wherever just so i can get to eat those which probably means that i'm not out in the woods enough because i think maybe some people who are more frequently than i am are a little bit like oh i've had enough but i'm always just can't get enough of that stuff um but uh yeah yeah i i used to love the turkey tetrazzini right uh mountain house that one was great stroganoff yes i feel like 10 days of mountain house uh is rough on the gut [Laughter] i yeah i i i agree with that you know um i feel like a lot of folks kind of have like their one dehydrated meal that like used to be their go-to and then they just like you know the thought of like getting that spoon to their mouth is just like i can't do it because yours the teriyaki i still love the tears oh you do well you have one though that i know i remember we had a whole bunch of them and you were like i'm not going to touch those i don't recall which one of that i don't remember what it was either when on our last adventure we had a bunch of uh spencer's though i'm trying to think we had the quail there's a bunch of quail tacos right a couple like uh mexican inspired dishes that were were lovely you know staying on staying on the fat thing so i recently made uh some uh you know it's kind of like a i don't know i've kind of made it up as i probably combined about three different recipes but it was a uh a wild turkey uh curry uh coconut milk peanut sauce with cilantro and things like that but you mean that stuff you've got it right now yeah sitting at room temp over at your desk the toxic green colored concoction that is delicious i'm sure my dog is actually eating right now had some chili oil in it jim all sorts of good stuff anyway though my question is you know i think that coconut milk has like a lot of fat in it so would that act is that like would that act the same as like animal fat then probably gonna be no i was i was just talking to spencer about this because they're gonna you know moving into away from the freeze dryer and buying the he just bought some big dehydrators um i was kind of asking him how the meals are gonna change and yeah some of the meals are gonna change like they probably won't have the mac and cheese because of the fat but the he said but the like the coconut milk seems to dehydrate just fine so yeah you should try you should put it in there and try it you know just dehydrate one little batch can you tell if it didn't work if it's something really fatty if it didn't work just because it's still kind of tacky when it comes out or no it's it's not so much of that it's that uh i think the story you know storing it is where you're gonna have some issues because the fat uh can go rancid you know being you could probably combat that by um you know i've done mac and cheese i've dehydrated it but like i said i i usually eat it up pretty quick you could probably vacuum pack it throw it in the freezer and eliminate that you know pot you know the possibility of it going rancid right oh sure how do you um how do you know when you stick something in the dehydrator i mean how long it's going to go i mean you mentioned earlier eight hours for example on on something um i mean is that is that trial and error is that a little bit like uh you open it up pull it out check it touch it see what it feels like throw it back in if it's not quite ready and then you just sort of eventually know general rule of thumb how long stuff goes or yeah i mean with with meat um which you know if you have meat in your meal and you have uh it's spaghetti well i know that there's a basic guide in there it's like meat could take up to 16 hours right so yeah i usually make the meal like if i'm making dinner i'll make two big batches of chili one for my wife and i and then one to go in the dehydrator right if i'm gonna go through the process of making it i'm gonna go ahead and get some for the dehydrator after dinner i'll go out put it all in the dehydrator turn it on and it's gonna run all night i get up at 4 30 in the morning make a cup of coffee go out and yeah pull the racks out start kind of giving them a little touch test and see where they're at and most of the time for me if i put it in the dehydrator at like nine o'clock at night um by about six o'clock the next morning they're done okay is there a uh can you dehydrate something too long like if you're like trying to err on you know the side of i guess caution or whatever you know like i don't want to under dehydrate but can you like all of a sudden something goes bad because you left it in too long i i don't know i doubt it i mean you might uh you may dehydrate some of the goodness out of it but i don't think so i mean you know you're dehydrating between 120 and 160 degrees right so it's like you know you're not gonna it's not gonna burn yeah that's fair when you um when you're doing veggies uh are those do you have to cook the veggies before dehydrating them so do you have to get them to whatever end eating state you're going to want to have them in when you eat them or can you just basically take a bunch of raw veggies and dehydrate them i get it would seem to me that you cook them first somehow right like steam them or yeah some of them you like stuff that's gonna take a lot longer to cook um like carrots yeah what what guys will do is cut them into whatever size you want to eat them put them in a basket into boiling water and just blanch them two or three minutes right just to kind of soften them up otherwise you're you're basically making like chips um so you know it's going to be way harder to rehydrate something like that that is was was already raw um anything that takes a long time to cook right so maybe broccoli uh carrots you know any of your vegetables that are beets you probably want to blanch them a little bit um most of the vegetables i do like i do beet chips and then you're just slicing them super thin putting them in there and letting them get crispy and you just they're just like chips right uh kale a lot of kale you just that all spray it with a little bit of olive oil sea salt throw it in the dehydrator a couple hours you got kale chips right on jim you're a big fan of the kale chips they're actually not bad yeah i tried them once i was forced into it and and then i realized shortly after i didn't have to get forced they're they're all right i think i had them because you had them and then i liked them yeah they'll do that to you now we've talked about a little bit about these dehydrators and the one we have next to us this is more that that oven style jim you're familiar with the oven this size uh and then i you see those like stackable ones they're like trays but it's stackable and and from what i've seen you know from the uh the youtubing that i've done it seems like they're not well you gotta take a little bit more care and like rotating trays and things like that what what have you seen have you used both styles joey yeah like that that's what i started with was that stackable round um not a lot of capacity right because you're eating you got this round shape and then you have that hole in the middle which is basically forcing air up and and through and but if you have you know if you have a bunch of jerky on the top the air comes up hits that and it's not then re-circulating that well um the the square ones are by far the way to go because there's just constant air circulating around them um and you can you can pile so much food in those things you know uh i'll run i i won't fill all nine trays with like if i'm doing chili i'll i'll go every other one just just to make sure there's good airflow um but like with kale you can load that up or if when i when i do my herbs from the garden you just load that thing up and it's so much stuff you know you can do all your herbs in two loads and you're done for the whole season oh wow yeah and then you know speaking of gardens right like you may not alright this is where i'm picturing it actually uh we'll be moving here in the near future gym so i hope to have a garden i don't have a garden right now but um i imagine there's times where you have you know this abundance of food and and maybe you don't have maybe you're not gonna make all your meals then do you like even in the beginning i was talking about i got i got all these tomatoes do you take tomatoes and just dehydrate just this mass of tomatoes and then plug those in your meals later down the road like hey this one you know instead of maybe doing it together like i got all these tomatoes i'll throw those in then i'll cook this meat and through do you do some separate stuff like that or you know in august if the blackberries are on you're like oh i picked all these blackberries but i don't want i don't want to eat them just in august like let's preserve them well now you have to start canning mark you got to get into i haven't even started dehydrating now i'm on the canning i know and then there's the chamber sealer now and [Music] all these food things you got to get a lot of stuff that is it is like there's definitely some gear well probably for canning i bet that's a little bit more it's it appears to be more gear intensive maybe we'll have to do a canning podcast down the road i think we should we'll have them food preservation series i almost got into candy once and boy that was i was pretty nervous pickling really intrigues me very much anyway that was a side trick a little bit uh so so that's what you're doing with those things then you're canning those things you're not yeah like if you're gonna if you end up with a lot of tomatoes which you usually do right if you're gardening um the best thing to do with tomatoes is candle then you can use them for whatever you want later on and then you don't have to buy canned tomato sauce at the store um the dehydrator is for me anyway uh you know i dehydrate all our apples and fruit and snacks blueberries i've done blackberries um they take forever you know they're basically little balls of water i mean like i don't know 30 hours or something like that but what you with is this little like it's almost like um almost like you know remember like the little berries and captain crunch when you're a kid that's what they end up like these little airy delicious you know crunchy blackberries i bet they're so good they're so good especially if you just get it just the sugar and the the berry you know heck yeah that's interesting i mean i know all these things get smaller but it almost seems like those uh ratio-wise are getting it goes from a thing of what appears in the berry world would be great substance you know maybe not strawberry level but uh yes down to something very very small but flavor flavor packed though oh yeah and strawberries too we grow a ton of strawberries here and they're great in the dehydrator you know anything that when you bite into it when it's fresh and it's already sweet if you dehydrate it it's uh it's ultra sweet there you're just getting all that crappy water just keep doing it um talk through uh talk us through your your jerky making process in the dehydrator as well because i mean a lot of what we were just talking about there was this stuff that you would dehydrate and sort of reconstitute if you will with uh with some hot water but i mean the snacks and you mentioned the chips too but the snacks that you actually intend to eat dehydrated um the jerky one's interesting like what cuts you're using how you're prepping them before they go in and how long they go in other flavors you've done maybe yeah so you know one thing i'm not very good at is i'm kind of um like in the kitchen i just kind of go in there and go to it i'm not a huge recipe guy like i'll use a recipe as a where i start but i'll kind of spin off um in the kitchen so some like i've made jerky that i'm like this is the best jerky in the world i don't like i didn't measure anything i just you know made made the marinade and then uh but i i have just like a basic marinade um that i use and you can find there's so many online uh hank shaw's got a killer cookbook with lots of recipes in it i use a lot of his stuff but as far as cuts of meat when i'm breaking down my elk and deer um i try to keep the jerky pieces as as large as i can you know so i'm trying not to break those big muscles down too small so that i can get like uh a very big piece of jerky like a a big square or a big rectangle um and cut them thin uh and then you know jerky super easy into the marinade overnight out strain off the marinade right in the dehydrator it's like the easiest thing you can do and you can you can get pile up a lot of jerky super fast it's like you know couple days of banging out jerky and i have enough jerky for the whole hunting season are you uh are you cutting it like a certain way with the grain across the grain yeah cross grain yeah yep yeah always just it's just tender that way um this year i did start doing like uh i was cutting maybe one inch like you like you would cut a back strap for a steak maybe a one one and a half inches thick laying that out and then cutting kind of thick strips and i made jerky that way for the first time like bigger chunkier pieces um and they don't get as dry a little bit more like chewy uh that was that was cool too just a little bit different texture you know yeah i mean i think that's definitely cool to mix and mix it up a little bit nice you got a skinny cut you got pub cut crinkle cut it's all potatoes in the end yeah but they do taste different i swear they do they do what about like when you are trying to get that super thin stuff are you just hand cutting that or do you have like a slicer that you like to use yes i have a slicer okay i'll have to add that [Music] you you just get away uh more uniform cut with a slicer and you know it's not like a slicer cost you 500 bucks they're pretty cheap so it's just another cool little gadget you know us hunter guys are all gadget guys so uh even in the kitchen man i have like every little gadget and uh kitchenaid deal anything that makes it easier in the kitchen you're working mark right now mark in his head is online just adding to cart well and i already had a couple you know i brought this baby home the other day and uh i got this one it is i cannot wait i'm ex you have no idea of course i've been talking about this for weeks because my master plan here yep super excited but i did get a what's this i got i kind of got a what's this where where are you putting this when i brought because it's you know there's some oh it's a substantial you mean space from the boss yeah yeah yeah i could see that but once once she sees all these meals that we're making does that is that a countertop piece that stay out i think that'll be probably right on the island if if i had my way yes if i had my way yes i think it'll probably be a cupboard piece but i'm going to be using this i'm going to be using the eyes of a cover i'm going to be using it so much jim it's going to be out all the time anyway i hope you do i'm going to make stuff i'm going to bring it over to you to hype to dehydrate for me hey you'll have one pretty soon jim i'm sure it'll probably happen so one thing we should probably talk about is uh so if you look at your dehydrator right now um it probably has like it has racks and it has a little plastic square perforated sheets right yes so you can't you can't just put your chili on there right right so there's a different options um so they make these cool little silicone mats uh you can get them on amazon and then you put your anything that's wet on there so if you're making like um you know potato bark or sweet potato bark or you want to dehydrate applesauce uh you put it on those silicone mats or you can just go to the grocery store and buy parchment paper and that works really well too i use that a lot okay but at least the mats you can reuse over and over um so i have like four of those and then i use parchment paper also and you just cut the parchment paper to the same size as your mats and uh put your food on and spread it out if you like i guess uh portion wise or whatever like um let's say you made a an average pot of chili i think yeah maybe we can all picture that can you this happens to be i believe i think it's a i think it's a 10 tray will that fit like will you put a whole pot of chili in there in one go no no just because i have before and what you find is like you know when you have that much mass you don't you lose airflow um so like maybe the top one will be will be totally done and then all the outer edges are all dry but then as you get to that middle you kind of then it's it's kind of tacky or wet still um which then you're gonna have to run your machine really long and you're just gonna be able to do it way faster if you kind of spread it out and make sure that there's good airflow in there okay so you wouldn't load would you even do like maybe like four trays or just like pick four trays and how many are you doing at a time i just i just skip skip a rack okay yeah go ahead together that makes sense what um if you're gonna make a meal because like obviously you go from this you know whatever normal cook state to this dehydrated state what would be is like two racks one meal is one rack one meal once it's done so what i did because at first like i would end up with all this dehydrated food and i didn't really know like how much is my portion once once it's dehydrated right yeah so what i started doing the last couple years um especially with that excalibur it's so big i can fit on it one rack i can fit a meal for myself or even maybe a little bit more uh but what i did was um i i measured it out so i just filled my jet boil the first time to the level that i would want to eat um and then measured that out and it comes out to you know about two cups well then i i do two cups at a time of of wet food on the dehydrator and then i know that's a meal that's like a very hearty meal for me do you find that it's always pretty much about um water to food with wet stuff that you're trying to rehydrate is it always basically like a one to one ratio of food to water like even you mentioned applesauce which i found kind of interesting like i wouldn't mind having some applesauce out there but you know i wouldn't always know how much water to add to it unless it's basically yeah well with something like applesauce um i i usually start with a little less water because you can always add more if you get stuff too watery it's you know it's not good with like the meals i always start with about one to one and usually have to add a little bit more water at some point in the process but it's a good place to start for guys okay got it again very similar to my instant rice in fact i do think most instant rice is basically dehydrated cooked rice if i'm not mistaken yeah that's all it is look at that of all this experience already [Laughter] didn't even know it we should have been interviewing you jim with all your instant rice experience i want to get back to the jerky thing though because i think so i think we're talking about some differences between meat and vegetables kind of uh like so meat is typically about that 160 mark for temperatures i think on my dehydrator um and if you look most dehydrators now you know they have a dial and it'll say like um vegetables it'll go right on up the list right and meat is always at the top and i think it's about 165 maybe online gotcha and then is that same program is that taking about you you put it in about nine nine pm and when you get up in the morning you're good to go or longer or that's usually how i do it is um i usually put it in before i go to bed and with the meat with jerky though i've messed it up a couple times where uh you know i wake up and go out there and it's also depending on like what the temperature is because i do mine in the garage um so if it's a war you know warm summer night and you're doing jerky it's gonna it's gonna dehydrate way faster so i've went out there a few times and it's like i have jerky chips you know like just crunchy uh so with that you're not talking me out of it no no and i'll still eat it but it's it's a little you know not everybody wants jerky chips uh meat chips but um someone does [Laughter] yeah probably quite a few quite a few back country hunter guys probably wouldn't mind meat chips um no but uh i'll usually set it for eight hours so you know i go to bed it's about eight hours i i'm up and out there and checking on it and then if it needs to go a little bit longer uh at least i'm not going to overdo it yeah yeah that's probably important to point out you can always you can always go look look at it do a little get a little status check are are you at now are you just looking at it like i've got a window here i can look at it through you know i can i can see what's going on do you want to stay away from actually opening it up because you don't want to stop the process yeah i i just open it up and you know once you've been doing it for a while it's pretty easy to know like okay this is done because it may you know it may feel a little softer um not softer but it like the with jerky especially you might open it up it looks like it's all dry like it's good you feel it and it's feels dry but it's uh it's you know you can it's not firmed up yet right because it's warm that's applied you take it out or and then i'll just turn it off and leave the door open and let it cool down and then it's usually perfect right as it cools down the jerky kind of firms up um yeah it's pretty easy to tell you know when stuff is done that makes sense mark what what is the first recipe you're going to try that please don't tell me it's that toxic looking turkey stuff it's delicious if you were if you were eating who okay if you like thai food like i don't it's like a combination of like thai peanut sauce coconut curry is that the first recipe you're gonna do please tell me it's not you know what it might be now ugh joey told me to experiment with coconut milk why don't you try like uh why don't you try something good that you know everyone likes i'll do it we've been talking about chili maybe i'll do a chili that seems like a good start a good start you could do you i bet it would be real good as you get together a bunch of fajita veggies and taco beef or steak or something and you just do a a big burrito mix dehydrated and then you have some tortillas folded up in your pack and then you just make some dehydrated camp burritos yeah except street tacos why would no no one wants to eat actually you know what street tacos in the woods you only need street tacos on the street right i would i'm i'm all about efficiencies and i don't like to hassle and to have to go through the work of like you know several massive things yeah all right um you talked me out of it into it out of it i'm good at talking people out of tacos for a burrito what about uh the size of things like are you wanting to maybe chop things finer so they dehydrate faster yeah and keep everything uniform you know similar in size um so and then yeah everything is going to be it's going to work better if everything's smaller right not only will it dehydrate but it will rehydrate quicker right if you have big chunks of carrots in there it's going to take a long time to get that thing rehydrated so everything i chop everything pretty small so like i have done the fajita thing right um i've cut my you know i'll take like a chunk of back strap out cut it super thin little thin strips marinate it up cook that and then with your vegetables peppers onions garlic uh i always i just throw kale and everything because it's a good fluff you know add some substance um [Music] you got to cut that stuff up kind of small too but in mix it all together dehydrate it and like jim said man tortillas in the mountains are killer because there everything's in you just throw it on there and oh it's so easy and that's easy it's like getting to eat the bowl ah it is it is it's like a bread bowl of chili but i mean eating uh eating just a bunch of warm delicious food inside of a tortilla is like eating a hug that's and who wouldn't like that golly i'm trying to think if i had any other questions here i mean i think part of it is just going to be diving in and and probably some experimenting some trial and error we'll have to post a picture of your first dehydrated meal on our instagram page yeah i think we've been armed with uh some pretty significant knowledge though here at this point a lot of it is just kind of trial and error um but i mean there's so much information out there now um and you know if with stuff like chili if you're making chili that's like the easiest thing to start with go make a pot of chili and dehydrate five five meals of it and then you and jimmy can have uh chili for lunch dehydrated chili cook-off oh damn a new twist here i was gonna invite you over for my dehydrated chili and you made it a competition naturally okay joey a quick question for you we we said chili so many times here i heard that it's a regional thing um but do you do you put noodles in your chili no no no but like i said i add a bunch of vegetables to it um sure just to make it i don't know more of a meal in the mountains you know yeah the k love carrots in there carrots and kale lots of kale right now and it kind of just disappears in there you don't really even know what's in there but and then uh i cook my chili in a pressure cooker so i can i can make a pot of chili in like you know an hour rip it out yeah great i did hear though that noodles in chile was a regional thing i don't know from what region but well it might be the midwest gem because uh crystal made some chili the other day and it was good it was good chili uh she always puts the noodles in it now i'm not a fan from around here too she's kind of yeah you know wisconsin missouri kind of that you know so she's lived several places in the midwest i think illinois as well um but yeah and that's like something that i've never done or thought about and uh well i wouldn't say it's my number one chili mac mountain house chili mac it's one of their one of the best mountain house meals ever i don't know it's different for some reason when i see that i don't get weirded out but it is dang good yeah special it's all about nuance jim with the noodles in your chili the name the name makes the difference uh any any other parting words of advice inspiration uh for somebody embarking on the dehydration game it's just easy man um i talk to guys all the time and they're like ah it seems like such a pain and it's like well once you start doing it uh it's fun if you like to cook like i do um it's fun you're already cooking it's pretty easy man to throw some extra meals in the dehydrator and uh i don't know mount you know mountain house meals heather's choice you know as much as i love to promote my my buddy spencer's business uh they're not cheap dude and i go through like 50 60 meals a season so uh doesn't mean you know i eat a lot of their meals too but it's a good way to cut some cost and kind of mix it up you know and eat some healthier better food i think you know mm-hmm for sure in in my perfect world jim and i know i talked about my vision earlier but i i i want to see a pantry full of probably mason jars that's what i'm thinking is as you know vacuum you know vacuum chambers mason jars kick and i don't get it well here i'm trying to be i'm trying to you know reduce our footprint on the plastic ocean so i figure i can i can reuse those i can look at my work i can see it in there i can also actually probably tell if it's gone bad if i do something wrong but i have all these meals and they're just sitting there and then i go to work and i'm like oh do i want spaghetti today do i want chili maybe i want the coconut curry wild turkey gem and and i've cooked all these meals with all this wild game that i've worked so hard to get throughout the year and i get to have a meal with it every single day for the listeners out there and for joey i'll provide a little extra color as to why i think this is not going to happen choices you know can we end on joey's positivity that it's not that hard yeah well no no i want i want to hear this it's not that it's he so i have some doubt but not very much that that you enough to bring it up no just a little only a tiny bit but that you would go and dehydrate and i think you could do it i think you could make your wild turkey weird stuff and dehydrate it and turn out all right you'd have all these mason jars you take what would happen is you'd wake up in the morning you'd come to work you'd be in a natural frenzy like always probably grab one of the jars but see the thing is that when you get to work the reason why your food right now is always lukewarm when you finally manage to get to it at lunchtime is because walking to the fridge which is i think probably 80 yards to 100 yards away from your desk maybe that's maybe that's excessive no it's a big building and the fridge is a little bit about 100 yards so walking that distance though in the morning to put your lunch in the fridge is is an excessive amount of time or something for you and usually it ends up just sitting at your desk so how would you then at lunch time get up go to the kitchen boil some water pour your meal in do the stirring bits let it reconstitute and then walk all the way back to your desk to eat it i just don't see it it's a lot of i've never seen you put that much effort into your logic your logic is flawed jim because number one it's just gonna sit at my desk not getting room temperature i often times walk to the break room to eat my lunch anyway so i'm making that one trip that one singular trip this is a time saver and we've got hot well i can microwave hot water we got a hot water machine down there i could probably just put it under the nozzle and pipe it right in what i'm getting is i've just never seen you put nearly that much effort into your lunch in my life which is why you usually granola bars and truck food i do there's so many times that i go uh yeah i'm here and i don't bring a light on just i just don't one reason or not i didn't bring in lunch then i have to go to my truck and you know you hunt all fall you accumulate a certain amount of just truck food and uh you go scavenge the old truck and find some granola bars maybe a cliff bar maybe some some nuts that you had maybe a loose beef jerky behind the rear seat but i don't know i hope for your sake that it does happen but i'm i'm cautiously uh can't you just be happy for me well i can't be happy for you you haven't even used this yet i will be when you finally do sorry joey he did hydrate her at least i mean he's have faith in him he's gonna do it one step in the right direction yeah i need i got the dehydrator there's step one uh step two is washing it out no um but yeah and then just getting apparently 19 other things that i need to get to you know i need to get a slicer now i need to yeah all sorts of stuff list of all the stuff you need there you go that'll come in handy maybe we'll include that in some show notes or something absolutely sweet awesome joey well thank you so much for taking the time to go through this with us we're actually right at an hour jim well done efficient and uh anybody out there if you have questions on this let us

"1Bhk1HIZV6g": "hi i'm monica a dietitian from the western sydney health promotion team this presentation will provide you with some tips and ideas on how to pack a healthy lunchbox and how to support your child to enjoy eating healthy foods to begin let's explore why it's important to pack a healthy lunchbox firstly healthy food gives children energy to focus and learn in the classroom it also provides nutrients for good health growth and development choosing whole grain unprocessed food can provide longer-lasting energy so your child can stay active in the playground and most importantly it helps them set up good eating patterns for the rest of their life learning to like some foods such as vegetables can take time children need plenty of opportunities without adult pressure to build confidence and become familiar with new foods the key to a good lunchbox is variety and balance this plate model is from the australian guide to healthy eating it shows us how much food we need from each of the food groups and this includes vegetables and fruit and the aim is to eat a rainbow of different colors because these protect you against diseases and boost your immune system your body needs a little bit more vegetables than fruit foods such as milk cheese or yogurt which contain calcium for strong bones and teeth proteins such as red meat chicken fish eggs or if you're a vegetarian things such as beans and lentils these are important for muscle strength and of course the breads and cereal based foods as much as possible choose whole grain rather than white as the extra fiber will keep the children's tummies fuller for longer so they're less likely to snack on processed food so when packing your child a healthy lunchbox aim to include one item from each of the food groups this includes a piece of fruit something small and easy to eat and you can even chop it up to make it easier for your child some vegetables something crunchy and colorful such as carrot sticks or a corn cob cherry tomatoes or packing some salad in their sandwich and wrap dairy foods you can pack a plain milk popper or yogurt tub and freeze these in the summer months and then your child will have a cool treat once they get to school breads and cereals you can change it up it doesn't always have to be a sandwich things such as rice or pasta and protein to keep your child's tummy full maybe some meat or chicken egg in a sandwich or you can pack them separately such as baked beans don't forget to pack a bottle of water to drink and an ice brick to keep the food cool and safe to eat you can even use the thermos to keep the food warm you didn't see these foods in the last slide we call these sometimes foods because even though they're tasty and fun to eat they don't have much nutrition in them so children will feel hungry again quite quickly and a hungry child is usually tired and will have difficulty concentrating in class it's best to leave these out of the school lunch box and keep them as an occasional snack even fruit juice it's better to pack your child some water to drink and a piece of fruit which has lots of fiber and goodness in it so if you're thinking what exactly can i pack as a snack well this slide is going to give you some ideas of healthier swaps to give your children for example instead of sugary muffins or biscuits you can pack fruit bread or homemade pikelets you can even include some crunchy sweet vegetables or some fruits such as berries in place of lollies and instead of muesli bars which are very high in sugar even those that contain oats or are labeled as whole grain you can swap for things such as yogurt or fruit and savory biscuits such as shapes can be substituted for crunchy sweet corn cobs or cherry tomatoes and carrot sticks you can swap salty fatty chips for things such as popcorn or whole grain rice cakes with some cottage or ricotta cheese on top and finally instead of these processed cheese dippers which don't actually contain much cheese in them it's better to pack some real cheese such as cheese slices or cheese cubes and some whole grain crackers for your child whenever you're packing the lunchbox or preparing a meal always check that you've included vegetables and the reason is because a recent survey in new south wales has highlighted that while 62 of children in new south wales are eating enough fruit only 5 of children are meeting the 5 serves a day recommendation on this slide we can see what it looks like to have five serves a day you must be thinking wow that's a lot and that's why it's important to include it across the day if we waited until the dinner meal to offer children vegetables it's really unlikely they're going to meet their target so this slide shows you what you can do break it up into each day and break it up into each meal throughout the day the idea is to provide many opportunities for children to try different vegetables in different ways and it's okay if they don't always finish them every little bit counts so start the day with nutritious food swapping sugary cereals such as cocoa pops or nutrigrains or whole grain bread and baked beans and the beans do count towards your child's veggie intake they'll also provide longer lasting energy and keep their tummies full recess is a great opportunity to replace processed snacks with fresh finger foods such as veggie sticks and dip adding some salad to your child's sandwich at lunch is one way to include vegetables and in their afternoon snack children are often coming home from school and they're looking in the cupboard trying to find something delicious to eat because they're hungry so having a healthy snack packed full of protein such as these egg and veggie muffins or zucchini fritters will be a great choice to keep your child full up until dinner time finally provide at least two serves of vegetables to your child at dinner and remember that half a cup of cooked vegetables is equal to one serve so they'll need about a cup or two serves other great breakfast ideas include cheese and tomato toasties for variety you can add spinach or mushrooms and for a middle eastern twist you can serve labne which is a savory yogurt on wholemeal lebanese bread with cucumbers and tomatoes a homemade smoothie is a fun way to add vegetables mix in some spinach leaves with berries bananas and yogurts other great finger foods for children to munch on at recess are corn cobs leftover dinner from the night before such as roasted chickpeas roasted vegetables such as pumpkin or you can get the children involved in the kitchen and make rice paper rolls now while sandwiches are a popular lunch item for children it's okay to make the feelings a little different so they are boring and repetitive the key is always to include a protein source and some vegetables for example monday sandwich can be leftover rose slam or beef with salad tuesday can be egg and lettuce wednesday can be tuna avocado and grated carrot and so on so forth try to avoid packing a sandwich of nutella jam or honey these sugary sandwich fillings will leave your child feeling hungry and tired making it difficult to concentrate in class children love variety so lunchtime doesn't have to be a sandwich leftovers from dinner go great in the lunchbox you can include homemade wholemeal muffin pizzas or veggie fried rice lentil dal pasta or even tabbouleh and leftover chicken breast don't forget to pack a spoon with these dishes so that your child can eat them at school many children's schools provide another opportunity for vegetables and fruit called crunch and sip this is during class time and it is in addition to their recess and lunch break if your child's school includes crunch and sip this is a great social opportunity for children to eat fruits and vegetables with their friends so pack a few small veggies like cherry tomatoes or carrot and capsicum sticks and don't forget to pack a bottle of water as well so finally we're going to wrap up by thinking about ways we can encourage our children to start enjoying healthy eating firstly get your children involved in the kitchen to help prepare their lunchbox and snacks research does show that children who are involved in the kitchen are more likely to eat the food that you provide to them you can also chop up the food into smaller pieces so that it's easier for your child to eat they love finger foods especially in the lunch box thirdly make sure your children see that you enjoy eating food the healthy snacks and drinking water in front of them because after all you are a positive role model for your child and they learn a lot socially so they're more likely to become confident to try new foods if they see others eating and enjoying them too as hard as it can be sometimes try and be positive and patient your child is on a journey of learning and research suggests that it can take 10 to 15 times for a child to see and try a new food before they learn to like it finally introduce a new food at home before packing it in the lunchbox and offer it with another food that they already like for example if your child loves cheese melt the cheese onto a new vegetable that they are trying okay so some final tips to keep in mind don't worry if your child doesn't eat everything the amount of food that your child will eat will vary based on their growth try not to pack too much don't pressure them to eat more than they want and if their lunchbox come home with uneaten foods it's okay don't give up make vegetables a habit in the lunch box in all the meals and the snacks as the more they're exposed to veggies the more they'll learn to love them make sure containers are easy to open and avoid soggy sandwiches by packing things like tomatoes separately and make sure your child can open the lunchbox and the cans and containers very easily finally if your child's school has a school canteen help them to make healthier choices when they're picking foods off the menu thank you for listening to this presentation today i hope you've taken away some great new ideas for your child's lunchbox please check out

fruit kabobs I think these are really really easy to make all you need is fruit of your choice and some kind of stick or skewer to pop the fruit on now where we get to the making we need to wash your

"-tiZBbRuXFo": "hi welcome to working mom village and today we are going to be doing some more food prep because nothing says get healthy like being on a river and we don't know what happened but my face is bumply and I broke out and it was awful and I probably had an allergic reaction which immediately means all my friends and I are now gonna have to eat healthy so one of the easiest ways to do that is with shakes that you just pull out of the freezer so today we're going to be explaining what we do with our shake packs and how to make them we have a variety of different kinds of foods here what's great about shakes is you can can put whatever you have on hand in it so what we have here is kind of spinach and some berry blends honestly kind of clearing out my freezer at the same time which is again another awesome thing to be able to do use a bought fruit that you like bought that you thought your videos that you never did so and speaking of freezers when you have the bananas that are going Brown oh hello look here's frozen brown bananas they will taste lovely in a shake you can do them for any shape any little tiny peices or big also what we have here for those of you doing a keto diet or that need extra fat so that you don't feel like you're going to die from just having a shake this is frozen coconut milk it's full fat organic and you just put it in the ice cube trays and then oh my goodness we can drop it into a shake pack and you have something that will help keep everything cool and give you that little extra bump of fat if that's what you need for like I said keto or just wow that shake lasted fifteen minutes we do have a couple of different fillers here - we've got some protein powders this is a jar of Great Lakes collagen it's wonderful for your skin and it's one of the cheapest per servings that I can find if you want something that's more vegan we do have the Vika protein and and energy courtesy of Costco and then we've got some various other things and what we're gonna do today is just smart sport you pick up your bag you label it and then you fill it with what you want when you walk out of here today you've got a whole bunch of different shake packs that make your morning word for me afternoon after I get home it's so much easier [Music] here we have it gal and bag we're gonna label each of ours and then we're gonna put sandwich bags all the goodies in use a smaller bag if you use the quart bag sometimes I get too much and are putting in spinach we're gonna be making a cherry superfood shake spinach was the base of almost all of these recipes are linked in the description box below and as much as you think you'll need I put a lot of cherries in here here's our superfood packet going in they have wheatgrass but it's also gluten free so you get the grass when it's very young and it doesn't have a gluten in it we're putting Great Lakes collagen in here remember there's a link to that below now I put swerve sweetener in because I really can't do sugar and swerve is the best sweetener we've found but the next one we're making is called chocolate-covered bananas so first you're going to take a frozen banana you can either use a whole or half it really depends on how much smoothie that you're going to want then we add one scoop of that cocoa powder now keep in mind this is not like a hot chocolate mix so you don't want to use a whole lot of it otherwise it will make it kind of bitter again we're adding some of that Great Lakes collagen great for skin and that is it so this was really geared towards our boys obviously they're probably not going to eat a whole lot of the greens and all of that they would probably prefer something a little simpler okay so chocolate raspberry and here we are again starting with the spinach because for the adults we want some greens then put as much of the fruit in as you feel like it needs we put a lot of raspberries into these because raspberry has kind of a fainter more delicate flavor so put a lot in its cocoa powder not hot chocolate mix like we said put it in a little bit get all the air out and there you have it next we have berry blend so again we're starting with that spinach base you can add as much or as little as you'd like I added a cube of that coconut milk that will help you know it a little kick of fat and maybe stick with you a bit longer now I'm adding whole strawberries this is fresh strawberries as well they don't have to be frozen that's just what we had on hand having some of the VGO powder so it's going to give it a little bit of a coffee kick so it's almost kinda like a mocha as well just one scoop of that now chocolate-covered strawberry pretty straightforward again we're gonna start with that spinach base we're gonna add some strawberries to it and then again that cocoa powder what I've been doing when I've been making these is I actually froze them so taken by the freezer I throw it all into my blender and then I add some coconut milk I just have like an unsweetened coconut milk and then I also add some honey to give a little bit of that sweetness again we don't have a whole lot of sugar in it we were trying to be mindful of that I also added some cinnamon to some of them and that really helped with the sweetness as well and give it a little bit of a different twist onto our next one there's our spinach base for Barry baobab the battle Bob tree has these weird little fruits that I found a package of dried and made into a powder they are so nutrient dense so it's a very good thing it adds a little bit of sweetness when you're making these also if it's just kind of bland and you've added everything you possibly can put some salt in them we just salted caramel so when you're making it if it doesn't taste right a little salt on it and stir it up again next we have banana berry again pretty straightforward start with that spinach base we're gonna add some frozen mixed berries we're gonna add a banana it depends on how much banana flavor you want as to how much banana you added I think I added about a half of a banana and then again some of that great lakes collagen that's gonna make your skin like oh so very good remember we're gonna have the recipes down below but these are not set in stone these are ideas please use what's in your freezer we have a cherry blueberry now straightforward once again and start with whatever your green base is we'll use spinach put your berries into this put in some kind of a protein powder because that will make it stick with you longer if you need an extra kick put some kind of a fat in you can also use avocados we didn't do that in this one but you could so the protein mixes make sure it's something that is going to mix well with all of the berries if you've ever used a protein in the past that didn't do well you know what I'm talking about next one we have is mocha berry two ways so the first thing we're going to do is again add that spinach base we're gonna add our berry blend and then we added Vica protein which has a little bit of a coffee flavor to it so it'll give a little bit of a mocha taste another option that you could do with these is you could also make them nut free so they said I use almond milk but you could always use soy milk or something like that that avocados probably going to be your best bet for that extra kick of fat oops all berries if you do one with all berries and then you put your protein powder and maybe your coconut and that's fine too the next one we have is cherry mocha so again we're starting with that spinach base we're gonna add some cherries and then again that coffee flavoring really nice about this set we took very few ingredients and we're able to make a whole bunch of different combinations I think we have something like eleven combinations here but you could have done anything that you wanted we also were able to get this completed in one hour so we ended up with about 40 bags of these and we got that done in an hour so that's 40 potential breakfast 40 snacks for tea after workout kicks whatever you want to call it in a very short period of time which again brings us home to the whole working together we were able to get that many done because it was two of us sharing the work being able to be more efficient about it label each individual one make sure you get all the air out put them in a bigger freezer proof bag and then all you have to do is pull one out at a time we hope that we have inspired you guys and help do some ideas on how you can make

[Music]", "RMMPh7ZfEaQ": "Making jam is easier than you think. I'm going to show you\nhow to make mixed berry jam and share a few tips\nalong the way. Once you've got the basics,\nyou'll be ready to whip up your own tasty jams to share with family and friends. To get started, juice a lemon\nand reserve all the seeds. Lemon seeds contain pectin and this is the magic ingredient\nthat helps set the jam. Tuck the seeds inside\na small square of muslin and tie them with kitchen string\nto secure. You'll need a third of\na cup of lemon juice. You may need to juice another\nhalf of a lemon if necessary. Next, put the fruit in a large,\nheavy-based saucepan. I'm using a mixture of\nblackberries, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries. If you'd rather use\none type of berry, that's fine. You just need a kilo of fruit\nto a kilo of sugar. Pour the sugar into the pan. And then add the lemon juice and the lemon seeds and give it a good stir, then leave it for 30 minutes\nbefore cooking. If you don't do this,\nthe undissolved sugar can burn on the base of the pan when you put it over the heat. As you can see, the berries\nhave released their juices, so it's time to start cooking the jam\nover a low heat. Keep stirring occasionally\nfor 10 minutes or until the sugar dissolves. This is a good time\nto pop a saucer into the freezer so it'll be cold enough\nwhen you're ready to test the jam. Once the sugar is dissolved, turn the heat up to high\nand bring it up to the boil. Then reduce the heat to medium and leave it to simmer\nfor 15-20 minutes. Make sure you stir it occasionally so the mixture doesn't catch\non the base. Try and skim off\nany of the frothy scum that forms on the top of the jam, 'cause it will discolour\nthe finished product. Here's an important tip. Sterilising your jars and lids means you can safely\nstore the unopened jam in the pantry for up to six months. Take three 375-mil jars and put them and the lids\nin a deep saucepan. Cover with cold water. Then bring to the boil\nover a medium heat. When the water is boiling, cover the\npan and reduce the heat to low. Let it boil gently for 10 minutes to kill any bacteria. Turn off the heat, then carefully\nremove the jars with tongs and place them upside down\non a clean tea towel. Do the same with the lids. Here's how to test the jam\nhas reached setting point. Take the saucer from the freezer and remove the jam from the heat. Spoon a small amount of jam\nonto the saucer and put it back in the freezer\nfor one minute. Then run your finger through the jam. If it wrinkles and gels,\njust like this, it's ready. If it doesn't, simmer the jam\nfor another five minutes and test it again. Once the jam's ready,\nstir in the vanilla bean paste. Grab some tongs and pull out\nthe parcel of lemon seeds. Vanilla goes well with the berries, but experiment with\nadding other flavours to your jam. You could try adding woody herbs\nsuch as rosemary or thyme or some whole spices\nto give your jam an aromatic flavour. Just wrap them in muslin\nlike the lemon seeds so they can be removed easily. Before you spoon the hot jam\ninto the warm jars, take a large metal spoon and just remove any scum\nfrom the surface of the jam. Then carefully fill\neach jar with jam... ..and seal with a lid. The last step is\nto turn the jars upside down for two minutes. This creates an airtight seal\nto help preserve the jams. Then turn them upright\nand let them cool completely. This mixed berry jam is\ndelicious on fresh bread. Store unopened jam in the pantry\nfor up to six months and pop in the fridge after opening. For the full recipe,\nsee the description below.

please go ahead and click that subscribe button I'd love to have you stick around and see all the other videos I put out and I'd love to get to know you so introduce yourself in the comments but anyway today I wanted to share a little bit of a grocery haul with you it's been a long time since I've done one of these but there's this local place that I go to that gets things like overstock and things that are nearing expiration dates and unclaimed Freight when it comes to groceries they just have all these different resources they get food from in different things and they're able to sell it to you at a very discounted price and so you never know what you're gonna find there it's always a little bit of a surprise you can't really like meal plan and go in there and do your grocery shopping but most times I go in there I leave just like so happy with the things that I found and it's a really great place to go to I've learned for snacks and treats and a good place to like try things that you've never heard of before and all the cheap so you're not spending a ton of money to try something new if you don't know if you're gonna enjoy it you know so yeah I just really like this place any time I post a haul from a visit to this store I always get people asking what stories that but unless you're local to me you can't really shop at it yeah I'll leave a link down below though where you can see if there is a similar type of like discount or salvage grocery store near you but anyway let's go ahead and hop into the video and I'll share my cheap grocery haul with you excuse a compost bin but here is quick look at everything that I got from the store today let's start over here as I mentioned this store is a great place to find little snacks and all the things like this you might usually find it like Whole Foods or sprouts or something like that for super cheap it's a little bit cleaner ingredients and you'll find like conventional snacks as well and this is Coco Rooms chewy cookie bites and salted caramel they're only nights so I'm excited to episodes of these special treat for me I told you things get random to you so they also had some treats from a dog every day she takes like a little joint health treat and these were a dollar twenty nine each or a case of six for seven dollars so I went ahead and just bought a case because she takes one of these every single day like I said and I did see a difference when she's taking something like that thing me and her dog treats this one was pretty good ingredients I also got some sky valley sriracha sauce it's made with organic ingredients and stuff a lot cleaner than some other stretches that I've seen out there and I love sera chests so I'm excited about that I saw this to pair with something you're gonna see in a minute it's the classic Oh reserva eggplant and artichoke pasta sauce that was only a dollar ninety-nine and it sounded delicious like absolutely delicious so I'm excited to try that over here this is Alaskan Pollock wild-caught for a dollar ninety-nine a pound and so I'm not even sure I've ever prepared Pollock in my own home but for that price I figured you know what that is there for 20 you see this that is like that is crazy so I figured we'd give it a shot if you have a good recipe for Alaskan Pollock let me know in the comments down below I'd love to hear from you I might even just add some like Mexican seasonings and you like taco bowls I'm gonna do like fish taco bowls we'll see but I thought that's a really good price for - so I went ahead and picked it up back here a little bit more of a treat for my girls they love these fake bars and it's a pack of 12 for only $2.99 and they're twin pack so there's two in each pack and I typically only let them each have one from each pack cause it's just a little too much sugar for my liking if not earth eat both of them so that'll be special things since they were $2.99 each I got two packs cuz that's a really really good price you can find like five packs for like more than three dollars click target so to get to twelve pack for three dollars with this deal this is also another tremendous steal one of my subscribers actually that's me um obtaining the frizz I don't know if it would see you let me know in the comments method recommended this simple Mills brand and right after she mentioned it I started noticing it everywhere and essentially makes products that are pretty much paleo ingredients which is pretty much how I eat so these crackers release tonio incense a box I've never tried them but that everything sprouted seed crackers but this is a terrific price I love the almond flour crackers you can get for the same brand that I get at Costco and it's like nine dollars for like a box that's maybe two or three times the size of this is seventy nine cents for this giant thing and I actually think they're two for a dollar fifty yeah I thought that was phenomenal and worth trying so I'm excited to try those then back here I got one of them out to show you but my girls will love these things they carried them maybe like a month and a half ago or so and I've got them maybe two months and there was only one box at the time and my girl just gobbled them up through these real fruit bites and strawberry and so it's a pack of I think six or eight I don't remember but they're just made from purees and fruit juices and so they're essentially like a healthy fruit snacks no added sugar or anything like that so they're gonna be excited about these I saw three boxes sorry bought three I know that they will get eaten another random thing I always notice that they have different sauces and stuffs it's a great way to try sauces on the cheap so this is Frank V's kitchen orange label habanero hot sauce and this was only 99 cents and it's organic so I was all over that because we love hot wings and so I make homemade hot wings semi-regularly and I thought this would be a fun flavor to try on our hot wings I'll probably do that in the next couple days that way if everybody really likes it maybe I'll go back and get more because we love hot wings in this family I also got a couple different sauces I got the Mateos gourmet salsa I typically get that from Costco but it worked out cheaper per ounce um here I believe it was two for three dollars for salsa so I got one nose and then and you want to try out and what does it say it Scooby's hot avocado tomatillo salsa and this is actually like made specifically for a restaurant so sometimes this store gets like restaurant overstock and so I think that might have been what happened with the fish as well since it was like packaged differently but I thought avocado tomatillo salsa sounded real delicious I thought eggs would be really good so I got that here's another treat back here for the girls these complete cookies have 16 grams of protein and so it's a way for them to get you know a sweet treat that they like while also getting a little bit of added protein makes me feel a little bit better about it and then it doesn't have all these things in it they are not gluten free but there is lots of fiber in it no dairy no egg no so a non GMO vegan if you have any of those things this is a good brain to look at when you want a little special treat so I got two peanut butter chocolate chip and what is flavors that birthday cake these I can typically get on sale 3 for $5 at sprouts so it really is a special treat this box of 12 was $4.99 so I got two boxes the lastest a long times it's not something they super regularly but every Friday night at our house is dessert night so that'll be a dessert option for them over here I got a spaghetti squash every single Saturday they do like this whole like produce market with all sorts of produce but during the week sometimes they get things into and this week they had spaghetti squash it was only 39 cents a pound I forget how much I paid for this total but it was real cheap and so gonna pair that with this sauce I showed you a minute ago these are plantains I love cooking plantains in some ghee and cooking oil and putting a little cinnamon on em maybe just a little bit of honey oh it's such a good delicious treat that's kind of guilt-free so I thought they were 29 cents each or for $4 so I got four but then when I went up they were 29 cents a pound so the four of these it was 84 cents so phenomenal deal again plums on were eight for a dollar and my girls have been obsessed with plums lately so I got eight they're gonna so excited when they get to school today so I don't drink cow's milk again but my girls do so I always try to buy organic that's one of the things that I really try to stick to my guns with and buy organic and when I can get it for a dollar ninety-nine for a half gallon I'm all over that so I got three half gallons of milk actually just bought two gallons the other day too so I'm gonna have to freeze some of those because they have a longer expiration date I don't know what I'm gonna be showing this it's didn't were the expiration date you're saying that like after that anyway I also got this for me I've never actually tried any kind of like dairy-free yogurt but I saw this it's an almond milk yogurt and explained Minette sweetened I've seen ones there before that either cash or almond but they were always like sweetened so I like that this was unsweetened so I can add my own honey and fruit or whatever I want to do to it so it was only 59 cents so I thought for that price I would try it and down here a little special things for the girls some juice boxes if we're like going out and about and we're packing a lunch or something like that sometimes those are fun or sometimes I'll surprise my younger - I'm packing in there lunch for preschool and they come home all excited because usually expect them water so the dollar ninety-nine for eight boxes of organic juice percent mixed berry and it's got the baby bears on it super cool this is one of those like very serendipitous finds because I have been doing some research about doing the liver cleanse and I have seriously been looking at this exact Liberty talks online thinking about purchasing it and I found it in store today and is marked for $2.99 but all that is something always put a slash through so it's half off whatever it's marked I don't know why the video I don't know what know why they just don't Marga what they're actually selling it for but I got it for 750 and it's a lot more and instead of Thursday typically so I'm really excited to try this if you guys would like to see a review on this let me know I think I'm gonna do like a liver cleanse diet along with it nothing like super duper duper extreme but I've just been doing a lot of research about the benefits of detoxing your liver and I you know since I was either pregnant or breastfeeding for like five to five years of my life and that just changed over the summer I haven't done a whole lot of cleansing so I'm excited to try this yeah let me know if you want to review on that then back here I got some algebra juice and so we're I'm very into like homeopathic living hands delight treating illnesses and stuff and so elderberry is great for immunity and it was 399 for this bottle so I thought I'd get that to keep on hand they always have a ton of homeopathic medicines there but I'm pretty much sucked up from all my other trips there I'm all sorts of things from Highlands and czar B's and just all sorts of amazing things so we're pretty stock to the moment thanks I didn't have any of this on hand along those same lines of kind of homeopathic medicine and things like that anytime I can find like a natural alternative to something I always try to use it first and see if that works so T is an easy way to incorporate that kind of stuff so this one's just for flavor but the other three I got for something else so this is a smooth move chamomile tea to relieve occasional constipation so it happened sometime shots so I buy that too heavily and it'll be needed at some point so in that way the sex it's a good brand traditional medicinals so tea was all 2 for $3 and this would probably be in the 5 to 6 dollar range at the grocery store I also got organic ginger tea ginger is good for like tummy aches and things of that nature so I thought that would be good to have on hand for that and then I got roasted dandelion right I'm actually going to be doing I guess kind of an experiment but there's a strength that you make that has this in it and a couple other ingredients and you drink it for a week and it's supposed to be very cleansing so another thing that I needed to buy that just so happened to be there I really have that kind of like you can never predict what you're gonna find I wasn't not thinking I would find this there but I was excited to find that there's an historic and this is another like five or six dollar product typically and then I got this organic India Tulsi red chime is solid tea and it's caffeine free so it's not actually chai and I love chai and it's anytime I can find like a try substitute though it's been awesome because China's caffeinated I don't drink caffeine so this is it's stress relieving and revitalizing it sounded really good from the ingredients so I thought this would be neat to see if I could make a mock chai with so I'm excited to try that and then back here I actually am completely out of coconut milk and it's something that I always always always like to heat stocked in my pantry and so I typically buy from Trader Joe's it's 30 cents cheaper actually this was one thing that was more expensive than I would simply buy but at the same time it was only a dollar a dollar ninety-nine a can and I think I've seen this flick over $3 in sprouts so still a really good deal when you compare it but I figured you know I'm gonna save 60 cents buying two cans at Trader Joe's but I don't really have any other reason to go to Trader Joe's right now they don't go there super often so might as well get a couple fans now I was there and I was thinking about it I was about to wrap up the video and then I realized I forgot to mention one of the most random things and that was toilet bowl cleaner by the brand better life it says naturally thrown tidying between the pole cleaner so it's essentially you know just important non-toxic one and it says it was $2.99 but they actually rang it up a dollar 59 so sure I'll take it so toilet bowl cleaner another thing everybody needs so I'm gonna head and pick it up let me know in the comments below what you think my best deal of the day was I definitely think I got some really awesome steals today so I'm super excited about my little haul today if you enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up so I know to make more videos like this in the future and again if you want to see more from me please do click

all believe this right now i'm genuinely shocked dude nature's very if you don't i i've never experienced anything like this so i think everyone should experience this at least once hey guys it's ellie and today we're going to be doing something a little different than our normal scheduled programming um we're going to be doing a food video which unlike my meat well i guess it's not that different like i did a whole music video about eating pancakes but today um we're going to be highlighting nature's wild berry uh it was sent to me by hank over at nature's wild berry so thank you hank i'm very excited i don't know if you can see this oh oh oh there she is i think um anyways so um i'm going to eat two halves of this berry if i'm doing the the instructions correctly i'm gonna eat two halves of these berries and in about 20 minutes sour foods should taste sweet we all know how much i like sweets so i've gathered sours foods i could find at my local grocery store sour patch kids warheads sours extreme and you know just going all natural we've got a nice lime so i don't know anybody who just eats limes on their own but i've seen a lot of people do it after eating one of these berries that being said i'm gonna tear into my pack the instructions say remove both halves of the berry from the package and place into your mouth please recycle back thank you so much i will do that so and then it says chew for 30 seconds moving the berry around your mouth swallow berry and enjoy the new sweet taste you get from sour foods oh it also doesn't take 20 minutes oh god okay well it lasts 20 minutes so there we have that so actually in 30 seconds so before i eat this i'm gonna go get a knife for my lime and then we're gonna we're gonna eat it all right berries i'm supposed to chew it for like 30 seconds and there's not really much left too i think that's 30 seconds i'm really scared i'm really scared about what this is about to do to my taste buds okay starting first we have sour patch kids i feel like this souris sour most sour sour patch kid is probably the green one right because like sour apples so let's try this one i was insane not sour at all it's so sweet i'm like blown away normally how sour these are at least first contact i'm always like oh that is so sweet okay oh i feel like that was um that was some kitty so here we go now we're moving on to extreme sour minis warheads um i don't eat warheads i get really scared of warheads they're very sour got a little purple one i feel like i should be making his face but i'm not that was so sweet it tastes like a like a sweet tart i mean obviously there's like a little bit of tang but this is blowing my mind like my actual taste buds i really think these are supposed to like mess you up when they're not doing that even in the slightest oh literally the warning label on the side of this says eating multiple pieces within a short time period may cause a temporary irritation to sensitive tongues and mouth so you know this is supposed to be very sour when in fact it's not all right i'm really excited about this lime situation this is super cool everything is so sweet in my mouth like i just have this like sugar-coated mouth right now okay so we have our lime that's the last thing we're gonna do oh my gosh here we go okay okay forget the candy this doing this with the berry by far oh my god i could eat this i could literally eat this i've never done this in my life like i'm always the one to be like like making the most faces i'm digging my teeth into this this is just gonna be a video of me eating a lime unbelievable like like i said there's still like moments of tang like you know it's there but in no way does it make you want to like puck over your mouth or oh my god i just want to eat this lime all day i'm just like i think my body's reacting to the fact that i'm just casually eating a lime but my tongue is like please give me more of this sweet sugar thank you so much to hank over at nature's wild berries if you guys want to experience something like this i'd love to see your videos if you just like eating a lime like me out of everything try it with natural foods maybe a lemon a lime anything that you can find at sour i think probably pairs well because the berry is actually from nature a ladyberry so yeah i mean there's nothing on it it's a literal berry so if you have the chance to try this i think this is an experience that everybody should have i'm gonna go continue to eat this lime but if you want to go see more videos of me eating food you can either check out the stomach music video or you can leave me a comment saying hey i love watching you eat for some reason so keep doing that i guess but anyways cheers thank you again to nature's wild berry and i'll see you guys soon bye you guys want to try one of these no i absolutely do oh my god please i got the rip oh my god the berries for sure wearing off well i just ate an entire half of a lime", "sXEXrij7OTU": "good morning it's a really beautiful\u00a0\nweekend day today so i'm gonna make pancakes\u00a0\u00a0 as per usual and it's pretty simple\u00a0\nstuff so let's get straight into it\u00a0\u00a0 so that's where i start my\u00a0\nday i just prepare everything\u00a0\u00a0 so that's all you'll need it's pretty\u00a0\nsimple stuff as long as you have the\u00a0\u00a0 pancake mix i use the japanese one but i'm\u00a0\npretty sure by now you can find it online as well\u00a0\u00a0 and my secret is just doing 50 milk so 50\u00a0\nmilliliters milk and 50 milliliters water\u00a0\u00a0 and yeah just making it creamy like\u00a0\nthis and getting started on the pancakes and now it's my favorite part oh my gosh\u00a0\nlook at it it's just perfect the way it rises\u00a0\u00a0 yeah but it's just normal pancake stuff i'm pretty\u00a0\nsure you know how it's done so just repeat as many\u00a0\u00a0 times as you like then i just add some berries\u00a0\nor any fruit and of course some oj in the morning\u00a0\u00a0 as it needs to be done and there we go just top it\u00a0\noff with some honey i usually use agave but i've\u00a0\u00a0 run out of that so honey it is and that's my usual\u00a0\nbreakfast for the weekend yum who else eats their\u00a0\u00a0 breakfast or their pancakes like this not using\u00a0\nthe whole stack but taking one off let me know usually in the morning then i go on to make\u00a0\nmyself some hot lemon and ginger using this\u00a0\u00a0 very large slice of ginger honestly the\u00a0\nbiggest one i've ever seen very lucky usually i use about half a lemon per cup but\u00a0\nhonestly if i'm feeling a bit under the weather i\u00a0\u00a0 can use a whole wonder glass as well just because\u00a0\nit's so tasty just add hot water and you're done\u00a0\u00a0 all right lunch time i'm gonna be making my usual\u00a0\nsalad which i have dubbed the tokyo salad because\u00a0\u00a0 i've always had it there it's really good and the\u00a0\nsecret is that you just dump everything in it that\u00a0\u00a0 you like in terms of vegetables what i also put\u00a0\nin potatoes or vegetables but you know what i mean\u00a0\u00a0 and some sort of protein sauce\u00a0\nso today i'm going to do eggs\u00a0\u00a0 let's do it it's me again voice over sophie\u00a0\nso now that we're at lunch this is all we need\u00a0\u00a0 again um pretty minimal ingredients i'd say just\u00a0\nchoose anything that you like to put in a salad\u00a0\u00a0 and get it ready and don't forget to\u00a0\nboil your potatoes and your eggs as well frankie's helping me make lunch\u00a0\naren't you thank you thank you back to chopping just starting with the letters\u00a0\nand then i'm moving on to everything else\u00a0\u00a0 i'm still not quite used to the big cucumbers\u00a0\nhere i kind of miss the smaller size in japan\u00a0\u00a0 because they were much easier to cut but\u00a0\ni'm just gonna go forward and cut them\u00a0\u00a0 into smaller pieces like so after\u00a0\ni've stacked them into a towel of pisa and then carrots i think everyone does differently\u00a0\nusually i use like a grater but i don't have one\u00a0\u00a0 of those right now so i'm just going to slice them\u00a0\nup like i would for ramen just put everything in\u00a0\u00a0 your salad bowl now and you're almost done just\u00a0\ndo the last veggies like my tomatoes honestly\u00a0\u00a0 sweet corn is very good as well if you don't like\u00a0\ntomatoes and then move on to your potatoes which\u00a0\u00a0 should be cooled a little bit slice them into\u00a0\nsmaller bits and get them ready for the pan i forgot to show it here but i also usually add\u00a0\nsome garlic powder to my potatoes which is so good i also quickly wanted to say that i make this\u00a0\nsalad in advance because it's a lot of chopping\u00a0\u00a0 stuff so you can just chop everything put it in\u00a0\nthe fridge have it the next day or in the evening\u00a0\u00a0 whenever so you don't have to do it all again but\u00a0\nit's so convenient to just have it there and have\u00a0\u00a0 a healthy meal at the ready and finally i just\u00a0\nadd some seed mix and that's all that's my salad\u00a0\u00a0 that's what i usually have for lunch it is massive\u00a0\ncan you tell sometimes i can't finish it then i\u00a0\u00a0 leave it as a snack but i do often finish it as\u00a0\nwell because i'm very hungry at lunch obviously and this is us waiting for boba yay what a\u00a0\nblessing ah it's not my favorite shop because that\u00a0\u00a0 one's in chinatown and i can't get there right now\u00a0\nbecause of lockdown but it's very delicious anyway\u00a0\u00a0 and this is frankly judging me sometime\u00a0\nlater in the afternoon or in the evening i\u00a0\u00a0 usually have some fruit bowls or grapes\u00a0\ntoday and this is frankly showing you\u00a0\u00a0 what i did the rest of the afternoon\u00a0\nexactly this with some netflix as well wow it's already the evening this\u00a0\nday has flown by but it's so simple\u00a0\u00a0 this is my favorite recipe right now i\u00a0\nlove this i want to eat it every single day\u00a0\u00a0 you just need some garlic and no two eggs\u00a0\npancetta and some pasta of your choice look at me being a responsible\u00a0\nhuman and weighing my pasta\u00a0\u00a0 i used 120 grams for two people and\u00a0\nthat is the perfect portion size and after you've cracked your eggs add some\u00a0\nsalt and pepper and that's just to your liking\u00a0\u00a0 whisk it up a little bit and\u00a0\nthen add the pasta to the boiling water add your

episode three of the fat loss series where we do our best to get in the best shape possible today we will be doing an epic meal prep to help you reach your goals we will be preparing all the meals for Monday through Friday this will save you money time it includes tasty and extremely nutritious meals I follow a plant-based diet but this can easily be used for those who eat meat too especially if you're on a budget I knew those something wrong with this guy hippie ass tree hugger nice try unsung during this meal prep the calories that I will be aiming for our 2600 calories with a macro ratio of 60 20 20 I will be preparing three meals for every day which includes oatmeal a burrito bowl and a curry number one is going to be overnight oats the ingredients you'll be needing will be 500 grams of bananas that come to $1 10 remember the prices may differ depending on where you live next up will be 500 grams of oats which is actually the food of the highest amount of manganese and it is very high in protein zinc and fiber if you don't eat oatmeal you're missing out next 500 grams of frozen berries this is key you can use fresh but frozen are usually cheaper these are low calorie and very very tasty this increases the volume of the meal making you fuller for longer and of course gives you a huge antioxidant boost next is 75 grams of protein powder you can use any protein that you want I'm using depo perform the healthiest protein out there which is why I'm working with them this gives you a BCAA boost this protein particular also includes turmeric spirulina and iodine and by the way if you are interested in trying this one out check out the link in the description box and use the code jv5 for discount moving on hundred grams of flax seeds this is the food with the highest concentration of omega-3 this comes to 2.64 the hundred grams we're going to use the last ingredient is one liter of soy milk this actually has 75% more antioxidants than cow's milk it is very high in protein calcium vitamin D and b12 and no in case you're wondering soy does not lower your testosterone or increase estrogen so the first thing we're gonna do is divide the 500 grams both into five separate jars you can also use tough words if you don't have jars next we weigh out the twenty gram of flax seeds for each day and add that to the jar too then we do the same without protein powder 15 grams in each jar then we just mix it up with a spoon or whatever until it's evenly spread now you take the 500 grams of banana that you bought and mash them up this is extremely important if you want your oatmeal to taste good as it will become much sweeter this way then again divide equally in each jar now again the 500 grams of frozen berries also evenly distributed in each jar and lastly pour 200 milliliters of soy milk into a measuring cup and then at hundred milliliters of water on top of it and put it into the jar that you will be using the next morning and mix leave the rest of the jars dry and pour the liquid the night before use when you wake up you can easily grab it from the fridge throw in your backpack and get ready for school or work and that's it for breakfast this will keep you full and energized for hours the total calories are 694 calories 102 grams of carbs 19 grams of fat and 36 grams of protein after a few hours it's time for lunch the ingredients you will need to make the fiber eatable meals are 500 grams of red bell pepper which by the way is the highest food in vitamin C it's also high in folate vitamin A and E and tastes delicious then you'll need 1 kilogram of broccoli this is extremely important for fat loss as it will add huge amounts of volume without adding the calories feel free to use as much of it as you like broccoli is very anti-inflammatory and actually a good source of omega-3 next up 500 grams of cabbage full of polyphenols which promotes healthy digestion and fights off cancer cells and for all use supplement fiends yes it even contains l-glutamine then we got 500 grams of onion high in biotin manganese and copper I'm addicted to onions it makes everything taste a million times better and then we got some salsa 500 grams which was 2 jars in this case make sure to get one without added sugars next up 250 grams of sweet corn which is high in protein beta carotene and pantothenic acid which supports energy production and metabolism now the main star of the dish 1.5 kilograms of pinto beans these are cooked if you want to save more money buy them raw and cook them yourself these are very high in protein foliate iron and much more next is 400 grams of brown rice if you are into the bodybuilding and fitness scene I'm sure you have your fair share of this but in this meal it tastes amazing brown rice is high in selenium manganese diamond and niacin okay so first we will chop up the onions and peppers that will be stir-fried and then move on to the broccoli which I recommend eating raw or lightly steaming throw the onions and the pepper on a pan do not use oil to fry them just add enough water and at the same time steam the broccoli until it reaches the consistency of your choice in the meantime start preparing the rice way out to 400 grams this is optional but I love adding some garlic in there too when the water is boiling add the rice in make sure the water level is just above the rice and let it cook on minimal heat for about 20 minutes while the rice is cooking chop up the cabbage and put it aside for later use after that take out the 1.5 kilograms of beans from the jar rinse them until all bubbles go away make sure to do this or you will have fireworks coming out of your ass put the beans in a bowl and get ready to season them with spices of your choice I use cumin paprika and black pepper so the rice should be done by now get the Tupperware out and evenly distribute everything into each one it doesn't have to be perfect just eyeball it and boom epic lunch for the entire week is prepped this can easily be brought along with you anywhere without spillage risk as there is no liquids in there the total price of each burrito bowl lunch comes to two dollars and 75 cents calories are 932 with 181 grams of carbs 6 grams of fat and 45 grams of protein yes this is a very low fat meal so we will be increasing the fat intake at dinner many hours later it's dinner time we will now be preparing a curry the ingredients will be 1250 grams of sweet potatoes I am a big advocate of these and I think that everyone should have it as a staple it is a food with the highest amount of vitamin A it's high in B vitamins beta carotene and loads of antioxidants if you're not a fan use white potatoes instead next up one kilogram of chopped tomatoes this is very high in vitamin K and C and lycopene and again more onions we're using 500 grams again it will make everything taste better so make sure to use it next up will be 50 grams of red chili pepper use more if you like very spicy food chili increases thermogenesis and its high in capsaicin which helps fight inflammation then we have garlic we're gonna be using 3 cloves and of course like onion makes everything taste that much better now moving on to one of my all-time favorites tofu we are using 1 kilogram of tofu it is very high in protein very high in calcium omega-3 and iron this is definitely a food that you should try out tofu is a little bit like white fish but much better it does taste plain until you season it so make sure to experiment a little bit now the main source of fats for the dish 400 grams of coconut milk I use the full fat one if you want to limit your fat intake a little bit more go with the light one next also one of my staples 1 kilogram of lentils also crazy good and tasty source of protein and iron and it is actually the food that is the highest in folate once again I bought precooked ones because I'm a lazy bastard but if you want to save more money buy them raw now start off by chopping up the onions warning you may break out in series just like Kathryn did please don't cry throw the onions in the pan and chop up the chili and throw it in there too next chopped up or squeeze three garlic cloves this will make the curry ten times better do not use powdered garlic it sucks in comparison next the sweet potatoes I sometimes leave the skin on but you can also peel it chop it into cubes and then throw that into the pan too now the tofu chop it into cubes if you're not a big fan of the taste of tofu chop it into smaller pieces and you won't be able to taste it as much do not throw the tofu in the pan just wait a little bit so now we add all the chopped tomato into the pan with the red to the veggies and some water if needed then pour in the coconut milk which kind of looks like a yogurt here mix it all up and throw in some spices I recommend using cumin powder coriander turmeric paprika and black pepper once it starts boiling throwing the tofu and let it cook for about 20 minutes meanwhile rinse the lentils and the curry should be done again get your Tupperware out and throw in the lentils in equal amounts in each then do the same with a curry and mix if preferred and there you go dinner is done this only comes to three dollars 35 cents and nine hundred fifty seven calories 113 grams of carbs 30 grams of fat and sixty grams of protein and that is all the meals I have been eating this for the past few days and it is very filling and very satisfying it's super healthy for you definitely give it a try this is what I typically eat to get fast results and what we recommend to our online clients who have gotten crazy results so please do not forget to try these meals to make progress with me and please hit the subscribe and

flu pandemic we are at home we have time now to consider our future and to take our health and immunity into our own hands so the goal of today's session is rather than panicking learn how to prevent and stay ahead of this pandemic that is called covert 19 or coronavirus we are very thankful you are all here today and we hope you'll have some significant takeaway so please I invite jr. now to come and begin our presentation hi guys and thank you for joining welcome to this youtube live on boosting your immunity let me just set this up correctly there we go alright so in today's session I'm going to talk about what can you do to boost your immunity and talk about what are the basic foundations of immunity in our body what are the pillars of immunity and then I'm going to go into my area of strength which is food and what foods can you take for immunity and particularly if you are someone who already gets a lot of sickness who already suffers from a lot of cold if you already suffered from a lot of sinus infections then we really want to talk about you as well here in terms of boosting your immunity also the format is going to be focusing not if you always had healthy food the format is going to be focusing on people who had normal food or younger kids in their 20s and 30s who were having unhealthy food and how can we boost your immunity rather quickly right away and then we'll also cover about these things like probiotics and what does your gut have to do with immunity and about vitamins and supplements that you can take so just quickly to talk about the five pillars of the munity these are the things that determine an overall level of health so the first section that we've got is diet and why diet so a diet keeps the immune system balanced and it keeps it ready to fight an infection as you have noticed with coronavirus a lot of people that got infected they didn't get sick a lot of people that got infected escaped with very minor or no symptoms and then a lot of people that got infected but were already sick they didn't do so well similarly you know when we talk about the seasonal flu alert it comes every winter or the change of seasons and some people get sick every time and some people never get sick and a lot of that has to do with diet so together with a good immune system and healthy diet is really really paramount to fighting off an infection so you know especially today since I am in the food business I mean I am in the nutrition business and I see how many people have a bad diet so I want to focus about how can you boost your immunity without changing your whole world without changing your whole diet like let's not start eating brown rice or start doing things that we've never done the focus when I talk about diet will be things that you can add what are generally eating everything that you used to eat so that's about diet okay let's talk about sleep which is the second pillar of immunity and right now when we are all staying at home or working from home it's a really good time to get your sleep studies show that people who don't get enough sleep are more likely to get sick and also you know the more you sleep the better your recovery is we know that right when people get sick there are more they sleep the better they the better day recovery so similarly just like sleep helps with recovery sleep will also help with immunity the time that you need to sleep is seven to nine hours of sleep you want to make sure you get one to two hours of good sleep um I have got a whatsapp number down here we have some sleep exercises if you are having troubles with sleep we can try to share those types of things with you that we use with our friends and family to help them sleep and in case of sleep issues the third pillar of immunity is the Sun so our skin is the largest organ in our body right if you think about it it is by far the largest organ in the body and sunlight connects with our skin and activates it to produce vitamin D so vitamin D or vitamin D is one of the most basic vitamins in which most of us have a deficiency today vitamin D is very important for our immune system because it helps regulate the whole immune system so vitamin D is not itself something that fights infections but it kind of helps balance the whole immune systems activity and so the other thing is that a Georgetown University study again it's a new study from Georgetown University said that sunlight can also energize your T cells T cells are part of your fighter cells it can also energize your T cells to fight off an immunity something else I came across is that when they had at the Spanish flu patient of Spanish flu was in 1918 that's why we are all scared of corona virus because I don't know 30 million people died in the Spanish flu people who were put outside were doing better people who got sunlight they had a faster recovery and they got didn't get as bad as those who didn't get sunlight so again just a little bit of insight about the Sun and how much time so very important is how much right so seven to nine hours per sleep for Sun even if you get twenty minutes of good sunlight so early in the morning at 8 a.m. here in Delhi if you get some good sunlight and it really helped you just boost it with production of vitamin D the fourth is exercise now exercise it it boosts our immune system it also helps more importantly it also helps regulate our metabolism exercise also reduces the stress hormones and of course stress is not good for us as in any way shape or form the other thing I want to tell you guys is we are products of 3 million years of evolution and except for the last 50 years we have always been active creatures we are designed to be active so any kind of exercise will help you be what you are designed to be and all your systems will work better when you act and behave like what you're designed to be again for exercise 20 minutes brisk walking will be good you can run in place if you are inside the house you don't have to go crazy you can do a one-hour yoga session also which will also reduce stress don't go crazy people who exercise too much like Olympic athletes or pro athletes who really push themselves at that time their immunity also gets weakened so you want to ensure that you are moderately moderately exercising now one thing I'm going to add to exercise is pranayama so the concept of giving oxygen to every cell in your body it's it's too powerful to even you know explain I don't know there many he's done on this yet but when you do pranayaam so if i do an oolong below and in the end you want to take that extra breath in and then out and then in if you can do it for thirty minutes you are really gonna oxygenate your body if you look up all party which is this sun again all of these serve to oxygenate your body and taking oxygen down to each cell has its own level of fighting and boosting you could say the energy level the vitality of each cell in the US now they have hyperbaric oxygen chamber so they put you in a high-pressure ice chamber to push oxygen to each cell level I don't think we need to do all that we have a natural system and it is pranayama so again if you can add for an iron every day every other day it's really going to be quite amazing for you and the last pillar of immunity is having a positive mind and right now you know guys we have a lot of stress people are worried about their job they are worried about their school they are worried about their businesses okay we are all in this together okay this is affecting me it's affecting you it's affecting the whole world let's not stress about it let's enjoy I'm having a good family time right now enjoy the rest be active be productive you know don't just become a couch potato make a game plan but have your positive mind if need be meditate so positive mind helps reduce stress and it takes a load of your immune system so generally also people who have a positive mind will have less inflammation because it allows your body to rest so with the positive attitude you won't be stressed your stress hormones will be down you'll rest better you'll sleep better everything is gonna be really really good so these are some of the these are the five pillars of immunity I'm now gonna go into food but I just want to see if there's any questions here on the chat and I'll take a few questions and then I'll go on into the diet okay so I've got two questions one is exercises which lead to good sleep and diet and sleep I'll take the easy one first for sleep young nedra hands down you can search on YouTube you can search for a yoga mudra you'll get you'll find yoga nidra in English and in Hindi I have a great Hindi version I used it myself my father uses it it made him reduce one sleeping pill within a day and again if you what's up here and just message sleep yoga nidra and then we'll reply back to you by the evening with the exact video that I do use so here's the number I hope you can see it so that is for the sleeping exercise sleeping you know exercise any kind of foods to help with sleep I wouldn't say specifically foods that you eat but if you think about things to drink then chamomile tea is extremely beneficial to sleep also blue lights so the light from all our devices action-movie things like that is gonna keep you awake if you can turn all of that down have some soft music playing aromas these are things that naturally calm us some people meditation works well of course I have mentioned the yoga mudra I would say drinking relaxing drinks like chamomile tea are gonna be really useful for calming the mind as a matter of fact I had M MIT last night so I think we'll move on now and thank you one more question which is better gym exercise or yoga great question depends if you're trying to build muscle then you want to do strength building exercises you can also do your exercises for that I've been doing yoga primarily for 10 years if you want to do cardio strength like your heart muscle endurance for that it's cardio but today if we're talking in context of immunity 20 minute walk 20 minutes running in place 20 minutes anything that is a mild upper to boost your cardio and just get a slight break of sweat if you're gonna do you overdo something again that pushes you and you can do yoga for 45 minutes to an hour if it's slow yoga if it's relaxing yoga you can go an hour and 15 but you know you can also do in yoga like you can do 50 Surya Namaskar which is quite intense but doing the awesome based yoga will you go deeper and deeper into stretches it releases a lot of endorphins it's really good you've come out feeling really nice and actually at the end of the yoga you can do pranayama so I like both I'm mixing up both would also be just a very good idea thank you for the questions now I'm going to move on into the food section so we have a lot of foods that really help pop up the immune system and I'm going to go into all my favourite things right now okay so first here we've got our la Amla is also known as the Indian gooseberry I don't know if you can eat it let me try it is very bitter and I can't even finish that but it's these bitter things you know it's loaded with vitamin C and that's the kind of stuff that you want right now you don't want to go for sugar you want to go four strong disks so when it comes to Amla you want to juice it and there's a seed inside you want to watch out for the seed cut it and it should where you get it you said if you don't have it and about one large Amla per person these are a little bit on the smaller side maybe one and a half so this is a little bit on the larger side so one of these now you don't want to have it straight we're going to mix it with some of these other things and go that way so Amla and the next thing is Barry's formula actually is a very family it's the Indian gooseberry but the other things that you can have so we've got strawberries strawberries are in season right now a raspberry that is also in season and berries also tend to be very rich in nutrients and very low in sugar so berries have vitamin C and again you know having a variety of types of vitamin C is again part of nature's the solution to disease so you know like you have the Amla you can eat this raw you can even juice it and so that will dilute the Amla then I've got fruits so in fruits again I'll talk about the green apple first so green apple compared to a red apple green apple has less sugar and we want to minimize the amount of sugar that we take we shouldn't have too much fruit juice we can have vegetable juice but we should reduce fruit juice so green apple TV and these have less sugar guava also has less sugar but it doesn't have the vitamins and things I need you to be eating for fighting a flu type in Section but green apple will be good TV will be okay oranges are also good but again the sugar can't go hi so having an orange as a few times a week is okay but otherwise you don't necessarily need to have orange if you are having a la and strawberry so going into vegetables tomato has vitamin C we don't know that often but tomato does you can juice these and other vegetables here's my little basket look at that full of colors so having some beet beet hell irony in it and again the thing about vegetables is they should be deep dark colors inside so if I compare a beet with a zucchini zucchini is mainly watered and it's white on the inside cucumber is mainly watered but these guys are very good broccoli broccoli is really good especially probably right now you can eat it I have this book that I've ivory brushed I think it's apt for right now right how not to die and he talks about broccoli as well having antimicrobial properties but the stem this is really good to use this is like where all the nutrients are flowing of this plant so you can juice the stem which something you wouldn't eat normally having some carrots carrots have carotene which is a phytonutrient also vitamin A so these go very well with Amla and I've got these are things I don't typically juice but right now in the time of coronavirus I'm gonna be using these as well because bell peppers are like I have an anti-cancer soup and Delphi pears are a key ingredient in that bell peppers are a lot of beneficial properties and almost no sugar so you're going to get all the nutrients but you're not gonna get any of the sugar which is what we want and of course you can always add a lime now lastly something that we don't often use is aloe vera so you're gonna take the inside part it's cut all that trip but the inside gel is what you want and per person about 1 teaspoon Alice para is very strong you don't want to overdo it but if you can take one teaspoon you have to peel off you have to Eve off the green part there YouTube videos on that and you just want the inside jelly and you can use that as well and that is very beneficial for your immunity in terms of quantity you know I would say having [Music] this you know like you want to juice at least more than this maybe some more spinach and stuff and some more berries or half an apple and you should get one good glass so if you can juice about 300 grams of vegetables and with these super ones then that's every day just think every day are having it every day how much will that boost your immunity and I kept coming back to how I structured this talk it's not about having you change your habits every day but if you can have all of this packed into one shot that will be really good and if you have had your lunch just maybe halfway in your lunch if you have it then you'll have some fiber also for this juice to kind of go down the flow ginger now ginger is very good during with my ginger here's ginger so ginger is very good in winter weather but now as we are approaching summer you don't want to do too much of this so you can do half a teaspoon to 1 teaspoon of ginger and chai and your tea or something like that but then it also raises your body temperature so if you feel like you've got a flu or something then you might want to have more of this ginger and black pepper I'm gonna come to black pepper also if you're someone who's just is always running and you're always having sinus issues then ginger is gonna clear ginger and honey are things that you should sitter turmeric so this is fresh turmeric you get fresh turmeric you get some powder turmeric from makalah which is called la Kadam turmeric and then you have regular jhumri I really want to shout out to all my friends who continuously have some infection or the other so if there's a Abby shake from Jaipur if you're watching if there's a current from Delhi Gurgaon if you're watching or lately I think that the case and I've noticed you also had a lot of runny nose so when you have infection your inflammation is higher and you don't want to have extra high inflammation you want your inflammation to come down turmeric is one of the best anti-inflammatory is known to man and in India it is part of our traditional medicine so you can have it with milk you know catching LD with milk so again you shave it you grind it and then you boil it with milk you can also sort it with some oil I'm sorry if I'm going too fast you can make out this is my area of passion so I this get carried away but you can have Holi with black pepper with oil or with milk or almond milk and this is going to bring down your inflammation so this is something that I cannot recommend enough if you have inflammation issues I don't know if it applies as an immunity booster but it is a well-being booster and here's garlic this is something I need to start but in many cultures specially South America they will take a one clove of garlic raw every morning and the trick is to take it raw so you wanna peel it and you can then put a few knife marks into this so I'm not gonna peel it in front of you but you can put a few knife marks into this so the juices open up and then take it in your mouth and suck on it for 10-15 minutes slowly chew it suck on it slowly chew it suck on it and that's the trick it's not about swallowing it whole it's not about dicing it and swallowing it it's not about cooking it and eating it cooking and eating is good for the heart but for immunity it's about having it raw and slowly slowly slowly sucking on it a lot of people that I know in my direct family living in the u.s. they have stopped getting winter flus winter cold when they take this I'm not saying that this is a medicine I'm not even going there I'm saying it can help and so again if you have a garlic in the morning and the juice and we're doing great and lastly is is black pepper and black pepper like a lot of times in masala chai we have black pepper and black pepper really clears out the sinuses and the upper respiratory tract so I wanted to add that again quarter teaspoon to half a teaspoon a day don't go crazy with anything in nature balance is key so keeping balance in mind had add some black pepper every day if you find your nose is starting to run then you can increase the amount of black pepper again if you're having any issues do reach out to me I'll try my best to help you now we go into Ayurveda we have Tulsi we have name and we have de LOI so this is a not actually it will see this as basil I didn't have to see in my garden but Tulsi is supposed to help you and so Tulsi six or seven leads in your juice name six or seven leaves in your juice and have it fresh I like everything fresh Gill away I wanted to bring this up because I studied it yellow is supposed to help you once you have a fever or if you have a fluctuating sugar levels so Gila will balance your sugar and of course that's going to be good for your immunity but if you don't have sugar issues then I'm not sure I couldn't find a lot of research on how cool oh it prevents disease but once you have disease it's supposed to be good again I'm not an expert maybe there's an algorithm person who might know better I spoke to one but I didn't get the right answer so I just wanted to mention it because every Ayurvedic person will mention Gila why so I wanted to write it that I didn't notice something directly related to corona virus there but to see a name I would definitely take and for quantity for turmeric if you are taking powder just to jump back it would be about a third of a teaspoon to a quarter of a teaspoon aloe vera was one teaspoon at the max or half a teaspoon ginger would be one teaspoons and again I hope I've covered most of them regarding quantities so now we have some questions we'll go into some questions [Music] hello there are somebody said how can you give it to children I would take it and throw it into the juice so we our kids had it yesterday they were happy to drink this jelly jelly thing and I would easily do that all right so that was one question now we're going to go into the last few sections and they're not going to be that long so probiotics so guys again this is for all the people who get sick very frequently this is very important for you for everyone else it's a booster so in India I have noticed a lot of people are having a lot of issues with getting sick every year and a lot of things about getting sickness is having a leaky gut so a leaky gut is your gut leaks and what happens is that when we don't have the right bacteria in our gut then the gut wall is compromised and this is very important today when we talk about immune system because a lot of your immune system has to be focused around your gut when the food comes in and the food is processed good stuff needs to go into your bloodstream and bad stuff should stay out but if you have a leaky gut there's a lot of bad stuff that's flowing through and your immune system has to go attack these bad bacteria as or bad pathogens and deal with them if your gut is healthy your immune system gets a relief from this book and it can then focus on other areas mainly your respiratory area your oral area than your nasal areas so the reason I have mentioned the gut is simply to give up support to your immune system right now so all your shields are up and so the one thing today that everybody can knows how to make or the mother knows how to make or somebody know how to make is kanji and kanji is a simple one that you can make once the movement is allowed there is sauerkraut and kimchi if you are in a big city or in kombucha you can find some local manufacturer of those because those are living probiotics the the lactobacillus bacteria is the one that you want I forget the exact strain of lactobacillus here I might have it written in my notes probiotics I have forgot to write the exact strain of the bacteria but I don't like the powdered stuff you know if the powdered probiotics for me it's the same as taking all your vitamins in a powder it's not the same you gotta take natural vitamins same way you gotta take natural probiotics but congee is one that you can begin with again if you always have runny stock this is really important for you it'll even stop or your runny stuff in the future and let's talk about vitamins which vitamins are important in this situation so wintermen C is rumoured to be really really good there is a study about ultra high dose vitamin C by ultra high dose I mean ten thousand units or more so I have this box it would almost be the whole box every day that is a very controversial study so read you decide if you want otherwise vitamin-c getting 1,000 milligrams with zinc is really good as an immune defense particularly for colds and flus so wit Ehrman C and zinc together if you have a poor diet there's a good chance that you are zinc deficient so you may want to consider having zinc and lastly vitamin D 80% of the population is deficient in vitamin D so there's a 8 out of 10 chance that you are as well and if you are then please take the supplements sit in the Sun and get this up guys this is a lot of knowledge right now I made do another video on for people who particularly gets sick frequently but I hope in the meantime that you found this to be helpful and informative and this was my first Youtube life so I hope you found that I did a good job in keeping you engaged as well and let me see if we have any final questions here so yeah it is I guess the number one probiotic the question is people have heard of yeah cool times when I make micro here's a probiotic I brought this this is careful this is fermented milk you ferment milk for 20 hours and you get this this has about 50 times more than yogurt also full of lactobacillus if you have IBS it will take it away see this if I leave it it expands it this bacteria if you don't feed it milk new milk every day the bacteria dies and so this is a living probiotic in my other probiotics if I they are in a plastic jar the jar expands because it releases air it releases carbon dioxide I have never seen idea cool bottle like blow up and I don't know how how are they living if they don't actively conceive Scott monoxide that's my big question with would this is it really active if they're not breathing so I I don't know I don't know that would be my correct answer I trust stuff that is living anymore questions okay guys thank you so much I hope that I hope that we can keep you safe and practice social distancing practice everything that they are saying and let's hope and pray for the best and I hope with all of these things you'll have an advantage thank you", "U5GP-o6K3IQ": "[Music] hey guys it's basil Jane today I'm gonna be doing one full week of healthy weight loss meal prep with you guys in just one hour so in just one hour all of our meals for the entire week for seven days are going to be prepped so breakfast lunch dinner and snacks so it's perfect if you're really busy but you still trying to lose weight and you're still trying to eat healthy meals as well then this perfect video and yeah that's about it let's get started with the recipes this is a weight loss plan designed for women specifically women who are trying to lose weight men or children will need to eat more to lose weight in a healthy weight just so you know and each day is based on roughly 1400 calories but you can easily adjust the calories per day to suit your specific needs at the end of this video I'll show you how you can easily tweak the eating plan to give you anywhere from 1,200 calories to 1600 calories per day or even more based on your specific calorie needs to lose weight and I've specifically created these meals and recipes to be lower in calories but to still be filling and to give you good sustained energy these recipes are all balanced with good whole carbs good protein and healthy fats as it's important to eat all of the food groups while trying to lose weight in a healthy way I'll also make sure to mention a plant-based alternative that you can use for any food items that are not plant-based so to get started you'll need some containers to store your meals and you'll need 14 containers for all of your lunch and dinner meals as we're making food for seven days if you'll be eating at home then you can use covered bowls or other dishes and you'll also need for small mason jars you can also just use covered mugs or glasses and you'll also need some reusable Ziploc bags or other small containers for snacks and other items so because we want a meal prep seven full days of meals in just one hour we need to start prepping and cooking the foods that will take the longest to cook so we will work in that order and at the end we'll see all of the meals come together make sure that you've preheated your oven to 180 degrees Celsius or about 360 degrees Fahrenheit before you begin okay so we're gonna start with the potatoes because they will take the longest to cook out of everything that we'll be making today we're gonna make enough potatoes for four servings of dinner because we'll be using them for four out of the seven dinner meals you'll need 400 grams of regular potatoes in total I'm using regular baby potatoes but you can just use our normal size if you want to I've washed and chopped them up roughly and I'm adding them to a roasting pan with about 1 TSP of cooking oil some Italian herb mix black pepper and sea salt and I've only fold one half of the roasting tray because we're gonna use the other half of the tray for something else in a couple of minutes so make sure that you keep your potatoes to the one side of your bursting tray and you can place the potatoes in your oven that you've preheated to about 180 degrees Celsius or about 360 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 to 50 minutes and then they'll be done next we need to start roasting the vegetables as these also take a long time to cook I'm using vegetables that are already chopped up because this saves a lot of time if we only have an hour and so many stores so pre chopped vegetables these days and you can use any vegetable mix that you want to I've got two different vegetable mixes here for you know some variation throughout the week I'm using a mix of butternut squash beetroot and red onion for four out of the seven dinner meals I'm using the entire bag because it's a smaller bag and then I'm using a mix of butternut squash red bell pepper and zucchini for the other three dinner meals I'm only using about half the bag because as you can see it's a much larger bag but you can use all the same kinds of vegetables if you'd prefer for all of your dinner meals so according to the nutrition information on the bags I've used enough vegetables to give me roughly seventy calories per meal we'll be adding some more vegetables later and that will take each vegetable serving to roughly 100 calories per dinner meal and I'm including the calories for the oil that we're going to use as well and all of that into the total calorie amount for the vegetables so I've added the vegetables to another baking tray with about a half a TSP of oil to each vegetable mix and it's about 1 teaspoon in total with some Italian herb mix black pepper and sea salt I also decided to actually add a few cherry tomatoes to the one mix which won't add too many more calories and they're really nice whenever nurse stood I love it so you can add the vegetable tray to the oven with the potatoes and they'll take roughly 30 to 40 minutes to cook fully now we're gonna start cooking the grains will be making quinoa as well as some brown rice for you know some variation feel free to only use one of them if you'd prefer to do that that's totally fine to a part you can add one serving of dry brown rice with three servings of hot water just careful not to burn your hands while you're working with the hot water the brown rice will take about 40 minutes to cook and to another part you can add one serving of dried quinoa with three servings of hot water so it's a 1 to 3 ratio for both grains one serving of grains to 3 servings of water but you can add a little bit more water if you need to as you go and the quinoa will only take about 15 minutes to cook so make sure you get it off the stove after about 15 minutes make sure you time it you can make as much of each grain as you need you can start with about half a cup of dry brown rice which should yield about one and a half cups of cooked brown rice which is what you'll need today for this meal prep and you'll need about three and a half cups of cooked quinoa for this meal prep so you can start by making one and 1/6 of a cup of dragon way as a rough guideline to yield about three and a half cups of cooked quinoa you can bring both pots of grains to a boil on the stove and then let them simmer until they're fully cooked and remember to check your quinoa after about 15 minutes and your brown rice should be done after about 40 minutes next we're gonna prep enough salad to last 7 days we'll be using the salad to go with our lunches so the key is to use ingredients that will keep well in the salad and that will keep well for a couple of days in a salad we'll be making two different salad options as well for some variation throughout the week to start I've got a whole lot of fresh kale that I've washed and roughly chopped up kale keeps really well in a salad better other leafy greens so I love using this I'm dividing the kale into two salad bowls so that we can make two salad variations and I'm adding one teaspoon of olive oil to each bowl with a little bit of sea salt I'm just gonna wrap the olive oil and the sea salt into the kale just for a minute this actually helps to make the kale softer and give it a better texture and I've got enough to have you know like a nice big handful for each meal and we're gonna use this for seven meals seven lunches so make sure you've got about seven handfuls so I've also roughly chopped up some vegetables and I'll only be using ones that keep well for a few days in a salad carrots red bell pepper and celery and then I've also got some tiny little cherry tomatoes which I'll be leaving hole to make sure that they stay fresh and then I've got a little bag of pre grated beetroot you know to save time and you can just about all of your vegetables pre-chopped to save extra time as well so to my first salad I'm adding the celery one or two stalks chopped up in total and then some red bell pepper I just used one medium red bell pepper and then also a nice big handful of cherry tomatoes I've used about a heaped cup if you want to know the amounts these are all really low-calorie vegetables as well fresh lemon juice is a must to keep the salad fresh for the entire week and it looks really good flavor and then some black pepper and Italian herb mix and then you can just mix that up and put it aside for now for the next salad I'm adding chopped carrot I've used about four medium carrots because I love carrots so much but you don't have to use as many you can just use like two carrots and then I'm using some of that grated beetroot and ask big handful and then some dried cranberries as well try to use ones that are free of preservatives and refined sugar if you can find them otherwise it's totally chilled you can just use whatever you can get don't stress about it though um it's just cranberries but the ones that I use are sweetened with fruit juice and they sulfate free I've used about 4 tablespoons of dried cranberries because we're making the salad into four servings and then I'm adding about 2 tablespoons of unsweetened balsamic vinegar with a little bit fresh lemon juice just don't get the seeds in there and black pepper and then you can just mix that up and put it aside again for a few minutes and this is one of my favorite salads ever it's freaking amazing okay now that the salads are prepped now we're going to prep some of the protein sources we're gonna make some salmon we're gonna make some chicken we're gonna make some eggs we're gonna make some chickpeas but don't worry I will mention a plant-based protein source that you can use and as an alternative if you'd prefer that instead of the the fish the chicken and the eggs but they will be roughly the same calories so the potatoes have been roasting for a few minutes already so now we're gonna add some salmon to the baking tray and that's why I said keep the potatoes to one side I've made a little divider out of the baking foil so that the potatoes don't get like salmon II no one wants that but if you have some kind of little divider you can use that I have 400 grams of salmon here so 4 times 100 grams servings because we'll be using this for four out of the seven dinners and I'm seasoning that with a little bit of sea salt black pepper and a bit of fresh lemon juice and as a plant-based alternative to the salmon you can use 2/3 of a cup of cooked or canned chickpeas per serving so that would be 2 plus 2/3 of a cup in total and chickpeas are delicious roasted you can just add them to your baking tray with some sea salt sand pepper some herbs and about 1 teaspoon of oil and you can place the salmon in the oven for about 15 minutes or longer if you need to and the chickpeas will take about 30 minutes to cook next we're prepping some chicken I have got 300 grams of chicken breast meat to make 3 servings of dinner so 100 grams per serving I just got pre sliced chicken breast meat to make it easier but you can just slice yours up if you need to just place the chicken in a pan with some sea salt some pepper Italian herb mix a little bit of fresh lemon juice and about 1 tsp of oil and about 2 tablespoons of pure tomato paste as an alternative to the chicken you can use some firm tofu use 105 des grams of firm tofu per serving of chicken so you'd need 450 grams of firm tofu in total and you can cook it exactly the same way as the chicken with exactly the same ingredients and cook the chicken or the tofu over a medium to high heat on the stove for about 10 to 15 minutes you can toss it with a spatula and you can add just a little splash of water if you need to if while you're cooking it if the pan gets too dry now for the eggs I'm using 6 eggs to make hard-boiled eggs for three of the lunches so we'll use 2 eggs per serving carefully add the eggs to a pot of hot water and bring the water to a boil in the pot on the stove with the eggs in it and then let it simmer for about 10 minutes to make the eggs hard-boiled you can also use black beans as an alternative if you don't want to use the eggs and you can use precooked or can black beans roughly one cup per serving instead of the two eggs so about three cups in total for three lunches I'm also going to steam some broccoli to eat our dinners so I've got enough here for a little handful serving for each dinner so 7 servings in total for 7 dinners you can do about 60 grams or so per serving if you want to get all specific so you do roughly about 420 grams in total for all seven servings of dinner you can also use broccoli floret or another low-calorie vegetable that you'd prefer like asparagus or zucchini so just place that broccoli in a steamer and steam it for about 10 to 15 minutes so make sure that you set a timer okay well everything else is still busy cooking we're gonna make all of the breakfasts for the whole week which is gonna be actually really quick to do for breakfast we're gonna make four different overnight oats recipes and then we're also gonna prep three smoothies as well and each breakfast will be roughly 400 calories to each jar you can add half a cup of dry rolled oats and you can also add 2 teaspoons of chia seeds to each jar then to 2 overnight oats only add 1/4 of a cup of water and then to the other two overnight oats add half a cup of water and you'll see why in just a moment so do a quarter cup of water to two of them and half a cup of water to the other two and then you can also add a little pinch of cinnamon to each jar for some extra flavor so to the two overnight oats that we only added a quarter cup of water we're gonna add about two-thirds of a cup of yogurt I'm using coconut yogurt because I'm dairy-free but you can also use full cream dairy yogurt or any other yogurt substitute that you'd prefer preferably plain and unsweetened and the reason we needed less water is because the yogurt you know with the yogurt you don't want to add too much water and then to the other two overnight oats that we used half a cup of water for I'm adding 10 roll cashew nuts to one and about a 1 tablespoon of unsweetened peanut butter to the other one now for the fruit I'm adding 1 cup of chopped up apple to the 1 yogurt 1 and 1 smashed banana to the other yogurt 1/2 the overnight oats that I added the cashew nuts too I'm adding 1/2 a cup of diced frozen pineapple and also 1/2 a cup of frozen blueberries and then to the peanutbutter one I'm adding one full cup of frozen mixed berries and then also one teaspoon of 100% pure maple syrup to each of the berry ones the yogurt ones with the apple and the banana shouldn't need the sweetener because the apple and the banana are both quite sweet the berry ones they have slightly less calories in them from the fruit as well so kind of all evens itself out but you can add sweetener if you do need it to the other ones so just mix them all together and cover them and you can easily make the same flavor for each day if you want to or you can make a different one for each day like added I've also got lots of other overnight oats recipes that I've already shown you on this channel so I will link a couple of videos below in the description box for you where I've done other overnight oats recipes if you'd rather try another flavor okay for the smoothie prep you'll need about 3 medium sized Ziploc bags which you can easily reuse again I've peeled and sliced up three medium bananas and also one medium avocado and I've divided all of that into three so to each the plug bag I'm adding one medium banana and 1/3 of an avocado banana and avocado birth freeze really well if they've already been peeled and both of them are really good in smoothies so that's perfect from here we're gonna make each smoothie slightly too French so that we have a different smoothie each day - one bag we're gonna add 1 cup of dust frozen mango to the second bag we're gonna add one cup of frozen mixed berries and to the third bag we're gonna add one cup of frozen blueberries the berries are lower in calories than the mango so because of that I'm adding one tablespoon of dry rolled oats to each of the berry smoothies this is gonna kind of help to balance out the amount of calories and also help to give us more carbs in those smoothies until the mixed berry one I'm also adding a small handful of fresh baby spinach which also freezes really well actually and you can add this to all of the smoothies if you want to or you don't have to add it at all if you don't want to so that's our three smoothies prepped which were roughly 300 calories each so to add another 100 calories and some extra protein to each of those three breakfasts we're gonna add some raw nuts to the meals I've added about a hundred calories of raw nuts to each bag which is what I like to do when when I have a smoothie I like to eat some raw nuts on the side I've paid ten roll Kashi nuts with the mango banana smoothie totally gives me like tropical vibes so I thought it would be fun and then I've got a troll walnut halves to go with the mixed berry banana spinach smoothie and then also 14 raw almonds to go with the blueberry banana smoothie so just seal the Ziploc bags and then you can put that smoothie prep straight into the freezer and you can store the little nuts of bags in the fridge if you want to I decided to keep the snacks for the week really simple and easy because we're taking this hour to make some wholesome healthy meals so I'm gonna be prepping a couple of different fruit and nuts snacks for the week and each snack will be roughly 200 calories for the first day I've kept it super simple with a classic apple and almond snack I've got 14 raw almonds and a big medium-sized Pink Lady Apple which is my favorite kind of Apple so that'll be roughly 200 calories in total I'm also gonna do one more of the exact combination for another day because I really like pink lady apples and almonds so 14 raw almonds a Pink Lady Apple again the third snack will be similar but a little bit different a troll walnut halves and one green apple to mix things up a bit you know which is also gonna be roughly 200 calories then the fourth and fifth snacks will be the same again each will be too small clementines head with ten roll pica nut halves which is roughly 200 calories again and then the sixth and seventh snack will be the same - I've got one medium-sized nectarine with a hundred grams of strawberries and also ten roll Kashi nuts again about 200 calories for the whole snack and I've made a double quantity of that and you can store all of your snacks in the fridge until it's time to eat them so basically what I've done is I've taken 100 calories of fruit and 100 calories of nuts for each snack and I've put that together to make a 200 calorie fruit and that snack so it's really simple you can use any fruit and any nut combination that you'd like and if these snacks are too boring for you that's okay then I've got more 200 calorie snack ideas on my blog I'll link to that blog post below for you or you can feel free to substitute these snacks for any other 200 calorie snack or even a 200 calorie snack bar okay so the quinoa and the rice have finished cooking and the eggs are boiled and the chicken is cooked and the vegetables are done roasting and the potatoes and the seminars are done and the broccoli is also finished steaming so now everything is done cooking we can finally finish putting the lunches and the dinners together first we're gonna finish prepping the lunches so for the first lunch we're going to use the quinoa and we're gonna use the chickpeas and also one of the salads that we made I've got four containers here and I'm measuring out half a cup of cooked quinoa to each of the four containers [Music] then a measuring out 2/3 of a cup of canned chickpeas to each container I just drained and rinsed the chickpeas you can also use cooked chickpeas if you'd prefer to and then I'm dividing one of the salads to go with these lunches too I've used the balsamic carrot beetroot and dried cranberry salad because I think it's a really nice pairing with the chickpeas and the quinoa and I made the salad a bit bigger than the other one because we're gonna use this one for four portions and that is for lunches for the week already done super simple and each lunch is roughly 400 calories in total for the other three lunches we're gonna use the X that we boiled so I took the eggs off the stove after about 10 minutes of boiling to make them hard-boiled but not like overcooked to get the eggshells off easily I actually like to crack the egg shells a bit on the side of the pot and then just let the cooked eggs sit in cold water for about a minute or so after they're done boiling and then the shells that actually come off really easily so for a plant-based alternative you can use about 1 cup of cooked black beans if you'd prefer to do that you know instead of the bald eggs then a measuring out 1/2 cup of cooked brown rice to add to each of the containers with two of the boiled eggs into each container as well and I've left the eggs whole so that they stay fresher for longer and then I'm just dividing up the other salad to go in the containers with the rice and the eggs this is the pepper tomato and celery salad and I made this one a little bit smaller than the other one because I'm using this for three portions of lunch and I used the other one for four portions of lunch these three lunches are also roughly 400 calories each and you can just cover them and store all of the lunches in the fridge until you're ready to eat them [Music] okay let's finish putting together our dinners for the week with all of our prepped ingredients and then we're done then we're all done for the entire week we're gonna use the chicken we made or you can now use the tofu alternative for these three dinners I'm serving 1/2 a cup of cooked quinoa to each of my three containers and you can also use half a cup of cooked brown rice if you would prefer to do that instead of the quinoa then I'm just dividing up the cooked chicken between the three containers so that's 100 grams of chicken per container so you'll also divide your cooked firm tofu here between your three meals if you want a plant-based alternative and then I'm serving one of the roast vegetable mixes here I'm using the vegetable mix with butternut squash tomatoes bell pepper and zucchinis to go with the chicken and the quinoa and I'm saving the other half of the veggies the other vegetable mix to go with the next four dinners that we'll be making and then don't forget the steamed broccoli if you made that too so I'm dividing the broccoli up between seven servings because we'll use some for the other four dinners as well so just use enough for three servings here and after you've added the broccoli these dinners are ready and they look so freaking good that looks so good so just cover them and then you can store them in the fridge and then let's put the final dinners together we're almost done prepping all of our meals for the entire week oh my gosh okay so we've got our roasted potatoes and our salmon which look so delicious so I'm dividing the roasted potatoes into four containers love roasted potatoes so much oh my gosh then I'm serving the four portions of salmon into the containers too you can use your words to chick peas here if you made that as the plant-based option instead of the salmon and you can just divide the roasted chickpeas into four servings as we're doing with the salmon and then also some of the roasted vegetables I'm using the rest about a nut squash beetroot and onion mix to go with the salmon and potatoes I just think it pairs really nicely and then at the rest of the steamed broccoli you can use the last four servings now and after you've added the broccoli these dinners are ready and there you go all of the dinners are ready they look amazing just cover them store them in the fridge with all of your other meals and we are done we are prepped and we are done we have prepped all of our meals and all of our snacks for the entire week so you can choose either one of your overnight oats or the smoothies for each morning what's really great is that every single morning we have a completely different breakfast recipe and your overnight oats are good to go you can literally eat them out of the jar with a spoon or you can serve them in a bowl whatever you like and the smoothies are all prepped and ready to go all you need to do is just throw your prep smoothie into a blender with about a half a cup to 3/4 of a cup of water and then you're good to go and you can just snack on the raw nuts on the side then for lunch you've got the option of the eggs with the brown rice and the salad or the quinoa the chickpeas and the salad or your other plant-based alternative for your snacks you've got a different fruit and nut snack combination that you can pick for each day so you can take whichever one you want that day or any other 200 calorie snack that you'd prefer and then for dinner you've got the chicken the quinoa and the vegetable dinner or you've got the salmon the roast potato and the vegetable dinner all your plant-based alternatives all of the foods that I've used should last for the whole week if stored in the fridge just make sure that you eat them within seven days you can freeze the dinners if you'd prefer to do that and then heat them up but the lunches then the overnight oats one keep wall in the freezer so you'll want to keep those in the fridge and also be sure to keep your smoothie prep in the freezer and you can heat your meals up in a pan or any other way that you'd prefer I like to heat my chicken dinner up in a pan for a few minutes and then serve it it just takes a few minutes and then it's heated and it's super easy and then I like to take my overnight oats and my lunches and must max with me to work all of the meals are roughly 400 calories each and if you followed my guidelines with the alternative plant-based options and portions humor should still be roughly 400 calories each as well and I really hope that you enjoy these meals and recipes these are meals that I like to eat and recipes based on what I ate when I was trying to lose weight if you don't like a particular ingredient that I've used then feel free to use another similar ingredient that you'd prefer that is roughly the same amount of calories just remember that we're all different and so every woman has different calorie needs to lose weight in a healthy way so if you'd like to follow a 1400 calorie diet you can eat all three of the meals as well as the snack every single day as I showed you all of the meal prep that we did today basically if you'd like to follow a 1200 calorie diet you can eat all three of the meals and then just leave out the fruit and nut snack which is 200 calories because of your minus 200 calories from 1400 calories you get 1200 calories and if you need to eat more to lose weight in a healthy way because some women do like 1600 calories or more then you can easily just add another 200 calorie snack like another 200 calorie for a nut snack or any other snack that's 200 calories or a snack that's more than 200 calories if you need that but you know what all the meals are prepped and that's gonna save so much time during the week ah but yeah there was a lot of work but got it

wrap without the tortilla grab a few peppers or other veggies of your liking a couple pieces of spinach a slice of cheese or maybe some avocado for my electives and taller friends that dash of nutmeg to spice it up if you please take a slice of Turkey and roll it up like a burrito and there you have it next up at number nine is to knit with whole-grain crackers tuna is loaded with protein it makes a very healthy and convenient snack one cup contains an impressive 39 grams of protein making it extra filling now into our crackers we want to make sure that whole grain is the first ingredient in our crackers meaning we want to make sure that they are 100 percent of whole grains we also want to look for crackers at least 3 grams of fiber we want to be aware of high sodium and we also want to keep the added sugars and trick with no more than 1 to 2 grams of sugar per serving being best a little out of honey is alright but best to avoid high fructose corn syrup or crackers with more than one type of sugar a great example of this is Nabisco's Triscuit baked whole grain original wheat crackers coming in at number eight or natural protein bars protein bars can serve as a healthier alternative to other packaged snacks it's quick it's easy and a great source of protein if we are choosing the right kind now what exactly do we want to look for in our protein bars we want no extra additives we want no added sugar we want about three grams of fiber to help digest a slowly and release energy evenly to keep us fuller longer and we want about eight grams of protein unless our goal is to gain muscle then about max of 20 grams of protein is fine a good example of a natural protein bar on the market are rx bars next up at number seven we have a Greek yogurt parfait consisting of yogurt granola and frustrated and sweet'n Greek yogurt is packed with protein calcium and probiotics which are good bacteria that can help base to your immune system not only is Greek yogurt low in sodium it is high in potassium most Americans nowadays have way too much sodium in their diet therefore this is a great alternative to a packaged snack now on to our granola our granola needs to be

just a few minutes to make all you need is a half an avocado four hard-boiled eggs a teaspoon of lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste whip it all together and there you have it for 2 to 3 servings

their low calorie counts on to our butters we have 3 major different types of nut butters almond butter cashew butter and peanut butter almond butter is the healthiest of all the nut butters it contains seven grams of protein 12 grams of mono saturated fats and is a great source of Omega threes it also has the highest concentration of nutrients per tablespoon and could my museum and calcium

some great examples are Justin's classic almond butter and crazy Richards 100% peanut butter rolling in just shy of the top at number two is veggies with Greek yogurt protein dip veggies are great for snacking but they are not very high in protein on that increase your protein intake by pairing them with yogurt chip a yogurt dip is typically made by combining one cup of plain Greek yogurt two

it's your girl Rachel it's Tuesday so I'm here for Tuesday tips inside our Facebook group results with Rachel so if you're watching this on the replay hashtag replay but today I am coming in I'm coming in every week you guys into our private group to support you and add value and hopefully give you some ideas tips inspiration answer your most commonly asked questions so every week I get questions and I figured why not address it with all of you because I'm sure more than one person has the same question okay so every Tuesday you can expect to see me here and less for some unknown reason I'm not but every Tuesday Tuesday tips with Rachel will be happening at 4:00 so set your calendar and tune in hi Matt and Andrea thanks for joining so in today's Tuesday tips I'm going to be going over a few questions that I recently got asked one was about snacks so I'm going to go over a list of ideas for you I'm gonna direct you to places in our group that you can find these lists and print them out yourself I'm also going to talk to you about what our macros and why are they important and what exactly do we need to keep track of and then the last one that I got was about our rebuild strength and how is it different from the formula one meal replacement shakes this person was looking because they've been working out hard and wondering thinking about I probably should be incorporating a little bit more into my diet now that I'm actually exercising so let's tackle first things first shall we so if you guys go into our Facebook group and you go under albums you'll find an album titled snacks and what I'm going to review is from one of the pictures that is right inside that album there's also a little tab called units and if you click on units you can scroll down and you can find a unit called snacks or healthy snack ideas and there's plenty of tips and inspiration in there as well but the reason snacking is important as you may already know or maybe we just need reminded is that your body's your body's like a furnace and it needs fuel so your your food is firewood it's fuel for the furnace it helps to keep your metabolism burning and if you go for long periods of time without feeding the furnace then the metabolism is going to slow down and you're not going to burn fat efficiently so you really need to keep an even keel all throughout the day I like to have my breakfast shake a mid-morning snack my lunch shake and evening or a mid-afternoon snack my balanced meal with my family and then sometimes depending on my protein needs I will have an evening snack okay if I get super busy one of my favorites and fastest snacks on the go by far hands down is the beverage mix all right type a little heart inside the comments if you love the beverage mix as much as I do it comes in peach mango or wild berry it's like protein kool-aid and the reason I love it so much is because it hydrates me it flavors my water I usually have a big thermos jug made up of it every day so I'm just sipping on it all throughout the day it keeps the hunger at bay it helps me to UM just stay on point and it's low calorie guys no sugar 70 calories with 15 grams of protein per serving like that is a huge win okay so um some other snack ideas I'm gonna go through a list from Susan Barrowman she's our registered nutritionist with Herbalife and she has 25 great snack ideas with a hundred and fifty calories or less so first neck idea is a protein snack bar now obviously the Herbalife bars are kind of no-brainers you don't have to worry about reading the labels or anything if you are using other bars one thing I would caution you is the carb count flip the label over if it's more than 18 grams of carbs I would say that protein bar is too much unless you are like doing some extensive exercising okay and I mean extensive all right so you want to stick to calories that are between 70 and 175 10 to 15 grams of protein we're talking snacks and 5 grams or less of fat and about 18 grams or less of carbs so our bars Herbalife bars fit all that criteria so a protein snack bar is a great thing to have because they're super portable you know individually wrapped you can put them in your bag and off you go another idea would be a mini smoothie so you can make your shake as normal and have a full meal or you can do half a serving of your shake and make like a mini smoothie and that'd be your snack hey taken the other thing I would say to you guys is if you ever get tired of drinking your shakes you know we always have several different kinds of recipes and how you can use the formula 1 to make waffles or pancakes or the mug cakes but did you know that you could also use the protein drink mix and formula 1 put just a little bit of water and make like a pudding so rather than putting in the full you know 8 ounces or so and making a shake if you're really not into drinking your meal or drinking a snack and you want to have something a little bit more I don't know sometimes I just want to eat you know what I mean if you're with me on that say I in the comments but making a mini smoothie or making a mini dish of pudding that's also a great idea too I've also have used the protein drink mix as a snack all by itself or you can make it like the consistency of a dip and cut up some apples and put in some PB fit with the vanilla protein drink mix and make like a peanut butter protein Apple dip that's a great idea yogurt is always a great go-to I prefer yogurts that don't have the fruit already in it you'll find that the ones that kind of have the fruit on the bottom there's a lot more sugar and and we don't need any of that so what I suggest getting is the vanilla flavored Greek yogurt and adding your own fresh fruit to it low-fat cottage cheese and chopped veggies so this is cottage cheese is kind of a weird consistency as some people like it some people don't um but low-fat cottage cheese is gonna be a great snack idea for you if you like it you can also you know mix up some vegetables and eat along with that and that's that tastes pretty good another idea would be vegetables and hummus so that's that's a go-to for me I love my my hummus nonfat latte so you make 12 ounces of low-fat milk or soy milk and sprinkle with cinnamon and that's gonna give you about 6 to 12 grams of protein so a nonfat latte would be a great snack idea hard-boiled eggs I can't tell you how many eggs I eat I eat a lot of eggs um in fact when I first got started I did not buy the extra protein boosters to boost protein in my shake so I would always have an egg with my breakfast shake not in my shake but like separately just to give me a little bit more protein but you know eggs are like what 60 calories I think so um they're low-calorie but you know good source of protein so I like hard-boiling eggs a lot a lot of them have a lot of hard-boiled eggs on hand and you can slice up a tomato and put a hard-boiled egg on top of it season it with salt and pepper that makes a yummy snack another idea is edamame I didn't even know what that was when I first started Herbalife but edamame is a really good source of protein you can get the frozen you can boil them in water for a few minutes sprinkle a little bit of sea salt excuse me and they're about 150 calories but 12 grams of protein they're great over salads but they're also really yummy all by themselves and I actually haven't had that in a while so next time I go to the grocery store which is tomorrow I think I'm gonna see if I can get me some edamame another great snack idea would be tuna and avocados I always have on hand a bunch of different flavored tuna packs one they're great for portability as well but they pack a lot of protein for a little bit of calories so I like that a lot turkey sticks um you know beef sticks anything like that you can wrap turkey breasts slices of turkey breasts around cucumber that's pretty yummy for about 120 calories but 25 grams of protein let's see what else tortilla and beans so you heat up two corn tortillas top it with 1/3 cup of cooked black beans and tomato salsa and that's gonna be 140 calories for seven grams of protein so hopefully that gets um your idea list started it's not an exhaustive list by any means of course we have our protein iced coffee which you can also make hot I really enjoy the coffee um either as a mid-morning or mid-afternoon between you know that and what is it the beverage mix those are those are simple easy fast snacks but if you're looking for others again go into the Facebook group results with Rachel if you're watching this from YouTube by the way and you're not part of the Facebook group would like to be just send me a message it will send you the invite to join but you want to go into the album's and under albums look for snack ideas and you'll see what I'm talking about there's also a recipe from my friend Lisa who made these coconut macaroon protein cookies those are pretty yummy if you like coconut so anyways hopefully that's that gives you some ideas there's also shake recipes and meal plans that kind of outline a typical day for someone who's on meal plan a B C D is not in there but um we don't have too many people on the D plan alright so hopefully that's helpful hi Wendy thanks for tuning in so my next question was what are macros macros is just a short way to say macro nutrients they're the big nutrients that our bodies needs such as protein fiber carbohydrates and fat so if you're using something like MyFitnessPal where you're tracking your macros tracking your calories tracking your protein and all that kind of thing I would recommend setting your macros to the following so protein is going to be 30% fat will be 30% and carbs will be 40% so 30 30 40 is the macro setting in MyFitnessPal if you are a woman do not go below 1200 calories you need to be consuming 1200 calories at minimum men need to be consuming 1500 calories at minimum also if you are breastfeeding or you're pregnant and you're using the nutrition you want to follow a 1500 calorie diet plan and if you go below these numbers guys what happens is your body thinks it's you're starving and so it goes into fat storage mode and it makes it very difficult for your body to burn fat and lose weight while maintaining muscle like so I suggest paying attention to that most often what I see from you guys is that we just get so busy and we don't eat enough so that takes me into my final question of the day which Wendy asked Wendy asked about you know what's the difference between our formula 1 replacement shake and the herbalife24 rebuild strength shake so in our 24 line it's designed for athletes it's designed for people like me who and you that go and get a good workout in okay and if you go to urban life 24 comm there is a ton of videos that you can watch detailing and reviewing educating you on each product and how to use it there's also free workouts available there there's testimonials so herbalife24 calm is a great resource for you guys you can also go into the pinned post of this group and there is the catalog ok and you can learn about all of the herbalife24 products right from the catalog as well but what I wanted to focus on was rebuild strength because Wendy asked it I'm actually just not too long ago rebuild strength comes in three different flavors we've got chocolate vanilla and strawberry hands-down my favorite is the chocolate it's like a chocolate Yahoo and it's the best reason to work out because then you get to drink it at the end so going back to what I was saying about making sure you're hitting your minimum and getting enough food tore out the day if you guys are incorporating exercise especially intense at least 20 to 30 minutes hardcore exercise you need to be following up that workout with something like rebuild strength because what happens is you know again our body is searching for the nutrients it needs to recover and rebuild and repair your muscles and if it doesn't have enough of it it's just gonna pull from other parts of the body and we don't want that we want to maintain our lean muscle mass we don't want to destroy it in our workout so we need to feed it we and the bigger our lean mass becomes the more Cowie calories we burn at rest which means we become a fat-burning machine so the simplest thing I can tell you to do is simply to order your rebuild strength the strawberry vanilla or chocolate tell me in the comments below which one is your favorite or which one you would choose it's like a Neapolitan I feel like menu and it's really light on the tummy so you don't have to worry about that but you have a 30-minute window following your activity and and I just recommend follow your nutrition plan as we've set it up for you you know getting you're enough of your protein and following the healthy guides that we gave to you from the beginning but then if you're incorporating more intense activity you want to follow up that work out with rebuild strength so rebuild strength it's made with whey and casein protein it's a different type of protein than most of our formula 1 flavors and it's going to rapidly sustain protein building state in your muscles so again it's it's for immediate and sustained muscle recovery and it tastes amazing so there's a try core protein amino blend free amino acids way encasing proteins again it helps to rebuild your muscle there's also iron which is essential for red blood cell reproduction many people are iron deficient unfortunately branched chain amino acids support muscle growth and l-glutamine supports the immune function and a and promotes muscle repair so you're just gonna feel great every time I go and have a really good workout and I drink my rebuild strength I can't tell you how many times I just feel amazing and my results speak for themselves so I would encourage you if you haven't tried it to try it there are 20 servings but depending on how you feel the intensity of the workout was you could simply have a half a serving if you had kind of a you know less intense workout day but if you're giving it your all and you're working out and you're breaking a sweat you know twenty to thirty minutes of activity then if you deserve you've earned your rebuild strength now there's also some other ways to use rebuild strength that I've used in the past I've if I've ever run out of PDM or I don't have soymilk or a base to make my regular shake with sometimes I will use a scoop of rebuild strength in my shake and especially in seasons where I am more consistent with working out the other way I've used it is I've actually taken a scoop of it and mixed Pb fit with it and made like a chocolate peanut butter dip that's another great snack idea and it tastes amazing I think I might have shared in a recent post too that if you mix a little bit of rebuild strength with coconut oil first of all you can freeze them and make these yummy little chocolate coconut treats that are to die for I'm a coconut lover I don't know how many of you love coconut I love coconut if you couldn't tell my husband does not like putting it all over my body I love eating it it's so good umm or you can you know put it over fruit like strawberries like I showed you in the picture Wendy and that that is amazing too so those are just some ideas for you guys I hope that's helpful every week Tuesday tips with Rachael here live at four thanks for tuning in and joining me if you have other questions go

"goPN7UqdZ5o": "we got time but no money but there ain't nobody stopping us hey everybody i thought i would share with you guys how i do my online grocery shopping i'm recording this through zoom and i apologize in advance my webcam was really not doing a good job so you won't be able to see me but you'll be able to hear me and i thought i would just spend a couple minutes i'm not going to do my whole grocery shopping with you guys online but i thought i would share with you my process which is i open up walmart and i open up kroger because those are the two stores that i compare prices at and then what i do is i make them half of my screen each so i shrink those down and then i'll pull up a product like you see here is coffee and then i'm gonna look at it to see who has the better price on coffee and that's when i add it to my cart so we're gonna go through just a few items today i've got on my phone and again you guys can't see this but if you watch my videos before you've seen me tell google hey google add such and such to my shopping list or something along those lines that's how my family adds things to the shopping list so we've done the dry erase board in the past and we've done the paper lists on the fridge and for my technologically savvy folks that live in my house which is so not me um they prefer being able to just voice command the shopping list and it has worked out so much better for us i even use it now um it's taken me almost two years to get on board with it but i love it now so on my shopping list i have coffee now this coffee is for my daddy they are coming for a visit and i happen to know that his favorite is this coffee right here so i'm gonna go ahead and add that to my cart and as i do i will check it off my list on my google app as you can see i already have some items in my cart because as i go through during the week if i'm in a room and i know we're out of something i'll open up the walmart app on my phone and go ahead and add it and i'll show you guys that in a minute so then let's look and see who has the best price on milk this week so i'll just go ahead and throw milk into both of the search boxes for both stores we drink one percent milk so it's 258 a gallon at walmart and it looks like at crooker it's 2.99 so i'm gonna grab two maybe three gallons of it at walmart and i am gonna go ahead and get a gallon of the one percent chocolate milk for my boys because it's also 258 for a gallon and then i'll just check that off of my list um the next thing on there is my son's sargento ultra thin i'm gonna spell it wrong at least twice sargento ultra thin so what i can do is if it's something like this i can just go ahead and copy and paste it and he likes the sharp cheddar because it packs a bunch of flavor into um into the slice and you can see here kroger only has the swiss and so that will definitely not do and it has a little coupon here so if i click on the coupon it's save a dollar on two if i click on more details sometimes that will pull up like this sharp cheddar that's what he really loves um so i can even try sargento cheddar so that would make it two dollars and fifty cents for each pack of cheddar so if they do have the ultra thin cheddar which it doesn't look like they do i would get two packs of that for five dollars as opposed to paying 268 for it at walmart but because they don't have the ultra thin cheddar i'm gonna come over here to walmart and i'm going to get him the ultra thin cheddar cheese and i yeah that's the sharp okay so we're good there then i need organic sugar now typically i get this at sam's club so i'm going to skip over that one i need brillo pads i don't know if you guys use brillo pads but we use them quite a bit and i typically will get this right here this pink wool pads 10 count um i'm going to scroll through really quick and look and see i haven't tried if you guys have tried the walmart brand um let me know what you think of them i tried them one time i believe and they fell apart pretty quickly so as you can see here the 10 count is 269 so walmart is definitely a better deal so that's what you're going to find on a lot of different things is that walmart typically is a lower price but because kroger right now has a mega sale going on i always check um just to make sure that it's not included and has a coupon just like with the cheese you could see that it was cheaper at kroger if they would have had it in stock so i'm looking for some furniture polish some dusting polish um for my house i pref i don't really care for this one um let me see if they have a better one there's the swiffer dusters there's the pledge i like the all surface one um i don't know if you guys have ever seen that yep this is the one i normally get that's why it says previously purchased that's the one that i normally get so i'm going to come over here and see if they have pledge and there is there's six of them this is oh see and they have a limit of two so because a the pandemic and then b's no apocalypse there's a lot of limits on a ton of items and so if i were going to buy one i can still click on it here and see that the price is normally 4.48 so it's just 21 cents more at kroger and i do need it um we are almost completely out they've got the citrus and they've got the rain shower so i think i'm going to grab a citrus and then i need lunch meat so let's see that's a really good one to compare because i do believe that kroger has lunch meat on sale my son still has some low sodium ham so i'm really just looking for um the rest of us so this black forest hand you'll see here that i already have two pounds in my cart because it's 5.99 a pound as opposed to 6.76 a pound for the one that we normally purchase so that is a really good deal and then we need sandwich pepperoni and i don't know if you guys like the bmt subs subway or the italian subs wherever it is that you prefer to get your sub but my younger two boys love sandwich pepperoni and hard salami so i'll go up here boris had a 7.99 i typically don't buy boar's head unless i'm buying the low sodium items for my oldest son so over here we've got the primadella sandwich pepperoni so i'm going to go ahead and grab one but i i only want well i guess i could do a pound because there's going to be several of us here so you guys get the gist right i need some screen cleaner for electronics because we are almost out we clean our computer monitors and our tvs with the special screen cleaners that you get so um i don't particularly like the little towels those are good for like your phones and stuff to keep in your bag i still have a ton of those i like the actual spray that you use and i don't see it here so that might be something i have to get on amazon this time around but they make a special screen cleaner i usually get the one from philips that walmart sells i don't see it here and we use that on our electronics so i'll have to get that on on amazon and then my youngest son needs a hamburger he put that on the google shopping list all of these items that i'm going through right now are just things that my kids have put onto the google home shopping list and i'm just going through and um looking for what they want so this is the one that he he had and both of the handles are now broken he's had it about six years so it's done a decent job so i think what i will get him i wonder if this comes in a different color because he will not be happy with that teal color um but i'm gonna pick out a hamper for him and get that in the cart and then i'm gonna finish going through all of the stuff there's literally 25 more items on the shopping list out of my google but i'm going to do that off screen so that you guys don't have to sit through the whole thing but the whole point of it was to show you that you can compare prices at two places even though you are shopping online for grocery pickup if that's how you prefer to do it for us that's what we are doing and so you can shop online and especially stores like kroger if you're picking an item like let's do let's do the organic sugar just to see um if there is a sale going on it's in yellow if there is um a coupon you'll see a little thing up there like i showed you before where it says coupon you can click on it and find out the details that's how i save money i do use my ibotta right now it's not linked to kroger but i can go into here i can look at my list of things that i have already added to my ibotta and if there's a rebate that i think i want to get like let's say that i wanted to get this um raisin bran right so you've got your raisin bran it's a dollar back if i click on shop it literally takes me to the items that are included and on walmart's website they actually highlight the audit item with a box around it so as soon as that loads i'll show you guys but any of the raisin brands that count for this rebate have this green one dollar and then they even change the color like if it's a different size and it only qualifies for this 50 cent rebate then it's a different color you can add it here and that helps you identify so if i wanted to get the dollar back on one box of cereal i would add this one to the cart if it's and i bought a rebate where it says you must buy two that'll be listed right here at the top of the box it'll say must buy two let me see if i can find one of those to show you guys um let's see here's a must buy two so if i click on shop on the good things it's going to highlight the box around them the ones that are included and it'll say must buy two right there see it must buy two so it's checked off because it is loaded on my card and you get two dollars and fifty six cents back when you buy two so it's because they're two dollars and fifty six cents that's buy one get one free which is a really really good price um these are gluten-free crackers i do buy them for my husband they're great to throw in the baseball bag to take to tournaments for him to snack with like a gift to go peanut butter cup or um i make him egg salad or tuna salad or something to keep in the cooler or you get the flavored crackers and have them with some hummus so there's tons of options for him with those or just good old-fashioned cheese and crackers so that's how i use the ibotta that's how i use it for online shopping if there's an ibotta bonus going on i typically will do a lot of ibotta shopping um right now on my ibotta there is a 10 bonus if i get 40 office 40 offers before march 29th so because march 29th is 11 days away that would mean that i have 11 days or basically two shopping trips and i would need to add 20 offers to each shopping trip to qualify for that additional 10 i'll take a look at it i don't know if i'm going to do it but i'll certainly take a look because they did just upload a bunch of new offers to ibotta so i'll take some time and go through that and i'll let you guys know in my grocery haul that is after this i'm gonna add all of that to one big video i'll let you guys know what i decided to do so i hope that this answers some questions i know a couple of you've asked me to share how i decide what i'm buying and where i'm buying it and to share my shopping with you guys i hope that this helps if it doesn't leave me some comments suggestions or questions below and i am happy to do that for you guys i want to help you feed your family and save as much money as possible and you guys always help me your comments and your feedback i have learned so much from you guys so please share those below and um the next part of this that you guys are going to see is the actual grocery haul you'll see everything i got from both stores and then we'll do the meal plan and the cost breakdown okay so i went ahead and finished putting in everything off of my google home list and i went through ibotta which took a really long time it's now 1 30 in the afternoon so i don't know that i'm going to be able to get these today i should be able to get kroger but walmart may have to wait till tomorrow anywho that being said i wanted to show you guys i did go ahead and add i think it's 22 or so of the ibotta offers so i could get half way towards my bonus and then try to get the other half by next week um we i went ahead and finished so my ibotta offers kind of start right here at the the busy bone i got a couple little bones for my little dog and all the way down if you follow this walmart list all the way down not these two liters of soda but this one yes all the way down to [Music] the triscuit crackers so all of those items other than the ones that i i showed you were excluded are i bought a deals so what will be interesting is to see exactly how many of those i actually get in my pickup as you see here my total is 163 dollars and 70 cents which is close to what our weekly budget is for groceries right now um we did take a little bit of our um money out of the gas sinking fund and put it into grocery because we had some extra i'll go over all of that in my weekly check-in on financial friday then over here in kroger's you guys can see these pizzas are on a coupon deal for 3.49 so i did go ahead and max out that coupon at five i got some chick-fil-a sauce for my boys these are on sale four for ten dollars so that's almost like buy two get two free you can see the little by four for ten right here there's that two pounds of ham we talked about these are on sale um and i my son likes these for baseball this is also on sale and i can't remember if it's i'm gonna click over and i'm gonna regret it but i'm gonna do it anyway yeah so 30 cents on those and you can use that coupon up to five times and then for the downy unstoppables i have both a digital coupon and a paper coupon and so i'll be using that that's why there's only one in my cart and if you watched my video on monday you saw that i ran out of the little beads that i put in my vacuum canisters to help put fresh air out every time we vacuum these are absolute favorite water enhancers there is a dollar off one coupon you can use five times so this will come down by five dollars to twelve dollars and forty five cents for five which is around 250 a piece a pretty good deal all of the snyder's pretzels there is a coupon you can use up to five times i believe that it is one dollar off so we got some of the sour cream and onion pretzels and the pretzel rods those are my boys favorite for taking for baseball yeah it's one dollar off of the pretzels so those are my boys absolute favorite pretzel rods they like to take them and dip them in the gift to go peanut butters between baseball games it's good protein helps put back some of the sodium that he loses while he's sweating and playing the sport so it's kind of a win-win there and we do share those with the other kiddos there at the ball fields i am going to go ahead and bump this up so that i use the full five these pudding cups are 10 for 10 there's a coupon digital coupon for a dollar off of any five you can use that coupon up to five times so i got a bunch here you're gonna see a mix between the regular and the sugar freeze and then for the kool-aids there's a digital coupon that makes each of these kool-aids end up being one dollar off so that makes them 99 cents for a 10-pack of the kool-aid jammers you can use that coupon up to five times so i did go ahead and get five of those those are so great to throw in the cooler if you're running to the pool or for uh baseball tournaments and things of that nature for my little guy who's um hanging out with us then the tide i have a coupon for three dollars off that's a paper coupon there's also a digital coupon for three dollars off so i will get six dollars off and end up paying 5.99 for this 92 ounce the all of these cereals it's a coupon you can use up to five times it's a dollar off so for about 14 worth of cereal i'm gonna pay about nine dollars for five of them which is a little less than two dollars a box and then the jello was the same thing there's a digital coupon for that the dunkin donuts cereal there's an ibotta and a digital coupon for that as well as the post um cereal i want to say was a dollar off one up two five times yeah a dollar off of one and any time you click on more details it's going to tell you how many times that you can use it right here it says use up to five times in a single transaction so that's what i did with that um so again my query total that you see won't be anything close to what it's going to be when i finally check out because all of the digital and paper coupons come off after you purchase it um so i got two of the cocoa i can go ahead and bump that to three and two of the marshmallow fruity pebbles and again this fourteen dollars of cereal is going to end up being about nine dollars for five boxes and then for the pringles the same kind of thing um the lightly salted for my oldest son the regular for my other boys and this is 50 cents off of a single can they're on sale for a dollar 49 so they end up being 99 cents a can for pringles pringles travel really well inside of a baseball bag you guys in case you're wondering they do travel really well so with all of the coupons and things coming off at the end that's my favorite part when i get to see how much i actually save and my total right now is at 188 that's what they're gonna charge my card then once i pick it up and get my final total i'll get to see how much i saved there's a digital coupon for a dollar off sarah lee bread so i'm pretty excited about this one and i will share with you guys what it ends up being all right so here is a quick scan of everything that i got in my walmart order this was a really really good week because there were only like five or six things that they were out of stock of so you guys have seen most of this at the beginning of this video when i

baseball bag is almost completely empty so that's a restock they did have the axe body scrubs that i was telling you guys about that are like loofah on one side and then this washcloth spongy thing on the other side and then it's got this like grip on the side and my boys love those so we replaced those then i got another package of these scotch brite sponges i had put the blue ones in my cart that are safe for your coated skillets and pans but they were out of stock of those these are and i bought a rebate um they were three dollars and then you got a dollar back so it was two bucks for this pack and they work really well got a little pack of chew nola's for my shih tzu this was and i bought a rebate i got um you guys saw me get the women's degree for the baseball bag in my last haul this is actually the men's which um also will go in the baseball bag then i was able to finally and it was a limit of one i was able to get the foaming hand wash to refill our method um foaming hand soaps in our bathrooms i got that box of 10 brillo pads i got some soft soap liquid hand soap refill for the the regular honey hand soap these were and i bought a rebate where you got five dollars back on two so it's basically buy one get one free it is the secret outlast i got one that's tea tree and one that's almond oil and i have not tried either of those since before and then i got three of these these are just little um collapsible cups that i want to keep in the baseball bag um when i may keep one in a little like zip pouch in my purse or something this is if you know if we're out somewhere um and don't have anything or if we've got the little dog with us or something like that they're not very expensive and they're pretty easy and small on space you guys can see they're about the size of the palm of your hand maybe a little bigger and then i replaced jackson's laundry camper so all in all that is it for the walmart haul we pick up our kroger hall here in a little bit and then i will film that and go through it with you guys all right so here is what i was able to get from kroger there are a couple of mishaps i'll go through those with you guys here in just a second but we're going to start down here where it's a little easier these are the five crystal light water enhancers that are the blueberry raspberry those are our favorite right now they were part of the buy five savor i'm sorry digital coupon times five times event so those were a dollar off i got a two pound bag of baby carrots and then the saber hummus i got one roasted pine nut and one classic that's a favorite for us then i got two of the six packs of diet pepsi and two of the six packs of coke zero those are for the coolers for baseball i got one of this purple rainberry um gatorade then i got five of the kool-aid jammers and i got all kinds of different flavors fruit punch um blue raspberry cherry grape and strawberry kiwi we'll throw those in the cooler the fresh out of pizzas that after the coupon ended up being 3.49 i got pepperoni couple two or three pepperonis and then there's a veggie under there and another pepperoni the ham is one of the things they messed up i ordered two pounds of ham they only gave me one which i don't know how that happened but we'll see how that goes um i did finally get a bottle of the chick-fil-a sauce i've tried to order this a couple of times i finally got some i got one package of lower sodium bacon it was on sale and there was a dollar forty digital coupon which helped out a lot our absolute favorite ground beef which is the 90 lean nolan ryan angus ground beef was on sale for 3.99 a pound which is a steal so there's 10 of those in there i did not take those out back here we've got all the cereal that you guys saw in my online order we've got the fruity pebbles with marshmallows here cocoa pebbles cinnamon toast crunch honey nut cheerios and then we tried the dunkin donuts mocha latte because they ended up being a really good deal right back here under the pieces i've got three bags of the ranch sunflower seeds for baseball here we've got all of the jellos that i ordered some of them are snack packs some of them are jello brand um i did get a variety just to have so there's sugar free there's chocolate there's lemon there's some chocolate vanilla some chocolate fudge and a banana back there these were a substitution i had ordered the sour cream and onion and they sent me uh just says seasoned with a buttery blend of spices so we've never had these before so i don't know how that's gonna go but i'm sure somebody will eat them i got three bags of the pretzel rods again we like these in the baseball bag to eat with peanut butter i got three cans of regular pringles and two cans of the lightly salted one loaf of bread the pledge cleaner the downy unstoppables this was a substitution um if they gave me the bigger one for the same price smells really good and then one tied downy sport so all in all not too bad i think there were four or five items only that they were out of stock and couldn't substitute so i will call them about the ham tomorrow and let them know and we'll go from there so last little piece of this and i can wrap this video up when i talked to you guys before about changes that were coming to my channel one of those includes that i'm gonna have to be even more flexible with my meal planning so what i've done here is i've actually made out almost a three week meal plan this one's two and a half weeks and i've just put a bunch of meals on here ffys means fend for yourself that usually means leftovers or something out of the freezer or fix yourself a sandwich or something along those lines clean out the fridge nights i do those when we've cooked a lot of heavier meals like we've got meatloaf balsamic pork loin spaghetti you know we've got several of the larger meals that there will be leftovers for so i added in i clean out the fridge night after leftovers so real quickly i'm going to run through these meal ideas and what we'll do is even though i've got them next to a date i really will use this more of a master list and pull from it um the day or two before and decide what we're going to eat except for my son's birthday so on monday we've got shake and baked pork chops a north side for part of my family and then a baked potato um or baked sweet potato for low sodium and gluten free then peas and some biscuits and then on tuesday we're having taco tuesday with chips and homemade queso wednesday we'll do some type of breakfast for dinner thursday's going to be shrimp alfredo garlic bread and salad if you haven't watched that cook with me i do my shrimp alfredo in the instant pot it is fantastic friday's gonna be leftover saturday is my oldest 15th birthday so we're doing wings fries cake and ice cream sundae will be meatloaf mashed potatoes and corn monday will be a balsamic pork loin with sweet potatoes broccoli and baked apples this was on the menu before and we didn't get it made because life happens tuesday is white bean chicken chili with some chips wednesday is your friend for yourself thursday april the 1st i've got spaghetti salad and garlic bread then a leftovers a homemade pizza and stromboli night a clean out the fridge night they've requested chicken philly cheese steaks again but they want curly fries with it this time instead of chips and then chipotle bowls with chips and queso and denver omelet casserole with bacon and biscuits so the reason i gave you the full two and a half weeks is because i don't know what we're gonna be eating every night this is just sort of a list for me to pull from i have purchased most everything that's non-perishable has been purchased for all two and a half weeks there's some perishable items that i may have to purchase like some more green peppers and things of that nature more mushrooms but those are really easy peasy to come by and i'm not real worried about it i will have to buy a little bit more ground beef because i only bought enough ground beef to make the tacos and the um meatloaf and i still have to make my son's low sodium burgers for the week if you've seen those before in my setup videos so that's the meal plan guys and that's going to wrap up this week's grocery haul and meal plan and i want to again thank issa for the idea of showing you guys how i shop online since i'm not yet going into stores to do my shopping and how i try and maximize my savings that way and find my deals i hope you guys like that please let me know in the comment section below if you did if you didn't you can also let me know that too just be generous in your feedback with um and tell me what it was that you thought would have gone a little bit better or what i could add to make it better i would appreciate so until next time guys i hope you're having an amazing weekend i hope you're with your family enjoying beautiful weather and i will see you in the next video take care everybody [Music] bye-bye you", "0IJdf0WQFrM": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

really excited about tonight because in the past a lot of people know in the history of our company meal prep played a important role uh as we were developing the seasonings as a solution to the problem of meal prepping for us so i'll tell you a little bit of back story but first i want to tell you a little bit about what we're going to do tonight okay so uh first of all really excited for you joining us and i hope that you get something from this class because uh these tips tricks and recipes that we're going to do and i hope will mean something to you and be able to help you make it cooking easier tastier and healthier so that's what we're really looking for and that's the fact our company's slogan easier tastier and healthier so uh a little bit about uh well we'll do breakfast we'll do lunch we'll do dinner and there's two main areas where we're talking about meal prep there's like refrigerated meal prep you could do stuff for a few days ahead of time and then there's frozen meal prep which you could do for a month at a time if you want to we'll talk a little bit about those there's benefits and drawbacks to both uh types and we'll go into a little bit more about various breakfast lunches and dinners and do some demos today specifically we're going to be doing uh fajitas beef fajitas for dinner tonight and we'll also be demoing a really fantastic and relatively healthy fruit snack that's made with zucchini all right and we actually have some going right here right now so first a little back story on the food prep is that i was a baker a chef a cake decorator just food was my life i'm kind of defined by my love for food but i realized early on in my adulthood i didn't really want to work nights weekends and holidays the rest of my life and still try to raise my family i was like you know i have to be there for my kids and whatnot i went to college i got an i.t degree and i spent 15 years in corporate i.t so that's the background so even though i love food and like i can't get enough of it still after coming home from work like i'm the cook in the household so immediately like as soon as i get home from work like my kids are not just hungry they're like literally starving food now anyway and it takes time it takes a little time you got to think about it you got like what do we have on hand what can i make what's fast what will everybody eat and all those kind of questions all right and so that's what sort of fueled the idea of making save the day seasonings right and we started with the always incredible this was the all-purpose blend we just made and i was like if i had some seasonings that would work on anything no matter what i put it on i could make the food anything i want mexican italian the obvious incredibles all-purpose so you could do anything you want with any like meats veggies pastas anyway they worked so well that that's why we started save the day seasonings because of uh making that meal prep like i figured if i love food and still would get frustrated like if you didn't love food or if like food was a chore for you or even if you love food too still you have to take the effort to do so so that's the whole goal for tonight is to make it easier all right so that's what we want to do so first of all i'm going to tell you a little bit about what happened right here with the this is the zucchini fruit snacks okay and guys these are ridiculou i can't imagine that these aren't like known to the world right now okay so what we have here is some cubed up zucchini all right and so if you've ever had a garden and you've ever grown zucchini you know that if it comes on like it can come on and so you end up with like 10 zucchinis and when you probably end up with is like zucchini like this okay so this is from uh the mother-in-law's garden uh we have a garden as well which we're going to be using some of that guard stuff tonight but like when you have this what do you do with it like nothing there's not like it doesn't it's not good for saute because it ends up being more spongy than usual ironically this is the ideal zucchini others could be used but this is the ideal because there's so much volume and the texture just right to make these perfect fruit snacks so you don't have to now throw those away or take up all that room in the compost bin but you can just cut up you peel it and then you cut it and you cut out the little seed portion in the middle and then you can dice it into like half inch and then you get it going with here and it's mixed with one frozen can or one can of frozen fruit juice and mixed also with one can of water so that's it those ingredients and we're going to boil that for about 30 minutes i believe it's been going for maybe 15. got there about 15. but it doesn't necessarily need to be time because this needs to look translucent and that's the right uh so it'll it'll uh it'll be pretty clear when we show you how it takes about 30 minutes so you use that as your gauge but then you look at the end and see the translucency of it and that'll make it easy for you to tell when it's ready all right we've got a lot of friends joining us i'd like to say hi to some of those some of our consultants here we have jessica newkirk stephanie pennington carrie seavy cheryl myers and audrey flounders flanders sorry rachelle bell and margaret snyder so we got lots of friends here that's great okay and anybody else that joins us tonight that is these are eyes are our consultants we're a direct sales company but a different kind of direct sales company we want to make sure that every order we get goes through one of our consultants and so uh we have a list of their websites and i do believe that is going to be posted in the yes i've already posted it she's already and i'll post it again so that you have a list of those websites to find a consultant near you uh and again if you go right to the company's website that's just fine we'll move it along to a consultant all right uh so let's uh go over what we're gonna cover so like i said we're gonna make the beef fajitas we're going to show you a little bit of the end process of the fruit snacks but we're really going to talk a lot about meal prep and about different kinds of meal prep and ways that you can just make your life much easier because we all have to eat every single day three meals every single day right and if you have kids or family younger kids uh picky eaters then those are factors that go into the level of stress or anxiety in your life so uh let's talk a little bit first of all we're going to do throughout here we're going to do some trivia questions we'll have some prizes to give out and uh chiefly we have some of our variety packs here as our favorite variety pack by the way we have a number of products i just want to show you really quick the products that we have if you don't mind jan pan and we can just show some of the products that we have the travel size jars the refill pouches for our regular glass jars we have things like the griller's pack which is a six pack of jars and our special this month is the two bulk pack these are normal these are the volume of five of these glass jars and uh retail for twenty four dollars and uh they're two four thirty nine for this month okay no code needed or anything and then we're going to talk a little bit about our save the day sweetenings now this is the new product line for us and uh really really awesome things that you can do with this we're going to use some of these in those fruit snacks and they are fantastic and so we have a universal baking mix that you can use to make all kinds of different baked goods including also pancakes and crepes and things like that and seven different sweet flavors all right so we can talk more about that but if anybody has questions just post the question no problem one thing to note all of our seasonings and sweetenings are gluten free the only thing that is not would be the universal baking mix so that does have flour in that just a little fyi and you know the baking mix is made in a separate facility than the rest of the products so they're all gluten free but we are going to be coming out with a gluten-free baking mix at some point right so we just have to develop that first all right okay uh let's talk about some basic tips and tricks about generally speaking food prep all right so you have different meals and the thing is a lot of food prep and things that i've seen out there they cater to very specific tastes or needs or anyway we each have our own style that of cooking that we like types of food that we like so i like to teach and just like with the seasonings like you can use them on any food the things i want to talk about tonight will be applicable to all kinds of different stuff so you can take what we're talking about later we'll talk about rice and noodle dishes right that you can freezer meal ahead of time and you can just move those same concepts over to other types of foods in the same sort of category i'll clarify that more as we go along but we'll be doing things like that but if you're doing for the say the next few days and going to refrigerate let's just go ahead and start with breakfast all right because we'll do breakfast and then that sort of example will tell you how apply those similar concepts also to lunch and dinner and to our snacks so with breakfast we're going to we have recipes oh i forgot to mention the recipes that are gonna be uh talked about today are also gonna be available uh in the group page i think jen puts those in the group page and so that you have access to those recipes and so i've got some add-on recipes as well that are not necessarily related to meal prep but that i just have also made so with breakfast we have the yogurt parfait is a really good one so if you like yogurt or if you want to help improve that morning diet yogurt is really good for digestion typically speaking you know it but it's lactose of course you have to be not lactose intolerant or anything but basically you can do up ahead of time a series of those with some fresh fruit in there but if you have the yogurt sandwiching the fresh fruit it stays stays good longer right it's the exposure to oxygen and air that makes those berries go bad faster so you can do those and they're good for several days in there so you can layer you know a half cup or so or more of yogurt in a it could be wine glass if you want it can be a cup that's tall and skinny it could be anything that you want or a mason jar if you want to put a lid on it and take it to go mason jar is a great idea because in fact that's probably the best idea if you have a small mason jar to be able to do that otherwise you'll have to wrap it you know with uh with a saran wrap in fact you would wrap it with saran and put a rubber band over the top if you just wanted to do that for a regular cut if you just have that so that works too but just do that and you can layer a quarter cup or half cup of berries in between you can pick your berries you could do mixed berries or whatever and you could also do frozen berries if you want and then as those thaw they're going to be mushier but they're not like going to go bad so if you want a softer sort of more like eating uh fruity yogurt like when you buy a store or fruit at the bottom use frozen berries because when they thaw they'll be more mushy but they'll taste fantastic so you can do that if you want and then granola is a good one but don't put the granola in when you make them like right before you eat them then you just toss granola on top and you can mix that in because the granola will get soggy on you all right so that's one way to do a quick meal prep ahead of time for a few days if you want could even last a little bit more than that depending and then if you wanted to do something where you freeze things ahead of time a lot of people don't know like pancakes and waffles you can actually make and freeze and most of them most recipes for those work in the freezer and then you can actually pull them out and you can put them in a toaster thawed or frozen if you put them in frozen they're going to end up more crispy you put them in well and if you put in more frozen more crispy on the outside less uh i guess cooked or heated through on the inside but if if they are uh uh refrigerated they'll be extra crispy and he dog i prefer actually have them frozen but i like that texture a little bit more it tastes more like they're coming right out of the waffle so maybe do it either way so you're saying like if on a saturday you're making pancakes or waffles with your family make extra and then just freeze them and in fact i recommend you know like almost all aspects of life if you can build something into something you already do that's habitual already that just thinks takes a little extra work but then if you had to do it all over again like it would be a lot of work so like making pancakes is a great example if you make pancakes and you're like well i eat pancakes once twice a week whatever however often you do it then you would make pancakes and then you'd have to make them again but if you made enough for two three weeks then you can put them in the freezer and as long as you guys like it that way then you can do that ahead of time and you don't have to redo and that's what makes your life easier it's one less thing that you have to do in the future okay we're having a hard time hearing i'm i'm missing a bunch of comments sorry let me let me look down here people are saying it's hard to hear so maybe just talk louder okay and you know what i tend to be a mumbler okay so i don't i i'm gonna try to enunciate a little bit better uh and then let me know right now let us know how you're hearing us like if right now this voice is working great i'll try to keep it right there i'll try to be close to you as well and then uh so just thank you for letting us know okay uh all right so there's other things you can do for breakfast like if you have uh pork sausage patties you guys like breakfast sandwiches a lot you can just cook up all the sausage patties ahead of time and put them in the freezer and then when you want to uh make your breakfast sandwich they usually nuke it for just a little bit instead of having to get out the pan and cook the sausage again right little things like that where it might make making a breakfast sandwich okay i'll just cook the egg rather have to cook the egg and the sausage little things like that that might help you right so things you're already doing if you think ahead and say if i do one more thing right now how's that going to help me later i mean it's a good strategy in life anyway right that's what we want to do still a little louder if you can all kinds of investing okay well you just shout at us okay i'll try i will try to shout so i'm not sure why it's not working that well man because it literally she's right in front of me and i'm speaking very loud so uh so that's a little bit about breakfast right so what we want to do is incorporate into our normal routine as much as possible and then make adjustments where we can so that our normal routine is expanded so much so that's a new normal right so now i always make pancakes for a month right if that works for you again find those things that work for you and your family and really hone in on those things okay they're saying that's better okay good go so we'll stay about this distance then if we can so let's get going on the fajitas all right so i'm going to i know i i was i was turning away that i didn't want to talk because i wanted to be loud enough so i'm going to use there's a couple ways that you can do and this is just a general cooking tip okay is that i'm going to use a steel pan rather than a non-stick pan so you can use a non-stick pan and that'll be just fine and you can cook the fajita stuff and all the stuff together there if you want to but you wouldn't want to use the technique i'm going to show you in this pan okay this is where we're going to scrape the bottom after we're done cooking and get lots of good flavor accumulation it's just a if you want to like raise the restaurant value of the food you make at home and you have like dishes that are not nonstick like a steel pan like that this is one technique that is not just good for this but for like almost anything you saute okay and i'll show you a little trick that will make your food like restaurant quality almost every time but with the seasonings that makes it even easier okay so really quick i want to bring it right over here where what we've done for fajitas and now i've made some adjustments because i love to make adjustments when i have to like we need a certain ingredient don't have it then let's see what we can do so today i decided since we have a garden we're growing several different kinds of peppers but no bell peppers and we use typically traditionally fajitas always use bell peppers and onions and so i actually picked some of the banana peppers because jen and i really like banana pepper and i'm like i'm just gonna try it like i could run to the store and get some bell peppers but you know what let's just go to the garden and let's just try it right so we'll just try that i advise people to take risks when it's safe to take risks right when your kids are cranky like your picky eaters are extra picky that's not the time to take a risk i'm taking a risk with just me and jen so no problem there otherwise if your kids like fajitas and you change it up on them then like you can really mess things up so i have some beef here we're gonna do beef fajitas and with fajitas traditionally it's sliced in strips right rather than chopped and diced and so this is just some round steak that was that i just chopped up uh we had made had some regular steak with it last night for dinner and this was what was left not enough for like a meal but great for fajitas so it's great if you have a smaller amount of meat you can incorporate that into a stir fry or fajita or a burrito or something like that so you can stretch that piece of protein out feed your whole family then okay instead okay i don't have enough steak for everybody so okay so we're gonna do that uh did the oil i love these little spray bottles that you can get from restaurant supply and even maybe even walmart or something like that uh but we'll put a little oil in there oh you know what i'm going to turn that down because i wanted to show you really quick i did this on purpose that might not have to get my knife here is it because i wanted to chop the onion while you guys were watching because i wanted to show you how i cut it and also mention that with onions there's a lot of different ways to cut it and still get to the same results so different people cut onions a different way and so there's not like right or wrong ways they're just your way so a lot of times i'll look in the fridge and i'll find an onion like this that's cut and the peels on on the outside whereas i will always remove the entire peel from the outside and and then i'm left with just the onion that i can cut and then i cut from that so and then once you get to the onion then i'm just thinking that's not right or wrong that just is that's fine uh then once it's here you can either cut it in half right and then cut smaller pieces you can cut from right the edge what our goal is to have strips right strips of onion and you can see this one's cut like not exactly down the middle so there's going to be a little lecture so in order to get strips i'm just going to go ahead and cut like this and be real careful you know when you're cutting uh and just like that and you see they're going to be about like that and that's just fine looks like nice little strips of onion we're going to cook this with the vegetables but this is what i want to do really quick this one i want to show you with this pan so if you're if you're making this for a freezer meal are you doing it any different than if it was for for eating right away yeah well i'm going to talk a little bit about the freezer or the meal prep part of this which is i'm only doing right now just a demo amount just enough for us to eat tonight but with this go ahead and cook a bunch of beef because this will freeze just fine once you could and with peppers and onions they do not freeze well now this is going to be a little bit loud i'm sorry i'll try to talk loud with the peppers and that is they do not freeze raw all right but you can saute them and they'll be just fine and so that's why we're going to do it and we can do as much as we want here and then freeze it in portion sizes whatever is for our family for one meal and you simply pull that out and then you can thaw it and then just reheat it and you're ready to go right already seasoned already flavored so with this so you've got that about medium high it looks like yeah it's medium high you want it pretty darn warm not not like cool it's like stir fry heat keep it hot and we have the mexican seasoning we're going to use this and we're going to use a little the alvey's incredible as well all right so i'm gonna put this on and you see i'm using a metal spatula don't use a metal on a non-stick surface and i'm gonna cook this and so the juices this is what i'll tell you whenever you're doing anything that incorporates meat and vegetables if you do it this way you'll be able to get a lot more flavor out of what you're cooking rather than throwing it all together which you can do you can throw it all together the meat and vegetables and cooking just fine but if you cook the meat cook it part of the way and then season it which is what i'm doing right here a little bit and i have the recipe which has the amounts but a little bit always incredible which gives it a nice pop and that mexican seasoning which gives that great mexican flavor we're actually those juices from the meat are cooking and they're also getting stuck on the pan and so we have these and we're kind of just going to flash cook them okay and i'm going to now take this but you can see that we're starting to get a little coating on the bottom all right i'm just going to set those aside right here [Music] now i've got that on the heat and i'm just fine with these pans these are nice pans it doesn't matter if they're super hot i can still pour the water on with that without the danger of them like warping and so that's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna put a little bit of oil back and i'm going to add these vegetables okay which is going to be in this case just the onions and peppers okay yeah rochelle belle says she freezes her fresh peppers all the time and uses them to cook later you know that's that's really interesting because you know i've had it work and i've had it not work but when they sometimes the time they end up mushy like they end up like maybe cook with them maybe depending on what you're cooking it can work okay so we got that and so what i'm going to do i have my water right here i'm going to add a little water right that's about a tablespoon one to two tablespoons of water and i've got the heat cranked up on that and so what that's going to do it's going to get all the as you look at these look at the pan all those flavors now are off the bottom right oh yeah they were not burnt and that's really really important to know that they were not burnt they were just cooked on there and they didn't have a chance to really get black and burnt and you don't want that but what happens here is that you have the actual flavor of the meat the flavor of the spices and it's been like sort of rehydrated and with the vegetables use this technique with a stir fry use it with pasta noodles and vegetables like an italian noodles or use it like with the fajitas or something like that because what we're going to do is i'm going to cook this all the way through until these guys are tender crisp is about ripe for fajitas a lot of people like a little bit more cooked than that so cook it too the way you like it and you can add a little bit more mexican a little bit more alvey's incredible which is what we're gonna do yeah um the consultants that are here joining us tonight please put your uh shopping links in the comments and uh that way everybody knows where to order from that's smelling really good i know you guys can't smell it but it's getting me hungry so that there is onions and peppers yes i'm using peppers yeah and we're using the banana pepper here just as an experiment yes typically you use green bell peppers which are red or any any color bell pepper and i recommend you stick it with that unless you want to test it or try it yourself i'm going to let you know we're going to let you know how this is but basically when this is ready then we're ready to go with fajitas and so i'm going to do a quick plate up here so i'm going to let her show that one grab a plate yeah let's take a look and see how this is coming and you know what i'm thinking is maybe we should consider doing some trivia giveaway uh let me let me give a little stir to these zucchini because it looks like they're almost getting translucent loosened so you can see that zucchini is absorbing all of the fruit juices just like a sponge which is going to make those fruit snacks a veggie fruit snack but you don't taste the zucchini you just taste the fruit juice all right so jen show this again really quick because what happened here it happens a lot is that it gets dry again right and the seasonings start cooking onto the pan again and have the danger of becoming burnt if so add another tablespoon of water or a couple tablespoons and that's what i did that would come around this way that'll keep it from getting burned and it also has a steaming effect on the vegetables to help them actually cook quicker so use that technique to also help your food cook a lot faster because it adds that quick hot steam and so those are actually done ready to go sorry about my dog he's a bad dog all right and so here's our fajita meat just add that right to it and uh actually i'm just going to leave it off because it's already semi-warm and that's ready to go now let me tell you some of the traditional thing now you can just freeze this freeze it right up just like that put it in portion cups bowls whatever you think we use and you can do that would you want it to cool first before you put in the freezer does that matter absolutely you want to cool yeah i should have been clear about that and now one danger zone about freezer meals is the danger of uh throwing it in there and never using it they have a tendency we have a tendency being habitual creatures to do the work and put the food there and then it sits there right and we forget about it it just it happens sometimes uh but make a reminder for yourself right make a little calendar do something that works for you and label it label it's really labeling is really important and storage is really important too and we'll we'll have just a brief segment on storage which is an important part of it because it stays fresher longer if you can store it properly can we give away uh one of our let's do it okay trivia question yes so this is is this uh specifically for non-consultants uh well i don't know are there some non-consultants i think so i think so i don't know anyway let's just go ahead we'll try okay what year okay so we have a couple of new seasoning blends that we've announced recently and uh in honor of those new season blends which are number one at garlic blend and number two a melt your face hot blend featuring the carolina reaper and the scorpion pepper which are the two hottest peppers in the world what year did the carolina reaper enter the guinness book of world records as the hottest pepper on earth oh that's a good trivia question so win a prize put the answer in yeah the first person to get the correct answer i should say the first customer to the first customer to put the correct answer in the comments you will get the variety pack sent to you okay and you know what if you win then we're gonna send you a free sample of our new garland blend which hasn't even gone out and so even samples for testing exciting uh okay how are we doing on time 6 30 okay good so we have that let's do a plate up really quick okay fajita and i'm so sorry because i need a tortilla oh the tortillas yes i'm just going to pan the products that we have again all of our seasonings are gluten free no msg no additives fillers dyes or preservatives our special this month is two bulk any two bulk sizes uh flavors for 39 normally one bulk is 24 so that's a fabulous deal and then we also have our different sweetening blends as well that we will highlight here shortly with our fruit snacks okay one thing i really love to do is not serve a fajita or burrito with a cold tortilla all right don't start off with a colder tip and typically with a fajita they're uh soft taco sized flour tortillas but this is what we have on hand so no problem we'll make it like a burrito style fajita that's great but i will you can heat up for about 10 seconds in the microwave you can have a pan with nothing on it that you can just eat that over or you can put over an open flame if you want and just drag it back and forth over an open flame if you want to it makes a big difference on how good it tastes my family my dad's side of the family's from india so we grew up with uh eating something called roti we did a lot of and that's a flat bread indian flatbread and you do a lot of heating things right off the right of the stove and so that technique came from that which is just but it ends up being right on the open flame if you have a gas stove uh adds a little extra gusto too yes so without giving the answer i'm going to tell you our first guess on the trivia question first person is guessing 2017 yes that is correct good job all right jamie loveland you are the prize winner good job jamie yeah just message us in our message area uh your address and we will mail that to you and uh jamie put in the comments where you're from i would love to know yeah thank you for joining us so here's a little bit of our beef and uh pepper mix right here nice i'm going to set that right there so typically your fajita is going to come with several different sides all right you can have lettuce is quite common but mostly on the bed of lettuce there's going to be like sour cream guacamole and pico de gallo or just called pico so what we have what i've made right here in which i'm also going to provide a recipe for is this pico de gallo right here so we have a nice real easy recipe for pico all right and i also have a nice easy recipe for guacamole which you didn't make but we also have the sour cream all right so basically put a little pico in there a little sour cream in there and we're ready to go but i also because we just harvested something too a bunch of tomatoes uh i made some salsa it is so good guys yummy salsa and the difference between salsa and the pico de gallo the pico as you can see is not a runny it's mostly just chopped and it doesn't have as robust of flavor as most salsas also it doesn't have quite as wide a variety of types of like pico as pico so but salsa can be all kinds of stuff so so jamie loveland says she's from salt lake wonderful taylorsville okay and she's a she's a guest of yeshua rochelle thank you thanks for saying hello all right so that's that so if uh if you were freezing that um yeah chick-fil-a that's funny she it did say chick-fil-a in there she doesn't know how that got in there um so for the fajitas if you were to freeze that you would just freeze the cooked part the meat and the and the peppers yes and then just reheat it on how would you reheat it yeah you can do it in a pan you can put it in a in the microwave that's just fine you can just reheat it any way you want to normally okay then add the fresh stuff and then the pico is just a sizing like i said it's not really a food prep thing it's just something it doesn't really hold well it doesn't keep well but if you have a little pico it's just really good so that's why we have a recipe great another trivia question okay okay we have a cajun seasoning okay as you guys didn't know that uh and the question is jambalaya incorporating french spanish and caribbean influences and that is cajun first became popular in which u.s city okay that's a little easier when i hope all right customers put your answer in there the first one with the correct answer we'll get another uh variety pack sent to you okay let's see where we are here what if you want to what if you want to plan an entire week on a weekend say you work every day and you just have the weekends to meal prep yeah so here's some a couple tips okay there's a couple of ways that you can approach this kind of thing like i want to get a bunch done and i want to do it and we're going to like make a day of it and i'm gonna get a whole bunch of stuff done break it up don't do it all in one day okay you can do part of the prep like uh you know the shopping part on one day the slicing and dicing on one day and then the next day you do all the prepping cooking or the cook and that kind of thing now that might not work in fact now you've just made one day work into like several days of work maybe maybe that doesn't feel right to you what if you want to instead do it all in one day like it's like now that fits your personality like i just really want to get it all done i don't want to spread it out well then do that get it all done in one day and do it for the whole month or whatever you want when i was a kid we would make like i said that roti it's not the easiest or funnest thing to make because you have to take it you make it's only it's flour water and butter and a little salt that's it it is ridiculously good though you roll into balls you roll it out you spread butter on it you roll it out again and you fry that you cook it in a little oil and it's here's a flaky and it's just awesome but when i make it i make like 50 at a time like because i don't like make it that much because it makes a mess it makes a mess a lot of work but if you're making 50 at a time like okay today's roadie day and you're going to make the 50 roadies and you put in the freezer and then you have this awesome roadie with you use it with all your meals and anyway that's like a separate one i should do a roadie or indian cooking yeah yeah because it is like if you have it and you can buy it pre-made at indian uh grocery store too and they call it paratha there p-a-r-a-t-h-a really good should we give the answer uh to the trivia question i think i have somebody yeah so the first person to say this was courtney's uh i don't know if it's steaming or stemming but she says new orleans okay courtney you were first good job give us your address we'll send it to you so i have the fortune to go to new orleans with my brother who is uh he's 14 months older than me so we're almost like the same age but for the first time in my life i went to new orleans last halloween and it was like as soon as i got there i was like i have never seen a city with so much personality so much history and character it was like number one san francisco's up there but i like blue passage so anyway i loved it i love new orleans uh okay so there was a couple tips break it up do it all in one day turn the music on make sure you've got some comfortable clothes on right you don't want to wear your nice clothes when you're doing the food craft because then you're concerned about getting something on your nice clothes wear the you know where you're painting painting clothes if you want whatever comfortable sweats anything you want comfortable shoes especially if you're standing yeah yeah and you know what if the kids want to help that's even better right make something fun out of it you can make a fun family activity where every so often you guys just want to all do that together if that's what you like you can do it one thing that i want to add that's really helpful is before you actually make your shopping list to check what you have you know check your uh cupboards check your fridge get a list of what you already have be so you don't end up buying way more than you need to so on that we're getting close we could probably call that any time you can see most of the fluid has been absorbed or evaporated and yet that flavor what it's done is in the whoops i'm steaming up the thing maybe in the culinary world that's called a reducing or making a reduction right so you take typically a fruit juice or something or something you want to make thicker and then what you do is you boil it until most of the water evaporates out and you have a thicker substance and to concentrate it and so that's what we have here is that zucchini it now has a concentrated flavor of the fruit juice in there and so it's just remarkably good tasting okay so once we have this we can put it in we can drain it right yep is this ready to go do you think jen has been the one that's yeah every time so far i just want to make sure that i say we do it at the very let's just leave it on a kind tiny bit more because it's probably good but we have a few other things to show we got the the lunch the salad and yeah okay so i wanted to show you really quick on the lunches there's a few ideas now we're not actually cooking demo right now but what we have done is a salad in a jar so this fits into the category of the next few days sort of thing but you're like well i can't really make a salad ahead of time too well because some of those ingredients go bad before then right and they like contaminate the other ingredients lettuce is very susceptible to like the contamination or moisture from other ingredients so what we've done here is made the salad in the jar but did it in the way so that it holds good for at least several days so at the very bottom you put the wettest thing you have which is your salad dressing and then you spend several layers then on whatever would be the next heartiest vegetables you want you can put here's broccoli carrots and there's nuts in there take some sunflower seeds and olives as well so you go in order of most hardy to least hearty or most susceptible to going down getting soggy yeah and so you do those layers and then tomato would be before the lettuce right so lettuce is going to be like the last thing you put on there a little cheese on top and there's a little cheese on top there fine yeah that's great and so when you're ready to eat this it might be a little hard to mix this you can dump this easy in a bowl you may be able to if it's not quite as cool if there's a little room in there you might be able to just mix it right in the in the jar which hopefully is the idea that you'd be able to do that yeah and our seasonings make really really good dressings very good dressing so yeah so what we've been experimenting with is i thought i'd briefly mention our new blends is that we have the garlic and we've actually sent out some of the hot hot blends to and i don't know if anybody on the on the call right now was a recipient of any of the hot blend but we've received a lot of great feedback and we're very very excited about the hopland uh and as i suspected when i moved it out uh and sent it out i thought maybe it might even need to be hotter and that was confirmed so the people are really light and hot like this maybe a seven but we want to kick it up to like nine close to ten and so that's what we want to do with this really hot blend that you can use on anything right let us know if you guys are fans of hot spices in the comments and then we've been using the garlic blend on a number of things we did not grill shrimp it was fantastic and right here i have the sorry about that we've been using this for days now which is our in fact i'll just show you really quick part of what makes it really easy to do the the meal preps is using the recipe card because for example we will just briefly mention soups that you can do on at lunchtime uh that you could use any flavor seasoning with right but this will tell you how to make a salad dressing uh out of any flavor seasoning and this is made with the garlic blend it's just with sour cream and mayonnaise it is so addictive i love it it's good and just be careful the garlic sticks with you a little bit yup yeah uh i just want to add audrey flanders said that salad dressing with the seasoning blend she loves that um she loves to use alvey's incredible dill chinese and believe it or not strong arm for a dressing yeah you know what's wrong since it's good and the always incredible if you don't know is a good like a ranching type dress if you like ranch dressing you want a little junk in it make yourself super easy with the olives incredible so all right let's get caught up here really quick not too much longer here guys uh i wanted to mention the soups in particular because that's a great freezer meal idea because if you have bowls it could be any size but if you have multiple bowls of any kind you can make a batch of soup put it in the bowls put it in the freezer and then in fact if you want to you probably should line it with let the soup cool down line it with a plastic wrap and then you can freeze it and then when you're ready to eat it you take it out of the bowl uh i'm not ready sorry got that backwards you take them out of the bowl and then you can package them together so basically your soups is in the shape of the bowl frozen thank you and then when you're ready to warm it up you it'll fit right into the bowl again thank you so you put it in the bowl you heat it up and you're ready to go with the soup now a key thing about soups okay with our seasonings is that i haven't found any better combo now there's all kinds of things you could do like with the curries and stuff like that but whether it's a split pea soup clam chowder chicken noodle broccoli cheese the best combination is 50 albus incredible and 50 italian use those two seasonings and like it's restaurant quality soup and it works with all the soups so try it out if you like to make soup the universal recipe card has a great vegetable soup recipe but uh my goal is to have lots of soup recipes clam chowders one of my favorite you know i love the broccoli cheese or the other ones i mentioned chili you customer classified as soup you can do that and freeze it so all that okay i wanted to mention uh noodles or rice bowls uh very good similar idea you can do it in the same fashion you can do them in the bowls you don't have to you can do them whatever you want but then the options are almost endless when you take the principles and just shuffle it along with various flavorings right doing the same thing in different ways so for example if you do a pasta you could do pasta with stir-fried vegetables on top you do you can do mac and cheese you can do spaghetti italian noodles with vegetables all over pasta you can do all those things over rice you can do them different flavors you can do it mexican italian you can do strong arm incredible so you can do them in various ways so you don't have to just have you know 10 of the exact same meal right oh i love that so you could do a big batch of rice or pasta and then portion out for individual bowls to be a different flavor right meals three mexican three indian two chinese two incredible whatever you want and that way you have variety because variety is the spice of life right yes audrey had a great reminder she says the ramen noodles instead of using the seasoning packets which we know has msg and whatnot she likes to mix the chinese and indian together and use that instead of our seasonings yeah in actuality audrey i i think audrey was yeah that initially did that the chinese indian yep it's a really good combination thank you okay so finally let's go ahead and do yeah do this right here so your kids will never know that this is a vegetable they will never know they will never know they're eating fruit snacks that are actually the core base is a vegetable so just kind of dumping it in a colander to strain the excess juice and it is good to kind of let it drip a little bit more because if you're going to put it in a dehydrator you want all that extra drippage off of there and what if they don't have a dehydrator so that is the thing we've done it with dehydrators this knot this is like the low end of dehydrator right here it plugs in you know one temperature yeah no heat settings it's got little racks you plop those on the racks and then uh it's like 18 hours yeah overnight you know maybe not a full 24 but and then you take them out and then we got that side and just bring these up here you got them like this here and this is just coming right on out of the dehydrator i think this one was maybe a cherry or strawberry that was a mixed berry and this one was grape right so we have them here and you know what these are i don't even know if i can demonstrate here the texture no i mean it's like eating a fruit snack i don't even know how it's different so but what we have is found really good our sweetenings we have the lemon and strawberry ones which are our fruity flavors and i'm going to just scoop a little bit in there we're going to mix them right on in there now you can stick right here if you're low sugar anything like that but our sweeteners are all natural and so we just coat them just like that it gives them makes them come apart really nicely and this is the lemon on the mixed berry yeah so what this sweetening does is is help keep them to not stick to each other at all it gets a nice uh texture to it and then you've got that little lemony zing to your fruit or you could consider the strawberry and it doesn't take much really just give it a little toss a little coat and yes somebody asked it is fruit juice so you can decide how natural and what flavor you like and and that zucchini will take on the flavor uh just like when you make a zucchini bread or something sweet with zucchini you don't taste zucchini right but this is even better because it's not shreds it's like it's just got the right fruit snack texture i don't know about you but i am not feeling guilty eating these eating zucchini yeah there's literally like zucchini i guess your kids will never know um and it is so good so i'm hoping we covered enough material tonight again a quick recap of what's going to be available for you after is there's going to be the recipes and included in that is yogurt parfait and some tips and tricks about the things we've talked about tonight uh lunch ideas salad in a jar and a noodle and rice options soup options and fajitas along with our pico de gallo and guacamole recipes okay so we've got all that and we'll have a separate one that gives you other ideas such as theming your weeks taco tuesdays you know fun time fridays or whatever where you can get creative or whatever you want so you can do things like that if that kind of thing works for you okay and then of course we have uh our specials you guys uh go to the consultant's website and order you know whatever you want again the special for the month is the two bulk jars for the 39 you can also get any four jars for 30 that's any time our griller's pack is uh 46 dollars and you get the six jars here but if you want to make your own griller's pack all you have to do is put the jars you want in these special instructions online when you check out all right so all those options what if you don't want to keep remembering to order your seasonings and you're like quite the leading question yes in case you don't in fact and i'm glad she reminded me because our kitchen club is a new program that we just came out with and this is for our loyal customers who just who always want to get our seasonings may not know allah's window or how to get them the kitchen club is you can go right to next to shop now where you're shopping online is join our kitchen club right next to it if you go to that link you can learn more about the kitchen club but what it means basically is you can pick one product that's shipped automatically to you one regular sized jar a month 8.99 no shipping one volt jar every three months that's 24 every three months no shipping and that's all you need to do to join our kitchen club and the benefits are that no do you get free shipping on your monthly or every three months product but you get free shipping on all your online orders so think about like christmas time coming up you could get free shipping on every order you you can order for your family send it wherever you want free shipping always on your orders and uh can you select the flavors of course yeah you change it yep you change them you select them and you can change that flavor every month or every three months or whatever you want can you can you gift it to somebody what if you want to like do like a flavor of the month well flavor is another option that's the third option in fact i'm glad you mentioned that which is our gifting option which is 99 for the whole year and they get a jar a month and then they get an email with instructions on how to go in there and select their flavor each month they'll get a reminder that says hey time to go in and make your selection and if you want it we'll just send you what you got last month no problem that sounds like a fantastic christmas gift to me all right so uh that was we talked about the new blend and what about the uh did you want to at least talk about the spice spinners oh yeah the spice spinners you know we that was the original highlight here but we ran into a couple of reasons why well we're sold out of them number one we're sold out of the ones we have and then the other ones they went back to get refitted basically for us so we had some older jars that were just a little slightly bit different tiny tiny millimeters but then they wouldn't quite fit in the spice mirror so the others are being retrofitted all right so but also we're running supply covered related supply problems in a really big way and it's unfortunate because we're with our boat yard and regular jars like almost impossible to find right now so the bulk jars we're fine on these jars for a short period of time maybe 30 days we'll probably be using a different size jar so i'm just making you aware of that that's why the spice spinners are not necessarily being emphasized at the moment is because we may not have the jars for the next few weeks but if they already have the jars and they want the spinner it's a really beautiful hardwood custom made lazy susan style way to conveniently get your seasonings and and i'll post a picture in the in the um comments if you already have the seasonings in the jars no problem at all you can go check out the spice dinner jen will post the video promotional video that we made and these glass jars if you didn't catch they are refillable so do recycle your jars hold on to them refill pouches are only seven to refill your jar yeah okay and don't forget guys we are a direct sales company if you need to earn some side income or just income we is so important to us that our consultants earn a profit and that's one of the things in our industry we're very passionate about and making sure that our consultants are making sure well taken care of so if you're interested in learning more you can go to info.savethedayseasonings.com and learn more anytime and we'd love to have you join our team and that's it for tonight i think we're signing off jan was there anything else no happy happy meal prepping and cooking and uh stay safe happy fall we're in fall take care bye-bye", "0IlMajB-Epw": "um my name is steve right manager of sport development uh again apologize for the difficulty heather hines is joining us tonight uh we're going to talk about a few things so heather uh please feel free to get going sure yeah thanks so much for the opportunity and i know that i worked with golf uh pretty early in lockdowns i think right before golf was about to get the green light to get back out on the course so maybe that was like may-ish i think um so it's great to have the opportunity again to touch base and i've been working with lots of high performance athletes over this time obviously over virtual platforms but just really focusing in on different things that we can work on uh when we are in more of a training phase and obviously as the seasons change you guys will be uh outside uh but uh right now there's lots of things nutritionally that we can focus in on so this session is really highlighting um the importance and then ingredients that we're looking for in regards to recovery nutrition but please use the chat if you have questions about anything and you don't want to speak up you can always type in your questions um i do hope that there's an opportunity for everyone in a little bit to turn on their screens and to have some discussion in regards to recovery choices i've brought some things into my office here to show you guys that i've utilized as recovery choices and and in a typical season um what we normally do or what i like to do with my job is lots of hands-on sessions so this is hopefully a session that we're doing over a virtual platform because this is all we've got but it can definitely evolve when it becomes uh you know common practice to be back in the same space with other people i think it's really great to learn with doing so it can be good to do cooking opportunities and food prep opportunities um and to be learning in that environment um as well so i'll go ahead and share my screen so that you're able to see what i see and there you go you should be able to see it and some of you might have tuned in when um i presented to golf um in about may i think 2020 or maybe you've seen me at other sports or other presentations that i've been doing um but this presentation is really geared around uh recovery and the types of things that you guys are providing your body after a training session whether that training session is sport specific or not so whether it's fitness or weights or it is uh golf specific we're really looking at what types of things are you bringing into your body when why and really getting a good understanding of the types of fuels um that your body actually requires after an intense workout so um this is like i said a session that i usually do um you know face to face that involves eating uh but it's had to evolve to you know be on this platform and it's worked really well when i've done it uh with other groups and and hopefully it continues to work well and and offers opportunity for questions and discussion um so if you have anything uh that you want to add as we go through uh just pop it into the chat and i should be able to see it as we go through the organization that i work with is the sport medicine and science council of saskatchewan i believe you've had sessions from lisa hoffert she's a colleague of mine she's also with the council i've been working with the council since 2002 so a really long time now but it gives me an opportunity to work in high performance sport full-time as a sport dietitian which is something that i absolutely love so i help lots of athletes uh with individual nutrition strategies as well so if you're sitting in some of these group sessions and you're wondering well how do i kind of fine-tune this for myself uh there's always opportunities for individual support as well um if any of you guys are in the age group for the next canada summer games um i'm also part of team saskatchewan so i go to those uh games and i'm part of the the mission staff or the the support team that's there to help athletes in regards to their nutritional planning so that's something that um has been a really good addition uh to team sask over a couple of cycles now so something that we're trying to keep up with to ensure that when athletes are traveling they're able to eat well and plan well with their nutrition so this is what we're going to be talking about today with a little infographic at the bottom there kind of as a little spoiler uh but we're really going to be looking at how do you plan optimal performance with nutrition and recovery so the timing of meals and snacks and why that's so important what types of items you would want to be packing for a training day so let's say you're doing school outside of the home and you're going right from school to a training session how you'd want to be packing for that and planning for that if you are doing school at home with virtual delivery i've come across many high performance athletes that just try to power through their schoolwork as quickly as possible and they're actually like forgetting to eat meals at certain times they're just trying to do their school work so i think it it can be really helpful uh to to remember why it's so important to be eating at specific times and i've had athletes that actually just like set a reminder in their phone to like go off at a certain time to say hey it's time to take a pause like this is lunch uh to make sure that we can stay on top of things so we'll talk about that in a little bit more detail um and then if you do have to to train away from home obviously what you can bring with you then we're gonna spend a little bit of time looking at recovery foods um and that was a piece of the homework so if you've prepared something to share then awesome if you haven't then you still can learn so that's that's always great but if you do have things that you really really like to do in recovery um i'll give you an opportunity to share at that time um and then i'll tell you what i've made so i've made some different things and and brought them that i wanted to to show you as well um and then there's questions throughout so if if there's something that you've tried in recovery or you've tried even pre uh training and you're wondering about it ask away this is definitely not a lecture from me to you so if there's things that you want to learn about or challenge me on uh please do ask all of the focus that we'll be looking at today for recovery is food um but i do know um that there is a multi-billion dollar industry that sells supplements and lots of people use supplements in recovery so those are great questions to ask uh to know if that's an appropriate choice or what the composition of that item might be so this is a slide that just kind of tries to pull everything together and it can look really overwhelming and i don't want it to so we're going to walk our way through it but when we're trying to plan for a training session it usually doesn't happen first thing in the morning so we do want to be doing some of this planning the night before so that we have a little bit more time and you'll see a common thread kind of with all of the meal and snack examples they're all combining sources of carbohydrate like the cereal or fruit with a source of protein like the milk so when you're when you're planning your meals and snacks not only is the timing really important but also the types of things are also very important so i typically get athletes that ask the questions of like well how much do i need at this time if i do a hard workout what do i need right afterwards well we're going to talk about the right afterwards part but knowing exactly what you need every single day is really really hard like i would never tell someone i know the exact energy demands of your body but it can be really helpful to look at how often you're eating how long you go uh between your meals and snacks so ideally when we look at this breakdown of a day of breakfast snack lunch snack uh supper then maybe a training session or maybe that training session comes in uh before supper and then a bedtime snack ideally that timing is is giving your body food every two and a half to three hours that you're awake that that type of strategy works really well when you're then involved in high performance sport when you're trying to maintain a good amount of strength on the body we want to be fueling the body as often um as that so eating every two and a half to three hours you'll see when we start looking at the composition of recovery snacks uh why this smoothie can be such a great option especially for a bedtime snack i'll have quite a few athletes that say well sometimes i'm not hungry after a workout so going with liquids can be a really good choice so we'll keep that as one of the options that that we will talk about but you can also see that eating this often really allows that workout so where i put that star and then workout training session in red font that really could happen at any time throughout this day so we can at any time we could go breakfast then we could go training session and then we could use our am snack as recovery so when we're eating often and we have a really good timeline between our meals and our snacks we're always ready to go we're never too hungry we're never too full we're not waiting for supper until we have our big meal we're spacing it out as as nicely as we can throughout the day and that's really the goal that we have lots of opportunities uh to be fueling uh fueling the body so this is a big piece of the planning if you're looking at this and you're wondering well this is totally different uh from how i'm currently eating i don't normally get someone to jump into this like right from the get-go but we look at strategies to get here so different areas in their day that we could maybe improve upon or we look at any gaps in your day that you might be going longer than like four hours without eating then we would when then we would try to bring something in so this this takes time and process but it definitely can help when someone is looking at training performance which is what we're dealing with right now and then into the future months when we're looking at competition performance and how steady the energy is that our body has available to it so this is a really good place to start is to be working on specific meals or specific snacks as you go through your training day any questions on this slide before i jump to the next one no okay so you've probably seen these athlete plates before and hopefully you have um but i use them a lot as as kind of break breakdown uh of the meal or snack that you're having so these are all just examples of like a supper type meal and the composition of that supper so if you're ever wondering like well what should my supper look like if i have a training session later on in the evening or if i'm using my supper as recovery these athlete plates can be really helpful and this is the athlete plate assuming that you're doing like an hour or an hour and a half of like moderate intensity uh training and you can see that fruits and veggies play a really big part on that plate uh protein is a critical piece but it's not the be-all end-all like protein is for building and recovery it's not a fuel source but those grains are so the grain products or high carbohydrate vegetables like potatoes those ones need to be there but they don't need to be covering the whole plate you're not unless you do multiple sports you're not running a marathon so your energy needs are quite different depending on the sports that you're involved with so just when i say that maybe you are doing lots of other sports so then your plate does change a bit uh but usually you want to be looking at it kind of case by case of what you expect your body to do um in one day so because many people will look at this plate and be like okay well i can't eat that plate that's just a picture i tried to find other plates that are quite similar in composition so these are all examples of different meals um that have that pretty good uh vegetable composition with the grains obviously if you do like a breakfast sandwich you'd have fruit or veggies on the side but i like a breakfast sandwich at any time so if you're doing your own cooking and let's say your cooking skills are kind of limited then eggs can be a great option um at any time of any time of day but these athlete plates and i'm happy to share the content of the these slides after if you want them but i do have quite a few athletes that just like print it post it and then they're like okay i get it like that that's what i'm supposed to be having when i'm having my meals so jumping into the recovery piece um these can be really helpful questions as athletes and as coaches to ask yourself and as a coach to ask your athletes key questions to ask yourself before you jump into your recovery nutrition plan so these are questions to ask yourself um after um a training session so how hard was that training session um so a rating of perceived exertion scale of one to ten ten being like super super hard and one being very technical not hard at all you're rating yourself on how hard it was and why that's so important is the harder that session was the more damage might have been caused to your muscle tissue so let's say you were doing weight training or you're doing a new skill so like new technique is quite damaging to the body especially if you're doing lots of repetitions of something or maybe you're doing aerobic training and it was really taxing maybe you were doing intervals on a treadmill or running outside or another type of aerobic activity so if something's really hard then that changes the types of things that you want to be having afterwards if something's quite easy or quite technical in a way that it doesn't cause any body damage to you then the recovery nutrition doesn't need to be as organized i would say like you could still finish a workout and have a snack but if you're doing something damaging to the body you want to be finishing a workout and then really planning out the ingredients that your body is getting so that's a key question to ask yourself how hard was it the next question to ask yourself is what was the duration so how long was it the total amount of time uh that you were doing that particular activity or sport the third question is what was the impact on your muscle glycogen stores and and not everyone's going to know the answer to that but the way to know is how aerobic was it and aerobic activity is like your heart rate is up you're breathing heavier you're demanding glycogen which is the storage of energy and sugar in your muscle tissue how much of that did you use so if you think of like uh the energy that you take in as fuel how much of that fuel was used um and we use a lot of it when we're doing something that's really aerobically taxing um so if we are doing any cross training or aerobic training that really drains uh muscle glycogen stores quite a bit so if if you're answering question three and saying yeah that was really taxing well that places a bigger importance on the amount of carbohydrate that you're then eating in recovery because you're trying to replace those muscle glycogen stores the fourth question that's really important to ask yourself is when's your next training session and right now we might have bigger gaps in our trade between our training sessions but lots of times i'll get athletes to think about if they have a training camp coming up or they have a day or maybe a couple days during their week where they're doing multiple things maybe multiple sports or multiple training sessions whenever your time between your training sessions is eight hours or less then it becomes really important to think about okay i've finished one training session here's my recovery snack and then i'm gonna plan for what i need to do what i need to do next and then the fifth question to ask yourself was how well did you fuel before you went into training so i'll give you a good example of that one is if i have athletes that like to train in the morning and they don't want to wake up early so they go into those training sessions without eating anything beforehand they're pretty much on empty before they start then they hold themselves on empty throughout so their recovery nutrition becomes even more important so these can be really helpful questions to say okay let's just assess how that workout went how hard was it how long was it how aerobic was it when do i have to do this again and how well did i fuel beforehand because when we know that then we can really plan out what types of things we should be having after that training session so these are our goals of recovery and hopefully you've heard i'm sure you many of you have heard of recovery nutrition uh before but we do have four specific goals that we're looking for in recovery and again i found a nice infographic because it makes my slide look better but we want to be rehydrating ourselves and that very much is dependent on sweat losses right now it's not very warm but when it's warm that becomes a critical piece especially in your sport of replacement of fluids and electrolytes the primary electrolyte that we actually lose is salt i know there's lots of fancy beverages out there that have other electrolytes in them but we don't really need them the only one that actually has a replacement need is salt so we can easily find salt in our diet but we do have to organize to have that one afterwards we don't need coconut water we don't really even need potassium we need salt so we'll look at options for that one we need to replace muscle glycogen like i said those are the carbohydrates cho is just short for carbohydrate stores um so we do need to replace those so we want to be looking for food uh or fluids that have that and one caution there is lots of popular like i would say supplements marketed to the general population have a lot of protein and zero carbohydrates because lots of people in the general population are quite scared of carbohydrates and think that carbohydrates are bad so if we're going into a grocery store or a supplement store saying hey i'm looking for something in recovery chances are it has no carbohydrates and that's not actually recovery so we do need carbohydrates to be part of our recovery plan and then the two last points in red they're in red because it reminds me of uh muscle um we do need to repair that damage that we've done and i'm sure everyone on this call has done exercises that are new to us or a weight program that is new to us and then you're sore and you can't go up the stairs for two days that's muscle damage so we want a little bit of muscle damage that's not wrong but we want to heal it as efficiently as possible and how we eat will help us in that repair and remodeling process so we go into the workout we break stuff down we finish the workout the body's primary goal is to rebuild itself and to rebuild itself stronger but we can't have that happen unless we have the ingredients so if i have athletes that just train hard hard hard but don't eat well they don't just get to be stronger they haven't put in the ingredients yet though the ingredients part is very uh very important in recovery so we we can actually calculate it if you're wondering and this was on um the homework sheet that i had given to to steve is we can calculate someone's recovery needs it can get really specific based on their body size or we can use this general guideline especially for uh your particular sport so we can use the guideline of between 30 to 50 grams of carbohydrates any food label will tell you what you're getting if you have a piece of fruit obviously it doesn't have a food label but a banana is like 20 to 25 grams of carbohydrates and apples like 15 so pretty much if you can fit it in one of your hands you're getting between that 15 to 20 grams of carbohydrates on the protein side this one's a bit more variable um it would really depend on your size um so the range that's on here that 10 to 15 grams if you're like you know quite a tall person with a lot of lean muscle mass then those values are going to be higher but i do you considering i can't see anyone um i do use use these ranges of like that 10 to 15 with the exception if someone says well hey i'm you know six feet this is then it's gonna change it's gonna be higher i'll give you that it maybe goes up to like 25 grams of protein so we want to be thinking about foods and that's really the idea of this session is thinking about foods that are going to check those boxes like yes this has 47 grams of carbohydrates and yes this has 12 grams of protein and yes i could have it with some water and yes it's a little bit salty so you start looking at those foods that check those recovery boxes and then right now since we're in a training phase we look at okay well what if i start doing this after all of my sessions what am i going to get well you're going to recover faster that's the ultimate goal is that you're able to do the work recover quicker and then adapt as quickly as possible so just by whoever wants to share whether you want to talk or whether you want to type it what would be some foods or combinations of foods that you think would be within your sport practical in recovery who wants to share i'll see if i can see the chat i think i can there we go peanut butter sandwich on rye bread yup for sure cliff bars yeah clif bars will do a pretty good pretty good job banana yeah and then i would take that banana and like combine it with a clif bar and then you'd have both sides of that uh carbohydrate protein combination apples and peanut butter yup cliff bar yeah and and two along the lines of the cliff the cliff bar is you can get like the cliff builder bars so for any of the athletes on the call that are bigger individuals the builder bar has 20 grams of protein the regular clif bar has 10. a hard-boiled egg one of my favorite things ever uh and pita yeah that would be a great one as well yeah you could do a protein shake um and you could either build that protein shake with food which sounds like those ingredients there so banana peanut butter milk seeds kind of blend it all together uh you could go right into a meal so like fish and brown rice and i've had athletes that would rather have meals than snacks so they just organized so that their workout happens before they they're actually having a meal so they're organizing their supper to be their recovery so that that can be a great way of doing it um as well so you want to think about quite a few and that's kind of the the idea of this session is you start thinking about lots of different options that you can bring in you always want to have variety and recovery that you feel you can stomach in all different environments obviously your sport can deal with the extremes of environment of like super hot super humid or cold and windy and so those temperature changes actually have a really big impact not only of the needs of the body but also the desire to eat so when we exercise in the heat or we're exposed to the heat for a long period of time that can really suppress our appetite and you actually have to like not force yourself because that's not a really good word around food but just you really have to have a plan you have to have a plan like this is part of my routine after a round or this is part of my routine um after a training session so this was what was sent uh in advance just to get you guys thinking about uh different options that you might want to share um and if you do have things um that you want to share i'm just going to go here and then i'm going to stop the share and i want to see so does anyone want to or maybe everyone wants to turn their cameras on and then chat about what they like to have in recovery and we can just kind of go around the room heather i'll start i actually ate it i i made it and then i was too hungry and i ate it so sweet i like to go with a cauliflower burrito bowl yeah you know it has it has cauliflower as the rice substitute my fiance and i we we tend to take the rice out and go with the more veggie at nighttime yeah because we're kind of lazy we just sit around and watch shows and stuff so but it still has the carbohydrate the bean and a little bit of tomato and onion and that sort of thing but maybe we either add chicken or ground turkey is a good alternative so that's that's what we like to go with that's awesome and what's so great about a bowl is you can make all those ingredients and then have them for leftovers and kind of build it as the week goes along and kind of pull different pieces to together with that and then once you're starting to run out on the protein side of it you could always just like put a fried egg on top and still like build it into a meal absolutely we we make for the lunch the next day so you've got enough for a couple days yeah awesome it's really really tasty great anyone else want to share their recovery choices i don't want to call people out if they don't want to but if you do want to share that would be awesome i know coach jays and jason schneider he's on the line let's let's maybe call you out i'm sure you can call people and see if you you know them so you can i know he's a big protein supplement guy but uh what do you got g um currently after the gym unfortunately now just because of schedule i get home pretty late at night um but i always have a lot of chicken already pre-made and i've really got on the kick right now of cauliflower rice something that i find is even a little bit easier i can't screw it up like i can screw up rice really bad but cauliflower rice it seems that the instructions are just really easy and i follow them to a tea and have some rice and chicken when i get home and then if i'm still a little bit hungry i'll probably have a little bit of a piece of bread or two with this little bit of margarine on it awesome and do you buy that cauliflower rice at costco like is it frozen i've seen different places yes at costco um the last couple times i've gone they've been the big bags okay um but in the past there was a bag but then there's individual servings in it oh and i really did like that because then again i knew exactly what i was doing i didn't have to measure it yeah um i don't know probably over so that's probably since kovitz started i've barely been maybe a bad thing but really starting to to measure i'm really gonna pay attention um a big snacky guy like chips stuff like that if it's there it's gone so i'm really trying to pay attention to what i'm eating not saying that i don't have my cheat days but i need a lot healthier and know what i'm putting in my body awesome yeah great options who else does steve want to call out so heather i i ran to the freezer this is the brand i i go with i'll either make my own or okay this one's like a mexican kind of flavor to it so it's really good and it's good for like when your body sore you can use the frozen bag totally and that's an ice pack hello um hi i usually after a big workout i eat a clif bar piece of fruit and protein shakes nice and you have is there a specific protein shake that you like to have um just vanilla and strawberry vanilla and strawberry are they pre they pre-mixed ones or do you have to mix it up oh they pre-mix it yeah okay good and that's pretty convenient because it's already done for you um it's probably pretty portable so if you're like into that routine and then you know i always like to think in the future when people are back at like training camps at you know different environments that's something you could pack and take with you for sure yep cool anyone else want to share uh yeah i'll go ahead um i had hard-boiled eggs but somebody stole them out of my fridge uh but i'll mix those with whatever uh complex carbohydrate i can find if it's pita rye bread anything like that uh awesome i also really love chickpeas because you get both protein and carbs out of them and if you roast them you can toss them in salt and then you can get some of the salt back as well yeah and then uh protein shakes uh to keep that up because you said tall with lots of lean muscle and that's kind of me exactly so yeah go to's for mine yeah and and that's the thing like when when you're when you have muscle mass and you're trying to build muscle mass and hold that muscle mass you really have to be looking at that protein load of all of your food and you have to be like okay what can i add to this to bump up the protein content and eggs is a great one chickpeas is another one black beans all of these different ingredients that we can pull together to just build up the the content of that macro nutrient have you seen someone said on amazon you can buy a thing that like it's like for only making hard-boiled eggs like it's like a hard-boiled egg maker and it like it's kind of like a rice cooker but for hard-boiled eggs another sport parent was telling me this and i was like this is a game changer i love hard-boiled eggs and like the start of cobin was getting fancy with like deviled eggs um and someone said you know you can buy these things and i was like holy no i've not seen that but i will check it out you might have to yeah i think if you just go on like amazon and like search like hardwood all day i'm sure it'll pop up thanks anyone else want to share anybody else autumn simone jackson what about that tim horton's uh iced coffee how much grams of sugar is in that bad boy a substantial amount everyone's like no dice i'm not turning my camera on no one wants to share there's really no wrong answers in recovery [Music] i guess i can let you know what i usually eat after a round if i'm at the cabin or whatever yeah i'll have a couple grilled chicken breasts i'll cut them up throw them in with some lettuce uh tomatoes some onion uh usually a little kind of a mixed bag with some dried cranberries uh a few different types of seeds i think there's some sesame seeds and things like that in there tomato and then throw on that there's some ranch dressing or an oil and vinegar dressing awesome do you find if it's like uh like if it was like a really windy or like kind of challenging environment day that you're hungrier for like carbohydrates to be added to that like toast or a bun on the side or something like that oh that's so much some days i'll have soup i'm making garlic toast with it yeah other days i don't bother depends on the day totally yeah great there's a couple of uh suggestions in the chat um so egg sandwich with avocado delicious um avocado toast yeah another popular one and a good option there um and then protein pancakes and that's actually one of the recipes i'll share when we go back to the back to the slides those are all uh great options did anyone else want to share before i share some of the the ones that i brought into my office with me no dice okay so this is this is like a breakfast slash like it's kind of like a breakfast cookie that i make a lot and i make with like every team whenever i can actually see them in person um so this is like oatmeal and coconut and banana like it's like banana bread but in a cookie with chocolate chips and loads of different ingredients i put in extra eggs i put in ground flax they're delicious they freeze really well i have the recipe in the slide so you can you can try them out they're not very sweet so i really like making them in advance for training camps and athletes athletes can just pull them out of the fridge or freezer or on road trips because we start to get really sick of granola bars and you might be at that phase in your athletic career when you're just like if i see one more granola bar so it can be really helpful to have other options um and these cookies are are great ones um these are packaged but i really like them like just different like energy balls or bites i can't have gluten um so these are these are gluten-free um and these are really tasty as well and then um i think it was andrew that mentioned the dried chickpeas delicious so these are purchased dried chickpeas which i know they're pricey um but when they're on sale i usually stock up so these are nut free which is hard to find a good protein source that's not free these are nut free and there's five grams of plant protein per serving and this one is uh cinnamon flavored so very very tasty and similar to that and also a three farmers product and that's a saskatchewan product um is this um salt and vinegar lentils so if you like a crunchy salty snack you might want to be busting these out um and you could put them in like a homemade trail mix um so if you're making like a nuts and bolts with pretzels um but you want to bump up the protein content um these uh lentils could be a good option and they have every different uh flavor but the other plus of these is like a tiny handful so a quarter of a cup has like pretty much the same amount of salt in it as a gatorade so when you're looking for sodium sources from food like i said we do not need to look far we can look at all of our our food options and anything in a package is usually pretty high in salt um and then i use these a lot and you probably use these a lot too because you don't need a spoon but these are great portable sources of carbohydrate for either during exercise during a round or to add in recovery so if your recovery was more on the protein side of things and you're looking for ways to bump up the carbohydrate content these are going to be a good option this has 16 grams of carbohydrates is tofu a good recovery snack that's a great question yeah tofu is a great plant uh source of protein um i've used firm tofu in smoothies um or i've used it in like a power bowl so you like have tofu you can you can slice it up especially the firm tofu and it pretty much takes on the flavor of anything that you're cooking so if you're like stir frying veggies um you would just dice up the tofu and then throw it into the frying pan and it's a great source of great source of protein yeah that's a good question i'll go back to the slides um hopefully i can i think i can i've done this a couple times uh maybe i have to jump through myself or maybe it'll go back to where we were yeah there we were so i'll show you some of the recipes that i've used with lots of groups that i work with and if you have any additions or questions about them um just let me know and honestly this is a session that hopefully we can do when we are back to in-person education because doing cooking is really really fun um and it's a great way to build your skills and to learn at the same time and i find it's a really great opportunity to just like ask questions in a casual environment um and have things be as interactive as possible so i'll start with just showing another couple sources of portable protein some of them we we touched on when i know i met with some people in may i think it was but lots of different options here these are the chickpeas that i just showed you this is a different flavor of the lentils so this is a barbecue uh flavor um and i'm always talking about canned tuna even though some people don't like it but it is a really good option um and then if you're looking for portable protein that's also salty um like cured meats is your gold in there so like uh turkey pepperoni or if you like like to hunt or you have access to wild meat and you make your own jerky or sausage then it's it's salty um all dairy products are also quite salty so cheese is salty uh cottage cheese is salty as well and a very very high source of protein and then many people on the call mentioned chicken so yeah if we've got the time awesome we can we can cook it up we can uh you know bake it in the oven we can barbecue it when we don't have the time we can buy it canned and it's ready to go and it looks a bit interesting when you first crack open the can if you're not used to it but it is cooked and it it can be added to a salad or a wrap or i've done chicken quesadillas with this chicken from costco um and you can see on that label um that if you have um one quarter of a cup that's 13 grams of protein um once you start buying your own groceries that's spectacular money uh spent there so um really good sources of protein can come from a can they're not scary from a can you just have to figure out ways that you like to like to make it and like to have it other ways to bump up the protein content these are a couple of options you could think about uh especially if you're like making a meal after a round or after a training session one of my go-to's to anything that i make and it never changes the taste is adding extra eggs you can always if you're making muffins pancakes cookies um anything extra eggs is very very high quality nutrition and protein content and we do want the whole egg so if you're wondering well what about just the whites no we want the whole thing there's a lot of nutritional value in the yolk there's also protein in the yolk and there's iron and vitamin d in the yolk so we want the whole the whole thing skim milk powder can be added as well to pancakes muffins cookies smoothie that'll bump up the protein content usually for younger athletes i start with a skim milk powder if they say well i want more protein i'm going to get a protein powder i'm like no you could probably do it with milk or dairy sources if you like to do bowls or rice dishes lots you could switch it out for a quinoa and you're going to bump up the protein content drastically doing that adding cottage cheese to pasta sauce is a great idea um i used to add christ cheese a lot to uh salad which sounds weird looks weird but tastes really good um adding beans and lentils similar to what many of you are already doing hard-boiled eggs again we talked about that and my love for hard-boiled eggs nuts and seeds was mentioned as well which is great so was chickpeas lentils and beans um and really looking for ways that you can just add a little bit more of this protein to your meals and snacks and why it becomes so important especially in recovery and just during our day is it really allows us to stay satisfied from our food so when people tell me oh i'm hungry all the time or i could snack any time of day usually that means their protein intake is too low or it's too low throughout the day and then too high later on so the more we spread our protein out the more satisfied we feel from our foods so these are a couple of options i showed this recipe um a lot so this is one that you would make like in a muffin tin um these grab and go high protein veggie egg cups you can use frozen veggies in the mix um if you have a busy schedule or a busy week sometimes buying frozen veggies is the way to go because if you don't get to it they're still good you're not kicking yourself for having your vegetables go bad in the fridge so these are super easy to make you just spray the muffin tins really well so they actually come out and they don't get stuck but you can see two of them has 17 grams of protein you would want to have it with a source of carbohydrate so like a toasted bagel or a couple pieces of toast or an english muffin that would be pretty delicious and then you'd get your carbohydrate there as well now i don't know if anyone on the call has made these but these are also super easy look fancy so you can impress other people um and very delicious um so this you just take a muffin pan again you line that muffin pan with like a deli slice of meat like ham usually is the best one because it's a little bit saltier and then you just crack an egg in it and you can put cheese on top if you want but you don't have to um and you just put it in the oven like it's that simple and it is absolutely delicious so another great source of protein um obviously it's protein with more protein added to it so that can be a really good option and they do last in the fridge for a couple days so if you have more prep time on the weekends then that might be a good thing to make at that time now these are my oh i think i have a chat question i'll see if it'll pop down sometimes it comes and then sometimes it doesn't can you guys see my chat i can't see it yet so elias says uh what does he say here my parents always thought that more than three eggs a day are bad fewer or just old people like them yeah there used to be like honestly i i don't want to i'll date myself i don't care i think when i finished my degree we still had this idea in dietetics that we had a little bit of a limit on the number of eggs that you would eat in a week and that is gone like you can eat eggs whenever you want in almost i would say any quantity that you want if someone has high cholesterol it's because their body makes too much cholesterol it's not because of the cholesterol content in an egg yeah so there's really a green light for eggs you can have as many as you'd like that's a good question so even to further that on eggs like i go and look at the egg section i see large i see medium i see omega-3s i see food like which one should one buy like finance is obviously something so you know i go to the large oh i go to the extra large i usually throw it down with the extra large so the omega-3 eggs they're actually changing the feed that the chickens get so it does change the profile of the yolk so if you're someone that doesn't eat a lot of fatty fish like salmon you would be looking for other sources of omega-3s and you could get it then um in in what you're getting from that type of fancier egg which you will pay the difference for free run egg matters if you care about how the chicken lives so it doesn't change the profile of the egg but it does change the life of the chicken so they're running free um so they are still farmed but they're like not in cages um so you'll see cage free too that's another term um organic would be something similar like even like for a while there's a big push on organic milk which is like double the cost like it's like nine dollars for four liters that does not change the milk it changes the life of the cow like the quality of the cow's life but not the milk content so it does become someone's personal decision what how they feel about how the animals are treated and raised but it doesn't change the nutritional quality the size of the egg yeah that would make a difference if you're buying a bigger egg you might see that the the nutritional profile is slightly different of what you're actually getting and then jay asks about egg whites versus eggs yeah that's a great question so um yeah they've actually done a direct study comparing eggs to egg whites and which resulted in a better muscle protein response so you can actually track muscle protein response after exercise so one group was given 21 grams of protein from egg whites and the other group was given 21 grams of protein from the whole egg and it was matched for energy content and the individuals that were given the whole egg had a better muscle protein response and the researchers did they ran the numbers twice because they're like well this goes against what everyone would think um because of the fat content of the yolk but what they're thinking that it that it was actually the fat content of the yolk that caused a greater muscle protein synthesis response so from that there's been a total shift towards when you're looking to build muscle tissue and when you're looking for health we want the whole thing um there's so much nutritional value within that yolk and there's a lot of flavor within that yolk like usually when i say have the whole thing people are like oh thank goodness you know like i now i get to enjoy the egg again and of course you want to enjoy the egg like you always want to enjoy your food but it's confusing i know science always changes and we don't like change but it does always change um and that's a good thing about science but it means that sometimes we have to kind of go back on our words a little bit yeah keep your questions coming i don't know why why i can't see them on my end but steve can see them and he can just tell me that someone's so good yeah uh this is my smoothie chart um i always get athletes asking for smoothie recipes so i'll share all the slides with steve after the presentation and if you guys want it awesome and if you want to try some of these great um that chocolate uh cherry berry one delicious and you can get frozen cherries at costco um or many grocery stores i would say the array of frozen fruit that you can get right now is pretty spectacular and and frozen fruit and frozen vegetables are just as nutritionally sound so if you feel like you're getting a lower quality product because it's frozen that is false um and you'll find a much better price point for frozen fruit especially right now because it's quasi winter time still so i mean buying a fresh mango in a grocery store you're paying for it but buying it frozen um you'll notice is a lot more economical so you'll see the nutritional breakdown at the bottom and i only put the calories in there out of interest i do not have any of my athletes counting calories but they do want to be aware of the composition so they do want to know how much carbohydrate they're getting and how much protein they're getting so that's why i include it in the table the only reason there's the asterisk beside those two is the fat content is higher um and again that's not a bad thing but that will mean that it's going to take longer to digest so if you're having a smoothie let's say in the morning and then you plan to go do a workout like 45 minutes later chances are that smoothie hasn't been fully digested yet because of the fat content whereas if you have a smoothie like the citrus one where the fat content is lower it will be digested quicker so that's that's why i've highlighted those two this is my absolute go-to every single day i have zero variety with my breakfast and i'm totally fine with that um i make my own granola and it's super simple i've never measured anything but this is what i put into it in roughly the measurements um and you might really enjoy making your own granola and putting it on any type of yogurt or greek yogurt that you like um because then you can control your own ingredients and make it the way that you want to so this is my uh recipe but you can put in any type of nut and seed that you would like any type of dried fruit that you would like it's not very sweet um but it's very filling so i like to have a breakfast that i can eat at like 7 30 and then you know be totally satisfied until you know three hours later and then be like okay now i need a snack if your breakfast doesn't keep you satisfied for i would say it like at least two hours chances are you're either not having enough or the protein content is too low like if we're having like eggo waffles for breakfast we will be hungry in like 20 minutes because there's no protein there so really think about the the protein content of your breakfast granola bars this one is dangerously good so it can be really good to make and then cut into pieces and then freeze um because it's that delicious um and again a good option for post workout or if you're looking to pack things on a competition or training camp environment um and this one is made with like a nut butter so either a peanut butter or an almond butter um usually like the creamier ones are a little bit a little bit better but if you do have an almond butter that's pre-mixed then it would work out pretty well these are my uh composition of a high protein pancake um it gets the protein load from cottage cheese and these are delicious so don't be thrown off if you're not a big cause cheese fan um again you can make these in advance and freeze them in like a ziploc and then just reheat them in the toaster like right where you'd put bread in um because then it's not soggy it's crunchy and so um that was a trick with reheating pancakes i can't even remember who taught me that one but that was a really good trick because lots of times when you reheat pancakes in the microwave they're just like a soggy mess so putting them in the toaster is a great option this could even be something too if you're traveling when that happens again but you're traveling and maybe you have like a kitchenette and you're looking for things that you could reheat in a in the hotel room uh this would be an option that you could have there so you can see the nutrition profile there at the top if you have four of them um that's a pretty awesome nutritional profile so 32 grams of carbohydrate almost 20 grams of protein which is pretty spectacular this is the recipe of the cookie i still haven't eaten but we'll be eating soon so i put in three eggs i put in three eggs today i put in four bananas today because i have a freezer full of bananas that i need to use up um and when you're looking at the breakdown of these ingredients i've already dropped the sugar content a bit so if you like to bake but you usually drop the sugar a bit i've already done that so if you drop it anymore you might be like these are gross um so they're not supposed to be sweet my kids are always like did you make cookies or did you make those cookies well these are the those cookies that they're like breakfast cookies they're not they're not sweet cookies um but i really like them um and i've shared it with lots of athletes that really like them and especially if they have an early morning workout and they have like you know morning stomach and they don't want to eat anything this is a really good option um at that particular time so easy thing to make a big batch of and then they freeze really well these i might have shared in may but i don't know if i did these ones kind of scare people when we make them because you actually put cooked lentils in them but they're delicious um and you don't taste the lentils the lentils are just there to bump up the fiber content and the protein content um and these also um you would want to let it cool after you make it and then cut it into bars and then freeze it but whenever i've made it with teams they don't let it cool and they just eat the whole pan so it is that good um and it's good to find things and ways to cook lentils uh because they are very uh nutritionally sound and very inexpensive so if you're looking for a way to stretch your grocery dollar um lentils is the way to go um because you can buy canned lentils or you can buy bags of dry lentils and the protein content is massive and the price point is like under two dollars for a big bag like they are very very economical but they also are a great thing to add into muffins or cookies or these are bars so this is a recipe from lentil.org if you go to lentil.org you can put lentils in anything i've made hamburgers and you put lentils in and they're delicious my kids were wondering what the little round things were but i just told them to keep eating but they are really good um you can't really taste uh taste the difference so that was my last recipe to share i'll stop the share oh i love my cookies yeah now i can see people's actual comments um i make mine with banana egg pancakes pancake mix oh that sounds really good i saw a recipe that was like a banana pancake and i thought i'm gonna make this and it actually had like like a maple banana like syrup that they had made on top it was this book at the library and it was like if you love pancakes and the whole thing was pancake recipes uh do you have any suggestions for being plant-based many of the typical recipes yeah they do most of them have dairy or meat but there's loads of great i'm not sure where your home base is but i know in saskatoon um at super store there's loads of dairy alternatives now like it used to be if you couldn't have dairy you were in like no man's land but there is like dairy-free yogurt obviously dairy-free cheese that you can buy but for other plant-based options i would look at some of those uh that lentil lentil.org website um and and i made modifications with lots of those recipes where you can make them without eggs you just use like the the ground flax as kind of an egg alternative um but there are lots of ways of doing it and i actually use a dairy free chocolate chip so those are those are vegan and dairy free as well so there are lots of ways around it um and you'll be very uh you know nutritionally balanced it just does take a little bit more planning but if that those are things that you want to do there's lots of ways to do that well i'll put my email address in the chat to everyone too um because if you have questions that come up later on um i have no problem at all with people sending me emails so that's my email address or if you're looking for um other recipes or like i mean that uh you know question about transitioning things to plant-based i've got loads of plant-based recipes um that i've helped athletes kind of experiment with with different things of making um some exchanges from uh animal sources of protein to to plant heather i have a question we had a a mental imagery zoom call a few weeks ago and and one of the students was wondering about you know brain function brain foods and you know is any suggestions for that yeah so the brain is is completely carbohydrate dependent so when the energy levels start to drop in our blood like if it's been too long between when we've eaten or if when we ate let's say the only thing we had was protein the brain will be searching for for food and you will feel foggier in the brain you will feel lethargic you will you will actually feel like you can't focus and concentrate so even though there's a lot of misinformation out there about like sugar being bad and carbohydrates needing to be limited when that crosses over into the sport world then it's really tricky because if we try to do that we're going to feel tired and just not be able to to really stay focused for brain health that kind of switches gears a little bit and looks at like the fatty acid profile of the food so for brain health it is encouraged that we have fatty fish twice a week so primarily that's going to be salmon or other types of fatty fish if we don't like fatty fish then you can get similar types of fatty acid profile in walnuts and ground flaxseed um so those would be some options to build into recipes like the cookies have ground flax and you can't taste it in case you're you know concerned about that uh but yeah so nutrition is is critical kind of on both fronts for how we feel like during the day energy wise and then for the actual brain health got a really good breakfast here that i make quite often especially in the summertime when i'm golfing or not um somebody can do it the night before so i'll take a cup of rolled oats a cup of milk slice up an apple into small pieces uh throw some raisins in with it and sprinkle some cinnamon and splenda brown sugar and just stir that up and leave in the fridge overnight you don't have to leave in the fridge but it just makes it a lot faster in the morning yeah then uh toss it in the microwave for about a minute pull it out stir it up throw it in again for about another minute and then add a helping of uh i always use genuine health vanilla protein powder and that is so good and it's just like eating a kind of an apple crisp dessert but that's with you for a lot of like a whole round of golf almost yeah no that sounds awesome like anything that you can prep like that the night before especially if you know it's an earlier session or an earlier round and the temptation would be to like just grab something else quick that's not going to keep you going but you really start looking at like you did the nutritional profile of what you're getting like where's my carbohydrate coming from where is my protein coming from and let's pull it all together in a way that that's easy to take in the next day yeah it takes no more than two or three minutes in the morning it's ready to eat awesome that's a great one there's a question in the chat uh popular supplements yeah those are great questions um and i like i do a whole presentation on on supplements that i'd be happy to you know organize for you guys um my my thoughts off the bat is they're usually not needed but there are definitely times if i know someone's nutritional is really well planned and the athlete comes to me and they say especially with creatine the athlete says my main goal right now is building muscle mass is there anything else i can do then i would sometimes in conjunction with a really good nutrition program uh look at something like creatine it actually has science behind it to support that yes um many people primarily males feel that they can train harder and train more explosively with that particular supplement the branch chain amino acids is way more hype than science so uh the hype being that those particular three branched chain amino acids is they they promote it as like that's all you need in recovery well that's false we need all of our essential amino acids and that's what we get from food um so usually i do not recommend the the branch chain amino acids because it's it that one i would say with a lot of uh certainty um is quite a waste of money but the creatine um does have some science behind it but those are good questions i'm doing a session on tuesday of like pre-workouts creatine protein powder um and like drink the pink which is uh branched chain amino acids so those are the super popular ones that everyone assumes because you know some nhl player uses it that it must be good but that no they just got paid to use it any other questions for tonight okay well if there's uh if you think of any more questions please uh send them my way or to heather she has her email there so uh yeah thanks for tuning in this evening heather thank you so much that's very informative and yeah really enjoyed that awesome yeah thanks so much for everyone who signed in tonight i know everyone's getting pretty like zoomed out um but yeah thanks thanks for jumping on and if there's other uh topics or questions that you guys have like where i'm open to doing more education as we transition to hopefully seeing people in person but this is obviously super convenient for you know hitting specific topics like you know depending on where people are in the province", "z0uTL_ZOOoY": "hi I'm Caroline

here with sick to fit by yourself well start health that I'm joined by Margaret Sarah boy finger how's it going great how are you doing good so you're back home after Nationals eh yep and I've met with my new coach and I've been changing up my training and I'm just really excited to to see some new growth going on so awesome awesome some just pulling up the comments so I can see what folks are are thinking and saying so I wanted to talk to you today about food right because last time we talked about you know like you're not a wealthy person at this point in terms of dollars mm-hmm yeah and you know you went out to California for like a week or two and you eat really healthy yeah and so I know people are always interested in like how do you do that like okay so your home you just eat beans and rice and there's you know it's boring but it's cheap like people have these concept at least they have concepts about how you eat healthy at home and how you might be able to do it on a budget but in terms of like traveling yeah but you know how do you manage to eat well and not go out to dinner every night or not have to sacrifice your your standards well one good thing that happened in California was I brought Captain America a que Mike and he's like the chef and so he's basically been able to create these like amazing meals that are you know plant-based and they don't have much oil in them you know seasoning like just being able to make it really taste well so that was a good thing going into this but sometimes I don't have him on my trips and so I just like stick with the basics you know like I'll bring some jars with me and I'll make overnight oats which is like a really simple thing where you can just like put chia seeds and oats and fruit and almond milk like let it sit overnight and in the morning you can add more berries or fruit whatever you know your preference and like that's like a really great nutrient dense fuel like to just start my day you know and then I just will eat you know fruits and vegetables throughout the day as snacks I really like hummus guacamole you know and so like when I'm on my own I'm doing a lot of like fruits and vegetables and oatmeal and beans and sweet potatoes you know things like that but when I do get to have my chef's you know I'll will get to eat like cauliflower pizza which like he's been like I'm really into pizza like as a swimmer like we used to like go to please to go to Pizza Hut like and basically just have all these like almost pizza contests were like you're trying to eat like a whole large pizza after swimming like a mile right like it has a kid as a kid I was a distance swimmer and so like our thing was after you know a race like we would go and eat like cheese pizza right and so like pizza is like my favorite food but I wanted to be able to eat it healthy you know and not not have all those complications while I wanted to eat good so he's been able to create his own crust so we're not having to buy you know we know exactly what's going in it sometimes he makes it with cauliflower sometimes almond flour tapioca flour he gets really creative with his dough and it's pretty pretty amazing so were you staying at a place to have postitions yeah so um basically since so I'm going on my second year now can you believe it like you first met me when it was like a hundred days of plant-based and now I'm like oh I'm now I'm almost on like two years you know so this is really exciting but yeah so every time I travel like I always look for an air B&B and I and it's really like a plush for the kitchen like I want the kitchen to be like really high standard you know and like if I sleep on the floor like whatever right like the kitchen is like the most important thing that the people who have like a full-size that way we don't have to like bring any blenders or you know any type of tools when I go out to travel like I have everything I need and so that makes it really nice you know cuz I've stayed at hotels and it doesn't make my food experience as good as I'd like it to be like I mean it's always good right like I can have fruits and veggies in the fridge and things like that but like oh if I want like you know homemade pizza or I want some beans and rice or you know because he's Haitian so he makes these like really authentic like Jamaican and different like cuisines like I I mean his food is so good that I don't even feel like we have to eat out because no one has the ability that we've gone to that can cook like him alright well that's that's totally useless for the rest of us Sarah because you're not sharing Captain America with us so we are a couple of the tips that I tags like if you stay in the Airbnb and they're using they're usually cheaper than hotels anyway yes they are right so a place with a good kitchen that has you know your blender and your toaster in your oven and plates and cutting board so so where did you so let's leave Captain America out of this because he's annoying skills let's say you're just you're just traveling on your own used at the air B&B is there like you have requirements like it has to be walking distance to a Whole Foods or a super how like how do you you know where do you go for your food what's one of the troughs out of which you feed when you're traveling well so I really I would prefer if it was like you know a Trader Joe's or Whole Foods or a common market like that's normally where I shop at home so I like that and also sometimes like regular grocery stores you know they have your produce items they have oats you know like you can get a lot of your basic nuts and things like that like for snacks things at a regular grocery store so with this particular place I was two miles from a Trader Joe's and two other grocery stores so say Trader Joe's didn't have what I was looking for like on the other spectrum like two miles the other way there were like you know another type of grocery store that had like my basic you know fruits and vegetables and all the things that I could use you know to make sure that I was properly nutrient so I could race really well you know okay cool so let's say you're you're in a city and you're by yourself again know Captain America yeah you're at your Airbnb you have your breakfast might be these overnight oats where you just get a jar and you put the oats or the chia seeds and the fruit in and it's just delicious in the morning then let's say you're gonna spend the day out like you're not going to come back for something what would you pack um so I really like broccoli so I'm a big like get some broccoli and cauliflower I really like hummus like I would say I'm the hummus killer because literally I could eat a whole thing of hummus I mean throughout the day um so and my favorite one is like the you know you can get like a basic one but I like pine nut and a lot of times if it has extra oil you know you can just kind of drain it so it's not too much for you and so then that would be like a really great snack that I would like carrots too I like and then maybe like some mixed berries like with some pineapples and strawberries and blueberries maybe even some grapes like to go along with that and so that would be like what I would eat maybe like two to three hours after my overnight oats just so that I'm not like starving so then I would get into cravings and things like that you know so I always make sure that I'm full so then I don't like have those things where all of a sudden I want some kind of cheeseburger right and so then like in that like if I'm going say I'm gone for like so we'll just say that like I'm leaving to go to the pool right and I don't race until maybe two o'clock but like want to go to the pool early and I want to warm up and and get settled and things like that so then like for maybe after my swim I would pack like a big salad I like to put fruit and vegetables in it I like guacamole maybe even slices of avocado and just you know what I usually like to use hummus or guacamole as like a dressing that way it just like makes it simple and I don't have to buy extra things when I'm out because like I really like to just like like I could literally buy a ton of things for under $100 for like a whole week I mean if I really wanted to I could the other great thing about using guacamole or hummus as a dressing is that it's not messy it's like it's not like likley and runny it's not gonna like spill out it into your backpack and get all over your clothes exactly and like a lot of times like there are like you know you can buy these little even hummus packs or even guacamole packs that are like really like you know like just a serving size so that way you can even just like throw it in your bag and it makes it like super simple for you no packing purposes and just like being out and then like I would also like find some nuts like maybe either a mixed nut or maybe I really like cashews they had they're high in fat but like I like that for especially when racing because I find that like when I'm having cashews or even like pecans or like things that have like a higher fat content it helps with my how I'm racing so yeah well I guess also when you're racing you know if you're eating like enough broccoli to get all your calories that's like 20 pounds of broccoli see yeah you're essentially a vegetable barge yeah yes we got some comments Ron says we look great thank you Ron thank you rob you look great too even though we can't see you yeah exactly Josh Josh Turner has a bunch of ideas do you know Josh no I think I know Josh the Johnnies buddy from from from home Louisiana with living with type 1 diabetes hey he was on the podcast a while back he says chickpea salad is a go to apples and bananas and also records like throw some quinoa into a salad for a good carb content yes I like that and I also sometimes will do you know sweet potatoes sweet potatoes and lentils are a big race fuel for me I like how I perform when I have lentils and sweet potatoes so that's good and I also like that chickpea idea I've done that a couple times where I'll just like mashed chickpeas and avocado together and like just maybe a little seasoning or sometimes not and I'll just even mix beets in there you know and sometimes it doesn't necessarily have to taste good like if I'm like really inspired to just get the you know the nutrients that I want in for especially for a race like I'm ok with it not being too like spectacular you know haha right yes the things like we like this food but it does it's it's the most important thing isn't the taste anymore right when I would travel to another city I'd be like you know oh where are the best restaurants you know where where the gourmet experiences that I can't have anywhere else I did a lot of business travel you know a decade ago I'd go to you know Brussels or cities in Europe or we you know we'd go to Kansas City and we want to know like what's this the best steakhouse in Kansas City and like you know what's the finest restaurant in Charlottesville now I'm like you know yeah it's nice to eat good food but you know give me a pail of slop with some mustard on it you know just just some beans and veggies you know if you got like Trader Joe's has real nice packages of things that are pretty much already cooked septic packed and just the feeling of okay I'm energized and I'm not grossly fall and now I can go do my thing it's like a better feeling that this is the most delicious thing I've ever tasted and I'm gonna overeat on it and it's you know it's full of oil and fat and sugar and salt and now now misery one I'm not enjoying the rest of my trip mm-hmm exactly like even yesterday for example I went to hershy park and so at Hershey Park like there's no plant-based options it's all like popcorn and funnel cakes and burgers and hot dogs and that's all you're smelling like all day right and so it's like okay like how can i you know maximize my experience right so like I wake up I'd go for a swim first and then I eat my overnight oats and then two hours later I was like okay I'm gonna have some broccoli and hummus and carrots and then you know I'll bring an apple and maybe like some kind of protein bar you know in with me to the park so then I can spend like three or four hours in there but I have like a snack so I'm not like feeling like you know because we all like if you smell it's not like it never smells good again right but you just know like that I don't wanna eat that you know and I don't wanna yes yes like the really hot boyfriend or girlfriend that just you broke up with you're like yeah they're still hot yeah but you don't have to go into the temptation right it's just like okay like I'm good do you know so and then even like we'll take a break and you get a hand stamp so you can like already have your food ready to go and then like we'll have a salad ready in the fridge bring tons of water so that you're never dehydrated you know and I find that like even standing in line for an hour can be fun just because like I'm I have all the nutrients that I need and I'm well hydrated and it's like it doesn't affect me you know maybe as it would if I wasn't prepared or I didn't think that these little snacks that I had could help you know and in my day yeah yeah you don't you don't want to be hangry on a line at amusement parks no I did that one time and I was like really painful like just the whole body was just like oh my gosh like why didn't I have a bottle of water with me or why didn't I have that snack you know and I end it we ended up that day doing therefore one ride waited two hours and I was like I'm good like I'm gonna just eat and drink there yeah it comes like if you talking about a bar like when you're traveling it's very easy to you know no pun intended lower the bar and you know like make all sorts of excuses about well this is a special occasion but so if you take stuff with you then maybe it's not your everyday like I wouldn't eat al arab are just as a snack in the middle of the day i would rather go for a banana or an apple or some frozen berries a little you know rolled oats with almond milk or something but when i'm traveling i'll throw like if i'm on going on an airplane like i'm going to California I will pack like six Larabars in my carry-on and I know that for that whole trip like I don't have to worry I mean you know they don't serve food on the airplane anymore yeah but they give you those like awful snacks like Ritz crackers cheese and like you know pretzels and I mean like a lot of it like I would just like sink back to life when I was eating those right and like it was like what was I feeling like I was just like oh man like it just with the way that it melted in your mouth right and so then you're watching all these other people eat these snacks but it's like it's not giving them necessarily energy it's just giving this them this like temporary feeling right oh this is good and then like something something too I mean like on an airplane like a six-hour ride or longer you need like little you need breaks to like mentally to break up the flight like okay in two hours I can have a snack then I'll watch the movie then in another hour I'll get up I'll walk really slow to the bathroom do some yoga and move this luggage I need to plank of the overhead bin right so and yeah and the other thing is like those airplane snacks if they don't you know generally they sell them to you right look they'll have a little laminated card that'll show like okay here's the the mediterranean box which will be like you know crackers two little things of celery some hummus of a very questionable provenance and like an olive and it'll be like 995 yeah like i'm a cheapskate like i you know with i don't have a ton of money at the moment but if i did it would earn me to spend it on subpar not enough food yeah no I mean I'm bringing this like it's so amazing I had this cooler that like for years I never used right like it's just like this little bag that's like really great for traveling you know I can wear my little book bag and I can carry this right and if I travel Southwest I can take both of those on the plane with me I don't even have to check it in right so I have this bag and I literally fill it up as far as I can with food so that like in any moment you know if I need something or you know whatever it is like I'm gonna have it and it's funny like how airplane people are constantly like wow like that's really smart you know to bring like food like that and I was like yeah well you guys don't sell anything and even if you did like I can buy it cheaper at the grocery store and I can you know have make sure that my needs are met because I've had times when my needs weren't met and it's not very fun right so I don't want that I don't want to experience that so and how it could be so simple to just pack a couple things with you you know so that you're able to be successful this also applies in the car you know or on the train or like when I travel on the train for like an hour I make sure that you know I have a couple snacks in my bag I have a filled up you know water with me to make sure that you know if it's a hot day or something you can you can easily carry a simple snack yeah and it doesn't it doesn't take the kind of prep that I think a lot of people are imagining like they think well we're I remember like the picnics we used to go to and like we've prepped for three days for a picnic yeah right like it doesn't have to be like that it's just like you think about what are the foods that travel well that can withstand a little bit heat that can withstand a little bit of bumping around that I can eat with my fingers I don't you know I don't need to cut them I don't need utensils and you know China bone china settings and it turns out to be largely the foods that we would eat every day you know vegetables spreads beans lentils rice fruits and vegetables and the eye and fruit is one of the great things like I love it you know when you eat the way we do we're used to sort of like paying a premium for like clean food but you go to the airport like the cheapest thing you can buy is three dollars and 25 cents like a Clif Bar there's like you know three and a half dollars then you've got the teeny little packs of like you know okay raw almonds like $7.99 and then there's this usually a basket of apples and bananas they're like a dollar each and no one's touching them yeah it's like oh four for six dollars I could buy four bananas and two apples that's like like all my calories for the morning and and lunch six bucks yeah and I mean because we are not you know educated like that right like it's not like this isn't a normal way to you know eat per se because like we've been shared conditionally that you know your meal consists of like you know sitting down somewhere and you you know need to have these particular foods in there and it has to you know that we've just kind of created like all this extra when it's just so simple just like our ancestors you know we just picked vegetables and fruit and we kept them moving you know okay yeah like the Lions on the savannahs where are we gonna put all this where where are we gonna sit where's the tablecloth right yeah yeah I'm in favor of like family meals of sitting down of relaxing but when you're traveling you can let go of of all of that and just you know in return and in fact traveling is like a good place to practice eating at home because you add these additional sort of constraints and it allows you to get real clear and creative about what are the essential things that I need in order to fuel myself mm-hmm and then you just get better the more you practice it like now it's like normal like I will never travel on a plane without some snacks you know like I'm always gonna bring my cooler because that's just you know it it I've had so much success with it you know so it just makes it easier right Elizabeth says she still likes her food sliced it's only a couple hours if you're traveling on a plane you know there's only there's you could use a credit card I guess ya get one of those like you know Chase Sapphire met with the metal credit cards you could use that to cut your food but you like it's a preparation like I wouldn't travel somewhere without a razor without a change of underwear and you know there's different different ways of doing it like joshula Johnny likes to travel with nothing and just sort of forage his way and in some cases he pays a premium for that in other cases you know he's very comfortable sort of going anywhere and finding his own food but wherever you are like I have backed out down there I have a shoe box that says travel and its got like adapters it's got extra batteries and it's got like a Larabars so I don't like the night before oh I'm going up to Boston hache I didn't pack anything like I just have extra just just always be prepared it's almost like you have like in the grocery store where they have like those like that sample drawer right where it's like oh here's my mini like toothpaste and toothbrush and like here's the aisle for travel like you have that in your house that's so cool yeah I won't have a travel box but oh it's great I mean what you know what one of the best things I ever did was like a separate little toiletries bag just for travel so I don't have to oh I forgot I forgot this i don't have aftershave I've no I no toothbrush like you know you ever yeah like chai I once I was once in New York City without a toothbrush looks like really they're all for two hours yeah so yeah prep you know just being as prepared as you want to be for anything else for for your travels mm-hmm totally cool anything else before we let all these good people go thank you for any questions from folks watching live yeah I don't know I mean I feel like that covers all the goods of the food cool cool yeah the other who says like if you are okay with water you're pretty good like beverage wise yeah yeah yeah if you don't need any tea or you know coffee or anything like that it works no all right well Sarah thank you for dropping your wisdom on us cool see you guys next time you next Tuesday okay", "6KYx-WvYf_g": "Welcome everyone! Just give us one quick second while we pull together our cameras. I just want to say thank you to everyone who's joining us today Thank you so much for tuning in for\u00a0\nthis week's episode of Cooking Connected If this is your first time with us, welcome!\nFor all of you guys returning, welcome still! We're excited to be here with you guys today and excited to go through this\u00a0\u00a0 really awesome recipe that we have Chef Julia\u00a0\nto demonstrate for us. My name is Saajewa and I am\u00a0\u00a0 one of the Cooking Matters program coordinators\u00a0\nand I'm also here today with my co-worker Jordan\u00a0\u00a0 (hi!) and our lovely volunteer Julia. Both\u00a0\nJordan and I, again like I mentioned, we\u00a0\u00a0 work with Cooking Matters Minnesota and that's\u00a0\nalso with the University of Minnesota Extension\u00a0\u00a0 And then again we have our volunteer Julia.\u00a0\nA normal Cooking Matters class is a six-week,\u00a0 nutrition-based cooking class and usually we meet\u00a0\nonce a week for two hours. We'll have a nutrition\u00a0\u00a0 educator and a chef who work together with a\u00a0\nrecipe, and the chef will do a demonstration. We learn some nutrition that goes along with that\u00a0\nrecipe and then we get to cook the recipe together\u00a0\u00a0 So, it's a really fun class and they're really enjoyable to be a part of\u00a0\u00a0 For today's episode, our chef will be\u00a0\nJulia and Jordan will be the educator\u00a0\u00a0 and we're going to kind of follow that\u00a0\nsame format that I mentioned earlier\u00a0\u00a0 Every week we do have a survey that\u00a0\nwe want to really quickly ask you guys to take\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you so much to all of you who have been\u00a0\ntaking our surveys! It really helps us continue\u00a0\u00a0 this kind of work and the constructive\u00a0\ncriticism helps us make our work better. Today's survey code for this week's episode\u00a0\nof Cooking Connected is going to be e 0 9 7 9\u00a0\u00a0 3 0. That's going to be our program\u00a0\ncode for this week's episode of Cooking Connected\u00a0\u00a0 I'll be sure to link the survey in the description\u00a0\nbox of this video as well as in the live chat so\u00a0\u00a0 you guys can check that out. And with that, I\u00a0\nam going to go ahead and pass this over to  Jordan and Julia. Hi everyone welcome back to\u00a0\nanother episode! As Saajewa mentioned, today\u00a0\u00a0 we are going to be making a healthy apple crisp.\nWe just want to quickly thank Ambitious Kitchen..\u00a0\u00a0 Monique with Ambitious Kitchen, for this recipe. We do have those links in our description box Thank you Monique for this amazing recipe!\u00a0\nWith that, we can go ahead and get started. Welcome Julia! Have you made this recipe\u00a0\nbefore? I have and it's a really good recipe\u00a0\u00a0 and with this the \"healthy\" is, I'm going to say\u00a0\n\"healthier\".  There's still a lot of sugar in it, but\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes you just need a treat - that's right\u00a0\nand we'll talk a little bit more. It's just lower\u00a0\u00a0 in the sugar, we've got some whole grains in there,\u00a0and then I'm gonna leave the apple peels on too\u00a0\u00a0 which is another way that we boost the\u00a0\nhealth of this. I'm gonna do this here: Alright so the first thing that I'm gonna do is\u00a0\nstart on my apples. No, first thing I'm gonna do is\u00a0\u00a0 wash my hands! And I already did that. 20 seconds\u00a0\nwashing your hands, super important. In between\u00a0\u00a0 fingers, around the thumbs, everywhere like that. So I did do that already. I cleaned my workspace\u00a0\u00a0 and now as you can see, I've got everything ready\u00a0\nso this is my mise en place. This way I don't have\u00a0\u00a0 to dart around the kitchen and try and grab things\u00a0,\nrealize that I'm out of something halfway through\u00a0\u00a0 the recipe... everything is right here and ready\u00a0\nto go. With that I'm gonna start on my apples.\u00a0\u00a0 So I've got orchard apples here that I just got\u00a0\nat a local orchard. They're called wealthy, that's the\u00a0\u00a0 kind that they are and they're pretty tart,\u00a0\nso they are going to work perfectly in this\u00a0\u00a0 to kind of balance some of that sugar that we've\u00a0\ngot in there. The recipe calls for Honeycrisp or\u00a0\u00a0 Granny Smith apples, but again anything that you've\u00a0\ngot on hand. Apples from the orchard are really\u00a0\u00a0 a cheap way to get some good\u00a0\napples, so that's what I did with these. Absolutely and apples right now are in season,\u00a0\nso getting local apples, support local\u00a0\u00a0 farmers, is really great. Part of\u00a0\nJulia's mise en place here is actually\u00a0\u00a0 to wash her apples as well, which I'm sure\u00a0\nshe's already done so don't forget that stuff.\u00a0 Don't forget that stuff if you are using\u00a0fresh apples. Alright, so for this to get started, I'm holding my knife\u00a0\nin a certain way. Let's see from this one\u00a0\u00a0 The way I like to hold my knife is to pinch\u00a0\nthe blade with my forefinger and thumb, and\u00a0\u00a0 then wrap my fingers around the handle of the\u00a0\nknife. That just gives you a lot more control\u00a0\u00a0 so your knife isn't flailing around everywhere. You\u00a0\nknow I've seen people hold knives more like this,\u00a0\u00a0 and that is just a recipe for cutting a finger\u00a0\noff, so I stay away from doing it like that. As you can see here I've got a method\u00a0\nfor cutting the core out of my apples. I don't have\u00a0\u00a0 a corer so this is how I do it. I'm just going to\u00a0\nshow you again on this one. So I always use my claw\u00a0\u00a0 hand to get my fingers out of the way, because\u00a0\nI don't want to be cutting off any fingers or\u00a0\u00a0 anything like that. I'm just\u00a0\ngoing to put my apple down, make sure it's\u00a0\u00a0 kind of stable, and then cut down one side\u00a0\nnext to the core so that gives us this little\u00a0\u00a0 piece there. Then what I'm going to do is flip it\u00a0\nto the cut side so then it's really stable, not\u00a0\u00a0 going to roll around on us at all, and do another\u00a0\ncut right down next to the core. Same thing for the\u00a0\u00a0 third side, and then the last side just right like\u00a0\nthat. That gets out all the core, all the seeds,\u00a0\u00a0 so you don't have to worry about that, and it's\u00a0\nnice and safe to always have it on that flat.\u00a0\u00a0 The recipe calls for slices of apple.\nI like it to be a little bit more of a chunk.\u00a0 So what I'm going to do is cut across, still\u00a0\npretty thin. I'm doing about an eighth of an\u00a0\u00a0 inch, if you can see that thickness there.\u00a0\nThen after I do this, I'm just going to turn the pile and do a cut across too, just so\u00a0\nthat it's it's a little bit more of a chunk than\u00a0\u00a0 a slice. If you want to do the slice that's\u00a0\ncompletely fine, it's just personal\u00a0\u00a0 preference. So Julia, with this is it still\u00a0\nimportant to cut all of your apple slices\u00a0\u00a0 kind of the same, so then they cook about the same?\u00a0\nAbsolutely, it's definitely important to try and\u00a0\u00a0 keep them consistent, otherwise you're going to\u00a0\nget some chunks of apple that are totally crunchy\u00a0\u00a0 and raw and then some chunks that are gonna\u00a0\npretty much just dissolve - become applesauce.\u00a0\u00a0 Alright, well it looks like Julia has a few\u00a0\napples to cut up there, so while she's doing\u00a0\u00a0 that we're just gonna quickly go over a little bit\u00a0\nof nutrition. We are making this beautiful sweet\u00a0\u00a0 treat today, so I thought I'd talk a little\u00a0\nbit about portion sizes. This is a \"healthier\"\u00a0\u00a0 sweet treat. I think it is personally, really\u00a0\nimportant to still eat the foods that we love\u00a0-\u00a0 so still eating these sweet treats, but keeping\u00a0\nin mind moderation is still really important. It's really just remembering not to overdo it, so portion control is a way\u00a0\u00a0 that we can make sure that we don't overdo it on\u00a0\nthe foods that we do love. \u00a0 We have gone over this before - our nutrition facts.\nI have a little nutrition facts label right\u00a0\u00a0 over here. Nutrition facts are really important.\nThey do tell you a serving size for the food,\u00a0\u00a0 and that is actually located, let's see here, right\u00a0\nup here. You can find the serving size of your\u00a0\u00a0 food. A serving size tells you the portion that\u00a0\nyou can eat for all of these different items\u00a0\u00a0 down here. For this it's one and one fourth\u00a0\ncup of this particular food, and you would be\u00a0\u00a0 consuming 220 calories. So keeping in mind you\u00a0\nknow that's for all of these things, so you're also\u00a0\u00a0 getting 20 percent of your vitamin A when you\u00a0\neat one and one-fourths cup. But let's say you\u00a0\u00a0 doubled that and you ate two and a half cups\u00a0\ninstead of one and one fourth - you would still\u00a0\u00a0 have to double all of these down here, so instead\u00a0\nof eating 220 calories I actually ate 440 because\u00a0\u00a0 I doubled the serving size. So serving size is a\u00a0\nreally important thing to look at and something\u00a0\u00a0 I'd like you all to consider looking at, especially\u00a0when we're thinking about our favorite snacks\u00a0\u00a0 I've got a couple examples here. I love pretzels\u00a0\nand, I don't know if any of you have ever done this\u00a0\u00a0 but sometimes when you grab that fresh bag of\u00a0\nchips or pretzels, or whatever you like to snack on,\u00a0\u00a0 and you go and sit in front of the TV, you open\u00a0\nthe bag and then you look down later on, and you\u00a0\u00a0 realize that half the bag is gone. So it's really\u00a0\nimportant to remember our portion sizes because\u00a0\u00a0 we need to know how much we're\u00a0\neating. So there's a few things we can do.\u00a0\u00a0 Looking at our portion sizes for the pretzels\u00a0\nthat I love, this is one portion of pretzels\u00a0\u00a0 here. This is 50 pretzels. I just\u00a0\nwant you all to see what this looks like\u00a0\u00a0 in a bowl here it does not look like very much-  you\u00a0\nmay eat a little more than that. But just keeping\u00a0\u00a0 in mind that this is one portion of pretzels,\u00a0\nand this is another portion here. So we'll\u00a0\u00a0 just see what two portions looks like real quick...\nso that fills us our bowl up a little bit more.\u00a0\u00a0 It's always really important to remember our\u00a0\nportion sizes. I'm just going to quickly give you a\u00a0\u00a0 few tips and tricks, before Julia gets done here, on\u00a0\nhow you can watch your portion sizes the easy way,\u00a0 because sometimes it can be really difficult.\nYou can portion out your snacks like I did here.\u00a0\u00a0 I like to portion out my chips and stuff.\u00a0\nSo when I get home from the grocery store I'll\u00a0\u00a0 just quickly portion them out in these bags.\u00a0\nThey do have these lovely reusable bags now.\u00a0\u00a0 I save my bags and just reuse those bags for my\u00a0\nsnacks. Another thing you could do is instead don't\u00a0\u00a0 take the whole bag with you when you're snacking. I really lean into my laziness and I like to\u00a0\u00a0 pour it in a bowl and then I'll actually put the\u00a0\nbag away and if I want more then I have to go get\u00a0\u00a0 it. Sometimes I'm not willing to do that so I will\u00a0\ngrab something more convenient, and a lot of times\u00a0\u00a0 if I have healthy food prepped, I'll gravitate\u00a0\ntowards that because it's more convenient.\u00a0\u00a0 You can actually put your unhealthier choices maybe\u00a0on a higher shelf or in the back of the cabinet\u00a0\u00a0 Might be a good option for you so then it's not so\u00a0\nconvenient. Some other things we can do is turn off\u00a0\u00a0 the distractions. Sometimes when we're sitting\u00a0\nin front of the TV, we don't even always realize\u00a0\u00a0 how much we're eating, so just thinking\u00a0\nabout our food and being mindful of that.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's make sure I got everything else\u00a0\nbefore we get started with Julia one more time\u00a0\u00a0 One other thing I did want to mention is also\u00a0\nlike portioning out meals, so if we have leftovers\u00a0\u00a0 like a big casserole, you can portion that out. You could either cut it up into portions in\u00a0\u00a0 the pan, or I like to take it one step further and\u00a0\nactually portion it out into Tupperware containers\u00a0\u00a0 That way when I am ready for work I just have\u00a0\none portion ready to grab for lunch the next day\u00a0\u00a0 Looks like Julia's got all of her apples cut up\u00a0\nthere so I'll turn it back over to Julia. Perfect!\u00a0\u00a0 I did get all of them cut up. I don't know if\u00a0\nanybody noticed on one of them I got a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 of the core in my slice, so I just went and cut\u00a0\nthat off. Some people don't mind having a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit of that middle part, but that's one thing that\u00a0\nI really want to avoid in my baked goods. So this is my bowl of apples. I did five - the recipe\u00a0\ncalls for five to six so just either one of those.\u00a0\u00a0 If your apples are a little bit smaller, maybe go\u00a0\nwith six. Mine were an average size so I just did\u00a0\u00a0 the five. So now I'm going to add the rest of\u00a0\nthe ingredients for my filling. The first\u00a0\u00a0 thing is going to be maple syrup and so this is\u00a0\npure real maple syrup this is not pancake syrup.\u00a0\u00a0 It's not Mrs. Butterworth's or\u00a0\nanything like that - this is 100% real maple\u00a0\u00a0 syrup and that's really important distinction\u00a0\nto get right when you're doing a recipe like\u00a0\u00a0 this, because - we're trying to\u00a0\nmake it healthier and that's just a whole bunch of\u00a0\u00a0 processed sugar, it's mostly corn syrup. Some\u00a0\nof them that you can get actually have a ton\u00a0\u00a0 of different kinds of artificial sweeteners in\u00a0\nthem, which not everybody really loves. So you\u00a0\u00a0 gotta make sure it's the real maple syrup in that. \u00a0\nSorry Julia, I just have a quick question for you.\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes maple syrup can be kind of expensive\u00a0\ndo you have any suggestions for any substitutes?\u00a0\u00a0 Definitely! So you could use agave syrup, I know\u00a0\nsome people that's getting kind of trendier so\u00a0\u00a0 some people have access to that now. Honey would\u00a0be good, I would just use a little bit less honey.\u00a0\u00a0 This recipe calls for a third of a cup\u00a0\nso if honey, maybe do a quarter of a cup.\u00a0\u00a0 And then if all else fails, throw some regular\u00a0\nsugar in there instead. Perfect, thank you! Alright, so that's that. This is a teaspoon of vanilla\u00a0\nextract just for kind of that warm baked goods\u00a0\u00a0 flavor. And then I've got cinnamon and nutmeg\u00a0\nin there. I really love nutmeg so I did -\u00a0 it just calls for a pinch, but I did a little bit more\u00a0\nthan that because I'm a big fan of nutmeg.\u00a0\u00a0 You can do whatever you like, and if you really\u00a0\nlike cloves or allspice, throw some of those in.\u00a0\u00a0 - anything like that. I'm just gonna toss this\u00a0\nup I'm making sure that I'm getting all of the\u00a0\u00a0 little clumps. Like this chunk, there's\u00a0\nthree slices all stuck together here,\u00a0\u00a0 so I'm just gonna make sure to break\u00a0\nthose up, and get some of these\u00a0\u00a0 other ingredients on all of the surfaces of the\u00a0\napples. Perfect! It's a very fall recipe, I love it. Alright, so that's that. I'm going to set this aside for a second while I work on my topping. So for this I've got all these ingredients over\u00a0\nhere. Again I set them up already, so let's see\u00a0\u00a0 You guys should be able\u00a0\nto see most of those now\u00a0\u00a0 We're using two different kinds\u00a0\nof whole grains in this. One of them is whole\u00a0\u00a0 wheat flour, and that is just like it sounds.\u00a0\nIt's the whole kernel of wheat, just ground up,\u00a0\u00a0 and that gives you a lot more nutrients than the\u00a0\nrefined flour, which is just the basic white flour.\u00a0 We really want to try to incorporate\u00a0\nwhole grains into our diet to get a whole\u00a0\u00a0 bunch more goodness out of our food. This is oatmeal, so it's just regular old, I use\u00a0\u00a0 old-fashioned oats because that's just what I have\u00a0\non hand. If you just have the instant, that'll work\u00a0\u00a0 too. They're pretty much just cut smaller, but it's\u00a0\nthe same stuff. And these are whole grains as well I'm going to get those mixed up.\nI have half a cup of pecans here -  you\u00a0\u00a0 don't have to use pecans. If you prefer walnuts,\u00a0\nsomething like that, you can use those instead.\u00a0\u00a0 I know my sister is allergic to nuts,\u00a0\nso if I was making this for her I would\u00a0\u00a0 just leave it out. You don't really need\u00a0\nto replace that with anything So do that. Then I've got spices here; this is just\u00a0\ncinnamon and salt. Salt is really important to\u00a0\u00a0 include in even baked goods. I know some people\u00a0\nthink that salt is only for savory stuff,  it's\u00a0\u00a0 weird to put it in cookies or whatever, but a little salt in everything is really\u00a0\u00a0 beneficial, I think. It just brings out the flavors\u00a0\na whole lot more. So in that case, you wouldn't even\u00a0\u00a0 need to use as much sugar, or anything like that,\u00a0\nbecause you'll be able to taste everything more.\u00a0\u00a0 So Julia, we do have a question: could you use\u00a0\nany other types of fruit in this or is there any\u00a0\u00a0 suggestions that you have for that? Well, different\u00a0\ntypes of apples, certainly. Whatever your\u00a0\u00a0 favorite kind of apple is. I would kind of stay\u00a0\naway from something that's really sweet, like  Red Delicious or anything like that, probably is\u00a0\ngonna just turn into mush -and if that's what\u00a0\u00a0 you like then go for it. Other fruit, I think you could do something with berries,\u00a0\u00a0 kind of do more of a a spring theme - so mixed\u00a0\nberries would be good with this. (Sorry I\u00a0\u00a0 don't know if you can hear my cat playing in the\u00a0\nbackground). Or pears, if you were gonna use\u00a0\u00a0 pears, I would maybe go with the ones that are not\u00a0\nquite 100% ripe yet. But I think those would be\u00a0\u00a0 pretty great. Did you have any other\u00a0\nideas Jordan? No, that kind of covers it. I didn't\u00a0\u00a0 even think of those. I was trying to think of other\u00a0\nones. The berries does sound delicious, I would\u00a0\u00a0 totally try the berries with that. Absolutely and\u00a0\nwith that I would definitely add less of the\u00a0\u00a0 sweetener to the filling because berries are so\u00a0\nmuch sweeter to begin with. Absolutely. Alright,\u00a0\u00a0 so next I have dark brown sugar here. So dark\u00a0\nbrown sugar is just the same thing as light brown\u00a0\u00a0 sugar, except there's more molasses in it so it\u00a0\ngives it a richer flavor and then also another\u00a0\u00a0 cool thing is you get more iron and magnesium from\u00a0\nthe extra molasses! So this is a third of a cup and\u00a0\u00a0 I packed it into the measuring cup. That's the\u00a0\nproper way to measure brown sugar. If you ever\u00a0\u00a0 have a recipe that calls for brown sugar, they're\u00a0\nassuming that you're going to pack it into the cup.\u00a0\u00a0 You can see in mine even, it still was holding\u00a0\nthe shape of the measuring cup when I was,\u00a0\u00a0 when I was going. I'm just going to give\u00a0\nthat a nice toss, kind of get everything\u00a0\u00a0 incorporated. The next thing I'm going to do\u00a0\nis I'm going to cut in the butter. So you can see\u00a0\u00a0 here, I've got butter in, I cut it up into little\u00a0\nchunks, so that's going to help it incorporate a\u00a0\u00a0 lot more easily. We're trying to keep some bigger\u00a0\nchunks of butter, some smaller chunks of butter,\u00a0 and that's just to keep the texture a little\u00a0\nbit varied throughout the topping. This\u00a0\u00a0 is cold butter. I know sometimes recipes call\u00a0\nfor room temperature butter, but this we want\u00a0\u00a0 to stay cold, so I just pulled this out of\u00a0\nthe fridge. I'm just going to add that.\u00a0\u00a0 And then this part you can do this\u00a0\nwith two knives criss-crossing,\u00a0\u00a0 you can use a pastry cutter if you have one,\u00a0\nI prefer to use my hands. So what I'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to do with this is just give it a little bit of\u00a0\na toss, kind of get the chunks of butter coated, and then I'm actually going to go in with my\u00a0\nhands and kind of separate those chunks of\u00a0\u00a0 butter. I am going to wash my hands again even\u00a0\nthough I just did. I think for something like\u00a0\u00a0 this, when my hands are actually going to be in\u00a0\nthe mixture, I'm just going to do it again just\u00a0\u00a0 because I feel like it. Yeah, that is absolutely\u00a0\ngreat. Thank you. We just did want to mention\u00a0\u00a0 as well, this is a really great sweet treat, but maybe perhaps you wanted to make something\u00a0\u00a0 similar, but not baked. If you wanted a non-baked\u00a0\noption, they do have options out there for this.\u00a0\u00a0 If you perhaps didn't have access to a stove right\u00a0\naway, or something like that, you could actually use\u00a0\u00a0 an apple pie filling. That does have a lot of\u00a0\nsweet, like a lot of sugar in it, but you could\u00a0\u00a0 use that for a sweet treat and add some oats to\u00a0\nit. And that would kind of be like a non-baked\u00a0\u00a0 option if you were interested in doing something\u00a0\nlike that. So Julia, I did have a\u00a0\u00a0 question for you, would you suggest always\u00a0\nbuying dark brown sugar, or would you\u00a0\u00a0 buy light brown sugar for some instances? Usually\u00a0\nI use light brown sugar. Some things are going to\u00a0\u00a0 be a lot better with the deep flavor of the dark\u00a0\nbrown sugar, like this topping. You just get more\u00a0\u00a0 kind of more flavor bang for your buck with that,\u00a0\nbut in something like chocolate chip cookies I\u00a0\u00a0 don't want that to be the predominant flavor so\u00a0\nI use light brown sugar for that kind of thing.\u00a0\u00a0 That being said, if you really love the\u00a0\ntaste of molasses, and you really love\u00a0\u00a0 the rich flavor of dark brown sugar, then\u00a0\nby all means try that in your cookies.\u00a0\u00a0 Looks like we got a couple of\u00a0\nquestions from our viewers. What does the butter\u00a0\u00a0 do in this recipe? I'm nervous about adding too\u00a0\nmany saturated fats in my diet. Sure, and  that's reasonable. Saturated fat is something that\u00a0\nwe want to try and keep on the lower side, for sure.\u00a0\u00a0 And that is again, any kind of solid fat so what\u00a0\nthis does is really pull the topping together.\u00a0 I mean, imagine if you just sprinkled the dry\u00a0\nmixture on top of the apples, it would still be\u00a0\u00a0 dry when you took it out of the oven. For\u00a0\nthis recipe I'm using a quarter cup of butter. This makes nine servings, so when you divvy it\u00a0\nup like that, it's really not going to be much per\u00a0\u00a0 serving. But if you don't want to use-  well first of\u00a0\nall, if you don't want to use an animal fat you can\u00a0\u00a0 use coconut oil, but that does still have saturated\u00a0\nfat in it. So if you wanted to do something like\u00a0\u00a0 that without the saturated fat, you could try\u00a0\nusing a neutral plant oil like a soybean or corn oil or something like that. I am\u00a0\nnot going to guarantee that the results are\u00a0\u00a0 still going to be that crumbliness\u00a0\nthat you're used to, just because\u00a0\u00a0 the way that we're doing this, there are some\u00a0\nchunks that have bigger chunks of butter and\u00a0\u00a0 some that have smaller pieces of butter and that\u00a0\njust really adds to the texture of the topping.\u00a0\u00a0 Sure, another question here someone asked\u00a0\nis molasses healthy? You know it's really,\u00a0\u00a0 it's not that bad. I'm not going to tell\u00a0\nyou to drink it as an elixir or anything,\u00a0\u00a0 but like I said there's iron in it, magnesium.\nI don't use it as much as I probably could. It does have, like I said, that really deep\u00a0\nflavor so I have a recipe for chocolate\u00a0\u00a0 cake with a little bit of molasses in it and that\u00a0\nis really good. I should make that again actually. Absolutely, any time for chocolate\u00a0\ncake. Yum! That sounds great. So this is looking pretty\u00a0\ngood. You can tell it's crumbly, it kind of\u00a0\u00a0 falls. Oh you can't see it from that angle, my\u00a0\nhand's in the way. And then I do have some\u00a0\u00a0 chunks of butter that are a little bit bigger\u00a0\na lot of them are smaller. It kind of makes it\u00a0\u00a0 like wet sand a little bit so you should be\u00a0\nable to grab a chunk and have it hold its shape\u00a0\u00a0 for the most part, that's what we're looking for\u00a0\nwith this. So now I'm gonna wash my hands again.\u00a0\u00a0 Always a good idea to wash your hands, so don't\u00a0\nbe afraid to do that in the kitchen when you're\u00a0\u00a0 making this recipe. We do actually\u00a0\nhave nutrition facts for this recipe. If you did go to ambitiouskitchen.com and\u00a0\nscrolled all the way down, pretty close to\u00a0\u00a0 the bottom, they do have nutrition facts for you.\u00a0\nAs Julia had mentioned, this does serve nine, so\u00a0\u00a0 there are nine servings in here.  Maybe if\u00a0\nyou wanted to portion this out for later, to\u00a0\u00a0 think about portion control, you could\u00a0\ncut your pan into nine different servings\u00a0\u00a0 and maybe take it one step further and portion\u00a0\nit out into Tupperware containers. It's\u00a0\u00a0 always a good idea to remember to try to look at\u00a0\nyour nutrition facts if they're available for you. Alright, so that's it for our preparation.\u00a0\nNow I'm just gonna put it all in the pan.\u00a0\u00a0 This is an eight by eight pan that I have.\u00a0\nYou could also use a nine by nine if that's\u00a0\u00a0 all you have, it'll just obviously be a little\u00a0\nbit thinner, but this is the kind that I have.\u00a0\u00a0 I went ahead and greased it. I just used spray, but\u00a0\nyou can definitely use butter if you want to.\u00a0 You know, you've got it out anyway for the\u00a0\ntopping. I'm just going to give this a\u00a0\u00a0 little toss again. Some of the syrup and\u00a0\nsome of the juices from the apples have\u00a0\u00a0 kind of concentrated at the bottom of the bowl,\u00a0\nso I'm just gonna throw those around a little bit. Oh you know what I almost forgot! They\u00a0\nwant us to put a little bit of the topping\u00a0\u00a0 mixed in with this to thicken it up. So this\u00a0\nrecipe says to to add a third of the filling,\u00a0 which I'm definitely just going to\u00a0\nguess, it doesn't need to be perfect.\u00a0 But that'll help thicken the filling\u00a0\nso it doesn't have just that liquid chilling\u00a0\u00a0 at the bottom. The oats and also the flour will\u00a0\nhelp to do that. I remember that this is why\u00a0\u00a0 you should always double check your recipe. That's\u00a0\nright! It looks like we got another question from\u00a0\u00a0 our viewer: could you buy light brown sugar and\u00a0\njust add molasses to make the dark brown sugar?\u00a0\u00a0 Actually yes, and if you run out of brown sugar\u00a0\nat all you can use white sugar and mix it with\u00a0\u00a0 molasses to make brown sugar. I don't know the\u00a0\namounts off the top of my head, but you know\u00a0\u00a0 that's something that you could definitely look\u00a0\nup online. But yeah, that does work perfect. Okay, so I've got this in here.\nI'm just going to spread it out\u00a0\u00a0 kind of into an even layer because again\u00a0\nthat's going to help it cook evenly\u00a0\u00a0 and make sure that nothing turns into\u00a0\napplesauce and nothing's still crunchy. So that's that and then I'm just going to\u00a0\nsprinkle the topping all over the top of it.\u00a0\u00a0 And don't forget about the the edges, because a\u00a0\nlot of times you know when you have desserts like\u00a0\u00a0 this, everything is kind of piled in the middle.\nSo I like to actually go around the edges first\u00a0\u00a0 to make sure that I get them all and then I'll go\u00a0\nthrough and fill in the parts in the middle.  That's a good idea. I always feel like I'm\u00a0\ndumping it all in the middle and then just trying\u00a0\u00a0 to spread it out at the end. Could you use\u00a0\na round pie pan for this recipe? For sure! Yeah I\u00a0\u00a0 don't see any reason why you wouldn't be able to\u00a0\ndo that. For that I would probably do a deep dish\u00a0\u00a0 or reduce this recipe, because a nine\u00a0\ninch pie dish is gonna be the same,\u00a0\u00a0 well almost the same size as this, but without the\u00a0\ncorners so you're losing a lot of area for that.\u00a0\u00a0 So I would use a a bigger pie dish if you can or,\u00a0\nlike I said, reduce the recipe a little bit.  I was thinking maybe a cast iron pan would\u00a0\nbe kind of cool. Yeah, that would be great.\u00a0\u00a0 So I know we're going to be adding,\nyou could always add a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 of topping to this as well to make it\u00a0\na little sweeter, with perhaps - I believe we're using a light whipped cream\u00a0\ntoday, if you wanted to do something like that.\u00a0\u00a0 You could buy a healthier ice cream like halo top\u00a0\nI think is a little bit healthier, low-fat\u00a0\u00a0 vanilla ice cream would go great. I think I\u00a0\nwould really love this with some vanilla yogurt. \u00a0\u00a0 I think that would be awesome that sounds fantastic.\nRight so that's everything for this. You can\u00a0\u00a0 tell it's pretty close to the top. I think you\u00a0\ncould see that from this side a little bit better.\u00a0\u00a0 It's really up there, so when I bake this\u00a0\nI'm gonna put it on top of another cookie sheet.\u00a0\u00a0 Excuse my cookie sheet, it's really old, well\u00a0\nloved. So I'm just going to set that on top so\u00a0\u00a0 that if any of the filling bubbles over it's\u00a0\nnot going to end up on the bottom of my oven\u00a0\u00a0 because that's a beast to clean. So I will\u00a0\njust throw this in. That is a really good tip! Alright, and so through the magic of TV, this is\u00a0\nwhat it's going to look like when it's all done.\u00a0 You can tell the topping is nice and browned, it\u00a0\ncrisped up really nicely. And the apples are soft.\u00a0\u00a0 So when I took, before I took this out of the oven,\u00a0\nI tested the apples with a little knife - put\u00a0\u00a0 in just to make sure that they were soft before\u00a0\nI took it out of the oven. And you might notice\u00a0\u00a0 that this is not an eight by eight pan, the reasons\u00a0\nfor that being I only have one eight by eight pan,\u00a0\u00a0 and also I am just one person so I cut the\u00a0\nrecipe in half to do this batch, and that way\u00a0\u00a0 I'm not gonna end up wasting food by having way\u00a0\ntoo much. Half a batch fit in this loaf\u00a0\u00a0 pan pretty perfectly, so that's always an option\u00a0\ntoo if you don't want to end up with all of that\u00a0\u00a0 at the end. Especially a lot of sweets, maybe you\u00a0\ncould share. One last comment from one\u00a0\u00a0 of our viewers: I'm assuming if you use a juicier\u00a0\nfruit like berries you would want to add\u00a0\u00a0 a bit more of the topping to thicken it up, what\u00a0\nare your thoughts on that? I think you could either\u00a0\u00a0 add a little bit more of the topping, otherwise you\u00a0\ncan toss some of the berries with a little bit of\u00a0\u00a0 cornstarch and that is going to act as a thickener\u00a0\ntoo. That kind of makes a little bit of a gel,\u00a0\u00a0 so I would do for this amount maybe a tablespoon\u00a0\nof cornstarch mix in and just toss with the\u00a0\u00a0 berries before you do anything\u00a0\nelse with them. Perfect, thank you so much\u00a0\u00a0 for all those tips Julia. We're so grateful\u00a0\nyou're helping us out with Cooking Connected.\u00a0\u00a0 Alright so thank you again Julia for that\u00a0\ndemonstration and that was our Healthy Apple\u00a0\u00a0 Crisp.

Thanks again everyone, bye!", "psbPaVLHvDY": "hey everybody and welcome to chef aj live i'm your host chef aj and this is where i introduce you to amazing people like you who are doing great things in the world that i think you should know about one year ago today march 20th 2020 i did my first episode of chef aj live at the time i didn't really know it was going to be a show it was just an effort to connect with people during the beginning of the pandemic i had no idea that people would come on and so many people would watch on a daily basis and i'm just so honored that now we are in season two with our first episode it's actually episode 445 i've interviewed over 500 guests for the show and i decided to start the new season with the guests that had the most views of all the guests and it is none other than multiple new york times best-selling author nutritional guru everyone's favorite doctor on the subject dr joel fuhrman thank you so much for taking this spot my pleasure looking forward to it as usual yeah dr firmer before we begin i just want to tell you how much i really truly appreciate what you do because somebody of your stature often wouldn't give somebody like me the time of day you've been on the show three times and with the summits i've done three truth about weight loss summits in the gi health summit and you are one of only two we we've interviewed over 150 doctors now you're only one of two that has actually been on every single summit you're always one of the most popular guests and your information is amazing and i what i really appreciate about you is that you're not afraid to tell the truth there's so many people that are doctors are in the nutritional space even in the plant-based world that are like oh you know oil's okay you know little vegan junk food's okay a cheat day's okay and you really tell the truth you're not afraid to speak up for for the health of people you're really one of the only ones in the plant-based world that gets food addiction so so thank you for that my pleasure and i think that you know that um i am some people may consider my viewpoints radical but i want to give people the best information so they could choose to do um what part of it or all of it i always felt like that if you'll sell a person out if you water down the information to try to expand your reach to make it more palatable to more people then you sell out those people who want the best information so they could have gotten well of the best results so by trying to make it more politically more applicable more that people want to hear you just weaken the message and don't and you have to um you know deviate from optimal you're deviating from the truth of what's best for people to do you know and you're not afraid to tell parents that they're not doing right by their children when they feed them this junk food that it's really not okay right and i'm not afraid to tell people that if they're a little bit overweight they're still putting themselves at health risk that there's no such thing as a healthy overweight person and we have all these healthy eating plant-based eaters of vegans they're healthy they think they're healthy but their body fats are 30 they weigh 140 150 pounds and they think they're healthy and they're and they're not because fat cells spew out reactive oxygen species cytokine lipo kinds increase insulin resistance increase estrogen production increase angiogenesis in other words what i'm saying right now is that the foundational principle behind my nutritarian approach is that is this idea of moderate caloric restriction in the context of micronutrient excellence and that we have to modulate the quality of what we eat and the quantity of what we eat to make sure that we achieve an optimal body weight and that means that that a woman's be a woman's body fat percent to be healthy has to be below 25 percent and a male's has to be below 15 percent and it's you're just you're trick um you're not being honest with yourself and people don't have the perception because they think as they're eating healthy it's okay that they still remain overweight because everybody in america is overweight and they just look like everybody else but it's still not ideal yeah well your height weight chart is that the gold standard because i'm i'm even overweight according to yours by about five pounds i don't have one specific weight chart or one specific amount of what i tell people to weigh i i do um you know i do tell people for most for males ideally that bmi should be about 22 when females are below 21 a bmi but there are some individuals that could have you know bigger bone structures that could always there's always the exception but regardless of your bmi whether it's above 22 for a male and above 21 for a female by a touch you still body fat still should be below 25 for a female and below 15 for a male i'm 67 my body fat's about 10 10 there's no reason why a male's body fat should be above above 15 ideally for a woman it might even below 23 but but certainly 25 is reasonable to expect people to have their body fat below that so i think that that's the it's it's a high expectation for some but it's something we should be achieving towards and if you have to do exercise to achieve that in addition to eating right then that's great wow well thank you i just want to show you something my birthday is in two days and look what somebody gave me oh wow that stuff is super expensive i know that is a good friend somebody that buys you dr fuhrman's vanilla powder thank you so much laura oh my goodness you know how expensive that is it's almost like a hundred dollars it's almost like two hundred dollars a pound yeah so it's like tremendously expensive stuff it's so good though it's the greatest stuff because it's it's good for you it makes things taste great you don't use that much so it's really worth it you know i agree we had to buy it because it was more expensive everywhere else so we had to get it and put it up there because people were pack couldn't find it for less than like 300 a pound so we had to get some and get them to even though it's super expensive it's still the best price you can get it at you know what i mean no and i agree with you as a chef it's unparalleled i won't even use extract anymore it's just yeah i mean either the extract the fake vanilla stuff it's in the liquids this is really real ground vanilla bean you know exactly because the alcohol free has glycerin which is sugar and the one that's not alcohol-free or sugar it just doesn't taste good i'd rather omit the vanilla than not use vanilla powder yeah that's great yeah so so we call today's uh getting together metabolism body fat oils aging and weight loss which one of those would you like to talk about first i wouldn't mind if you talk about oils because there is now a slew of younger vegan doctors that are basically saying it's not only okay but that it doesn't impact somebody's heart disease and with the um percentage of people overweight and obese i just don't understand how anybody is recommending oil as as a food well you know i'm i'm saying something a little even more radical in the other direction i'm saying as as crazy as this sounds i'm actually saying olive oil in these oils actually increase the risk of cancer like breast cancer so i'm saying completely opposite what these people are saying the reason i'm saying that and i think i can justify that with science is because oil is so effective at preventing weight loss and maintaining people in the overweight condition and it's being chronically overweight that set that raises aromatase activity and raises your estrogen levels that increase risk of breast and prostate cancer and it's being chronically overweight that keeps you chronically insulin resistance insulin resistant and then you have a higher glucose response with more advanced glycation end products circulating which age you faster so i'm making the connection between oil and body fat because we know when people either remove lessen the oil or switch oil the same amount of calories of oil into nuts and seeds they lose weight and that's well established in the scientific literature so there's no science so i'm saying something even further here that if you were going to a buffet and i gave you a tablespoon of olive oil 120 calories of oil to eat on the way to the buffet because there's no fiber and no volume and no significant nutrient load and it's absorbed so rapidly into the bloodstream when you got to the buffet you wouldn't eat 120 calories less eat the same amount of calories it has no effect to ratchet down the apostate so the additional oil you eat is just additional calories you could have consumed that you're consuming that you wouldn't have consumed if you didn't put the oil on it has no effect to reduce your appetite if i mix the oil and the food on the buffet then the scientists measuring how much people ate would find out they ate more than 120 calories extra from the oil 200 calories extra because oil is an appetite stimulant makes you want to eat more food or whatever it is you're eating furthermore because the oil it goes and the calories from the oil go into the bloodstream so rapidly it stimulates dopamine receptors in the brain the same way as other addictive substances like sugar does it's the speed at which calories into the bloodstream medical the medical term for that is called the bolus the word bolus means it all enters at once it doesn't come in slowly when you eat calories from a walnut or pistachio nut you get one or two calories a minute coming in here you get 30 to 40 calories a minute coming in and you know when your body takes in fat calories slowly your body preferentially burns those fat calories for energy it burns it off and it'll burn off the omega-6 calories as they're coming in to keep your omega-3 omega-6 ratio favorable when you're taking oil calories there's no burning off it has to go to storage when it goes to storage it turns on fat storage hormones which stay elevated for days and and you continually eat oil every few days and you have your fat storage hormones activated and people wondering why they're not weigh 145 pounds and they're not losing weight for a five foot four woman or something why she's not losing weight and she's cutting back on their food but she's still putting oil in the food and what i'm saying right now is oil has not only makes for excess calories but it has biological effects to your body's efforts to get rid of excess fat on the body and i'm making this clear in this conversation how dangerous i think excess fat on the body is i've already gave you three or four examples and that the hormones that lead to fat storage and like insulin also activate angiogenesis promoters because fat cells in general are are blood vessel and hypoxic tissue they don't have a great blood supply because they don't create a great blood supply in order to grow they have to release certain mediators and hormones that tells new blood vessels to grow into them the word angiogenesis means the promotion of the growth of new blood vessels so fat cells can grow more right so you now cancer cells need angiogenesis promotion so they can replicate grow and metastasize without angiogenesis promotion you can't get cancers to spread fat cells on the body are almost necessary to allow cancers to replicate and so i'm saying it's irrelevant whether a little bit of oil raises your cholesterol or is cardiovascularly negative or positive compared to a person eating butter meat pasta or a white potato it's irrelevant what's relevant is the oil is the most body fat promoting it prevents and most people are as you just said earlier most people in america are overweight if you were working eight hours a day behind a plow you know in an ox you know where you're a professional athlete and you could handle a little oil in your diet and still keep your body fat low and be really slim probably be great for you but most people don't aren't professional athletes who are working physical jobs and most people unfortunately are significantly overweight and that little bit of oil sabotages their ability to get healthy you know i couldn't agree more and it's generally the doctors that are telling people it's okay are ones that have never been overweight you know right they've never been overweight yeah and they don't know how some people have very slow metabolic rates and a little bit of deviation from what would be what we're considering ideal could could sabotage their results i take care of as you know i have people here who are diabetic with high blood pressure who are overweight and it's not that easy to get them well if they don't keep dropping weight every single week while we're monitoring them so they know exactly how to eat so when they go home they can replicate exactly what we taught them to do because they know they're losing two to three pounds a week and they can keep it going at home they know exactly what to eat exactly how much to eat they put dust adjusted it so they get results so they can replicate it the ultimate um decisions here if you're not getting results you're doing something wrong you have to get results if you're overweight so you achieve an ideal weight right i say a nutritarian is somebody at their ideal weight or if they're overweight they're moving towards that ideal weight at least two pounds a week if they're not dropping two pounds a week in the direction of their ideal weight and they're not following you know my recommendations because you have because that's because moderate caloric restriction is part of it needing less food slows the aging process and even has the ability as we see it measure it to reverse aging i know that sounds crazy and radical but we measure these aging parameters and we're seeing people age backwards and i'm not saying you're gonna um i'm saying what they've accelerated their aging and they've gotten to themselves in bad health and their aging parameters are abnormal like they're telomeres and their stem cell measurements and their inflammatory markers show they're at a higher chronological age biological age in their chronological age but then we get them doing the right thing and actually we see the biological layers measured by telomeres improving so it's we're seeing people actually get healthy reverse disease and age backwards well i we know this works but people still say that the diet that you and i eat and recommend without sugar oil and salt it's extreme i mean how do you eat at restaurants how do you eat at other people's houses you know and and this idea you know of these cheat days the people that you and i know and work with they can't afford a cheat day right you know i always give the story of like yeah one i won't give the whole story now but one sheet meal sets a person back for three days now that one cheat meal because when you are losing weight you're not just burning calories your body is also removing toxins and acidity and your body holds on to fluid and swells itself so when you getting healthy you're spewing out toxins and you're spewing out extra fluid that the toxins needed to dilute them so they wouldn't irritate tissue as much so when you go off your diet your body stops removing toxins it stops removing fat and it stops again and you hold on to fluid too which is also reflective of of um improper health to have excess fluid being held by the body yeah absolutely so if you don't mind i there are some questions that have been sent in because you're very popular and i'll start with a few of them we have one from deborah i recently started eating a whole food plant-based diet june 2020 due to having crohn's disease i just had a colonoscopy and they found deep ulcers in my intestine which can turn into fistulas is there any possibility of healing naturally from this my doctor wants me to take medication for the rest of my life which i don't want to do and i don't want another surgery yeah over the you can imagine over the last 30 years my a lot of my work has been involved with taking care of people with autoimmune conditions especially colitis and crohn's disease so it's very um you know so it's just um very very very critical this person knows they can get well and that we have certain protocols they have to follow but if they're having inflammation there then they have to be on a diet of pretty much mostly cooked foods and they have to have and we usually give them um some extra elements like high dose probiotics and high omega epa fish oils you know high we give them um a lot of inflammatory anti-inflammatory type materials and we usually heat give them juices that have been mildly heated as well so we have a protocol to get the inflammation down and then we as they're doing better we can wean them off the primarily cooked food and heated diet we can go towards a more um you know more raw foods that are blended so it has to be done in stages and it's really just hard in this type of a conference to tell a person what to do they need particular guidance based on their individual um disease process which even involves blood tests to make sure we're doing we're you know adjusting the the um the food and the supplements accordingly to help them heal so that's something i do do and i um actually have i've had people come to the retreat here to get well from that one example is a um a 19 year old boy i think he was like 16 when he came here but at 16 when he came here he had active crohn's disease on remicade and he stayed here for a couple of months and i've been in contact with him over the last year since he's been gone and he pretty much has made a complete recovery from his crohn's disease so we have a lot of that's just one example but over my career i've had to treat a lot of people with colitis and crohn's i remember years ago i had one person who likes who lived in my house for like two months who came out of the hospital they wanted to remove his colon wanted to surgically remove his colon and he was on steroids and he wasn't on eating anything so i told him well get you know we'll come into co right from the hospital and come in and live with me for a while i lived in my house for a while in the bedroom before my before carol was born he was up in that bedroom but anyway he stayed in that room we we um i kept i fasted him for a period of time i think i fasted him for about 10 days once he wasn't eating in the hospital but it was off the steroids now fasting in my house and then i put him on just steamed zucchini and cooked vegetable juices for about two to three weeks after that he was only on pureed steam zucchinis that we steamed with the full skin on and vegeta and cooked them and then so that and then we gradually fed them on to some like red new skin potatoes new skin players without the skins on them with the zucchini we gradually advanced his diet and he fought and he of course made a recovery too but it was a very um harrowing and you know he was very very dangerous position with having like 18 bloody bowel movements a day and they wanted to take his colon out so i have some taking care of some very very severe cases and achieved results in those cases and so now it's almost like people can live with you again if they eat to live retreat you know i always love that that people you know my wife and i first of all enjoy getting to know people and having you know it's because i always we always talk about people years ago um when we first got married and i was first a doctor i have to have people living in my basement you know on beds in my basement i did but but now we have a beautiful place where people come on but it's nice to know people and get to know them and that and it helps the healing when as you know you can't just come in for a doctor visit sometimes and and get a person to really understand everything they have to do and they need help to do it and of course we're dealing with a lot of people who still have addictive relationships dip this addictive love affair with food and that that period of abstinence where they learn to make healthy food taste great is the it you know turns it around for them too thank you sherry wants to know if we can freeze the dr furman vanilla powder it's available on your website drfurman.com in the store i think it's probably a good idea it might keep for a year out of the refrigerator but if you know because it's expensive you need to lose it you don't know how long you're going to use it for might be a good take some out into a smaller bag or a glass and then keep that in your refrigerator and the other part you could freeze it's a good idea yeah that's what i've always done i just want to let you know thank you randy dole and you got us a super chat donation so thanks dr fuhrman and here's a question from nataria regarding white blood cell count i recently saw a youtube video of dr fuhrman saying that people who follow a nutritarian diet have a lower white blood cell count i did some blood tests recently and my white cells were lower should i be worried you should be proud of yourself for for a health accomplishment because we know in the scientific literature that lower white blood cell counts are lead are linked to reduced inflammation longer lifespan and lower risk of cancer so this is a very good question because people should be aware that the normal range of white blood cell counts is abnormally high because it's measured because they set the normal based on where most americans run and you go to your doctor and he sees your white blood cell count as 3.2 or 2.8 or 3.8 and in the normal range is 5 to 10 and the doctor says oh my goodness there's something wrong with your white blood cells are too low you need to get a bone marrow biopsy you could have cancer and i'm saying to people no it's the doctor that needs the bone marrow biopsy for his high white blood cell count you have the normal white blood cell count because you're eating right and we know that these cells like the battery in the flashlight maintains its charge when the battery is turned off our white blood cell counts are lower because our white blood cells are safely tucked away you could say they're um they're they're safely in their in the bone marrow not being utilized not much inflammations then should we get an ammonia or should some some infection or some serious issue now we have white blood cells that can function more effectively we need them to function because people are constantly inflamed keeping the white blood cells activated all the time they're not going to respond well when they get sick whether you're exposed to a virus or an oral or a bacterial illness so we have better white blood selectivity and this woman should be proud of herself and be able to stand strong against her physician and saying no my white blood cell counts are good it's the other peoples that are higher that are bad yeah it's so hard when you don't have a doctor like yourself or a lifestyle medicine or plant-based doctor because they they interpret the blood tests completely differently yes and i think certainly i you know i've been i've been sharing this with all the physicians i've mentored in the lifestyle medicine community to let them know about these abnormalities observed over the last 30 40 years and people who eat so healthfully to let them know that they're not abnormal you know great thank you kathleen says for the g bombs do you have to have everything together at once or can some things be eaten with other things within the day for instance i have berries and flax and chia in my oatmeal cooked mushrooms with my morning steamed greens raw onions in my evening salad beans and soups a friend has everything all at once in a salad and do the greens have to be raw or is steamed okay of course they don't have to be all at once i'm saying g-bombs are foods that we should be eating regularly probably daily but not all the cells have to be able the same meal of course but um and yes we want people to eat the the onion family and the crus and the green cruciferous family some raw each day what i'm saying right now is that there are two raw foods and two cooked foods that maximally build the microbiome with that favorable biofilm covering the villi in the small intestines that makes for food which makes for toxins blocking the intake of toxins antigens proteins but also keeping the glycemic effect of fruits and other foods you eat lower because you have this favorable biofilm made up of a thickened variety of bacteria it's the huge different variety of 500 different species of bacteria that give us the healthy microbiome and we want variety in what we eat too the broader variety in your diet the broader variety of bacteria healthy bacteria you develop so the two raw foods are to help you build this microbiome are raw leafy green vegetables particularly raw cruciferous greens that you chew exceptionally well and the raw of the allium family mean meaning onion and scallions and the two cooked foods of course are mushrooms and you should be having more than one variety of mushrooms a day when you do have mushrooms shiitake and one other type of mushroom usually and of course cooked beans well-cooked beans especially azuki beans black beans and red beans in combination with the you know not that you can't have cooked greens and cooked onion but i want some of your onion and cruciferous green consumption to be consumed raw now i call it that anti-cancer salad because it includes obviously these on the scallion and the onion and the raw greens and we're chewing it exceptionally well with a dressing made with some nuts and seeds instead of oil because you absorb 20 to 50 times as much of the fat soluble phytochemicals and carotenoids because you did have some fat from nuts and seeds with that meal in the drink and it could be you could shoot a few walnuts with the meal but um and then the anti-cancer soup the reason i call it an anti-cancer soup is because when we put the onion and the green vegetables in the soup we don't we puree it while it's raw we puree first the greens in the blender then dump that into the soup to cook and then we puree the leeks and the scallion the onion and in the blender in its own blender and pour that into the soup to cook it's because the enzymes the myrosinase enzyme in green the cruciferous vegetables and the alienase enzyme in the onion family still stay activated when it's broken down while it's still raw to form the beneficial organosulfite and isothiocyanates all these beneficial anti-cancer compounds are now formed in the blender as you're breaking down the cells where they would normally be formed in the mouth as you chew very well but now we can pour them in the soup and the heating of the soup will not destroy them it's their formation that it would have impaired if we had heated them first before they were chewed or crushed so yes the reason why we're developing this this anti-cancer dietary portfolio with the way to cook and prepare the foods to maximize the anti-cancer potential and it includes a mixture of both raw food and cooked food sounds good yeah we have a lot of questions about beans and nuts actually but i wanted to ask you because i recently had doug evans on the show and i know you wrote the forward to his book can you eat the sprouted legumes and sprouted nuts instead of eating the nuts and the beans is that acceptable um it could be it could work for some people but when you sprout something you reduce this caloric density turn it into a vegetable from a bean or a nut so it's so it's good way to lose weight um but some people who are athletes and bigger people need the extra calories and obviously it's pot you know so um so it may reduce the calories to turn your um it may reduce the caloric density and and um and some people just need more calories you know what i mean but but it but it would be acceptable in your opinion for some people that have trouble with those foods to eat them that way they'd still nutritionally be okay yes except you know we it's we'd have to see yes i think yeah if you're eating everything sprouted what i'm saying right now is it's like eating a salad you know so um as long as they're not they're getting enough calories and getting enough you know they're everything looks good sure some people need more protein and more fat as they age and their ability to biologically assimilate these nutrients go down so if a person's getting frail not getting good athletic response getting muscle wasting then yeah you know so probably you better eat the sprouts and those sprouted substances need a small amount of the nuts and seeds of beans would be give you more biological diversity and nutritional diversity whenever you narrow the diet and remove a certain amount a certain type of food you usually have a higher probability of impairing a person's health so we really want to have the full biologic effect of all these foods present so in most cases i would say it's probably better to have some and it depends on how much they're sprouted too you know what i mean which nut you're talking about usually a nut that's partially sprouted is still a nut it's not much different from a nut whereas a bean that's sprouted like a mung bean it's still it's now it's a b now it's a vegetable more like a vegetable than a bean but most of those beans that are bigger beans have to be cooked even if they're slightly sprouted because they still have those agglutinins in them and they still have would have to be cooked to deactivate the gluten so so it's very very but we have to be more specific here you know so what kind of bean we're sprouting you know what i mean great thanks so much okay looking at bean though as you know increases its absorb by increases its ability to digest digestibility and deactivates the let the harmful lectins there's beneficial effects to cooking for certain foods like beans you know right uh richard hubbard is watching live he said to my friend dr fuhrman tell him i said hello well who was that richard hubbard oh yeah yeah he's a nice guy he lost tremendous amount of weight he's doing great yep i had him on the show he's wonderful so jana writes i'd like to know if you have a suggestion for raising blood pressure without the use of sodium i often end up in the er or icu with bradycardia dangerously low blood pressure and syncope the cardiologists all recommend liberal use of salt which has worked to keep me stable anytime i've actively worked to decrease my sodium intake i end up back in the er i do exercise every day and i've been completely whole food plant-based and so free for at least four years and other people watching live saying they have hyponitry natremia so is this no salt for everyone no there's some people who require some more sodium in their diet because they have a certain biological genetic or acquired inability of the kidney to hold on to sodium there's definitely some adjustments but they shouldn't follow the doctor and just put a lot of salt in their diet they have to treat this very scientifically like a scientist and actually measure the amount of sodium they require so they get the perfect level it's it's also what's letting your sodium deviate your high to low and medium to moderate to that gets that's not good for their health in other words most of us the lower the sodium the better the natural diet gives about 500 milligrams to 700 milligrams a day of sodium which is perfect because our sweat stops throwing out sodium and our urine stops putting out a lot of sodium so we hold on to sodium well that way we're in an athletic event going for a run or a tennis match or something very aggressively sweating we're not going to lose sodium and we're not going to be playing basketball and getting cramps in our legs because we're losing electrolytes because when you push out and urinate out and sweat out extra sodium you pull out potassium magnesium and other electrolytes and other minerals with the excess sodium excreting so it's better for you to be in a low sodium diet everybody holding on to all those minerals and you don't need and you don't need water not gatorade or something you don't you know you don't need to take salt because you exercise but there are some individuals who do not have their kidneys is a impaired ability to reclaim and hold on to sodium so they require a little more on their diet and for those unusual people maybe one in a hundred people then they should experiment when it's usually reasonable to give them 250 milligrams of sodium with the extra with each meal so that means in addition to the 750 they're getting with their diet from natural foods they're getting an additional 250 with each meal they're doubling the sodium moving from about 750 milligrams to 1500 milligrams of sodium it's very rare a person would require not good for them to move up to 2000 or 3000 so the doctors so if the person did require using a lot of sodium because the average american might be consuming 3000 milligrams of sodium it's still considered a low sodium diet on 1500 you follow me by some people's criteria but that 1500 of a low sodium diet still has 250 milligrams of extra added sodium per meal which is more than the average american is consuming but this person required that now if they so that number should be titrated so these people are using the least amount possible to maintain normalcy of their blood pressure and of their sodium levels in their blood so they're non-symptomatic because excess sodium causes microvascular hemorrhaging hemorrhages it's a pro-inflammatory substance for the endothelial lining of blood vessels and over years and years it weakens the lining of the blood vessels making them more prone to rupture increasing a person's risk of hemorrhagic stroke so we don't want people to consume more sodium than they require because it has its deleterious effects over time great thank you uh bronwyn says i'm wondering what your take is on collagen i'm in the midwest and it's extremely popular right now for healthy skin hair nails and weight loss our plant-based dermatologist said absolutely not what do you think about college and dr furman i think most of the studies on it haven't shown any significant effects so we have to look at whatever data we have available in the scientific studies and i think most of the collagen that you consume orally as a supplement gets broken down into its basic amino acids and a little bit that's absorbed as collagen doesn't have the ability to go into your skin into your joints and have um and have those kind of positive claims if it did we need some the more radical or how she'd say the more unbelievable the claim the more you require more substantive research and data to be able to hold that claim with some degree of authority you know so we need a lot of data to make that statement to make that statement as being strong so i i don't think that data is there um so it's not something i generally recommend well i've never taken i've got healthy nail skin and was able to have weight loss so i don't know why don't they just do your diet instead well every person is different you know you know person could be a mediator and say look at me i've got healthy nails my weight's down and they're one person in their in their certain age you know but obviously the ultimate um what you could say determinant of whether what's right is following groups of people for decades until their death and seeing how long they live and what they die of and then we can give them better advice you know what i mean yep let's see uh trish says could you please ask dr furman to discuss the vibrational piece of exercise equipment the power plate he uses in his practice i'd like to know how he uses it himself where he gets his routine and if he can share where one could watch and follow a class that's a great idea because i i was just thinking i should make a power play class because it's a vibrational platform the power plate is a little better than other vibrational technology because it moves in three dimensions forward back left and right up and down it's a little more expensive you know usually and it helps you when you exercise on it it helps you get faster results from the exercise and it makes you more tired and burns a little more calories and a lot of the profession almost all the professional sports teams football players basketball players use this kind of technology i use it because it helps me with skiing and it helps with injury prevention too so i might be doing a vibrational um i crossed my arms and it's a vibrational pulley which i'm pulling up and exercising while it's vibrating makes it harder to exercise while the pulls vibe and the platform is vibrating so when i'm up there doing what i'm doing on one leg i'm going down and up on one leg from side to side and then with the other leg i'm standing on the leg from side to side i'm putting my feet together and i'm pulling against the straps i'm lifting against a stationary motion or i'm doing touching one toe and coming up and touching the other toe and coming up on the power plate while it's vibrating and i'm doing these exercises it gets you more response in regard to building bone mass and the reason i've done it used in my office and i use this equipment in my offices because i treat people without medications who have severe osteoporosis so i'm my style of my practice is getting people well without having to use drugs right so a person comes in they're told by their doctor they need to take bisphosphonates or you know some toxic drug and i say no we can get you well we're going to give you a customized exercise program that's not going to compress your bones and your spine we're going to be gentle but over time we'll put more force on it and we'll use vibrational technology we'll measure the amount of strength you have and we'll see you improve your strength and your bone mass and i've got some great results well for example you know have people making radical improvement in their bone mass on their dexa scans using both about you know using these type of technology so i have it at the retreat and by having it for my patients i've been using it for myself and seeing that it gets my legs in better shape for sports you know it's just i know the professional athletes are using it so yeah the power play on we have some um i've put some up of the different types of power plates on drfurman.com with an explanation of different types because they're because some are more expensive than others some are more affordable and so like i use the professional one because it's here at the retreat but people can buy a home version that's much less expensive in other words yeah that'd be fun to see you do uh videos with it i should probably do you know do like the top 10 exercises that i do on the power play so people could watch them they come with a whole slew of exercises but i have my own that i think are better that i use for really i'm building on them and also we do like i just did yesterday i did push-ups on the power plate i did i did my leg raises for my stomach on the power plate so my body was vibrating it made it a lot harder it makes the exercise more difficult you know to doing on a vibrational platform and you just get better at better um you know get tired out faster and get better outcomes and they say you don't do more than twice a week have enough time to recover in between these strong efforts it's a lot of effort to work out on the power plate yeah that sounds like a lot of fun people are asking where your retreat is it's in san diego right yeah it's in northern san diego northern san diego county near the la luceri creek nakes of nature preserve we have a thousand acres of um of nature water and 100 miles of hiking trails with streams and lakes and little waterfalls it's just such a beautiful area part of san diego we can drive anywhere to the beach within 20 minutes but we're um but we're out in the middle of the country and almost like you're looking around and you hardly see any living creatures around you it's almost it's really in a beautiful um open area with great views dina wants to know if you miss new jersey uh not at all i'm like i'm living the i'm so happy to be living to here in san diego because it's just so beautiful here and the the um recreational opportunities i can go to the dog beach i could run on the beach and the sand dunes i can go climb in the mountains i could go surfing i could play tennis i could drive and go skiing i could go you can go to go to a river or go to a lake and go you know in other words there's so much opportunity to have to do things that are fun and always have nice weather you know and always have this temperate climate where it's always beautiful and sunny and to do things outdoors and swimming of course you know and so it's um anyway we have a big saltwater pool and we also have a sand volleyball court now we don't just play sand volleyball we use the sand to exercise on the sand to like move side to side motions and to have the have the bare feet in contact with the earth doing certain exorcisms in the sand so yeah i know what so it's a new um a new part of my life you know where i'm not writing books anymore and i'm you know caring for the people that are here and i have a little more free time because i'm not busy being an author in writing all the time so i can slow down my workload and have more time for recreational and fitness too what took you so long to get to california faith wants to know how you feel about green tea decaffeinated green tea and alcohol yes yes and no okay so the tea whether it's a green tea is good whether it's decaffeinated or not but alcohols no okay good alcohol is carcinogenic and a little bit of carcinogenic isn't so bad but it's still carcinogenic you know and it's it's still a dangerous substance the only thing that we have to talk about tea for a minute the green tea is good for you the green tea extracts are in the green tea or have anti-cancer effects but if you drink things that are so hot it has cancer promotion effects what i'm saying is let the tea cool down so it's warm if you're chronically burning your mouth with soups that are too hot or teas that are too hot which people do you're increasing your risk of tongue cancer and throat cancer from the chronic exposure to steaming hot substances so the tea is good for you but don't make the tea that hot let it cool off or put an ice cube in it so you're not burning yourself when you drink little tiny burns when you're drinking it right but are there some people that just for the caffeine it's it's really a no something with how they metabolize them there's some people that just really shouldn't have caffeine in any form yeah i'm sure that's true but you know but you but obviously green tea even the ones that have caffeinated have less much less caffeine than coffee and their one green tea a day is not is going to be as addictive and and the reason why i'm an anti-caffeine person don't allow people or don't want people drinking coffee and too much caffeine is because they feel withdrawal from their caffeine they don't sleep as deeply it enables them not to be in touch with the amount of sleep they need it acts as a stimulant but also they start to feel a little buzz when they're withdrawing from the caffeine which is relieved by eating food so they've lost their connectivity to feeling hunger and feeling so they think that the caffeine withdrawal because it's taken away by eating it makes them want to eat more and more frequently so i i'm really not a person a person that discourages the caffeine consumption but of course with green tea one green tea with some caffeine in a small amount a day usually is not harmful and of course we want their um we want to encourage people to continue their green tea why are you so adamant about people overeating even if it's healthy food of a low caloric density like like vegetables or salads you just why do you think it's just never good to overeat i mean if you're in a normal body weight right because people are chronically um how you could say they're they're not just addicted they've been chronically patterned to eat so many calories they don't need so the average person because of their upbringing because the way other americans eat are eating almost double the amount of calories they require through life i always say we live on half of what we eat and on the other half lives our physicians did you get that i get it okay so what i'm saying right now is most people are so used to eating so many needless calories they didn't need to have that when they go to a healthy diet they still try to connect and get it to their stuffed and and they eat too much food trying to duplicate the amount of calories they were eating on their unhealthy diet and they don't realize when you're eating this healthily need less calories you don't need that many calories unless you're getting too thin of course and to explain and also we know that when we sleep on an empty stomach and we're healing and detoxifying and repairing more in the non-digestive state and we eat it to dinner to our full once we eat too much food it takes longer to digest it and then you're digesting food half the night while you're sleeping in bed at night i don't mind if they overeat at lunch a little bit but i want them not to eat so they feel stuff because you're decreasing your digestive capacity and your digestive efficiency when you put so much food in your stomach at one time um so yeah i've seen people overeat on healthy food and it's not great for their health which which let's springs into this thing about metabolism let's because it talks about how much you eat about metabolism let's say for argument's sake for simplicity that my caloric needs for the day to maintain my lean body mass a good amount of calories for me is about 1500 calories a day just because it's a nice round number i don't know if it's 1400 or 600 let's just say 1500. if i consumed an extra piece of ezekiel bagel or something an extra 200 calories a day let's say over that 1500 now what would happen to those 200 calories every single day would i gain 20 pounds after a year because it is 3500 calories excess per pound so with 350 days in a year each hundred calories over basal metabolic rate would put on 10 pounds per year so i ate 200 calories extra a day after a year i'd be 10 pounds heavy if they're here to be 20 pounds heavier right no wrong you wouldn't be 20 pounds heavier because as you overshoot your basal metabolic needs your body compensates to try to utilize the extra calories and what it does to you without putting weight on you so it's your body speeds up its metabolic metabolism it raises its metabolic rate to burn the extra calories so after 200 calories extra for a year i'll only have gained 10 pounds not 20 pounds because my body will speed up its respiratory quotient the amount of calories burned through breathing it'll increase its thyroid function it'll raise its body temperature it'll set into motion of a series of biological events to try to get rid of some of those calories and in doing so the increased metabolism as a result of the extra calories is burning your stem cells and you shorten your telomeres and increasing the biological parameters of aging you're aging faster so you made a deal with the devil here i'm not going to gain as much weight from the excess calories i'm consuming but i'll take away some years of life at the end by you by aging myself faster to increase my metabolic burn and run my body temperature higher okay so now here i am at 1500 calories a day and instead i undershoot my calories by 100 calories or so each day and i go to bed if some nights i even feel as i'm going to bed as i finish dinner at five or six o'clock some nights at 10 o'clock as i turn the light off i feel oh i'm a little hungry right now but i don't go to i don't go up and eat i just go to bed i just take a little sip of water and go to bed the hunger is my when your hunger is mild it's not strong so i'm trying to err on the side of slightly under eating not slightly overeating i'm trying to win as a question of not having enough at dinner well stop eating that if you think you're not hungry anymore you know you can always eat breakfast the next day you're not going to starve the food's right there you'll eat an earlier breakfast then if you need to i think people are just sorry to be hungry they're afraid to be hungry they're afraid to now i undershot my calories and let's say under shot by 100 calories a day so that means after a year instead of 150 pounds i'm 140 pounds right the answer is no not right i'm not going to lose the 10 pounds because i'm already exercising a lot so my body gets the signal from exercise that it has that it desires to retain this muscle mass and this amount of strength so my body wants to have as much as getting signals from my use of my body that tells it to maintain this guy's degree of strength and muscle mass and resist losing weight because it utilizes those muscles regularly and my body then will slow down the metabolic rate in the attempt not to lose weight with fewer calories i always say moderate caloric restriction not excessive caloric restriction people can moderate can caloric restrict and become too thin and that's not healthy for you either you want to maintain good muscle mass and strength and size but i can moderately caloric restrict and still maintain that muscle weight in size the the less you eat the longer you're going to live assuming you're not too thin so what i'm saying right now is how much should you eat you should as little as you possibly can as long as you're not becoming too thin now getting back to me again who now i understand my calories by about 100 calories a day i'm still keeping my weight at 150 pounds though or 146 between 146 and 150 not dropping below 146 for the year but my body will get colder it'll slow down the metabolism it'll lower my thyroid function a touch it'll reduce my body temperature it'll slow my respiratory quotient my body will conserve those forces of life it'll keep that battery not being used my the battery in the flashlight is the flashlight's turned off my body's running cooler making the age slower so we have the we have the control of our metabolic rate you can't increase your metabolism and burn hotter without gaining weight you're burning gaining weight slower but you it's impossible to raise your metabolism to induce weight loss the metabolism is raised because of excess calories and you're still going to be gaining weight from the excess calories just not as fast as if your metabolism wasn't raised so eating excess food raises your burn your calorie burn and makes you gain weight slower but you're not going to lose weight the the most proven methodology to slow aging is to have adequate and micronutrient exposure with a full variety of nutrients humans need while at the same time making sure your body fat is low and you're not excessively consuming calories that's the whole picture there people are just doing part of the picture they don't like this part of the picture that means they shouldn't overeat and chronically use recreating food between meals and constantly eating all day long even if they're not overweight there are people that are not overweight that are still chronically overeating and they still could be at almost the same weight and still cut back their calories and run at that same weight and be a lot healthier if they eat less calories wow thank you dr fuhrman there's a question from nicole who's a health coach it's kind of long so i'm going to summarize it but what a lot of things we talk about is is how environment predicts your success that i always say if it's in your house it's in your mouth and her question is basically why do you think that so many people put up with unsupportive spouses and children because what i hear a lot is well i i want to eat this way but i can't because you know i have to cook you know this kind of food my husband and children won't eat this way so what i guess the question is is why doesn't the family support them but then even the bigger question is why does the wife put up with it um well i think that here's the thing if i was a person in a household where i was eating healthfully and learning all this information i'm excited about what i'm learning and i think that the food i'm eating is beautiful aesthetically beautiful it tastes good but i'm understanding the magical the magic of natural foods the magical substances it contains to do such good to the body now i'm not necessarily going to control another person but if we have a relationship of love and respect then those other individuals can respect me and share in my enthusiasm and even learn what i'm learning so they can support me in my endeavor that's the starting point of is getting so when you go from a house where one person learns about this information and gets excited about it the only opportunity this person has to do to change the people around them is not to go home and say you know eat this way i'm gonna divorce you or you know or start fights about this and try to push it on people the place to start is two is three two or three things number one is i'd really love you to understand me and care for me and support me in what i decide is best for me if i if i wanted to go to medical school this person to become a lawyer or be whatever they pursue some some career or hobby they get support from their family or be an artist they'd get support from their family encouragement because they want that person to be happy and feel fulfilled in life and this is something where we need the support of the people that live with us to make us feel respected known and and considered and to share in what we're learning and be feel and we want our people that love us to feel proud of us for what we're doing whether they can do it or not that's the first step then the next step is people recognizing that this is not may not be an all or nothing thing but the person in the family but we're this person preparing healthy food for themselves a lot of them taste good we're certainly going to these people going to improve what they're eating it may take them some time to achieve that but then there's the feeling of love from this person who's who's who wants to change and that feeling of love is that to the person who's not changing was well how would you feel if you loved a person you loved a person as much as i love you i love you so much and what i've learned is so beneficial to people that i want you to learn this and try to at least move towards it because it would be so much better for your life your happiness your brain function your health we can live in the future and have a happier life together be more physically active so you know i've dealt with this for the last 20 years when people have come to our getaways and when and one of the spouses is into it and the other spouse is not at the end of the week when they've heard all the lectures and tasted all the food and the majority of those people changed over and really are doing it with their other spouse so a lot of it just has to do with with the relationship has to be built with a lot of care on both sides and strengthened use this to strengthen your relationship to strengthen your love and care for each other and making healthy foods in the family we want our children to eat healthy because we want them to be healthy adults right this shouldn't be a source of contention because there's too much knowledge science experience and even knowledge and experience in making food healthy food tastes great most people just eat the simplest diet that has no flavor and no you know i'm teaching people obviously to feel that's not what they're giving up it's what they're gaining and what they're gaining is more enjoyment of what they're eating a complete you know more pleasure both with taste pleasure but also the intellectual and emotional pleasure of feeling you're doing the right thing for yourself and that has tremendous ability to make you enjoy eating more so i think with the right ability to teach and share with your family you should be able to slowly get the support more and more of the people around you if it's done with kindness and love and with your how should i say walking the walk not just talking the talk if you are just talking and you're not doing it yourself and you can't expect the other person to change you've got to be a perfect role model and achieve and feel better and be better and look better and be healthier for it then other people are going to you kind of emulate you and learn and want to learn from you so i think i'm i'm not just blaming the person who isn't changing i'm doing some blame here on perhaps the person that is doing the changing maybe they're not doing this properly in the way they're sharing demonstrating and loving the people they're living with but sometimes it's still really hard for them especially if they're food addicts to be living their in the house with everybody else eating crap when they're trying to eat healthy they they have to do they have to go one and one thing at a time and do all these things we talked about as well as in the process having their own refrigerator their own storage unit maybe their refrigerator is the garage refrigerator the one in the kitchen is not the one they touch there's all that we've got to um structure it and we want the ability the support of their people their loved ones to help them stay on track even if they're not doing it their loved ones when i you know where for example we want a person not to smoke cigarettes we don't want them to go home and have people smoking cigarettes around them but if they have a smoker in the house that smoker can't smoke in the house he has to smoke out of the house if this person wants to eat bacon cheeseburgers that has to be out of the house and not in the front of the face of the person who has that you know bad fat you know bad relationship with food but yes all these things can be cultivated and proved and moved in the right direction it's never the case almost never the case that it's hopeless it's just they need the right coaching and right advice yeah i agree thank you so much well i saved this for the end because it's controversial but as you know just like with all of our guests especially when they're doctors people want to know how you feel about the covet vaccine and if you personally are going to take it well keep in mind that i just want to say that i'm a i spend untold amount of hours researching the scientific literature on nutrition and health and longevity and i even have scientists that work for me dr ferrari phd as you know on my staff who who um who's always researching and reviewing articles so so we are stay up to date on nutritional research i'm not an immunologist i don't stay i'm saying that because i don't stay up to date and knowledgeable about all things regard to vaccines it's not my field of specialty and and the toxicity of vaccines and the possible side effects of vaccines and whether they work or not and whether this vaccine is going to do some more variants and make it worse for people in the future it's going to so these are unknown um i should say unknown guesses people have some people saying well these vaccines are going to in the throes of the pandemic are going to make for more variant changes in the virus and make more people die and have third and fourth and fifth waves that are even worse and some people are saying well the the rna vaccines are going to be bad for people's health long term so the answer the question is i don't know i really can't answer that question um my gut feeling not based on science just based on feeling is that i that they made most likely the case that the variance is going to continue in a year or two from now people are going to need more vaccines and so i'd rather take less vaccines right now and maybe if i was going to take a vaccine take the j and j vaccine it's just one vaccine rather than take two rna which is a newer technology vaccine because it may be the case that you know a year from now or two years from now you need an extra vaccine if there's new if a new variant of kovid starts to kill so many people again so the answer to the question is that i'm not professing to be an expert in this field um and i have and i probably when the when the vaccines become available for healthy people um right now i think it's 65 and older um i am 67 of course um i probably could get the vaccine shortly it's just been made available in california for people 65 and older and i probably will get the j j vaccine just because i want to just because i'm thinking that i'm not worried about cohen myself i've never been even missed a day at work in 50 years you know i mean i don't i don't even get sick from anything but um but not to put uh i just want to have give people more confidence around me and people that i care for that i'm not going to be putting them at risk so i think i probably will get um i haven't got get the i'm thinking the j and j vaccine it's more standard technology it's one shot you know and also it doesn't require so much care in in freezing it or um so if something does something wrong in the preparation or storage of it it's not like it to go bad or something they're probably going to get probably would get that shot but but certainly i'm respecting people with different opinions and different because nobody knows and it's a lot of there's a lot of unknown here sorry about the people working in there that's okay well i'm going to let you go because i know you have to be somewhere but just one last question you i know you're going to live a long time with your healthy lifestyle but what do you most want to be remembered for well you know it's it's what i enjoy doing the most and that is um i've impacted so many individuals and given them a better life and they know i've cared for them with a lot of kindness and love and knowledge and i've gotten a lot of people to transform their health and i have so i have so many thousands of people that appreciate my work and what i've done for them over the years and i mean if i um and i don't need to accomplish anything more in my life you know i still want to i still get pleasure from doing what i do um but i'm not um under some pressure to um do anything i feel satisfied with the amount of people i've touched and what i've accomplished in life and i think that i'm proud i'm proud of that and i think that people who have changed their diet and gotten and learned about health and nutrition they've also gotten themselves in better health like you who then reach out and help other people they get that same feeling of superpowers of doing good for humanity and being kind to people so i think it's the it's the people i've touched and known that they know i care about them and do everything in my power to help them get better thank you because it's incredible how many people even yesterday on the show that i interviewed that their point of entry was either one of your pbs specials or your bookie to live well thank you and my and to put a plug for my latest book i'm obviously eat for life because i want people to have the more modern updated research and because they still think of me as meeting each to live which is great which is they should read it but of course it's better when people read more things that are updated more updated research and more scientific support as the research has accumulated over the last decade making this way of eating overwhelmingly supported by the scientific literature well thank you so much for the work you do and we'll see if we can keep you in the number one spot and you can come back anytime sounds great thanks everybody nice to meet you take care and thanks all of you for watching another episode of chef aj live please come back tomorrow and my guests are dr doug lyle and dr alan goldhamer bye", "zLGUclL3IqU": "all right welcome back everybody and we are going to do a tomato review on this tomato here and this is called the chimoluski's wild tomato and so we finally made it here it took me a couple of years to actually get to the point where the plant was able to grow and produce fruit i had a hard time in the beginning getting it growing but we got it and now it's producing fruit so as you can see either earlier in this video or it'll be a separate video where i shot on the plant and show you the plant and some of the fruit and everything on it like that as you can see in that video uh you could you could see what kind of a plant it is and it's obviously a wild tomato variety so it's gonna have a lot of wild features to it some of the things i will point out let me back out a little bit some of the things i will point out about this variety is number one the plant is extremely fragile so the slightest movement to the plant the plant will just snap in your hands it'll break as if it was made of thin glass so it's very very very fragile this plant does not like to be touched or handled in any way and if you do handle it it's a 90 chance you're going to break it right where you handle it it's very fragile these tomatoes that you're looking at here i didn't actually pick off the plant i waited till they fell from the plant so these aren't fresh tomatoes picked from the plant they literally fell off the plant that was what was suggested to me to basically just wait until they drop that's how you know when they're ripe because there's really no way to know when these tomatoes are ripe or not so when they fall from the plant that pretty much means that they're about as ripe as they're gonna get and that's what i'm hoping for here uh keep in mind these are a wild tomato so there are going to it is going to have undertones to it that are going to be very strong if not stronger than the tomato flavor itself and it's really going to offset how i review this so i might not be able to review it quite the conventional way but i will break out the cheat sheet and we can still look at the numbers and kind of compare that to everything else there's no i can't follow every detail at least i don't think i can but when it comes to the flavor of these wild tomatoes they're really bizarre and the undertones are stronger than the tomato flavor there's no other way to actually describe it now this this particular tomato variety i also want to mention uh the the foliage the plant itself has a very citrusy smell it's very very fragrant so if you even rub against that you're going to smell a whole area light up with like a citronella type of citrusy smell it's very pleasant actually the smell is very very aromatic it's a very pleasant type of an odor it's not disgusting in any way however the taste of the tomato doesn't taste anything like the smell i'm pretty confident i tasted one that already fell but i just took like a lick off it because it's it split and it fell so i just took a lick off it just to see i didn't actually eat it but i could tell you right now that it doesn't taste anything like the smell the smell is very aromatic it's very uh fluorescent in in uh in its in its odor it's very pleasant odor it's not unpleasant in any way so let's uh well i i can't even weigh this because this isn't even going to show up on my scale because these are probably less than a tenth of an ounce so it's probably not even going to show up they're very small very light let's show you what the tomatoes look like in general this is one that's probably three quarters of the way right or 70 or 90 right i don't believe this one's fully ripe when they get fully fully fully ripened they get like a palest color to them and sometimes if you look sometimes you'll see a little stripe form on the bottom and oftentimes if they're in fully exposed sun the calyxes will start to get purple a little bit and a little bit of purpling around the top of the tomato so but these were grown in my greenhouse so they weren't exposed to sun quite the same way you could see that the the little paddles coming off the calyx are very long all right so they're very long variety you could tell they're kind of ripe because when you squeeze them they're kind of like you can pop them so you can kind of tell that they got some ripeness to them but again they're like most of the other wild varieties that i grow and uh they're going to be um very challenging to to really work around some of the details on this may have things associated with me reviewing it that's different than even regular tomatoes so we'll see when we get to that point here let me show you the inside it's very hard to handle this stuff with one hand okay that's what it looks like on the inside not sure if i move things around it almost looks like a center of a kiwi isn't that strange almost looks like a kiwi very very small seeds and i'm not gonna weigh it so let's go right over to the bricks let's do a bricks on this and see if what it says on the brakes i'm not expecting it to be too high but um i don't know we nobody's ever done the bricks on this selenium chimalewski at least as far as i know the seeds are coming right out very messy just took a lick i cheated there's no bricks number no bricks number there's not enough juice coming out of it making a mess here trying to get this bricks there's almost no juice in it it's very hard to get any kind of a reading off of this okay we got a bricks it's barely reading because the juice is so light but i can read the number i think a little bit okay it's about a ten and a half on the bricks ten and a half guys this is going to be strange i i can tell you right now it's i don't think it's sweet i don't know maybe maybe they'll be sweeter i don't know but um all right let's uh give a piece of this a go and see what it tastes like i know a lot of my fans are tomato lovers so this ought to be interesting wow it is sweet i have to spit the skins out man this is the skins on these things are tough it's all seeds on the inside by the way it's just like a berry this is like trying to eat a berry really it's got a really strange flavor guys gonna have to uh i gotta do another one here just the flavor is just really bizarre skins are tough wow that's weird the flavor is definitely awkward all right let's uh let's do it with studio break out the cheat sheet and see if we can see what we could gather off of this it's going to be a little on the hard side to actually use this sheet because i it's a lot of it i don't think it's going to be too applicable all right let's break out the cheat sheet and uh let's see what we can come up with as far as numbers go this is weird guys i don't even know how to actually rate this thing but anyway let's start off with the sweetness the funny thing about the sweetness on this tomato is it seemed like it had like a sweetness in the beginning when you first eat it and then it gets overwhelmed by this flavor this very strange and odd flavor that i can have to describe to you somehow but if i was to put a number on the sweetness it was kind of high and then dissipated really quickly so i'm not sure how to rate that but if i was to put it on the number one if when you first get that sweetness on there i would probably put that original sweetness punch at probably like a 38 in the beginning and then it tapers off really quick and the flavor becomes overwhelming so you lose that sweetness right away but it is kind of sweet in the beginning and it disappears is this tomato is very much like eating a berry it's not like exactly eating a tomato i don't know any other way to put it it's really like eating a berry and not a tomato go over to the tangy part now the tangy part was funny the center part of the tomato didn't have much of a tanginess in it however the skin part did have some type of a tanginess the center part the little bit of gel that i was able to get off of it uh that that part right there was really where all these undertones and everything really lied it wasn't so much the flesh there was no real flesh on it it was just skin and seeds and basically that's it there was a little bit of juice and stuff in between and that's really it there's no there's nothing else says tomato is nothing but skin and seeds instead of skin and bones it's skin and seeds in this case so the tanginess i'm probably going to put the tanginess that probably outside the skin because again i started chewing the skin and the skin had like a tangy tartiness to it but the inside part of the seed area uh it did have a tanginess but not very strong it was like uh i'd say probably between 18 and 20 on the tangy for this tomato ranging from zero to fifty so it was kind of on the low side the tomato flavor now we're talking about the strength of the flavor and i'm not sure how to rate this i was already thinking about this as i was tasting it i'm not sure if the undertones is the flavor the flavor is the under i don't know but as far as the tomato flavor or undertones if you will the prominence what how strong and and uh evident was that flavor in the profile and that's what i'm trying to get across here the that flavor was extremely intense i'm going to put that at about a nine and a half it it is so this tomato is flavor of it is so intense and concentrated that when you cut it open the air starts to stink around it has like a smell to it and that smell is in the flavor itself so it's very aromatic even when you're cutting the tomato in fact i'm smelling my fingers and my fingers have the smell of that on there so it has a very weird kind of a i don't know tomato taste or flavor undertones that part of it the strength of it was extremely overwhelming it's a 9.5 that's probably the highest rating you're ever going to see on that but that was literally all tomato uh flavor the whole thing the whole experience was basically that undertone stink i call it a stink because my hands stink from it now so it has like a stinky stinkiness to it but uh yeah extremely high on the tomato flavor now the moisture was off the scale too because these things were nothing but liquid so i mean as soon as you cut it in half put it in your mouth it turns instantly into liquid skin and seeds that's what it is liquid skin and seeds that's all it was so if i was putting on a moisture scale i'm going to put that also at a nine and a half because it's ridiculously moist and wet it just put it in your mouth it turns right to flavor and liquid so there's no substance to it the only thing you had between that part of it the moisture and the um uh and everything else was the skin and the seeds which didn't break down but everything else on the inside was basically liquid so it was off the chart on the uh on the moisture tartiness and sourness there was something that these again that now the skins were very tardy there was something going on with those skins it was very very tardy uh if i was to just put a number on on the tardiness of the skin probably go with about a two and a half maybe even a three on the tardiness on the skin as an overall tardiness i would probably say maybe a one one and a half if you get my drift i'm just trying to give you an idea on how i'm trying to figure that out i mean the tardiness was just uh it was just in the skin once you started chewing up the skin then it started coming out so it was a real tardy soury type of effect that i was getting on the back of my jaw when i chewed those skins up now the undertones was absolutely off the chart and i don't know if the undertones was the actual flavor itself or the undertones i don't know what it was but the undertones was about again 9.5 i don't even know if i can hit it at 10 i mean it was completely off the chart was undertones as far as i'm concerned that was the tomato flavor was the undertones so i that's why i said this tomato is going to be hard for me to review because i don't know how to place it on any of these numbers it's not really fitting this chart it's like trying to review an orange under using my tomato flavor chart to review an orange it's a totally different thing it won't apply to an orange this chart is designed specifically for raiding tomatoes and not oranges or apples right so this is kind of like that what we're talking about here this tomato is more like a berry and not a tomato and i'm trying to rate it as a tomato and it's just not working out so as far as the undertones go it was a nine and a half it was very strong doesn't mean that it was bad but i'm going to tell you right now the flavor was definitely weird i'm going to talk about that right now for a moment as far as what did it actually taste like as far as as as far as like what did it actually taste like guys it had a really strange flavor almost tasted like seafood a little bit uh the after undertones or aftertaste or whatever but then it also had like a earthy skunky tone to it like a very strange wild earthy skunky tone there's no other way i could describe it very weird type of a flavor it's not the kind of a thing you're going to want to go out of your way and pick and eat this tomato anybody who grows this tomato is simply growing it because of the sheer fascination love for wild tomatoes not not because you're going to sit there and eat these all day this is not the kind this this isn't the kind of tomato you're going to want to eat all day it can't be eaten but it has a weird very weird type of flavor and and uh that's everything about it's really strange again it's more like a berry than it is a tomato all right so that's basically it with the undertones it's off the chart with the undertones the texture there was no texture it was just skin so i can't really rate this by texture i mean the whole inside was just basically liquid uh it was basically seeds stuck together by liquid a slimy liquid and then the skin that's all it was so there was no texture i can't rate the texture very high at all and i don't even know if it would be fair to rate the texture because there was no texture but if i was to put a number on it i'll say two on the texture because there may be been a little bit of mushiness by the texture but it's really low on the texture because again it was more liquid than anything and the skin was a problem because the skin you absolutely had to spit out you couldn't even chew that skin up it was so strong and hard you just chewed whatever juices you can get out of it whatever flavors you could get out of it and then you had to spit the skin out didn't even break i couldn't even break the skin up in my mouth with my teeth so it was a pretty hard skin so again we'll be rating skins differently if i was to rate the skin separately from zero to five five beating five being super tough on the skin this would have been a five this would have been uh at the top of the chart for for uh skin skins would have been at the top but um we're not really rating it that way but the skins were tough and if you were to eat this tomato i i would just say pop it in your mouth and then pop the juice out of the skin while it's in your mouth and spit the skin out that's really the only way now as far as production goes this tomato is actually quite a good producer it produced quite a bit of those tomatoes though in the beginning when i first started growing it didn't want to produce anything but now that it's grown and it reached about five or six feet tall it's spread out about five or six feet wide and it really spread itself out of this tomato produced dozens upon dozens of pounds so the production of those tomatoes is basically off the chart uh well i mean not off the chart but i'm going to put the production of it probably at about seven and a half and eight we're going to production because it did really good but it didn't do as good as say my wild hairy tomato which was would have been my wild hairy tomato as far as production would have been a nine and a half ten that's how productive that plant made so many tomatoes i couldn't even pick them all up it was they're everywhere they were virtually everywhere more ten times more to my pimps my you know everglade tomatoes or any of my pimped tomatoes the wild hairy tomato outperformed all of that by a mile because of the amount of tomato and that was one plant so this one did pretty good if i was to just average it out against that and maybe some other pimps i'd say it's probably about a seven on that scale it was a really good producer i got quite a few tomatoes still on the plant just wait until the plant dies and you know then we'll uh we'll get the rest of the tomatoes off now how would i rate this tomato and back you out a little bit so how would i rate this tomato from a one to a ten with one being the highest and what i'm saying hi when i refer to like rating the tomato it's like a tomato i can't wait to get out into my garden and either eat raw or pick them so i can make tomato sauce or a salad or something how would i generally rate that tomato like what is it one of my is it my go-to tomato my number one go-to tomato that's what what i'm that's what my rating is supposed to represent how would i rate this well i mean as a tomato collector i rate it very high because a very rare variety and i would rate this as a 10 or a number one for like rarity of the tomato or any of that if i was to rate it based on just like the flavor of it i would rate it at 10 because it's not something i would really want to eat again to be honest with you it didn't taste very good but because i like growing wild varieties of tomatoes this is going to be a very high it's going to be up there at about a one you know before wild tomatoes it's going to be up there with my favorites and my wild tomatoes are a fun tomato to grow but as far as eating i i can't i couldn't even recommend it for eating get off of there get so that's how i would rate that tomato um but again this is a collector's variety tomato you have to really be a tomato collector or somebody who's really interested in growing wild tomatoes for this to grow this variety it's not really something you're going to want to grow for food or production you'd probably want to grow this maybe because you want some of the genetics into your regular varieties or something to that effect but if you're looking to um you know grow for food and production that's ridiculous you can do regular tomatoes pimps you do everglade tomatoes you could do the uh pink forbidden tomato you could do a lot of these wild tomatoes and and do much better this this isn't that type of tomato it's a collector's variety this is a variety for people who are dedicated tomato growers this isn't your everyday type of tomato so that for me to rate this i i can't really even give it an honest rating but like i said for a collective variety i'd rate it number one it's best variety i i i think to date even better than uh uh selenium peruvian and maybe even better than the um uh the hairy tomato because of the rarity of it and that smell of the plant is so unique it's very very interesting so i i give it a high rating among the wilds i can't really get rate you know based off of my other tomatoes because this isn't you're not really going to want to eat these guys i'm telling you this isn't the type of tomato that it is so anyway i don't know what else to say about it i will leave whatever information i do have on the uh chameleons wild tomato in the description below and i end on the website and i will also leave a link in the description below where you can go over to the website and actually buy the seeds for this variety and give it a grow yourself see how you do for it and you can you can experience that flavor for yourself and then watch this video again and see if what i'm saying is really off kilter see if what i'm saying is on par hopefully that it is with what you're growing but uh see if it's similar to what i'm saying all right so that's it that's your tomato review for these uh chimalewski's wild tomato don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you on the next one take [Music] care [Music] you", "NvQWxhVv8Dw": "nine years nine years I've been doing intermittent fasting and some keto and this and that but I've been around the block with it and in that time I've done a lot of research and I've established my own processes for fasting so today I want to share with you what I would say if I go back in time are my five favorite meals to break a fast with and I mean this from a scientific perspective I don't just mean it like these are tasty foods I'm gonna eat a Butterfinger bar no this is like what I would actually recommend you eat based on scientific literature but also based on what I've experienced now there's some very very important things to know about breaking a fast before we even begin breaking a fast is not about gorging yourself on a big meal breaking a fast is about being very strategic with at least one relatively small meal if you can be powerful and strong with this one strong meal it'll make it so that later on and you're eating window you can eat more and have more flexibility right when you break a fast your body is so sensitive you have to be very wary of what you put in your body at that point in time so you've gone 16 18 20 24 36 hours in your fasting window when you break that fast you need to be eating the right things okay so this breaks it down into something a little bit more practical I've done videos on what not to eat and stuff like that but I figured this is practical this is a little bit more fun to hey in case you haven't already please hit that red subscribe button you got new videos coming out almost every single day and then hit that little Bell icon so you can turn on notifications so you know whenever I go live alright one of the most important things you need to know is that you should never mix fats and carbs when you break your fast okay your body is highly insulin sensitive at that point in time when you eat carbohydrates you spike your insulin that means you put your body into absorptive mode if it wants to absorb those carbohydrates that's one thing but don't let it absorb the fats along with the carbohydrates because those fats are going to go right into storage now additionally we have this thing called a SP in the body a SP oscillations stimulating protein spikes the insulin from fat so when you eat fats you still get an insulin spike just a little bit less and indirectly so if you eat fats with carbs you have a double insulin spike so double problems plus cup that with the fact that you're at the end of a fast where anything you eat is going to have a huge impact it's like a triple whammy negative effect so the way that I've broken this video down is into ultimately three categories I have options for non keto intermittent fasting what you should break your fast with or my recommendations for breaking your fast if you are not on keto and then I have keto options and then I even threw a vegetarian or vegan option in there that will work for either party but it's just a matter of just giving you an option to because I have a good degree of followers that are vegan vegetarian all right so despite all the benefits of intermittent fasting we still have to understand that our gut is very sensitive at the end of a fast hour mucosal layer kind of wears down a little bit our guts been going through a lot of janitorial work cleaning and all this stuff so we want to make sure that what we eat is still easy to digest masticate ultimately absorb so although there could be some better options in terms of profiles of food I'm trying to get ones that are going to be easy to digest as well so let's dive right in to the first one which is a non keto option now I still think whether your keto or not you should hear me out on this because there's some good science with it this is gonna be organic rice cakes a couple of them along with some seaweed snacks and lean protein okay hear me out on the reasoning behind this okay we're talking a small meal remember this isn't like your dinner it's a small meal than an hour later in your dinner okay rice cakes are very high glycemic okay so what that means is you have rice that has had air injected into it which means the starch molecules that were like this bound together all the glucose molecules excuse me bound together in a starts chain just had air injected into them poof all the glucose molecules are no longer attached they're now separated as individual glucose molecules which means they absorb way faster I want an insulin spike right when you break your fast because if you're going to spike your insulin I want you to do it in a controlled fashion not with a bunch of fats and mix anything like that so rice cakes are super lean it just it ends your fasting period the stronger the controlled operative word controlled insulin spike the better the imports which which means it flips you out of fasting mode and into muscle building mode okay all these things that we want to pay attention to so we don't lose my so right again insulin is not a good thing we just want to control it with this I can't overemphasize that don't hate on me here in fact there was a study that was published in the journal nutrients that found that insulin causes that the post prandial insulin causes a big spike in mammalian target Efrat myosin fasting otto fuji mTOR the opposite of fasting it clicked it's the switch there's no gray area we're flipping the switch out of the fasting mode into the eating mode okay then the reason that I have seaweed in there is because you have a suppression of the thyroid a little bit during a fast your body needs iodine from seaweed in order to actually process inactive t4 into t3 well in these selenium but it also needs iodine to combine with tyre seen to make t1 t2 t3 t4 so we need the thyroid function we need your metabolism back which means I like having seen meat in there plus it just tastes really good on rice cakes then a lean protein why lean well remember we're spiking our insulin with the rice cake so the protein we better have better be really lean okay so I want lean chicken okay it's like not chicken thigh I don't care you know what the situation is lean lean lean lean steak preferably like a white fish or something like that that's really lean and we're talking a couple ounces okay I'm wasting a lot of time here let me go ahead and let's go on to the next one non keto option number two okay this is good if you're not on keto and you're breaking a fast I call it my fast break thought okay you're making Vietnamese pho but you're making it at a super abbreviated easy way get some gluten-free noodles usually they're rice noodles okay like the Asian rice noodles same kind of concept as what you would have with rice cakes high glycemic I'm not a big fan of grains and don't like don't put me in a corner based on other content that I've done that kind of poo-poos grains and stuff okay like I'm trying to help you here all right so you got rice noodles and then what you can do is take a little bit of shrimp okay just a couple ounces of shrimp a small amount and easy enough to break down piece now you can also use scallops okay but I like using a shellfish or something like that you don't have to do this you could use lean chicken but super high in iodine super high in selenium so we get the thyroid benefit from those fishes okay or I guess you can't really call them fat but whatever they are right you get that iodine and selenium benefit just tremendous for your thyroid then the rice noodle spikes your insulin then pick up some grass-fed bone broth right some grass-fed beef bone broth or you can use chicken if you want and use it as a stock as a broth then you get the mucosal healing effect coming off of your fast you at the rice noodle insulin spike and you get the tyrosine selenium effect and the protein from the shrimp or the scallops pretty awesome stuff okay so that's honestly one of my favorites super easy if you're not on keto now I want to move in to a keto option okay this one's a little bit different if your keto we're not spiking your insulin right we don't want to have the carbs in there we don't want to have the rice and stuff like that we don't have the rice noodles so what does it look like this one is all about making a small amount of bolognaise okay like I got any kind of beef bolognaise or pork Bolognese where you're mixing it up with a little bit of no sugar added marinara okay you can get like Costco has some marinara that has like four grams or five grams of carbs and for like a half a cup serving the amount that you're having is gonna be so small anyway it's perfect you're gonna need just about a quarter cup to a half a cup of marinara cook it up with some fairly lean ground beef or ground pork or even a lean pork chop if you wanted to put it on there and just mix it up in some marinara okay the acidity from the marinara actually helps kick-start digestion again but we want the good quality protein here high Omega threes the Omega threes are going to trigger protein synthesis so it's gonna kick you out of that fast and kick you into muscle building mode again now what's probably the most important thing here is with the marinara or with the tomato sauce no garlic no onion why because it's too high in the fruit tans and all ego saccharide content we don't want those because it's going to bloat you and you're gonna have a heavy prebiotic affect that's gonna just wreak havoc on your stomach you're gonna end up just gassing up the whole place like a couple hours later so just keep the garlic and onion out of it that includes garlic and onion powder okay if you go for good-quality meat I recommend you go for grass-fed grass-finished here's a really interesting study that just came out this is really new stuff okay this study took a look at semi-free grazing in this case it was pigs but it still gets the point across versus feedlot indoor pigs and they found that they wanted to take a look at just the overall content how it affected flavor and density of the meat this is what's wild grass-fed stuff and free-range actually ends up tasting better so what happened is the myofibrillar fat content increase which means there's little bits of fat throughout the muscle fibers moreso in the free grazing kind than the non free grazing showing that you're gonna have more flavor and more of the healthy omegas that are in the actual tissue versus having to get big old globs of fat right so we don't want those big uncontrolled globs of fat we want small little amounts in the muscle fiber it's gonna make it taste good plus more in the way of type 1 muscle fibers which are smaller and have a higher IMT G content in termina cellular triglycerides so when you cut through like a steak or when you cut through something you bite into ground beef and it's like not grisly and it's smooth and it's just you can tell it's higher quality that makes a big difference in the overall flavor profile now we're also looking at higher amounts of naturally occurring glutamate which is gonna satisfy the brain so you're actually getting kind of a new mommy effect to that new mommy effect that chefs will know about is very very important kind of how the brain lights up when it tastes something good so at the end of the day though the small amounts of fat that we do get in we want to be good quality omega-3 and if you're being fed grass and not grains and feedlot garbage you're gonna have a higher degree of omega-3 and honestly this is where exactly where I would insert butcher box because I talk about them all the time so if you guys don't know about them check them out down in the description below this study made me think of them because they're all about grass-fed grass-finished all the time right so you can literally get grass-fed grass-finished meat high quality high quality meat delivered right to your doorstep for less price than you'd pay at the grocery store so please do check them out not only are they a sponsor of this channel but like I said I thought of them when I read this study because in fact I even reached out to them said I want to mention you and I talked about this study because it's just interesting stuff I think it really just summarizes how important grass-fed grass-finished is outside of just just the health side it tastes better too anyhow I digress check them out down the description special link down below the next thing is a keto option as well this one is if you want to have a little bit of fats added in normally I say keep it lean no matter what right because the ASB the oscillation stimulating protein you just want to spike insulin right at the end of a end of a fast even if it's with keto right more even with it's just with that's my point in saying that is if you're going to have fats they need to be coming in the way of like ncts they're shorter chain they're gonna absorb quicker but here's the big reason MCTS are now being shown to increase tryptophan availability in the brain on keto we suffer from not having enough tryptophan because tryptophan can't get into the brain when we're on keto what ends up happening is because we have low levels of insulin there's this competition that has to occur for other aminos so a long story short the brain doesn't absorb the tryptophan like it normally does and trip the fans important because it converts into eventually serotonin and ultimately even melatonin so you don't feel good you can get the press you have a hard time falling asleep MCTS will help kind of kickstart that process in your brain because MCTS have been shown to increase tryptophan content into the brain so that is very powerful now I want to combine that with just something really lean again like a lean fish so like a little piece of cod like 3/4 ounces of cod with a little bit of coconut oil or a little bit of MCT oil and maybe a little bit of pepper and salt guys I'm not saying this is five-star cuisine here I'm saying these are strategic ways to break your fast lastly I want to talk about the vegetarian option here the vegetarian slash vegan option is going to be death which is a really interesting grain it's a gluten-free grain that has unique Pro lemons in it that doesn't kick-start the same kind of cascade from an autoimmune respect that any kind of other grain could rice can even do it but gluten we want to avoid right so teff I highly recommend teff with a little bit of salt pepper and then a quarter cup of berries okay so you're gonna make like a grain berry salad like you've seen it with quinoa quinoa and some berries okay I'm talking like a quarter cup of just blueberries or maybe some blackberries mixed in with this teff season it up a little bit of salt a little bit of pepper then if you want take a little bit of egg white and mix it in there and make like kind of a fried rice I know it sounds weird with berries but trust me the flavor profile is good so maybe just a couple egg whites we don't want the egg yolk in this case normally I'm all about the egg yolk but in this case we want the white because we don't want the fats with the carbs if you are totally vegan and you don't want to do the vegetarian egg option AP protein shake just half a scoop small amounts of protein pea protein can still be hard to break down on an empty stomach so you want to combine it with the with the teff and you want to just do a small amount and then everything an hour later you can go ahead and you can eat your full-blown dinner or your full-blown bigger meal where honestly just have flexibility within the realms of what you are eating keto vegan non keto you name it and also just a quick note for those of you that are gonna try the fast break that I talked about if you're doing scallops butcher box now has wild cut no chemical added scallops to so I thought that I'd make a mention of that so check them out again down in the description anyhow if you like videos like this and you want more just give me ideas down in the comment section as always see you soon", "VGpxHcvViOI": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music]", "d6yobs_gO00": "so you finally decided to do something about that unhealthy and unsightly belly fat that you've been carrying around the last few years this video is going to help you with that now how do i know anything about belly fat and how to get rid of it i'm dr ken berry a family physician with over 20 years of clinical experience and a few years back i was actually morbidly obese myself and suffered from dunlap that's something we talk about in the southern united states it's when your belly done laps over your belt so i am somewhat of an expert on losing belly fat both as a uh clinician and as someone who suffered from lots of extra belly fat now i'm sure you think i'm going to tell you to eat less and move more join the gym eat lots of rice cakes but nothing could be further from the truth as you've already discovered those things don't work they're not sustainable you're hungry all the time angry all the time you have no energy no one can stick to that people in the past may have intimated that you were a glutton and a sloth and that this is all your fat all your fat yeah all your fault that you're so fat well it is kind of indirectly your fault but it's not really your fault because you didn't know the proper steps to take to lower a very important hormone that we're going to talk about in this video and you also didn't know these 10 steps and in an effort to give more than i receive i have added a bonus tip at the end here are the 10 tips to lose belly fat effortlessly okay and the last three might really surprise you because you don't hear them very often let's jump in number one when you go grocery shopping stick to the outer aisles the outer wall of the grocery store that's where you're going to find all the natural foods that's where you're going to find meat eggs cheese full fat dairy some vegetables some berries these are real foods that your body actually know how to use and they're not going to lead to increasing belly fat they're actually going to help you burn that belly fat off quicker number two is choose only one ingredient foods okay so if something has more more than two ingredients whatever the ingredient is and maybe salt don't buy it only buy one ingredient foods your body knows what to do with ribeye it has one ingredient your body knows what to do with broccoli it has one ingredient but if you start shopping in the center of the store you're going to find things that have 10 20 30 40 50 ingredients many of which are going to spike your insulin and cause you to not lose that sticky belly fat that you just can't get rid of number three don't ever drink a carbohydrate or a sweetener okay so this applies obviously to the soft drinks this also applies to the fruit juices if what you're about to drink contains even one gram of carbohydrate don't drink it because your body doesn't know the difference between added sugar or natural sugar and so whether you're gonna drink a pepsi or whether you're going to drink some organic grape juice it makes no difference it contains sugar it is going to make you build belly fat instead of getting rid of it number four eat at least one gram of protein per kilogram of your body weight every day protein is satiating also your your body needs all of the amino acids contained in that protein to renew and rejuvenate itself so the protein is not optional eating this much protein a day may be new to you but i promise you it's going to keep you fuller for longer and that's going to keep you from eating the junk and make the belly fat keep disappearing number five is eat more fat and i know you just went wait what yeah eat more fat fat is the most satiating of all three macronutrients being fat protein and carbohydrates carbohydrates don't really satiate you or fill you up at all that's why you have to eat every two hours if you eat lots of carbohydrates also eating carbohydrates turns immediately into sugar or glucose in your blood and that spikes your insulin anytime your insulin is high you ain't going to burn that belly fat does that make sense so you want to eat plenty of protein and you want to eat plenty of fat every single day my favorite is the fat found in fatty cuts of animal meats you can also eat plant fats that's fine but eat lots of fat every day number six is eat plenty of real salt i know again you're like wait this doctor just told me to eat salt yes yes i did here's why many times when you get a craving that craving is actually for salt or for a mineral it's not actually for the cheetos or doritos so if you eat plenty of salt each day and it's a real salt so it has minerals in it as well as sodium and chloride then you're going to be giving your body all the minerals it needs and you're not going to be having weird cravings that make you wind up going to the center of the store where are all of the processed carbohydrates are hiding in plain sight number seven recognize your sugar addiction any carbohydrate breaks down to sugar sugar hits our pleasure centers in our brain just like some illicit drugs it's absolutely without a doubt true that some people are very very addicted to sugar and so if you have a craving and fall off the wagon then don't necessarily beat yourself up about being a glutton just look in the mirror and say hi i'm feeling your name and i am a sugar addict and once you come to grips with that that you're a sugar addict it makes what you're fighting against much easier because if you know your enemy then you have a better chance of defeating your enemy but if you think that your enemy is just eating too much in general or laying on the couch too much that's that's kind of hard to fight but if you know it's the sugar it's the carbohydrates i'm a sugar addict i have to fight that specific battle every day that's gonna make it a lot easier number eight is limit your alcohol intake to one serving a day and this needs to be a carbohydrate-free sweetener-free drink and so if you make a mixed drink make sure that you use something that has zero carbs and no artificial sweeteners because any sweet taste in your mouth is going to raise your insulin level and when your insulin is high you ain't burning no belly fat so you can have your one drink a day and i don't mean one drink a day i mean a serving size of alcohol a day if you even want it the alcohol is not going to help you lose weight but it's also not going to make you gain weight if you just have one serving it's just kind of a wash so you make your decision number nine stop all sugars whether added or natural okay so if you drink a two liter of coke that's a ton of sugar if you eat a full bag of those beautiful delicious niagara seedless grapes that's also a ton of sugar your body can't tell the difference it doesn't know whether the the sugar came from pepsi or orange juice or the big bag of grapes stop eating any sugar and your belly fat will start to melt away effortlessly number 10 implement some degree of intermittent fasting into your lifestyle every single day try to go for at least a 16-hour fast so if you sleep for eight hours a day then that means you would you would wait four hours after you wake up to eat your first meal and you would stop eating four hours before you go to bed you don't have to do this every single day but i want you to move towards doing a 16 or 18 hour fast every single day because when you're fasting your insulin level is very low normal and that's the sweet spot for losing belly fat effortlessly number 11 your bonus is avoid protein bars and protein shakes now wait a minute i thought in number four i told you to eat lots of protein yes i did the problem with protein bars and protein shakes is that they're very often mislabeled if you look at the total carbohydrates and the protein in the fat most often almost always they're highest in carbohydrates so they should really be called carbohydrate shakes and carbohydrate bars that's not going to help keep your insulin low normal if you want to eat a protein bar then cut your ribeye and strips and hold it like this and call it a bar that's a protein bar if it comes in a plastic wrap in a cardboard box that's a carbohydrate bar and that's never ever going to help you burn fat off your midsection effortlessly now there are two diets that will absolutely help you lose belly fat effortlessly and they're going

these yogurt drinks are to make, you'll never buy the\nstore bought ones again. (fast upbeat music) (bright music) My kids love single serve yogurt drinks. While they're convenient, they can also get expensive when you have three kids. Let me show you how I make my\nown with my favorite fruits. The combinations are endless, all you have to do is\nhave the proper fruit, yogurt and milk ratio. Let's get started. For strawberry flavored yogurt drinks, we're gonna combine the milk, yogurt, honey and strawberries\nin our blender and blend. Chilling before serving is preferred unless you're using frozen fruit. That makes what I call\ninstant yogurt drinks. If you make these yogurt\ndrinks ahead of time, you might want to give them\na quick shake before serving.

I was going to do triple berry preserves and I think I'm gonna try preserves why because I've never made preserves before I've made a lot of jam I've made a lot of jelly but I've never done preserves so I think we're gonna do that today it's gonna be super easiest to something all of you be especially if you're new all you newbies can we'll be able to do this I'm gonna spin you around it is a blustery rainy cold windy day here in Michigan and it is the perfect day to cam so I have water hot water now in my canner and I've got my my jelly jars I'm soaking in hot soapy water with cleaning vinegar just a tad of cleaning strength vinegar added to it I'm gonna clean these up wash these up and then I'm gonna go ahead and put it in my canner and then I'm going to sterilize them over on the stove and while that happens then we can make our our preserves and I will get all that out and and we'll get started here super excited I love canning days like this it's just it's like the perfect weather [Music] [Music] [Music] like my charts are all washed I'm gonna go ahead and this water begins to heat up I wish dam full panner worth of jars even if I don't fill them just in case just in case better to be safe than sorry [Music] all right and we will start sterilizing those up and let me get out the pot and my berries and we'll get going here okay guys so I'm going to show you what I have and what I'm gonna use and if this works I'm going to probably be canning again so what I bought for this recipe is this triple berry blend I bought this from Sam's Club it's three pounds of berries I compared it to fresh berries and this was so much more economical you know the fact that they freeze these you know when the when the berries are at their peak and they're ripe I'm fine with using frozen berries so I'm going to be using this and the recipe calls for two pounds of berries and I believe two pounds I'm actually going to be using this recipe from the ball blue book for the berry print preserves so it's two pounds of berries and four cups of sugar so I'm going to be doubling that recipe I'm going to be doing four pounds of berries so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add I have a brand new package of blueberries here and I also have a half a bag of raspberries and this bag here has raspberries blueberries and blackberries in it so I'm going to combine this and make my preserves from that if this works I also have a bag a three pound bag of the triple berries with cherry includes dark cherries now in it so blueberries raspberries cherries and blackberries so that would make a really good preserve too but one step at a time Heather again don't follow me just ride along with me because I've never done this before so I'm going to figure it out as we go but I think preserves and cooking it down and making it real thick and not having pectin in it I think it's gonna be really good I'm really excited so let's give this a go all right so in the bowl it's gonna go or I should say pies oh it's so busy here at the house baton phones are ringing kids are home playing okay so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and dump my berries in now all right so all the frozen berries in and on low this pot is gonna go and as it cooks up here I'm just gonna kind of work them down but they all are so all right let's get to also calls for eight cups of sugar all right so eight cups of sugar know your sugar jar is large when you take 8 cups out and it hardly makes a dent in your jar alright so there we go with that get over here alright so we have our sugar man let's go take it over to our stove so then lightly smoothly and the sugar this is where I always tell myself so you need a bigger pot if you need like a 10 quart or 12 quart but then I'm too short I wouldn't be able to stir so it's a catch-22 there all right let that heat up now don't be like me cuz it's always smarter to thaw your berries my problem is I always get sidetracked and then like you know I've been wanting to make this forever now my berries would have gone bad by now had I done that so you know you could be like me I guess and take them out and cook them for frozen state this is how I this is even how I do uh I've done blueberry pie filling in the past that works out but probably not the easiest route Heather okay I'm gonna go ahead and add cup number four I'm just gonna slowly add the sugar in as I go here okay guys so I have all the sugar added now and you see it's really starting to loosen no just have to warm it up so far I mean it's beautiful that's for sure it's not even showing how deep and rich berry red it is on camera but it's it's pretty beautiful first time making preserves woohoo okay so here we have it we have added all the sugar and it's starting to come to a little boil now I'm gonna add a little pat of butter on this and get rid of the foam it starts foaming here add that in there half a tablespoon and that should get rid of any foam for me and what I'm going to do is really all you do is you're supposed to turn up the heat so we're turning up the heat and we're going to rapidly reduce this to a gel stage and go ahead and put a spoon I can test it as we go here oh it smells incredible and I'm telling you I'm gonna do the triple berry with the black cherries in it as preserves to us I think that would be insane so so good you know I buy preserves all the time when we go to like the cider mill or when we go into Frankenmuth and you go into all the little shops and some of those little specialty kitchens you know they always sell preserves and I love preserves and never even I can't believe before now I've never even canned it I don't think I've ever even done blueberry preserves I think I've always just turned it into jam with pectin so cooking it down we look at that big you see that that's up see you see that look at that big that big raspberry they're hot some raspberries lots of full full-size blackberries too and see it on there ah so good so good so good all right now turn this on and this up and get this to rapidly reduce to a gel stage and then double check here all right so we're gonna bring slowly to a boil which we already did and then it says cook rapidly almost to jelling point as mixture thickens stir frequently prevent sticking remove from heat skim the foam if necessary and then ladle hot preserves into hot jars leaving a quarter-inch headspace and then we're gonna put the lids on bring them up and then process them for 15 minutes in the water back here so I've just got to get to that point so I will be back when we get there even though I know you guys love hanging out with me I do not want to bore you I want you to come back for the next video smells incredible you guys we try to give you a better peek but I would end up steaming out okay so let's test I'm gonna use my very frozen spoon dip it in here pull it out [Applause] check the see [Applause] I like that you can see where fruit is stick sticking on the spoon Newport's preserves it's not supposed to be like a jam it's not going to be as thick I want to make sure it stays on the spoon it's looking [Applause] so but I'd say we're almost there we are almost there right almost there guys longer process but so worth it I think it's going to be so worth it so let's test this one more time another frozen spoon oh yeah that's what I'm talking about that's a perfect gel that that is beautiful all right let's get ready to canvas all right hopefully I got you set up okay you can see everything so start with and being our first jar here then I always get a backup jar my candy funnel in and I think I'm not going to use this one you can use this canning funnel and I know I get a lot of questions about this one this one is made by progressive you can get it if I can find an amazon link down below I'll put it I love this though because it's got a little notch right here and this is where the room of your jar goes so not only is your jar protected from the inside it's also then protected from the outside from anything dripping down onto your rim this is perfect for beginners and I love it I will it's perfect for anyone it's perfect if you can a lot too because it really cuts down on cleaning your jar time all right so [Music] let's get this chart oh my gosh it's beautiful let me shut off my scent sorry about that guys I'm just trying to get rid of some steam here we're gonna do a quarter inch head space honestly I usually do a half inch head space just so I don't ever run into any problems with my seals little bit more I think always have a um always have a towel laid down so you prevent any leakage or any stains or anything like that's easy i I picked these blue towels up from Sam's Club they sell them like in a bunch of six or eight or something and I love it now I probably don't need to stir this down but I'm going to anyway just in case I have any air bubbles better to be safe than sorry and that is it alright so let me get I've got some vinegar here just some regular white vinegar and I'm gonna dip the napkin in there my edges there and I have my now even with the new lids old lids I don't care what lids they are I always still come in hot water I just do it's just what's always worked for me and what continues to work for me even with the new lids so fingertip tight and that is it so me show you this beautiful jar of triple berry preserves here oh so pretty all of these bigger jars for us because as fast as my boys go through jam and jelly it's perfect for us so don't fingertip tight and there we have it hmm so excited this is so much fun to do with you guys thanks for hanging out with me all right let's do another cool looking journey after this one my kids have been loving the Oh what is it now it used to be ABC Family now I think it's oh gosh I don't need a very mother the name of what it is now I don't know whatever it is it's a terrible name because I can't ever remember it but if the 13 nights of Halloween they have been loving it I have a little Halloween movies and specials so that's probably what you're gonna hear in the background alright there's another one in the canner she goes teenager and he said give it away as a gift I try to keep my pretty jars either for us or for people that I know return my jars because the pretty ones cost more and they're hard to find so give those up oh as much well this is a perfect recipe if you have a hard time with setting with your set being good with pectin if pectin is not your friend definitely get preserves a try it's a little bit longer of a process as far as as far as you have to boil it down longer so that takes a little time but definitely definitely worth it also saves you money too if you don't want to buy pectin I mean all you need for this right the sugar and some berries and as you see I use frozen berries so you don't even have to have fresh berries in your area to be able to do this you know I need my mouth okay this one of the new sure tight lips there's not going in this one and my battery's flashing at me so I am going to end the video here for now I'll meet you back here in a little bit what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna finish filling these I'm gonna lower them down put the lid on my canner bring it up turn it on high bring it to a boil once it starts boiling and inside a full rapid boil I will time it for 15 minutes and I'll turn off my heat I'll let it sit in the canner for an additional five minutes then I'll bring the jars up and out and when I get to that part I'll bring you guys back and show you what they look like oh here are my finished jars this I actually did to two loaves here this is the triple berry and this is what it looks like if I can get it over here and you can actually see it get focused you can see how thick and beautiful with this it's just it's beautiful and this one also has big black bean cherries in it and that's the second batch that I need I kind of mixed the two on this one because I had a little bit extra of the first batch and a little bit extra of the second batch so I just put it in a jar and this will just go and sit in our fridge but um I just want to show you what it looks like and then this is the triple berry with you needed a new battery okay so these five are the triple berry with the added of black cherry to it so those I just pulled out of the canner and then I've got six nine I've got ten so a little tiny one but it's perfect for a gift ten here and let actually let these process for twenty minutes just because I have these little bit taller jars so just in case I don't I don't think yours you have to do that but I did it anyway but I've got ten jars then of just the triple berry preserves so altogether that's a nice little it's a nice little collection to put up on my shelf I'm super excited so I'm gonna let these sit and I don't even think oh these have pinged already means I've already pinged and I think all of these have pinged look all those at pings so I'm just gonna let these sit and rest and cool and then when they're completely cool probably in the morning I will wash them up in hot soapy water with some vinegar and get them labeled I still have to do these jars over here and they need a hot soak in some soapy water as well and they need to be labeled so I'm gonna do that tonight I think Matt is gonna go ahead and make make my canning shelf because um I kind of need it I'm kind of out of room this this one I will just let cool down I'm still really hot

steak which are just hamburgers that I throw in here and that came out good now this I made extra ah drew for this because tomorrow I'm going to bring this gravy back out and I'm gonna cook my pork loin in it and it's gonna be so good so that is it we also had a home canned green beans as a side but that is it guys I hope you enjoyed this video and going along the ride with me as I make preserves for the first time very easy a little more time-consuming because you really need to really need to reduce this down so it thickens up but it was definitely worth it whose definitely worth it so alright and with that I'm gonna let you guys go and I'll be seeing ya I'm gonna do pineapple tonight but I think we're gonna build the candy shelf instead night guys I'm just gonna go ahead and

blood sugar rises in response to a certain food with foods lower on the glycemic index being less likely to cause spikes associated with weight gain something to keep in mind if you first freeze white bread and then toast it the amount of glucose that your blood absorbs after eating it is half the amount you absorb from fresh white bread the researchers suspect that the starch molecules in the bread take on a different structure as a result of freezing defrosting and toasting which means your body has to work harder to break down the sugar and if you're a carb counter don't miss our amazing

hormone shoots up leptin the i'm full hormone decreases the result you're hungrier and you eat more food 25. cook bacon the right way yes bacon most people cook bacon in an overcrowded pan which yields inconsistent results make life easier and tastier by using the oven instead lay bacon out in a baking dish at least two inches deep in bake in a 400 degrees fahrenheit oven for 10 to 12 minutes until the meat just begins to brown and crisp around the edges bacon like other meat will continue to cook after you remove it from the oven not only will the bacon be perfect every time but the fat will also render out more thoroughly this way meaning your bacon doesn't just taste better it is better 26. always go for greek yogurt it's not just the huge protein boost more than twice as much as found in most conventional brands that makes greek style yogurt so great the thick creamy texture and pronounced tang give it a versatility that other yogurts don't have try it in any of the following applications 27 swap bread crumbs for nuts no matter how little oil they absorb bread crumbs are always empty calories but breading on meat and fish doesn't need to be a total nutritional zero nuts

cravings yolks also deliver vitamins d and b12 so they're great for your bones and brain too and not to worry that eggs will hike your cholesterol turns out those concerns from health experts back in

system support event how to support your immune system like a boss i am extraordinarily excited to share this information with you tonight my name is kristen boucher and i am a nurse my background is in nursing i'm no longer practicing as a nurse um so this is really kind of fun stuff this is kind of geeky sciency neat stuff that's really going to kind of make your head explode in a good way um so i got started with young living it's been about six years a little over six years now and i was doing health coaching and vlogging and i had two young kids at the time i had a one-year-old and a four-year-old and i was burning the wick at both ends i was running my own business and i was completely mentally and physically exhausted and my hormones were out of control and my friends kept telling me to get some essential oils and i was like yeah yeah yeah okay i have essential oils i get them on amazon what's the big deal i started using young living oils and i was like that's the big deal night and day completely different quality from what i was using so um long story short here we are today six and a half years later with a big huge team all over the world now and um just sharing the oily love and it is just so much fun such a blessing it's brought so many incredible people into our lives that i cannot express that so tonight i am excited and thrilled and honored to be joined by christina bakayaki she's a rock star she is a senior star leader with young living she is like the ultimate mom boss she has four kids so like right there like you know she's super mom runs her own business she's a daycare uh provider preschool teacher she just knows her stuff and she has had an incredible story around healing her body with natural substances i should say um so i'm going to introduce christina and then we're going to jump right into the content of tonight so thanks so much for being here thank you kristin that was a very warm welcome hi everybody so good to see you um so yeah my story is one that started when i was very very ill for a good portion of my life so as kristin said i'm a mom of four they range from ages of five to twelve they're all girls um and i have been running a daycare in a preschool for over a decade now so kids are kind of my thing um and throughout that time i went through a period where i got very very very ill and my body started to shut down and it was based on hormones my thyroid didn't work and i was had been on medicine for a really long time but it just wasn't jiving and i went through a period of immense stress and those coupled with just the normal everyday life that we all do took me down it took me down to the point where i ended up with a hysterectomy before i was 40. i had major inflammation in my body to the point where they thought that i had early arthritis at the age of 40. i grew a mass right here on my chest the whole nine yards and it was at that point that i said i need to find something better so i had been living organically since my first was born so it had been you know at that point eight years where i was very healthy already but it wasn't enough it wasn't enough to just change my food and change my beauty products because i still had all of these holes in my immune system so i called kristin and i said hey i heard of you would you meet for coffee because i can't take this anymore i am so sick i am so unwell and i can't function in my life so she met me for a coffee and changed my entire world she introduced me to a couple basics one of which was ningxia red we're going to talk about that today but i swear it saved my life there was about a three month period where i wasn't able to even consume food and the only thing i could keep down was ningxia and all my blood work would say that i was spot on perfect they were like we don't understand how you don't eat because you are right on on key on everything and it allowed me to start getting well and then to just keep taking those steps and so now i have decided to take this on as a new passion of mine to share just like she shared with me i want other people to feel better and not feel as bad as i felt so i've joined this team and we now have a wellness channel to my business and um and and here i am so i'm happy to be here thank you yay that is such an amazing story and those kinds of transformational powerful health changes are just what lights my fire hearing that so thank you so much for sharing that okay we're going to dive in i'm going to bring up my fancy slides and i want you guys can just give me a thumbs up when you can see my screen and i'm also gonna ask because we are a wonderful community i can't see the chat when i have a slides up so if y'all can just kind of monitor the chat and if there's a question there that you feel comfortable with answering this is for everybody here tonight please do otherwise we'll just kind of go through it at the end and answer every question um that we can okay now i'm just need to hold on i'm not sure what am i doing i can't even use i can't even use google docs there we go all right can you guys see my screen i can i'm good perfect perfect okay so i'm going to just jump right in so as you may already know diet and lifestyle um have a profound influence on over how long we live and how healthy we are and how good we feel i mean eureka right so according to one study only 40 of our life expectancy is determined by determined by our genetic makeup so that means the remaining 60 and i would argue that's even more is determined by our food choices our activity and our environment so that's something that we are in control of and particularly in the current situation that we are in which i can't which shall not be named but we know that the folks that are having mortality from that or were having mortality or that are having really bad complications from that smoking diabetes chronic disease obesity those are the things that are causing so much distress in our health care system and their bodies so a lot of that can be something we can control for the most part um so what happens when our bodies to our bodies that it needs daily support so our bodies care about two things getting nutrients that we need and dealing with the toxins that we encounter on a daily basis so those are pretty much the two things if we can keep these two things in balance then we're going to be pretty healthy and as we grow older we see a steady decline in our immune system particularly due to dna damage from free radicals you've probably heard of those things free radicals and it tilts our body into a state of inflammation the same kind of inflammation that christine christina was just talking about so i'm sure you've heard of inflammation before it's kind of like the silent killer it can create heart disease and diabetes and all kinds of issues and autoimmune diseases all kinds of things so when our bodies encounter toxins whether it's from food or our environment our cells either die off or they mutate and become cancerous which is frightening so think about it like a car the older the engine the more pollutants come out so that's why as your car ages particularly here in massachusetts it gets a lot harder to pass the state inspection because you have all of these emissions that you're putting out from an older car so the same goes with our bodies so going back to our bodies the worse our diet is the more pollutants that come out of our cells the more chemicals that we're rubbing on our body or inhaling while we're cleaning our homes the more pollutants come out and so on and so forth so these pollutants are called free radicals show of hands or just a little me me in the chat who's heard of free radicals before if you've been with with us for a long time you've heard me talking about free radicals before they are those pesky little buggers that diseases and ages they create all kinds of havoc to ourselves that creates a lot of work for our immune system which then has to go back and repair ourselves so it's kind of like being a parent keeping our homes clean amongst kids animals life being quarantined we're constantly cleaning up after all the things so this is what our immune system is doing all day long every single day 24 hours a day it is our primary safeguard to keeping disease in check so how does the immune system work so right here these are kind of the five big things that create havoc in the immune system so we get sick for several reasons and sometimes not just sick with a cold or the flu or the stomach bug you can get really really really sick chronic disease when our immune systems are switched off for the following reasons stress digestive weakness messed up guts lack of key nutrients and lack of adequate sleep so more than likely you're experiencing some of these things perhaps right now because we're kind of in a really weird state of uncertainty right now that's creating a lot of distress in our bodies so only when we are well rested nourished have healthy guts does our immune system truly have the ability to kick in and keep us healthy so interestingly being sick is our body's way of healing after a long period of stress so this is why people tend to get sick during the holidays because it's the perfect storm for illness to sneak in right we're out there we're going all the parties we're seeing everybody we're wrapping presents late into the night or we're shopping and we're just doing too many things we're not getting enough sleep we're stressed out we're eating like crap boom christmas day you get sick right has that ever happened to anybody before multiple times literally christmas day is the day that the wheels fall off the bus so why do we get sick that is the magic question is it germs or is it stress or is it both so there's two schools of thought um whoa what am i doing here oh shoot i'm all out of order good thing good thing all right forget the slides something weird happened there so why do we get sick there are two schools of thought when it comes to research on how we get sick this is really fascinating first is the germ theory okay the germ theory and then the pleomorphism theory in the simplest of terms we either get sick from germs uh that we come in contact with or we get sick only when the terrain of the body becomes favorable to disease now in the former the germ fear we were all familiar with what i we're all familiar with that is what's happening right now well that is what we're thinking is happening right now that is why all of the hand sanitizer is going was going out of stock that is why everyone's washing their hands like crazy and not that that's a bad thing that is a good thing we want to make sure that when we come in contact with germs we get them off of our body because otherwise it goes into our body and our immune system has to work harder to fight them so um what i could never understand was how some people can get so sick so easily and then often and some do not but then recover quickly so you know those people right the ones that can like literally travel and do all the things never get sick or then you come in contact with one person then you're sick for two weeks right you just never quite know so the mere presence of germs does not constitute the presence of illness or disease so the pleomorphism theory hinges on the health of our microbiome if you've heard that before that is our human cells along with all the bacteria that live in our bodies that's basically our gut so when our microbiome is disturbed it can create an environment for opportunistic bacteria to cause disease and illness so christina when did i did i all right i'm going to hand it over to you now so you got it has your mind been blown yet i'm going to pull the slides down for a second and see if i can fix it while you're going and then um we'll go from there sorry guys this is real life this is my state of my state of my being right now my slides are completely messed up all right you take a minute we can take it away christine all right all right so awesome awesome information with that in mind what can we do to ensure our body is healthy and our immune systems are strong basically we need to foster a healthy terrain so we need to flood our bodies with the nutrients and the antioxidants to keep ourselves clean and healthy we need to give them what they need to do their job which is keeping us healthy you wouldn't put pump dirty gas into a ferrari right we would get the high-end gas this is kind of the same idea we want to give our bodies what it needs so think of your body like a car we need to fuel it for the run but in tune turn we need to we create pollutants as we burn that fuel if we're fueling our body with bad fuel those pollutants increase tenfold especially as we get older and our engines don't run as well and what do these pollutants do they damage our dna and they either kill off our cells or make mutant cells that can cause cancer or other degenerative diseases so what's the magic bullet well besides being completely clean eating completely clean unprocessed food and living in a bubble which although we're all trying i don't think we can do that for long um we need antioxidants that is the magic bullet it's antioxidants we've all heard of these this this term is out there right so what they do is they go in and they support our bodies to process the and undo this ner these um damage that had been done to ourselves called oxidative stress the free radicals are doing every single day and keeping our bodies kind of just moving along so we've all heard about them they're in things like blueberries and pomegranates and if you're a fan of those yummy like assy bowls my 10 year old is obsessed with them they're in there too um and how do you know which foods to choose so what's really awesome i think this is so cool i love the science part too kristen is there is actually a measurement tool called the is it orax scale they say that right don't ask me what it stands for i have no idea but it's a measurement of how many antioxidants are in each food so it's going to rank which foods are the best so blueberries have a value of nine thousand six hundred and twenty one that sounds pretty good but pomegranates have a score of ten thousand five hundred pomegranates are good we've all those palm drinks those are so delicious right but let's do even better elderberries have a score of 14 697 so we're getting even better and there actually was a norwegian study that showed flu patients who received elderberry syrup felt better about four days sooner than those who received a placebo so elderly syrup we probably a lot of us have heard people they make it at home i mean you're really getting a lot in there um but but none of it compares to the ningxia right here this stuff my lifeblood right here so these have a score of almost 30 000. like 30 000 oh my goodness no wonder this kept me alive so super berries are awesome at helping our bodies to overcome the damage and highly anti-aging so let's talk about the wolf fairy for a moment you might be familiar with the jojo berries the wolf berries are like the same thing wolf fairies are from china and the jojo berries are from india so kind of that same region but here's the thing not all wolf fairies are created equal so the best source and the highest one on that orac scale comes from the ningxia providence in china what's the name i don't think i can say that correctly kristen key yellow river the yellow river originates in the himalayan mountains and flows through the ningxia province the river creates a unique mineral-rich fertile ground that produces incomparedly potent wolf berries it is in this area of the ningxia valley where the wolfberries are the highest in antioxidants so i could go on for days talking about ningxia it is my favorite product ever um it is the ultimate easy button so i tell people if there's one thing you change in your life right now today it is just start drinking this every single day and you will notice a difference i just i've seen it time and time and time again i have seen it it is the ultimate easy button it is infused with this natural fairy plus the powerful essential oils that are known for immune support which is gonna just pump them up even more so the cool thing about infusing essential oils into supplements is twofold it enhances the bioavailability of any supplement and this is a big deal if you're into supplements it's really important to have something that has bioavailability and in short it means that your body is able to absorb it and what's crazy is that if you don't have a supplement that has bioavailability your body's ability to absorb is about five to ten percent so you're literally excreting the rest so you're wasting your money young livings are bioavailable available so you are going to be able to actually use all of that and i'm pretty sure the last time i checked it was above 95 that you're able to absorb so again you're getting the most bang for your buck so you can excrete less and have more good stuff essential oils also provide a level of synergy that enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of both the supplements which is the elderberry syrup and the oil working together so it just really marries really well i like to describe it as if you picture like swiss cheese the essential oils fill in all the holes and make that stronger so it just fortifies everything and just gives you literally like the best thing ever another simple hack for solid immune support so you want to feed the good bugs and crowd out the bad bugs so we're getting into the gut now the gut is super important our immune system lives in the gut we need to make sure that is taken care of and this is where one of the things that i had struggled with to correct and get better for so long even though i was doing all i was taking probiotics i was drinking tons of water i cut out all of these things for me it cooked stepping up and getting into the good supplements and the nature red to truly see life-changing differences so you're gonna take care of it so you've probably heard there's good bugs and there's bad bugs we have unfortunately as a human race spent probably the last two decades trying to get rid of bacteria with antibacterial everything and an overload of antibiotics unfortunately this killed not only the bad but the good and so we're all trying to come back from it we ended also ended up with an epidemic of leaky gut syndrome and so many gut issues and antibiotic antibiotic resistant super bugs this is not good we don't need these problems in our life um fortunately try clicky try glycerol so bad at reading all these medical words but one of the chemical agents responsible for that antibacterial has now been banned so too little too late which is unfortunately a lot of times what happens with regulations and why we have to be really careful but now they can't do it anymore um there's also a ton of research around on the got the mind gut connection and this is really really important especially as we get older because your gut is going how you take care of it is going to affect how your brain ages but it's also really important when you're younger too and you're developing and so a quick google search will show you some fascinating information how god is connected to mental health autism all of those types of things so how do you fix this you flood your body with good bugs so things like probiotics probiotic rich fermented foods like sauerkraut and yogurt um we take here in this house this probiotic which is called life nine from young living and i absolutely love it um and so keep keeping those things that are good they also have one for the children as well called the mighty pro and they can take it it's like a little i have it next door my kids actually mix it in with their ningxia between that and the magnesium one the other thing you can do your next strategy would be to use essential oils and cbd and these help keep your cells clean i cannot rave enough about cbd and i love the young living cbd line because i am so thankful that i finally have a cbd product that i can trust where it comes from so cbd will change your life it um can make you so many things can can help you on your way to wellness but it can reduce stress and it can help you sleep better so essential oils have been called the lifeblood of a plant they circulate through the plant tissue and pass through the cell walls and that's why they call them essential oils for them they carry the nutrients into all the cells so when essential oils are applied to people or animals they do the same thing they can increase our ability to absorb vitamins and other nutrients as well as supporting literally every single body system from our immune system to our emotions our respiratory system our brain health our digestion our muscles and joints and everything in between essential oils also possess homeostatic intelligence so that means a state of perfect wellness perfect wellness right what we're all trying to achieve is a biological process within a living organism where it's functioning exactly as it should and i truly believe that our bodies can achieve this if we treat them correctly and we help them and support them cbd offers a similar effect as well by reducing the inflammation and when used with those essential oils the effects are incredible for immune supporting benefits we'll tell you more about this in a minute um but we're going to go on to talking about clearing out the toxins in your life so if you're doing all of this good stuff for your body it makes no sense to undo that good by exposing yourself to toxins in your daily life this is where you can ditch and switch everything in your home to help with everything that you're doing improve your daily routines that are already laced with toxins and that are creating those free radicals which are just aging ourselves in our body and replace them with cleaner toxin free alternatives for example you can swap out your cleaner with something like this and make your thieves save a ton of money and have something that is non-toxic and truly healthy for your house we also love to ex to diffuse the thieves i defuse thieves right now in the situation that we're in i diffuse thieves once a day in my house and then the other i defuse all day long and all night actually um and at least one of those times will always be thieves because it will clean my air um and i use the thieves hand sanitizer and the soap i actually use the laundry detergent i i make i make everything i absolutely love thieves i made the win uh my own wind glass cleaner there's the word i need to use a glass plater today um and again it was just the thieves cleaner and some vinegar and some lemon essential oil so it's amazing um absolutely amazing yeah yeah cleaner is the best that is is it's a one-stop shop for everything so guys um i'm gonna just stop the screen share for one second and hop into the chat um i'm curious how many people do we have here that are already already using oil so if you can just pop in the chat and say me are you already with young living or already not so i can get an idea it's like kind of a good idea to know your audience so i'm just looking in the chat really quick yes awesome awesome okay so we have a lot of people that are already killing it um and getting lots and lots of good stuff from young living and um i'm gonna so what i'm gonna do right now is we're gonna walk really quickly kind of through the starter kit and the oils that are in there that support the immune system specifically because i want to make sure that especially if you're newer you're getting the most out of your starter kit especially since we're talking immune support the cool thing about the starter kit is that it really and truly is the most incredible and comprehensive cross-section of oils that support every body system but particularly the immune system so really really really quickly three ways to use oils because again i'm recording this and there might be people that may um want to share this with their friends who may not yet be part of young living so i'm going to go over this really quickly three ways to use essential oils topically aromatically and internally topically putting the oils on your skin they're absorbing their they're getting into your bloodstream you're getting all the wonderful benefits of the essential oil aromatically i'm getting aromatically in my diffuser right now christina is getting her oils aromatically in her diffuser right now or you can be you know one of those crazy oil people and just sniff it right out of the bottle that is the fastest way into your bloodstream is to just breathe it right in it takes like three seconds it's really really really fast and then the third way internally supplementation that's what we're really talking about tonight um yes you can ingest young living essential oils and we'll talk about the oils that you can ingest it's basically the white labels those are actually labeled for ingestion as a dietary supplement um if you guys can mute i'm gonna i don't know who's who's unmuted um thank you so um and the other thing is our oils our supplements as christina alluded to are all infused with essential oils which enhances the bioavailability of those supplements making them far more effective far more efficacious than just the supplements that i was buying on amazon many many years ago so how does young living compare with others well here's the thing why young living so i questioned that myself over six years ago probably close to seven years ago i said what is the big deal about this young living i keep hearing all about it why can't i just go to amazon and get my oils well what i learned was young living is the only company that has the seed to seal guarantee and basically what that means is from the time that the bottle the time that the seed is sourced to the time that the bottle is sealed you're guaranteed 100 purity authenticity no chemicals no herbicides no funny business we have been in business for over 25 years we basically wrote the book on essential oils distillation methods growing methods harvesting gary young who was our founder god rest his soul he was so passionate about getting oils into every home because he knew the power that they had to support everyone's wellness so that really kind of spoke to me we also own all of our own farms being on those farms is the most amazing experience i highly highly recommend it okay one thing i wanted to share real quickly if you're not familiar is um all oils fall into four categories grade a grade b grade c in grade d grade a those are genuine therapeutic grade essential oils 100 the real deal that is what young living offers grade b those are food grade okay they may be used as a food additive to like let's say seltzers if you're buying those at the store um but they're not again therapeutic therapeutic oils grade c that's kind of like your health food store oils your tj maxx oils your bed bath and beyond etc they may smell good but they may not have they may be cut with other things and grade d is floral water that's basically the trash water that comes from a grade a distillation it smells good but there's absolutely no therapeutic benefits in there and the thing to remember is there's no labeling requirements for essential oils yet i'm hoping at some point there will be but basically in order to label a bottle of essential oil is pure therapeutic you just need to have five percent essential oil in the bottle and the rest can be whatever else and that five percent essential oil can be grade d can be floral water can be trash water so you really want to be careful about where you're buying your oils from the good news is all you guys here tonight are young living members and you know how how good quality it is okay so now without further ado we're gonna walk through the starter kit like rapid fire oils that support the immune system okay lavender swiss army knife of oils what does it do it helps us relax it helps us get stress-free it helps us sleep and what do those things do for our immune system right guys sleep stress right out of the gate so put some lavender and epsom salt get into a bath put some lavender in your diffuser and have a great night's sleep just put a drop on your pillow and have an awesome sleep it is just remarkable um peppermint vitality christina want to tell want to tell the fine folks about peppermint vitality and how we support our immune system i sure can i'd love to so peppermint i love peppermint um it is what i keep in my purse actually that's how much i love it this i don't leave home without it um it's invigorating it's energizing it's got that mint flavor to it um it is going to be good for focus and for cognitive function for me i use this for stuffiness and allergies so that is a go-to for me um lemon is the next one lemon is cold-pressed from a the rind of a lemon it tastes very lemony citrus it can enhance your food or water i like to make my lemon buttercream frosting with this um it also um can enhance anything so the key ingredient in thieves and ningxia red so it's in those as well really high in antioxidants and so if that means it's going to combat free radicals help support a healthy immune system things like that this is a citrus so the one word of caution is is you wouldn't want to apply it and go out in the sun um frankincense is the next one i love frank he saves me on so many times right um this is considered a holy anointing oil this has been around it's biblical it's been around forever has been used in religious ceremonies for thousands of years it is well known during the time of christ and was one of the gifts given to christ at birth um diffusing it is great for calming and grounding so this is one that i would diffuse this in a blend like when we're all cooking dinner at the end of the day to try to just bring everybody back down um it is also fantastic for your skin i keep this bottle in my bathroom and i directly apply right to my face especially with those like age thoughts that are starting to show um and it is wonderful in any wellness roller i will i'll kind of put this in almost anything that i make that has to do with skin or healing because it's just it just amplifies everything it's just so wonderful um thieves so thieves is fantastic this is the thieves vitality oh i almost dropped it um this is going to have your healthy immune system thieves is a proprietary blend for young living in it it has clove cinnamon bark rosemary lemon and eucalyptus so i always say this kind of smells like christmas to me you can add this into like your elderly syrup to make it even better for you or put it in a veggie capsule like these and add add a carrier oil and just swallow them and get it right inside of you like i said i diffuse this right now once a day at least to make sure that i just keep the home functioning as as healthy as i can um and i have a fun fact about thieves for you so the thieves essential oil blend was inspired by the legend of the four 15th century french thieves who formulated a special aromic combination composed of clove rosemary and other botanicals they used while robbing the dead and the dying so if you have a stash of thieves products oh pumps right here everybody can show their themes so thieves is the key ingredient in the thieves household cleaner which we talked about a little bit earlier today also all right the next one is the citrus fresh vitality so this is going to just be even more citrusy it has orange tangerine grapefruit lemon and mandarin and has a hint of spearmint so it is just it's a great blend to add to your water um it's full of those antioxidants and really can just help kick your immune system into high gear would be great in tea as well when you diffuse it it's very uplifting and fresh so this is one that i would diffuse in the morning to help us get going i love that one raven so this is a powerful blend um it has rev steri peppermint eucalyptus radia and other essential oils you can diffuse it or apply it to your chest i actually keep a rollerball on mine and i wear it as a perfume i help right now i feel like right now especially with the mask it has enough in it to help keep everything really fresh and help my airways stay open i'm an asthmatic so i love this it really helps a lot you can use it in a shower as well and kind of create that steam aroma so if you haven't tried this one i would recommend diffusing it because you will absolutely love it or just rolling it right on um die guys is in here this is my belly one um so this is all things tummy i remember it because it kind of is like digestion when you read it and so this is to help support a healthy digestive tract and immune system i am a um a gluten intolerant and so is one of my daughters and so this is one that i use if we ever get gluten and we have something that's really bad i will rub it on the outside you can also put a drop underneath your tongue or i just learned this really cool trick if you put it on your thumb and hold it to the roof of your mouth it actually gets even faster so next time that happens because it always does someday i'm gonna try that for that trick as well so there's your belly oil um you have pan away so this is a blend and this has wintergreen clove that h word i can't say well and peppermint that's a mouthful it's a mouthful i just can't seem to get my tongue around it um this is a stimulating aroma and soothing to the skin it is ideal to apply before and after any type of exercise so this is going to be if you have runners and you apply it to like your calves um or after a workout if your like biceps are really sore um is going to help to give them the support they need so they can recover from that workout pan away i don't know what's on valor so valor this is a wonderful wonderful blend a lot of people absolutely love valor i put this on myself before we started tonight with just doing a scent tent and rubbing it all over so this is um helps to balance your emotions you can inhale it you can also put it on your shoulders or the bottoms of your feet and it helps to support your emotional well-being it is um really considered like the liquid courage which is why i think it's in the kid power and also why a lot of people will use it before they're going to have a board meeting or they're jumping onto a zoom where they're talking or doing any of those kinds of things this is going to be that blend that will help support that for you it's very soothing and calming and it is really good for children so diffusing that at the end of the day or when you're having a really long hybrid day in front of the computer it helps i know it helps i do it and then you have two more oils so these i love peace and calming and stress away they do just that um peace and calming is wonderful if you diffuse it at night for sleeping um and also helps to kind of unwind at the end of the day so for me this is another while dinner starts to cook i will before i start dinner i start my my evening diffuser and this is one that i'll put in um and stress away i will put in as well but sometimes i used to use this even earlier in the day depending on how school is going um and this is they're just both wonderful blends to just truly ground you and bring you down and help you relax and get past the stress that's happening um and ningxia we talked about this but then you get these two packs of ningxia red and we did talk about it it is absolutely fantastic um i don't i don't know if i need to go into any more than that but i love it um this is the best it is it's just the best and the other two things that are in here are going to be 10 packets of your thieves hand sanitizer and your little grab and go i like to call it thieves cleaning spray [Music] yeah that starter kit is awesome so if you don't have it already which you do most likely because you're listening to this um it's just 165 plus tax free shipping the best value ever and that is also that starter kit's going to get you 24 percent off everything that we sell at young living including the things that i'm going to walk you guys through right now so um without any further ado we're going to beat ningxia red into your head tonight whether you like it or not because it is so amazing so again just kind of going back to um the whole antioxidant load 30 000 on that orac scale like that just when i read that my mind was blown it was just like oh my gosh that's incredible so obviously things i'm going to walk you through right now are things outside of the starter kit these are kind of like next level things level two things these are the powerhouses that are really going to fire up your immune system so you can have a strong barrier to all of the things that are coming at you on a daily basis so you can fight them off okay and one thing i do need to mention even though i am a nurse i cannot treat prescribe diagnose cure etc etc tonight is for information purposes only i said that a little late but you know it's in there at least there's in there so obviously ningxia red outside of the starter kit in your starter kit like christina just told you you're gonna get two packets of these but quite honestly guys if you're not buying the bottles you're spending a lot more money than you have to so what i prefer every single month we have an essential rewards kit and it's a four pack of the ningxia red bottles and then a 30 pack of the singles it is the best value per ounce okay and if you are a budget conscious person like we all are that is the game changer best value per ounce okay i promise you i did the math i crunched the numbers it is amazing the next thing that is awesome for your immune system is inner defense i call this the personal bubble okay because it really really is this contains thieves which we talked about which i spelt wrong in the slide please don't shoot me what i'm doing is completely distracted with my kids in my ear so this is this slideshow not did not go so well oregano and there's a there's a period there holy cow this is awful i'm going to delete this lead thyme and lemongrass okay this is a capsule of those oils now sure you could make that capsule of those oils but what i really find awesome about inner defense is that the capsule that it's made out of is designed specifically so it breaks apart and that specific area of your intestine where it's supposed to where it's going to be the most maximized effect okay um also if you make a veggie capsule of those oils you might taste it it might kind of come up a little bit and those are some powerful oils so you don't necessarily want to feel those coming up you know whether you're burping or whatever it just doesn't taste that great um the other thing about inner defense this is definitely one i have on hand in the winter time all the time i have actually multiple bottles because i always want to have extra on hand because when things do happen i want to have plenty of inner defense to kind of get us through that period so i like to take inner defense i don't take it every single day but if i'm feeling like i'm immune compromised or if i'm around people that may be under the weather or if i'm traveling if it's 2019 and i'm traveling or if i'm just kind of just not feeling right i'm not getting enough sleep i'll take one of these and it really kind of just boosts my immune system and the other cool thing this is free in october this is part of our monthly promotion in october with your 250 or 250 pv order you're gonna get free inner defense so i am pumped about that because that is one of the oils or one of the supplements that is like non-negotiable in our house next is life nine like christina was talking about earlier life nine is our probiotic life 9 is like it's got like 19 billion different bacteria it is super powerful it is awesome it is um it's it's it's been such i used to buy one on amazon i'm a religious believer in life nine i take it every single night before i go to bed you want to take it on an empty stomach and the other thing to remember if you're taking it with if you're also taking inner defense you want to space it out you want to take this at least eight hours apart and the reason is because the oils that are in inner defense might gobble up the good bacteria that's in life nine so it's kind of like a moot point if you're going to take them together you don't want to do that so you want to make sure that you're you're spacing them out um kid sense mighty pro this stuff is amazing awesome this is a prebiotic and a probiotic so the cool thing and you have to be a kid to take it okay so don't don't feel like oh i'm not a young one i can't take this mighty pro you certainly can this is such an incredible supplement this came out a couple of years ago it tastes like a pixie stick it's in a little little uh packet like this both of my girls love it they have very uh you know despicable taste so they they they know what they like and they absolutely love this stuff and the great thing about it being a prebiotic is that it's a type of fiber that the human body cannot digest and it serves as food for probiotics so prebiotics help promote beneficial bacteria by providing food and creating an environment where microorganisms can flourish which is what you want so this is awesome for the kiddos i give this to both of my girls every morning with breakfast they absolutely love it and it's been such a good good good supplement for their immune or their immune systems as well as their gut health mupro is a chewable tablet this one is wonderful it's made from the ningxia wolfberry and then a blend of mushroom powders a whole bunch of mushrooms that i cannot print out so i'm not even going to try in addition to zinc and selenium plus melatonin which what helps us sleep so i will take uh imupro at bedtime if i'm feeling immune compromised or if i'm feeling like i might be coming down with something or if i want to just get a good night's sleep because i know it's going to help benefit my immune system so it's really good it's kind of like i don't know like a berry flavor it's really really really good and i also will give this to my kids as well if they're kind of feeling under the weather before bedtime we have mighty bites so if you're if you're a mama or a dad or a guardian or a grandma or grandpa this is the children's multi-vite so this is an amazing multivite it's berry flavored it's um a nutrient-dense food-based superfruit plant and vegetable complex and it also has this organ fa which is the best source of natural folate available there's a lot of synthetic stuff on the market out there this is not synthetic at all it's 100 usda certified organic and there's absolutely no synthetics whatsoever super c so super c comes in two options chewable and tablets okay it contains 1440 percent of the recommended dietary intake of vitamin c per serving so not only is it fortified with rootin citrus bioflavonoids and minerals to balance electrolytes and enhance the effectiveness and absorption of vitamin c there's also essential oils in super c that may increase the bioflavonoid activity so vitamin c as we've probably heard over the last several months is one of the most important vitamins required by our bodies the ingredients in super c play a role in normal immune and circulatory functions help to strengthen connective tissues and promote overall health vitality and longevity and because our bodies cannot manufacture vitamin c we need to consume it as a supplement and you're not going to get what you need from your food even though i thought this for many many years there's just not enough food that you're going to consume over the course of the day to get what you need in your in your supplements and then but wait there's more super vitamin d this is the new kid on the block i cannot tell you how excited i was when this was released back in june at our international convention this is a highly absorbable vegan friendly and completely synthetic free vitamin d supplement it's mixed berry flavor and it's chewable so you actually dissolves and then you chew it so i give one to my each of my girls every single day we know that vitamin d supports bone health healthy muscles respiratory health and the respiratory immune system so we've also heard some things um over the last several months that many of the deaths that have resulted from the current situation many of those individuals were lacking in vitamin d so i don't know about you but that alone was enough to make me really start paying attention to the vitamin d that i was consuming in my body and it tastes good as well again both of my girls their their their palettes are very picky they enjoy the taste of this then we have kids since unwind so this is another brand new supplement that just came out show of hands again i can't see anything in the chat yet but if you like unwind give me a like a comment this stuff is awesome i am taking this every single night again i'm not a child nor do i play one on tv it is remarkable so the cool thing about the supplement it contains superstars like l-theanine 5-htp and magnesium that are must-haves for bringing a sense of chill when your energy is high so what are these amazing ingredients that i must have in my life why what's what's the big deal kristin l-theanine occurs regularly in nap and green tea it helps promote a sense of relaxation while helping to ease occasional irritability it also offers next day benefits helping to improve focus and mental clarity in the home and in the classroom does anybody have children that may have a little bit of an issue with focusing i do my second one is my wild child i've been giving this to her especially in school nights and it's really kind of helped take the edge off during the remote learning days i don't know about in school because i'm not there but it's been extraordinarily helpful for her to really kind of sit and focus and get her work done 5htp is another ingredient that's in unwind and that works synergistically with l-theanine 5-htp promotes a calm state and relieves occasional stress it also is kind of the precursor to releasing dopamine in your brain and that what that helps affect mood and regulate mood so if you're kind of dealing with some mood dips this could be extraordinarily helpful for you or somebody that you love and then of course magnesium that is naturally derived and necessary in over 300 metabolic reactions in the body magnesium plays a role in defending against occasional sleeplessness and may also bring a sense of calm to your environment so if you're dealing with any sort of sleep issues magnesium can probably certainly help a great deal and again also mood if you're um an adrenal person like myself where you're kind of running on a lot of stress here and there and you don't you don't manage it all that well unwind could be really helpful for you um one of our amazing um silver leaders kay cooney who you may know she developed the coolest mocktail it's called the katini and it's it's a packet of unwind it's two ounces of ningxia red seltzer and lime vitality one or two drops it is like the chill pill it is so good it is perfect for like that afternoon like when you're just you need to relax instead of reaching for like a cocktail get your katini and it'll just it'll it'll rock your world it's such an awesome awesome combination okay so those are the supplements and i'm just going to run really quickly through some powerhouse oils that i want to share and then we'll wrap it up and answer any questions that you have sound good okay so if i were to share with you every single essential oil that's good for immune support we'd probably be here all night so i'm going to just give you kind of the heavy hitters and then if there are other questions we can kind of answer those as well because there are quite a few of oils out there that are great for immune immune system support and the thing to remember is when you were looking at immune support you really kind of want to look at it um i'm just going to mute that person you might have done that already um you want to kind of look at it like diversifying your portfolio and the reason is because one sometimes our bodies become desensitized to oils or to things and they just don't work as well as they should or as they did in the beginning and the second is everybody's different so people like metabolize things differently so what works really well for one person may not work as well for another and vice versa so that's why we kind of throw a lot of stuff at you and you can kind of pick and choose what you want to use uh and incorporate into your um regimen okay [Music] there we go okay so powerhouse immune supporting oils oregano you've probably heard of oregano before oregano whoever is not just mute you got a little little cutie behind you um oregano is a powerhouse oil this one is fantastic you can make a roller like a wellness roller with some carrier oil and then roll it like on the soles of your feet or along your spine that's another fantastic place to get oils it also comes in a vitality oil so you can put it in a vegetable capsule like christina was showing earlier if you're feeling a little under the weather remember oregano is what is in inner defense so think about how powerful that might be i'm trying to stay compliant in my language it's very hard mu power so mu power is a combination of a whole bunch of oils it smells it's got some cumin in it it doesn't smell amazing but this is one that i bring out i call this one the big guns when we're really feeling under the weather so thieves is fantastic for immune support but immune mu power is like again incredible so again i'll put it make a wellness roller and roll it along my my girl's spine on the soles of their feet i will defuse that one as well it is fantastic and then robin sarah raven sarah is free this month as well this one is really known for respiratory immune support um this one is in raven so you can see why it's such a powerful oil it smells really nice and again like i said it's free this month with your 190 pv order so those are three again those are the tip of the iceberg of the oils that are great for immune support and like i said if you are already a member with us you've already gotten your starter kit but for those that may be watching the replay if you're not yet a member please circle back with the person that invited you to this call tonight and they can help get you started we really kind of covered the oils that are in the starter kit on the left here the premium starter kit with the diffuser um but believe it or not there's multiple ways you can get started we have several different starter kits that all kind of lead you to the place of wholesale pricing with young living so just depending on what your needs are we have several different options so and there's actually a ninja starter kit as well that i did not put on there again i did a horrible job making these slides so with that i think that's it oh and then last but not least if you are already a member which you are definitely definitely take advantage of our essential rewards program um it is the best way to shop and i mean i know that's an opinion statement but it really is you're gonna get rewarded for the things that you're buying on a regular basis all of the things that we talked about tonight you can put on your essential rewards order and for every every order that you place once a month you're going to get points back and free product you're going to get free gifts at 3 6 9 and 12 months it's just an amazing program so think about it like let's just say the target red card that gives you five percent back on your you know your your order when you order it this gives you up to 25 so it's really really remarkable and then you can cash those points in and buy free stuff and just pay for shipping it's really awesome and that is it i'm gonna stop the sharing of the screen and we can answer any questions that you guys have i'm gonna take a peek in the chat okay okay hold on how much ningxia red should we drink daily uh that's coming from michelle well the recommendations on the bottle are two to four ounces so it really depends on your personal needs and how how you're feeling um more than likely if you're if you need some extra support more is better but i typically go with two to four ounces so i'll do two ounces in the morning and then maybe another ounce or two in the afternoon if i make like a little mocktail with some seltzer just kind of depends and i give my kids two ounces especially during the school year a certain amount of product boy yeah let's mute somebody if you're not muted could you just mute yourself besides christina i want to know about overkill of too many products um again start low and go slow so like i necessarily if you're not using any of these right now i wouldn't just go buy them all and start using them remembering immune support is is um kind of you want to lead up to it so if you really really want to just start with something i would say go with nature red and life nine those are kind of the two core supplements that will get your foundation solid and then as you need others bring them in for example inner defense emupro um i'm super ct too that's another one that i would keep as in your foundation as well um because again you're not getting these things from your your diet i mean it's just unless you're eating massive amounts of fruits and vegetables you're just not getting them so i would say you know kind of obviously go with your what's based on your budget but ningxia red hands down absolutely life nine gut health everyone's got is is in the toilet super c fantastic that's just overall wellness i might even add vitamin d to that as well just because now that we're getting into the winter months we're not getting outside as much we're going to need a lot more vitamin d can i say something to you kristen please so what i found when i was trying to figure out how to get well was taking the individual steps i was able to truly assess okay this really worked and when that fixed things i could then determine what else needed tweaking so i started with the ningxia red and i saw this huge jump and i was able to finally feel like i could start to function again and from there i actually added the core to stop because for me um having inflammation and having stress was a huge deal and that was causing a lot of problems so i added that and then i've been able to get to a place where i feel like i'm i don't know 85 percent there where my body like i am able to stay up throughout the day i can function i'm not dealing with immense pain there was nine months of my life i wasn't allowed to pick up more than six pounds i mean what mother can't pick up sick i couldn't even carry a laundry basket it was insane i'm past all of that but if i had gone back then and done it all it would have felt so overwhelming i probably would have thrown up the towel and said this is too much so taking those steps getting the biggest bang for your buck and then tweaking it every month and that's another reason why that essential rewards is perfect because you can say you can reach out to somebody else on your team or me and kristen and say okay i'm starting to really i got these pieces of my health under control i really want you know my eyes are really fatigued because i'm always on there what can i take for that and so you start adding and tweaking in after that and you're just gonna see such a huge improvement and taking those steps yes what she said absolutely just starting listening to your body i think that is kind of that is kind of the pivotal thing because everybody is different and everyone's needs are different so um so really kind of playing around with that that was super super super helpful um let's see has anyone experienced facial breakouts with diffusing um i've not ever heard of that in my six and a half years with young living it could also be 17 years old hormones raging or toxins if you're eliminating the toxins from your home that could also be his body just releasing those toxins so again i don't know what your situation is but that those would be my my thoughts right out of the gate have him try the charcoal the charcoal yeah so i've i've added that to my daughter's um they're 10 and 12 so they're starting to get that acne for when you're little and that that charcoal bar is really helping really really helping to just pull the toxins out and then add some frank to it and he'd probably be good yeah definitely definitely that that um charcoal bar soap is fantastic um make a cow for relaxation if you're an adult certainly there's magnesium in there so absolutely um radical absorbance capacity well thank you jeremy and your wellness roller karen is asking so again i change it up a lot again i like to kind of switch it out but imu pro or thieves and summer oregano and maybe even just kind of replicating the oils that are in inner defense um frankincense like there's so many oils that are really really good for wellness and and immune support um but emu pro and these are kind of like my standard bases and then i kind of just add things based on what i'm feeling robin sarah good question okay the k drink recipe okay you ready a packet of unwind one or two ounces of ningxia red seltzer just plain bubbly seltzer and then a drop or two of lime vitality or whatever whatever vitality oil is calling it doesn't have to be lime per se but lime is just awesome okay candy great question i got my reverend sorry i noticed it says diffuse for three hours is there a problem if it goes longer no i diffuse until my diffuser shuts off so i think that's just kind of the standard recommendations three hours but we've never ever had an issue in all of the years that we've been diffusing a lot i diffuse like 500 users 24 hours a day yeah same never said but i'm home all day so they're just always going yes okay do you have to buy a certain amount each month um this is howard um is this with i'm guessing he's asking with essential rewards and the answer is your minimum is 50 pv a month to be on essential rewards and that equals usually about 50 ish dollars for the most part 50 pv and dollar and us dollar are about the same certain things are a little more a little less um but it's a 50 pv commitment but you can cancel at any time so just you know speak to whoever got you started with young living they can help walk you through that and then um help you kind of make a a plan a wellness plan so you can decide what you want to order every month so it makes sense for your budget and it also makes sense for your wellness can you talk about which supplements you can take at the same time in which you should not so like i had mentioned i wouldn't take inner defense and life nine together um otherwise i kind of just i just spaced my my supplements out just again so i'm not overloading my liver with everything um which i used to do because it was just easier but i've kind of learned that i want to kind of slow things down so um the only two that i would just say recommending to keep separate are inner defense and life nine do you recommend zyto override toby depends um they both provide good information so it just kind of depends on the on the person does the do supplement have enough d yes it does depends again it has a hundred it has 50 micrograms um per serving which is 250 of the recommended dose for vitamin d so all right any other questions i'm going to stop the recording", "_iZlOinl-40": "hello everyone welcome how are you all doing i hope you're all having an amazing sunday as usual it is very very very very hot today however i have a little cooling system going on that's going to try to cool me down a bit now we're going to be talking about collagen guys and you might be wondering what is this collagen about why do you know they talk so much about collagen collagen have a lot to do with how we age as we age our skin tend to lose it's elasticity it's also is what caused the skin to have wrinkles and fine lines and it's also what cause your joints to be like you know painful and not as flexible as you want them to be it is one of the most common protein that is found within the body so as we age that um the body actually produces its own collagen but as we age it tends to just slow down and that cause all the signs of aging not only on your skin by having the wrinkles and fine lines but also on your joints and your movements it affects a lot of things that we tend to do you know some people when they age like their fingers are you know not able to stretch out and all of that their feet and their knees and all of that starting to earth all of that could be the sign that the collagen has actually slowed down however today we are mostly going to focus on the skin and basically our overall health when it comes on to boots in our restoring collagen in both our body and our skin so if you're new welcome to the chat how are you all doing i can see someone here from brazil um ma christina the uh oxo c i think it's pronounced hello written a long time haven't seen or hear from you jason how are you doing magdalene how are you we have um diva roberts no sound um let me know guys if you are hearing the sound clearly and i'm hoping that you're hearing the sound let me know let me know let me know let me know are you all hearing somebody comment and let me know so um we have um brooks gilland from texas are you doing down there welcome to our moderator lucy who is here to weed out all the nasty and unnecessary comments and keep us in line and we also look hello every one welcome to all our new um okay please okay thank you for that tara carps how are you i came here uh i can hear you all right thank you so much hello karen mcdowell how are you welcome welcome welcome now if you're on the channel and you have any skin care regime routine whatever you call it going on and you are using any form of a collagen boots are feel free to comment now for me guys let me just take you a little bit about when it comes on to my skin with collagen booster i'm at the age where i personally is starting to see the sign of aging on my skin and for me to boots my collagen it's one thing that i make sure that i have within my skin care routine as a matter of fact most of the skin care products that i use on my skin contain some form of collagen properties because i am trying to keep my skin from getting flat you know more fine lines and wrinkles and i'm also trying to keep my skin to um looking firm so i use a lot of collagen mostly natural collagen products on my skin and that is the reason why i find that i tend to have less wrinkles and fine lines now we can apply collagen on our skin topically as well as we can eat our collagen the best way to be honest to restore the collagen is to eat the collagen so now you're asking what are you talking about eating collagen yes guys we have a lot of stuff out there on the market that you can actually eat or drink to boots collagen there are a lot of like supplements there's stuff like bone broth which you know is readily available in powdered form that you can mix to boost the collagen and that is basically a direct way of boosting the collagen however for me i find that eating certain kind of food is you know more rewarding in terms of boosting the collagen if you're a meat lover boots in your collagen is pretty easy because you can make your own bone broth at home that's little you know chicken bones and stuff like that that you might cut away from your chicken or your beef or your um pork when you're cooking you know some people tossed it while some people just use it to make a stock that stock you could actually drink because it contains um a lot of nutrients and and collagen boots and properties in it that is actually what they use to make the bone broth or the the collagen powder most collagen powder are made from scrapping of meat um whether it be red meat white meat pork meat whatever it is meat scrapping most collagen powder is made from that so you can actually whip that up in your kitchen for yourself while also if you are vegan how do you boot your collagen you will have to turn to green leaf vegetables and berries to boost the collagen one of my favorite um is blueberry i tend to swear by blueberry when it comes on to boots in the collagen production i like eating a lot of stuff with blueberry but be mindful because most things that you're going to find out there that contain blueberry might also have other um other things like iron carbohydrates that you might not want in your system too much is no good such as a blueberry muffin or a blueberry pie so i don't really do that i tend to put the blueberry in smoothies and i also like to just you know eat my blueberry just like that it's summertime i like to eat it frozen and that is loaded with a lot of antioxidant and collagen boots and properties another amazing food that you can eat and i'm gonna call it a fruit is it's controversial for me really it's pomegranate guys that is another amazing first of all any of your fruits that have bright red or bright purple color is always loaded with antioxidant that can help to boost the collagen production in the skin so you can have your pomegranate and personally i just like to eat the pomegranate like that i prefer to eat a fresh pomegranate than to go and buy the pomegranate juice but not everyone have access to the fresh pomegranate so get your pomegranate juice guys the most important thing when you're looking for your pomegranate juice is to make sure that it's not loaded with sugar so unsweetened pomegranate juice is best now for those of you who cannot drink these things without sugar then you can actually monitor the amount of sugar that you put in your pomegranate juice so you have blueberries you have pomegranate juice and nowadays guys they even have the pomegranate powder for you like your smoothies and stuff like that pomegranate and blueberry loaded with vitamin c that will help to boost the collagen production another thing that is really really good guys that sometimes we tend to overlook is herb when it comes onto herb like cilantro guys some people don't like a taste of cilantro some people do if you get some cilantro and you don't like the taste of it what you do you just cook with it put it in anything at all that you're making like yours chew to get the best benefit from it i like to drink a good cilantro tea and the reason for that is that i grew up using like cilantro and parsley and basil and stuff like that not necessarily a spice but as you know um bushes for tea so if you are looking to boot the collagen production in the skin and not only that if you're looking for circulation and stuff like that you can actually boil some cilantro tea and you can actually sit on it you can even boil some cilantro and put a little bit of mint leaving it if you go to a good iron spa sometime they have this serving and you put a little mint in it and you chill it and you can actually drink that as a matter of fact for those of you who like to have your cold lemon water right throughout the day load it up with cilantro or even some parsley but the cilantro contain more collagen boots and properties than the the parsley so those are some of the things that you can actually um eat or drink to help to boot the collagen production in the skin if you have any question on what we just talked about or if you have any other fruits or vegetables that you tend to to eat um for boots in your college and feel free to comment all right so um agg 30 what about the juice and i am assuming that you're talking about the cilantro juice or the parsley juice or pomegranate juice the pomegranate juice is very very good blueberry juice is good too but

carrington welcome is dry blue blueberry good um as well as tobago all right so dry blueberries guys yes dried blueberries is good okay um especially especially when it is um professionally done what it does is that it's lock the the the nutrients in without you know it's um evaporating however anything fresh is always better but you do have some of the properties that remained when it's dry because what happened the drying process is that it's just shrink it like shrink it without it escaping without the nutrients really escaping from it so you can still get um um a good bit of the nutrients from your dry blueberries or even your dry fruit as a matter of fact drying your fruit is a way of preserving your fruit when you find it in abundance okay so if that's all you have access to it is still good wake it up by pouring some water on it cover it and let it um sit in the water for a couple hours and it's gonna plump whatever dry fruit you have that with water will plump it up or some people tend to use a little bit of a warm water to basically wake the fruit up and make it be more you know i personally prefer to freeze than to dry okay unless it's like dry orange peel and stuff like that and dry but if i have a choice i would prefer to freeze my stuff than to dry but dry fruits is good and still contain all the essential nutrients and vitamins now if you're just

days as a matter of fact i was saying i think i was saying this last week that more people are now looking younger than back then and the reason for that is because of technology where we can now share with each other some of the things that we're doing are simply simple recipes and simple ingredients that they can use to have their skin and to have their entire bean and a hole looking younger and fresher one of the best way to have your face especially to look younger is to boost the collagen so that's why we are here telling you how to restore the collagen and we're not only telling you how to restore the collagen topically on the skin we're also telling you how to restore the collagen from a health point to healthy point of view so we talk about foods and we talk about things that you can eat to boost the collagen one very important vitamin that will have to boost collagen guys is vitamin c whether you're going to use it topically on the skin or you are going to just you know drink it up take some vitamin c tablets or just you know enjoy vitamin c on a hole there's this fruit guys some of you might have access to it and some of you might not and that is the kiwi the kiwi tend to contain more vitamin c than the orange itself if you're looking to restore collagen like really really fast try to eat up some kiwi you know they said a couple a day keep the doctor away a kiwi a day will give you a full dose of your daily vitamin c some people like kiwi some people don't i like kiwi i just don't like when i get the sour one and you can also use the kiwi on your face topically so definitely guys that's one fruit if you have not yet been you know having it into your daily fruit collection that's one food that you can start eating and um you can challenge yourself when it comes on to the vitamin c now when you come on to applying vitamin c to the skin topically there are several different kinds and different ways of um of means of getting vitamin c you can use natural vitamin c on the skin number one vitamin guys for collagen um is vitamin c and vitamin a which is two but i'm gonna break it down everyone need vitamin c okay vitamin a have to boost collagen more so for you know a more mature skin but we'll get to that now when it comes on to the vitamin c vitamin c is a very very tricky vitamin guy very very tricky and you could go out there and you could buy some vitamin c for your face and by the time you're ready to use it it have no form of a potency because when it is exposed to like sunlight and all of that you lose all of that and that's why you might now find vitamin c on the market in the form of a powder if you have to use vitamin c on your skin topically especially if you're all you know doing all the natural stuff guys the best vitamin c to buy for your skin topically is it in the powder farm and the reason for that is you can just mix it right before you use it and you can choose to make that the vitamin c powder if you have access to it and you can add a little bit of vitamin e oil olive oil coconut oil you can make it your own mix it up and there you have your vitamin c with all you know the the with all the the the electrolytes which we're not getting into that you could compound that make up vitamin c intact and you'll get the best benefit for your skin now everyone need the vitamin c if you're in your 20s 30 40s up 50s guys go vitamin c always always use a bit of vitamin c on your skin that is going to clear the skin of hyperpigmentation and help to boost the collagen you can buy your vitamin c in the market the pharmacy wherever now if you want to go natural like i personally like to go vitamin c you're going to get from the same blueberry that i just mentioned the same pomegranate that i just mentioned you can actually do i have a wonderful by um blueberry facial mask on my channel and this morning i actually made myself a blueberry facial mask it is really really good and blueberry is good to use on the skin topically also when it comes on to the citrus fruit you have lemon you have um orange you have grapefruit all of that is great with vitamin c natural guys i prefer to use the peel all of what i just mentioned because the peel do contain more of the vitamin c than the flesh of um of any of the citrus fruit itself so lemon guys i find myself peeling my lemon some people might be like no i can't peel the lemon it's too small but if you really want some good lemon zest which is loaded with vitamin c peel your lemon put it to dry you can even get lemon zest um powder to buy an amazon you can get the orange beer too but you know it's nice to make it for yourself so you don't have to run and go and buy lemon powder or you know orange powder so just peel your lemon before you use it i know sometimes we like to see the peel of the lemon in our drink because it give it a nice presentation but it's all for just presentation but peel the lemon put the peanut brown paper bag or if you're like me most of the time if you go in my kitchen you'll see me adding orange peel lemon peel just adding it to dry when it's dry you just stay it out you blend it you can blend it and put in a bottle with a tight cover and you can keep that in your refrigerator for months six seven eight months once it's dry the trick when you have the lemon or the orange or the grapefruit peel guys is to take that powder form add your favorite oil to it so you could add like olive oil coconut oil almond oil cover it tightly in that lemon or orange zest put it in a dark place in your um pantry or wherever under your bed anywhere in your house is dark leave it there for a week or two and then you take it out and that is what you're going to use as your vitamin c as natural as it gets on your skin amazing for clearing the skin if you have hyperpigmentation on the skin that's gonna have to clear the skin of hyperpigmentation for those of you with acne prone skin are large pores you're gonna tip a little bit of a tea tree oil in it and you're gonna use that on your skin it's gonna get the job done and it's gonna clear the skin but you gotta use it on a regular and you can take that vitamin c oil that you make and then you can add it to your homemade remedies you can even add a little to your store-bought body lotion guys just add a little bit of vitamin c and use that lotion all over your body it's amazing and that's easy as it gets when it comes on to making your own vitamin c at home all right let's take some question and then we are going to move on if you're just joining us a warm welcome to you we're talking about restoring collagen in the skin we're telling you how to eat right to restore the collagen and now we're talking about vitamin c which is one of the most important vitamin when it comes out to boost in collagen production we talk about where you can you could actually buy or you can make it your own and that's where we are if you have a question feel free to comment rita with it add acne scars you bet it will perfect for acne scars another thing that this vitamin c remedy is good for guys is the dark on the eye circles for those of you with dark under eye circles if you make that one for yourself and you tip a little bit of a vitamin e oil and use it under your eyes use it for a month and see watch your dark circle disappear now a month yes the reason why we are saying a month because all of these things that we're using are natural they're no preservative and there's no added acid that is going to speed up the process no added chemical per se for instant result although some things do give instant result like turmeric powder give instant result okay so we are taking some questions and then we're gonna continue talking about boots and collagen in the skin and regardless of your age if you are in your 20s let me tell you something start taking care of your skin when you start to take care of your skin at the early age when you get to my age your skin take up before and after picture do you notice some people posting they were they had a thing going on on instagram recently where they put a picture um and i think they was doing like either 10 or 20 years ago and do you notice how some people um 20 years ago oh they looked like really really old compared to how they look now you know why that is is because people are more exposed to things ways of me and means of taking care of their self and simple things used to be years ago and way back then that some things are only for so-called rich people but nowadays everything is for everyone because of technology i can basically tell you how to make your own vitamin c at home and you can actually use it on your skin and see amazing results while before you definitely would have to go and buy it and try to figure out you know how to get vitamin c for your skin hello holly say how are you doing uh michelle um currantan i have lemon grapefruit and orange essential oil can they be used also yes they can be used but i want you guys to know that there's a big difference between natural oils and essential oils there is a there's a total a different process of making the essential oils and the natural oil as a matter of fact and don't get scared guys i'm just going to say that essential oil is not really really all for say you understand what i'm saying is added um added things to it but oil you know natural oil is natural oil i do not recommend applying any form of essential oil on your skin directly maybe just maybe tea tree oil to pot to to to put on um severe acne skin just maybe tea tree oil okay essential oil our oily concentrated and they are designed to mix with other oils so if you have essential oil get yourself some almond oil which is a good carrier oil get yourself some coconut oil some olive oil or even some my favorite grape seed oil and to every tablespoon of the carrier oil all you need is two drops of the essential oil once you do that you mix it out and then you can use it on your skin okay so they're all good but you need to dilute them um further but personally i prefer to use essential oil mostly for um you know fragrance and stuff like that okay so um you're not gonna like tea tree essential oil do contains anti um bacterial um properties like lavender essential oils you know some of these oils are good but you can also find out there nowadays like the floral essential oils and some of these oils are mostly geared toward you know you know using in your particularly and stuff like that so be mindful and i actually i'm actually in the process of um learning about essential oils to be honest um i'll tell you a little bit more about it really i'm trying to educate myself and how you know the different essential oils um the properties and exactly what they tend to go well with when you mix them and all of that so you know guys very soon you will be learning from me like you know um definitely more um about essential oil and how to use them correctly all right so let's take another question and then we're gonna continue talking about boosts in collagen production in the skin nancy chichi i bless the lord for you i've learned a lot from you thank you so much for that jajeta hello tg do you know why even when i wash clean my face daily i still have dead skin coming out from under my nose yes under your nose i'm assuming that you're not saying you know inside your nose you are talking about maybe right here and a lot of people tend to have this issue because right here um most time when you're cleaning your face you see that because the nose is creased right here you don't get to properly exfoliate that area and it's not being cleaned properly sometimes you tend to look at some people's face and i'm gonna just do mine like this right and not everyone can do this some people if they try to push their nose and i'm assuming this is where you're talking because i know a lot of people on top of your nose on the top of the nose like right here you um it's okay if it's on the top of your nose like right here and you find that you have dead skin cell actually that's because your nose is dry your nose is dry right there so it's gonna seem like it's peeling off and also you might have um um the pores and the right there might be producing um a lot of sea buns and grease and dirt you gotta exfoliate it if you say you exfoliate but you got to spend more time exfoliating and when i was um dead advised not to do this but i still believe in this where you take your finger and you push your nose up right like this and most people if you try to do it they're not they're going to tell you that's not good because you know you're squeezing up your face you know but if you take your finger and you push it up like this for most people you're gonna see all white heads and stuff like that coming out what i would suggest that you do you do that squeeze your nose and then you exfoliate your nose when you're exfoliating your face you gotta pay attention use something with a fine granule i would suggest rice rice is good use rice you could just make a nice garage space blend into a powder and exfoliate your nose try it this week and see what happens rice powder and dip a little bit of your favorite oil in there only your nose you're gonna focus on that part of your nose that is peeling out exfoliate your nose when you are and another thing that is good for your skin with that nose carrying on like that is to steam it how could i forget that you need to steam steam first and then you do the exfoliating and do that just two times next week and come back and tell us if it look a little different i'm almost sure that it's gonna look good and definitely be careful of what you use on your skin sometimes what you use you might have combination skin where you find that you the product that you use on the rest of your face might not be too gentle or too good for your nose area so be mindful of that but try the steaming squeeze it out if things is coming out and do a little rice um and oil exfoliating for the week and see what happened and moisturize your nose okay all right so oh your face is always peeling okay see see what i mean you need to steam you definitely need to to steam your face and be mindful of what you're using on your skin whatever it is that you are using that whatever it is that you're using at your level on moisturizer on your skin take a check at that you might also have um sensitive skin nancy um mater skin can you you're uh um awesome love you i'm from kenya east africa what do cows milk do when you apply it to the skin all right cow's milk contain lactic acid okay let's get it clear cow's milk directly from the cow okay gotta go through a process all right it's gotta go through the process and the process is where they tend to the condensing of the milk and blah blah blah blah blah i do not suggest that you get cow's milk fresh from the cows and use it directly on the skin because you just never know anyway but definitely cold milk is actually regular milk okay well i say it now milk is from cow all right however and the reason why i'm saying this guys because a lot of people are not aware that the milk that you buy in the grocery store is cow's milk okay you do have goat milk and you do have buffalo milk and um what are the milk they have i don't i don't know but right now i know they have cow's milk buffalo milk and also goat milk and then you have the the nuts like the almond milk and all of that but the and i'm if i'm wrong guys correct me most of the younger generation are not aware that the milk that they buy in the grocery is cow's belt if you think i'm wrong correct me guys but that as i that is something that i actually recently learned that a lot of people younger generation don't know that anyway cow's milk yes cow's milk is milk so when i make a video and i share to use milk fresh milk that is cow's milk contain lactic acid vitamin a a bit of a vitamin c amazing for the skin especially for diana i think with peeling skin milk is awesome and and also yogurt which is derived from cow's milk okay so milk is good with tomato that is one that is gonna clear the skin of hyperpigmentation milk which is the same color milk is actually great to use with green tea milk is good to use to mix with your fullest heart milk is good to mix with your clay mask milk is good to just use directly on the skin to wash your skin what milk also can do to your skin if you wash your skin with milk it's gonna have to exfoliate the skin and i used to use a lot of products with milk okay there's this company as a matter of fact i have some right behind me right now i haven't used them for a while but i need to use them all before they get full then milk rice is good and guess what in the olden days or even now some people used to think milk but just load the bathtub with milk and sit in it for a couple of hours and come out with their skin looking younger and fresher if i have money and let me not say if i have money because it's really a waste to just you know use up all that milk but if milk was like you get the same properties from milk and it wasn't coming directly from the cow and i could pull a bathtub and sit in there with milk i would do it because i'm amazing for the skin all right guys we were talking about people who might not be aware that and milk also is good to boots collagen it contains a vitamin a and it's also very very good to drink but not excess okay because it also contains high in cholesterol all right so but topically on the skin the way to go adventure seeking artists hello i'm 30 years old and i've been trying to figure out what would be the best thing to use for my skin what would you suggest to use to get rid of this dry spot on my forehead you need a skin care routine whether you're going to use your homemade stuff or you're going to go and you're going to buy some stuff to use on your skin i suggest that you exfoliate your skin at least twice per week and use a mild exfoliator you can use a rice exfoliator if you're using one of mine or one of my brown sugar exfoliator or you could go to the store and buy a facial scrub and preferably preferably a facial scrub that have some form of a fruit like with a peach or a grapefruit facial scrub they have um a lot of like um i think they call it clean um clean i think that's the brand name clean and you also have the ordinary those are some amazing facial scrub for your skin once you scrub your face twice per week you are also going to try to use a facial mask at 30 years old a facial mask that is rich in vitamin c you're not really need

some of my homemade remedy or you can get a good facial mask in the the store you can also use some hydraulic acid on your face you can choose to buy that or you can choose to to to get the hydraulic acid powder you can get it on amazon as a matter of fact i think i'm going to share a video with you guys how to make that and you can use that on your skin to have your skin looking good make sure to moisturize your skin a.m and pm and also make sure to use a facial toner not the facial estrogen okay your toner does not contain um alcohol so get a good facial toner and if you want to buy go buy one if not use one of mine make a green tea fish on my um toner or a matcha facial toner and spritz that on your skin and use it green tea put a little aloe vera gel in it and a little touch of vitamin e shake that up and you spritz it on your skin and you're good to go but the most important thing for your skin is vitamin c so make sure when you're buying your facial products they do

coming out with spinach and it is also good for acne prone skin what you need to do to put a twist on it is just to drop two drops of tea tree oil or two drops of lavender oil to it so you can actually wait for that or i have a a bit of a video um in the title that contain acne skin so definitely um search for those but most ingredients that have antibacterial properties is good for acne prone skin okay all right so we are moving on kimura um stroke um skincare routine for lifeline um facial massages and clay masks definitely use a clay mask at least once per week when i try to get up

when you massage your face your boots and the circulation you can actually just wash your face and just get a good oil oil that is suitable for your skin if you have dry skin use a more heavier oil if you have um combination skin use you know in between oil and if you have oily skin you can use oil such as grape seed oil which is a lighter oil and massage the skin now we're going to talk about um vitamin a guys vitamin a is a the perfect vitamin or it is the vitamin that is going to boost collagen production especially on mature skin this is not only going to boost the collagen production but it's going to keep your skin just looking radiant and firm looking i use a lot of vitamin a products in my um skincare remedies because i'm at the age where i need to you know have my skin looking fresher and clearer now for anti-aging purposes guys vitamin a vitamin a vitamin a now how do you get this vitamin a you can actually get your vitamin a from dark leaf vegetables that is the easiest way to get it so eat it up guys you are not only you don't need only to apply things to your face topically you need to eat up those vitamins also okay eat up the vitamins guys so that you are shining from inside out when your system is clean your skin is going to look good also do you notice sometimes you tend to just break out some people like when they eat certain kind of food i know this girl when she eat ice cream she break out some people when they eat eggs they break out and stuff like that so definitely whatever you eat the skin is the largest organ guys and it actually is on your body to purify everything so whenever you eat things and your system is reacting to it it tends to show on the skin so definitely green leaf vegetables spinach guys i made a spinach facial mask and i also eat the spinach i am now trying to you know eat more spinach by putting it in like smoothies and stuff like that i know some people don't like the taste of spinach but when you're trying to take care of yourself sometimes it's not all about the taste there's a lot of things that i don't like to taste and i still eat it because i know it is good so definitely eat up your spinach vitamin a we're back to vitamin a in terms of boots and collagen i'm gonna give you a list of facial oils that contain vitamin a tested proven and you know it's really really good to boots collagen topically on the skin the top of the line vitamin a oil which is now like the biggest thing out there in the skincare world is this dark black looking oil called the the patchy oil and i don't even think i have it here with me today i should have bring it but it's probably somewhere upstairs batchy aisle guys they are now calling this batch oil the new alternative to retinol and you all know well not all but most of you might be familiar with retinol that retinol when your skin start to look a certain way then you start to use it to smooth wrinkles and fine lines now this batch oil i have been reading about it well more than a year ago but i didn't want to come on my channel even though the skincare world and the skin care market out there have already done their research on this oil i want to try it for myself so i bought it don't really really like how it look because it's really thick it reminds me of castor oil but i use a carrier oil with it and i've been using it on my skin and after i started using on my skin i realized that this thing actually worked like yeah it actually worked so that is when i started to drop in on my channel about this batch oil i talk about it in one of my um friday let's start skincare with chichi beauty which is a series that we are that i kind of start because the timing was bad but i actually i'd like that series which i might bring it back um and then i start to you know make a few of my natural remedies using it but it is amazing guys it really works and what i'm mixing this batch oil with is the natural hydronic acid um powder and it's when you mix it to turn into a gel and just you know put it back anyway i think i'm going to share that with you guys but i was a little skeptical some of you might not have access to the the hydratic um powder but anyway get the batch oil use a carrier oil with the battery oil okay so get the carry the battery oil and tip a little bit of best grape seed oil and just make it your own or make your own facial oil i have several videos on the channel you making your own anti-aging facial oil for your skin vitamin a rich these are like some nojo facial oil and very soon guys my shop is gonna be open alex maxie and i'm gonna be having my own personal anti-aging facial oil blend coming to you guys so that is in the work so stay tuned for that and if not just look at my channel in the meantime because it's going to contain basically all the ingredients and some of these that i post on the channel so i'm in the testing process and it's really good all natural oils all natural oil the same oils that we just whip up on the channel is the same set of oils that we're putting in and shaking it up the only difference is that it's going in with a percentage amount and you're going to use it on your face to look younger so the battery are guys the next oil that i really like and contains um a wide amount of a high amount of vitamin a is rosy oil and that is common to most people the rose it all contains vitamin a guys now roses oil not roses guys i get this a lot a lot of people think that rosehip oil is actually from rose petal no it's a big difference guys so don't go and buy rose oil thinking you're using rose in oil rose oil is from the petal rose if oil is from the rose seeds okay rose seeds is what they make the roasted oil out of and that is loaded with vitamin a and it also contains vitamin c and that is why even more than the bottle or the rose oil is a more all rounder oil okay and you can use the rosette oil directly on the skin or you can mix it with other oils to use to boost the color and produce for production it's actually a good oil to use topically on the skin not only on your face and your neck but on your entire body if you have rosie oil you could pour a little in your body lotion and shake that up and you are good to go vitamin a rich okay all right so we are going to move on to another oil that actually have a little bit more another little bit talk more than 100 times vitamin a than the rosin oil but it's a little on the pricey side i don't use it a lot on my channel but it's actually very good and that is the kake oil and that is actually a oil that they made out um from this cafe plant that this only grow in certain region like in the amazon somewhere out there in the amazon that plant can only um come in that area that kind of a climate and it's the kake oil you know before they discover their batch oil and how well it is where retinol is concerned the k was right on the top of the list for boots in collagen and for aging skin for mature skin so it's right below the cocaine oil right below the battery oil when it comes on to retinol properties but it's amazing guys it is really good so just think about mixing a high concentration of batchy oil cookie or roasted oil with a little bit of a grapeseed oil and i'm almost giving you what my oil blend is gonna be so guys guys do your research do your research if you are not even buying what i'm telling you okay but definitely these oils are good for boots and collagen some people are gonna be like i do not like to use oils on my skin i'm going to tell you why everyone need to use oil on the skin they know the the skin do for the body produces oil your skin produces oil that is what they call the sebum okay now what this oil does is that it keeps the skin hydrated it's keep the skin firm and looking really really good now for some people their skin produced too much and that's how you get oily skin when your skin is oily the skin is producing too much the skin is thinking that your skin is not um need to be hydrated so it produces more and it gives you this oily skin when you have dry skin it means that your skin is not producing the amount of oils that you need on your skin for combinations can it mean that some place on your skin is producing oil the skin is thinking that hair is too dry our hair is too and need more oil and so on and so forth that's all your skin get whether oily dry or combination why do you need to use oil on the skin it have to balance the amount of oil that the skin produces if you have oily skin you use oil on the skin it balance the oil that mean your skin think that your skin is already hydrated so it's not going to produce more oil if you have dry skin and you use the oil on your skin it's going to help the skin to know that okay your skin is moisturized if you have combination skin is the same quick tip guys and some of you might not know this but some of you would like oh i don't like to use oil on my skin 99 of your facial moisturizer contain at least 40 oil and sometimes 60 oil okay so please bear that in mind when you are going to tell yourself that you don't like to use oil on your skin if you do not like to use oil on your skin a quick and easy way to make your own moisturizer is to drop you know take a quarter cup of your favorite oil this might seem a little much you know but it's you know you're gonna blend this thing you drop an ice cube in it and you blend it out so you're adding water that's how they make a moisturizer anyway okay it's not ice cream ice cube that they use they use a form of acid which is going to get it too creamy just like how you make mayonnaise with the egg and all of that so you get your oil you put ice cube in there and when you blend that oil it's going to come out looking like a cream more so like mayonnaise and that's the way you can use your oil if you don't like to use oil directly on the skin but you need to incorporate oil oil is really really good because your moisturizer is going to contain oil anyway okay all right so boots in collagen production we are moving on really impatient about the launching of your brand i know jason it's

conversation and to all the members of the channel i am trying to actually arrange a zoom a zoom call with you guys very difficult extremely difficult because everyone time is different so i think i'm actually gonna use this platform the one that you guys really have to pay and figure out a way that members could actually have this one-on-one without actually having to pay okay so all of that is coming um in the work we also guys we're also going to be launching some classes and you know if you're watching and you want to be a part of some of these classes you can join in we're going to have different different classes we're going to have like class and it's all a part of youtube um stuff that they launched that we have well my channel have to take part in so we're going to have classes like teaching about certain things and this way we also couldn't gonna have like some group for my you know older subscribers where we could actually talk freely about like menopause and stuff like that in these group um rooms the the only thing is that you have to pay for it and as i said i am the person that will decide on the price and you know we'll bring that up very soon so all of these exciting things are coming up all right guys if you're just joining us today we talk about boots restoring collagen in the skin we talk about a lot of things we talk about things that you can eat to restore the collagen such as blueberries pomegranate we also talk about herbs such as um cilantro we also talk about um what else we talk about where food is concerned um i don't even remember um some of the food we we talked about um things that you can apply topically to the skin oh we talk about um collagen powder and collagen supplements to boost the collagen we also talk about vitamin c whether you're gonna you know apply topically or you're gonna actually um drink it eat it put it in your smoothies how to preserve vitamin c to boost the collagen we talk about vitamin a which is a rich source of collagen booster especially on mature skin and i think we'll talk about some other things that um you can actually rewind and watch over the chat if there's an area that you um that you were interested in that you miss the best os guys that you're gonna use with your special oils the special oils are the oils rich in vitamin a and vitamin c like the um the the rosen oil the cacao and the baci oil the best oils to chase those with are olive oil grapeseed oil coconut oil i totally forget to talk about avocado guys that is one thing that you know if you like the taste of avocado you can eat that avocado avocado is great for your skin whether you eat it or you use it topically on the skin rich in vitamin a rich in omega-3 guys it's like a complete reaching all the electrolytes that is good for your skin um internally and externally okay guys so definitely eat up the guacamole put your avocado on your toes and leave a little slice of it to mix up with some yogurt or use it directly on your skin okay one thing that is good to use directly on the skin avocado it's going to nourish the skin hydrated skin for those of you out there with dry skin especially dry mature skin get yourself some avocado no avocado get yourself some avocado um oil avocado oil is amazing i use a lot of avocado i like to use the avocado oil to make my salad dressing i made my own salad dressing guys i'm really really good at it i probably should start bottling it avocado oil guys so you can get the avocado oil to buy in your grocery store readily available if here's a little trick guys here's a little trick if you live somewhere and you do not have access to all these fancy special oils that i'm talking about like the battery or the k oil and you know the rosette oil and all it have the one oil that you can use to substitute all of that is the avocado oil and the avocado oil is going to sell like a regular oil well depending on some brand because the other day i went in the grocery and i saw this brand which i won't say name and they have like about an eight ounce of avocado oil and it was 17 and i'm like oh my goodness look like this other car that's growing a different planet or something because i don't understand just to buy a label so be mindful guy you could depending on where you live you could get avocado out for 2.99 okay so once it's um once it's um um first press cold press avocado oil it's avocado okay and make sure that it's not mixed with another oil because some brands are doing that too like they mix the avocado on with a cheaper oil and then they label it avocado oil so be mindful when you turn over the back of it it should say 100 pure avocado oil and you're gonna buy the food grade avocado oil if you go on like amazon sometime you're going to see some avocado oil and they're going to say for cosmetic cosmetic purposes it's not food grade when you're searching for avocado oil to use on your skin as a matter of fact any of these oils like the olive oil and all that and the almond sweet almond oil by the food grade okay that means you could use it on your face and you could cook with it okay so that's what i do so be very careful read the labels guys when you are buying your oils especially for your skin it needs to be 100 pure i said if you ever gone to the grocery store and you buy like a bottle of olive oil and instead of big old olive oil on it and when you get home and you turn it over you realize that it's like on olive oil mixed with like canola oil if that ever happened to you guys um let me know let me know or have you ever gone to the grocery and you pick up a jug of pomegranate um not pomegranate um what's the other one um what's the other one the other one that you use cranberry have you ever picked up a bottle of cranberry juice and it said a big old cranberry on the top of it and when you go home and you turn it over it says mixed with pear juice and mixed with orange juice like it's not pure cranberry the same thing with oils guys so be careful when you buy your eyes especially when you're going to use them on your skin to make sure that it is pure whatever oil you're buying pure coconut oil for pure olive oil pure um grape seed oil pure almond oil and the sweet almond oil is another trick guys so be very careful when you buy your sweet almond oil all right guys so juliana eats um avocado almost every day now tell me where you get that for right now i'm just seeing some really not so good avocado in the store right you know i love me some avocado too um tara um taran how are you love avocados cynthia wallis i'm allergic to avocado and that's another thing to guide some people might be allergic to some of the stuff that we share so always make sure whatever you're using or

that's the way you actually support the channel by becoming a member norma norma cook hello well justina i love what you're teaching us today please continue justina from um zambia and welcome to the chat lauren um lorraine um hoggins does tumor reporter have to kill dead skin cells now turmeric powder actually help there's no such thing as um killing dead skin cell what you do you remove dead skin cells what happened to your skin is that it shines like if you see like a lizard or a crocodile and they tend to after a while you see like your skin is peeling the same thing happened to us the same thing happened to the human skin it's just that it's not that not visible with the naked eyes however when it gets a little severe some people might start to see like it's flaking like for dry skin people you see it like it peeling that is when it's severe but if you should take a microscope and you should look like on your pillar or on your bed sheet you will notice that your skin do shed at night not to gross anyone out and that is what is called dead skin cell in the skin get rid of the dead skin cell naturally however when you want your skin to look more brighter and more radiant you actually help the skin out by exfoliating the skin and that is where facial scrub and facial exfoliator come into play that is even where rubbing your skin with your regular washed rod come into play when you rub your skin you're exfoliating the dead skin cells when you find that your armpit is a little smelly that is all because all of that dead skin cells and sebum and perspiration build up on the deer and you gotta exfoliate if you exfoliate your armpit just the way you exfoliate your body for those of you with eye body odor it's going to cut down on all of that cell with scent because the the skin is going to be clean and free of the dead skin cells turmeric powder is not going to get rid of the dead skin cell unless you add the tumeric powder to something with some form of a granule like some rice or some brown sugar however what the turmeric powder actually does it's it's it contains skin bleaching properties that will help to lighten and brighten the skin so if you want your skin to look radiant and glowing you put that turmeric powder in some brown sugar or some rice and you rub it over your skin leave it on for 30 minutes and you rinse it off and reveal beautiful skin okay i hope i explained that um clearly and you get the gist of how we do these things all right so we are oh my time is up oh my goodness i can't believe my time is up so guys i mean i'm gonna

loses it lost the city and that is when you start to see sagging skin that's when you start to see wrinkles and fine lines on the skin and also when you start to see your neck looking a little creepy and your ants are not looking full all that is collagen collagen is a protein as a matter of fact the most abundant protein in the body but after a while guess what in the body kind of not produce the amount you want to look younger so what you do you help your body out by you know by taking collagen in or applying collagen topically to the skin so that your skin could look fresh and younger as if

right um lil learning um caldo can i use any of your seven-day mass up to one month on a daily basis definitely it's not recommended that you use mask on a daily but there are some masks that are so mild that you can use them on the skin daily like the mask that i'm going to be sharing um either tomorrow choose i think it's going to be post with the parts with the um spinach leaves you can use that on the skin daily you can use masks that contains like yogurt on the skin daily those are good and most time if you can use them daily i would say yes you can use them daily on the skin but um no need you can use a mask every other day on the skin and you're going to get the same result as if you're using it every day um brenda how to get rid of the frown lines and funny enough someone asked that quest r did i go back um far back okay different question to get rid of the deep frown line the the what i suggest is to use a clay mask anything that is going to tighten the skin when you apply it on your skin pack it in the area where the deep corners like here make sure you put extra there let it dry on the skin rinse it off and then you're going to take a good oil preferably on with vitamin a such as the rosehip oil and you're going to use it to massage the area and you're going to just miss out put your two finger in the crease lift and all and you can repeat this about 20 times and you can do this every day give it a month at the end of the month you're going to see a huge decrease in the front line really really works it's just that you really have to do it you don't have to do the mask every day two to three times a week for the mouse is good or even twice per week but the massage daily daily to decrease the frown life and you can also make sure to practice to eat some food rich in collagen such as your spinach leaves you know it's going to have to boots you know the the the the circulation and get rid of the front line but i swear by the misogyny and a good clay mask or skin tightening mask or even some oatmeal blending to a powder or even the rice and you know let it dry whatever mask you're going to use you let it dry on the skin brook um oh um all you use prickly cactus oil or tomato oil i have been using for several weeks and love it now um this was a friend of mine that actually introduced me to the prickly cactus oil and that was to put in my hair so i've never really used it on my face the tomato oil i have not yet tried i know of it i've not tried it and i'm gonna get it and i'm gonna use it and i'm gonna come back and tell you guys if i like it or if i don't like it or what i think it's good for first i'm gonna try it as an exfoliator so definitely um so definitely i will come back and give you a comment on that but the prickly um the prickly cactus i heard is very good and i actually love using it in my hair but i have not yet tried on my face all right diana edwards good day i'm not seeing where to click to join um to become a member i think it's somewhere below the video or if you click on my face below the video it's going to take you to the channel page and on the channel page you're going to see the word subscribe and

we have susie not suzy ill to you from israel thank you for the information and a big shout out to all my israeli subscribers and welcome to the chat um you jetty and we also have um um let's see who else is here um we're taking questions guys i feel like i'm not seeing all the comments juliet i just saw that juliet um tracy thank you i will be shopping as soon as i get the info thank you again you're welcome [Music] i think i messed that up but welcome to the chat ritzy i don't have okay i don't have any oil except vitamin e is that okay for substituting yes guys if you can have only one oil apart from you know the regular coconut oil olive oil and all of that if you can only have one oil the honest truth that the one oil that you should have is the vitamin e the vitamin e is good for more skin type and 99 of your facial lotion your facial moisturizer is going to contain a bit of a vitamin e so if you have one oil definitely make it vitamin e now vitamin e comes in different iu you have vitamin e i you like 5 000 3500 you have up to 35 000 iu now the higher the iu is is the thicker the vitamin e oil is i do not suggest that you use a vitamin e oil that is anywhere above 20 iu directly on your skin a good vitamin e oil to use directly on the skin is like a 3500 to a 5000 iu which is more like watery form but definitely it's good if you have a higher eye you mix it with a carrier oil but it's amazing to use directly on the skin or to mix um with another oil to use on the skin if you have to have one oil remember i said it's vitamin e now guys if you don't have vitamin e some of the oils that you're using on your skin already are vitamin e like the grape seed oil is rich in vitamin e the avocado oil is rich in vitamin e so if you can do both then you do one you have grape seed oil and i mentioned use a little bit of extra vitamin e oil and you were using your grapeseed oil not to worry because the grapeseed oil already contains vitamin e okay all right so um i don't know i i don't like the way i am right now stretch marks on my stomach and if you're not deciding to read the first part of your question because you know it's a little funny on youtube we don't want to think we're given advice i have i i'm not going to say it's one of the best a stretch mark remedy but i see so many people send several like emails after emails after emails about the stretch

face yes yes yes yes yes yes because the first thing that people see when you present yourself is your face okay is your face you are often judged by the way you look and there's no two ways about it you might have an excellent personality okay and you present yourself somewhere and the minute they see you and you don't look right regardless of how wonderful you are then you are judged so you gotta you know make sure to take care of yourself and don't let anyone tell you what oh it's so vain like no no no no this is what people see first i know some people that have really amazing personality but you don't know that when you see them you don't know that you have to interact with them or be around them to discover that they are amazing people but you see what they look like first so take care of yourself guys and not only that we're living in the time and age where people are living much longer so you want to swing into 70 looking like 40 you know you really want to look good because you're living much longer nothing is wrong with that okay so not only the skin and also guys you know do your little meditation and your little workout and eat right and you know talk to

patch michael thanks for joining we're continuing on the dehydrator experience here i've had so much fun this week uh we tried some new uh fruit drying and it's uh it's fun and it's really good really really good so i only have the trays here i put the actual dehydrator in the laundry room because it was just making way too much noise so we just let it run overnight we closed the door we check in the morning and uh it takes a bit longer than uh we initially expected so it's actually good to let it run overnight oh hi flower eggs and yiesta thanks for joining inspiring charm hi hey hey so yeah all good so today well first i need to share with you what i did hi william hugs uh montana oh yeah my kitten is very cute i know i agree he's a little cutie he's actually very sweet too not just cute very sweet we are very lucky with our pets they are very good even the dogs it was a bit tough last weekend with the girl in heat and the boy a bit hard to contain but it's almost over now and they're really really sweet all of them bourbon capital of the world michael wow that sounds exciting yeah flour eggs and yeast you see raspberries exactly um what i actually did before connecting is kind of wash them off a bit um i had i got my sink here a big bowl i put mostly water and maybe a quarter of a cup of apple cider vinegar and i started with the blueberries what i did i just submerged the whole pack because i didn't want them to float all over so i submerged it let it stay there for maybe 10 minutes and then i rinsed uh in cold water because i didn't want to have any apple cider taste uh left and so i did the same so here is one pack of blueberry that i'm i've already washed i'm letting dry and i'm doing the exact same thing with the raspberries and putting them to dry and trying to keep them uh as you see they're actually extremely nice it was a i know it's not the season but i found some not too expensive ones uh usually i go to costco but i think these ones are actually found at sam's club um so a few here we're gonna try it's our first time really excited for the raspberries because the girls eat dry raspberries a lot so i usually get them at trader's joe and they're kind of expensive and honestly they're not as nice these are really you know very nice raspberries the ones i don't know what they dry how they dry it i'm sure some of them are made in china i mean it's you don't really know what you get so yes you can come so the girls are waiting to come as always they want to help so here are my little helpers oh well okay and eaters helpers and eaters ah you're in your truck waiting on your clothes to dry michael i hope it's not too cold outside yeah i agree flower eggs and yeast uh yeah rich life is such a great place i agree i met a lot of you over there yes yeah he's really good at helping us smaller channels to uh get some views and uh get connected uh and honestly his lives are really fun i really enjoy his lives oh thank you inspiring child uh spending a charm i'm reading at the same time yeah they're i've got some very well i'm not neutral i'm the mom but i think they're very cute cute little tweeds i'm not sure we're gonna dehydrate much in terms of raspberries a lot goes in the mouse over there but yeah they're helping me they're not little helpers and they washed hands first right yeah so what we're gonna do girls is we've got the tray here uh you want to start with the raspberries yes yes okay we're gonna we're gonna try to put see you put them on the tray you leave a bit of space before you eat them all exactly before you eat them all so yeah so raspberries today let me show you once they eat what i did earlier um so this week i did a full jar of bananas pretty much stayed overnight but yeah looking uh pretty good i ate a few of them they're really good i put a little dehydrant uh water captor thing over there the second and here are some apples i probably have room for one more apple at the top so i might just put a few more and what i tried to do as well here to share with you even we got so many citruses uh in the yard too many for me to eat um i dried a few um these are we got a weird three that's a lime lemon i'm not sure they're in between so i dried some and i also dried some they're not small oranges in french we say clematine yeah climate so i did a few as you can see these are the smaller oranges we were learning about friends on my other movie we could do that too oh you want to learn french too okay so these girls clemontina clementine very good and this from was okay so we're gonna probably do a few more what i try to do also with the where is it here with my little tiny oranges i actually tried to uh peel them and cut them in half and dry them this way and it is so good i want to try that's why i took some from the tree i want to do a tray or two today uh just to heat it up maybe enough for a jar i'm not sure but this is just so good so how are we doing on the raspberries girls the formulas right the frog can't forget my snacks no don't forget your snack you are right okay i think we're gonna be good for a full tray on this why little angeline you are doing so good you're very productive okay we're done are we done with one tray girls let me check yeah we got a bit more on that side okay let's spread it a bit it's a concentration on the right side let's push a few here and otherwise we are good so we're gonna put that tray here girls and the next tray what are we gonna do blueberries blueberries so you put all the blueberries here they're going to shrink a lot so you can uh put them closer by huh yay i don't want to spread them so i got another one here oh yeah it's still a bit wet that one we're gonna have to dry it let me put one more paper towel here to kind of dry it first they're pretty big actually blueberries very nice hopefully that's gonna be a full jar it's just so much when you start and it it shrinks uh so much you want to try and try one no it's actually pretty good they're washed out they're clean no way no way why not they're really good in pancakes oh hey yeah food is calling i totally understand william thank you for joining i'm getting all the big ones on that all right i'm getting all the little ones all the little ones yeah all right so has any of you guys tried the blueberries before and if so how long did it take you because what i'm reading i said it's our first time but what i'm reading is that it takes a good 18 to 20 hours so we're prepared it's uh it's gonna be probably 11 30 when we put them uh we load it all and we get started uh so probably gonna spend the night but yeah let us know if you got any uh experience on this and once the girls are loading the the blueberries i'm going to prepare some more of these little oranges because this was so good how do you peel so ideally what i read a lot of people who dry dehydrate these they actually some of them keep the peel for oranges and juice some orange candy with uh dipping them in sugar in um in chocolate so i'm not too sure i would be able to with these my uh my fear here i'm not sure it is 10 39. all right so for this we have a lot of seeds as i said they're from the yard so it's great if you want to replant it's full of seeds but otherwise [Music] it takes a bit of time to what are you eating here are the snacks okay i thought you were eating blueberries let me just take my hair up a bit wow angeli you are doing so good okay let's let's spread them out a bit here um i think we're good on that tray actually we're gonna have to start okay hold on let me maybe take one or two off here because it's not it's actually pretty full you've got them on top of each other we cannot have them on top of each other okay i was not watching you did a good job but it's a lot of blueberries okay no you're good you're good okay you take this out i think we're good now okay okay hold on i finally spread them good because we have to hear that okay okay you do the same on this one good all right so for these ones here i'm gonna need a knife no no not shimmer yes all right so now it's time for the big blueberries yay they are big that's small i think we should take this one what you're pointing with a straw a purple straw that's my favorite color hey yeah i said what's gonna take most of the time is taking the seeds away but i could let me know just this way and then we're gonna put them on a tray i might actually do it directly on the tray anjali if you don't mind mommy's gonna take a tray from you yeah yeah you do the blueberries you're doing so good on the blueberries your background you guys comment down below [Music] in your backyard background so as you see for the fruits we use this uh this covers here it's very handy it doesn't stick everything gets out it's really nice hey why do you need a straw we don't need a straw for the fruits so yeah i take the little piece here and i just cut it in the middle and open it up to ease the and take this one right here i'll keep the seeds for now but i don't know if you guys have a seat exchange or you want some uh some of our seeds uh better stir it takes a long time to plant and grow but we got plenty and these uh little uh oranges clementine i call them are so good they're very sweet actually and tasty okay what are you doing girls are you doing it with the spoon oh that's gonna take forever no oh michael thank you so where are you going yeah after you were doing your laundry and now go heading back home with your clean clothes i'm going somewhere that's kind of funny yeah oh hey youtuber chat thank you so much for joining us we are dehydrating blueberries and yeah raspberries already set up there and i am doing some little oranges uh that uh i'm not maybe well you're canadian maybe you can help here in french we call them clementina how do you say that in english orange orange no they're not oranges that's the thing clementine is not exactly oranges i know i think in spanish you say clementine or something like that it's the same i think but not sure about the english commenting you think yeah i don't know and so my little helpers over there are having fun with the blueberries with the spoon oh thank you so much super chat i appreciate all the help and so why are not eating all your snacks okay let's do another little clementine right yes yes yeah maybe i need to try to actually keep this peel to try to do my candy uh candied orange here after this is good if i dip them in chocolate i'm sure the girls are gonna eat them wow because you eat everything that has sugar and chocolate my love that's pretty much the rule here in this house if it's sweet and has chocolate the girls will eat i might have to dip the veggies in the sugar to get them to eat them all right are we done with the blueberries um no no after that i'm gonna set you up with some bananas huh maybe we can do one more banana i'm sure i'll do it with the spoon with the spoon all right that is definitely i'm doing the the thing that takes the longest time it actually takes the longest to dry as well the ones we did the other day uh took almost 24 hours to dry and it wasn't much i mean they're really dry that it's uh it was one tray yeah 24 hours and it doesn't produce much but we have just so much on the tree in the yard and it's going to go to waste so it's uh at some point what happened last year with all what we had left it was the rats or opposum that went to eat them so i'd rather dry dehydrate all these fruits before the rats uh whatever night creature we got over there uh eat them are you done yeah okay hey don't don't don't don't scratch the snow hey we want to keep them good huh okay it is pretty full but it's gonna shrink okay so i think we're good ah that's a heavy one yes okay so the next one here we are let me get you set up with maybe a banana right you want to do a banana girls yes let's do a banana like bananas the minions like bananas yeah i like bananas too they're pretty good huh i've been reading quite a bit about let me cut it here about the dehydration and what temperature to use and it looks like it's uh it really needs to be fine-tuned and uh there's discussions on uh keeping the vitamins and what temperature to use in order to preserve most of the vitamins uh i don't know if you guys have experience uh i'll be interested i understand the lowers the temperature the longer of course it will take to dehydrate but you might actually be able to keep more vitamins my understanding is that vitamin a and c are pretty uh volatile so they don't keep up well with the heat but i'm not too sure usually i set it up at 140 between 135 and 145 here on my fruits i might try to do it a tiny bit lower today maybe 1 30 but i don't know if that's gonna change much in terms of keeping the vitamins oh hey sony's place thank you for joining me and the girls we just uh finished with the raspberries and the yummy bananas blueberries and we are now dehydrating a banana i was maybe doing two but obviously the second one is being eaten so anjali you're my little helper can you put the banana on the tray i normally eat the banana quaker yes you do eat the banana at the store but that was before the virus when they were giving away bananas for the kids now you don't get free bananas so let me keep going here uh and i'm trying to uh cut here open some of our small uh oranges clementine from the yard so cutting each piece in half and getting the seeds out and then placing that on the tray so i've got a variety of fruit which might not all take the same time to dehydrate the bananas here are probably going to be done the soonest um [Music] and for the rest it's definitely i mean this one is going to take 24 hours and i'm expecting the blueberries and strawberries to take probably as long but what i will do is rotate the the trays so that they're all uh get to experience the same amount of heat air flowing and so on also my nesco dehydrator is actually pretty good you're done anjali yeah okay very good you want to wash hands okay go this banana is so good it's so good so how do we say banana in french banana banana and what's the color what is the color yeah but how do you say yellow banana hey hi good morning it's attention to detail well i say good morning but it's almost afternoon for some of you on the east coast but yeah thanks for joining me and the girls in our saturday morning uh fruit dehydration exercise here so blueberry raspberries already loaded one banana loaded the second one being eaten and now we are doing a few small oranges and then i will cut this um lemon here in uh slices to uh pretty much fill up my jar here as you can see i did that this week that's a mix of lemon and my small oranges oh yeah daddy hasn't joined i know and so here as you can see they're pretty uh still whitish so what i did is i um dip them first and let them stay for five minutes in water with a tiny bit of lemon juice so i actually i started by dipping the lemon first and then i put the oranges so that it was watery lemon water and that helped preserve the colors and otherwise what my understanding is that it turns kind of brown which doesn't change anything to the taste but it's not as pretty so if you want to keep it with nice color and a whitish uh peel dip it in a tiny bit of lemon juice to start with and then you should be good to go so this i'm looking forward in the summer you know when we don't have it in the yard anymore it's very often i forget to buy the lemon or limes at the store you can just put one or two in your water eyes and it's just refreshing so ed you have a chef man dehydrator and a fencer cursory dehydrator well it looks like you're very well equipped how are these two dehydrators we just got ours uh the nesco garden master for christmas it was actually my idea for a gift for my husband but at the the end i'm the one well he did some beef jerky he did he uses it for beef jerky but i think i've used it more than he did and i really enjoyed it um it's um it wasn't easy to find because when you look i did some research on the internet and i wanted i didn't want to spend uh too much because some of them are super expensive and others that i wanted were just sold out so it wasn't uh that one was actually a good compromise and so far i only read good reviews and i can only confirm it's working perfect it's just a tiny bit noisy but i think all of them are you know with the air flowing so i mean i learned my lesson the first time leaving it in the open area in the kitchen so now it's in the laundry room with closed door and we let it run overnight and it's just perfect but yeah so far it's uh good so i love this but look at that one that's from the yard so it's organic no treatment but one of them you've got four seeds in a tiny um quarter so it's it takes a while but they are really really really good so the chapman is good for fruits and veggies and the kosori is larger and oh you can program it to get warmer so you can do jerky oh that is nice so you've got definitely a more fancy one that we we have this one is just pretty much an on and off you don't have a timer um also i have a manual timer i can set you know to what we use for the lights when we're not home so i can always move it and use it as a timer but that's uh yeah it's a pretty uh basic but working well dehydrator in the 100 range i'm pretty happy uh so far and as i said it worked uh actually really nice for the beef jerky my husband did um it did not take him too long to dry the jerkies um i think they were done in like six hours uh the fruit takes a long time all right i think i have my first tray here so that's my tray with my little uh clementine let me set it up all right girls the girls are decorating the fridge okay very good decorating the fridge that mommy do another um the best mom ever thank you my love for showing everybody thank you thank you it's okay it's okay well that's good eh come on so advertisement from the kids oh thank you michael that's so sweet yeah they are they are really good kids i'm blessed on that one really um and with this uh whole pandemic i actually got to spend a lot more time with them working from home and homeschooling them so it's uh yeah at the end we're very close so it's uh it's good and they're really sweet girls also i love this texas you love the texas flag why why do you love the texas flag it has anthony's favorite color my favorite color and it has a white so which one is your favorite color the red or the blue i like both of them you like both of them okay they well i thought your favorite color was purple purple and pink oh purple and pink so that's not the texas flag you just like the texas flag love kids [Music] okay yeah they're sharing the whole fridge magnets with you guys you're lucky here i think i know which one i love when it was our five-year-old birthday i'm gonna bring all the pictures to seoul yes you're right sony's place it also has the french black colors it's funny how many flags you've got with this uh red blue and uh and white uh it's not always the same shade of blue but um yeah okay i think we're good without showing all the magnets on the video you know i think i know which one they're gonna love which one what's that one the dogs oh that's a magnet with our dogs that shine right there that's what shine when he was a baby that's so cute when they're both nose everybody's seeing the whole family i need to keep you busy girls you know what mommy gets you busy we're going to do a maybe a man and you're going to help mommy with the lima maybe oh this looks so cute but the thing i need to keep them busy otherwise i think i think yes naked no you're not naked it was the summer you were wearing a swimming suit oh yes you're not naked all right so have you actually has anybody here dehydrated lemons or oranges um doing uh slices just what i showed you and do you actually keep the skin or do you peel it just to remove the outside i'll be curious here oh thank you for chat i appreciate you staying even for a tiny bit i greatly appreciate nothing just cute yes hey no no no okay done with the pictures you don't put that on the fruit i like this one oh nice sony wow 12 years old yeah they're starting to be teenager on your side huh made a fried egg sandwich not bad yeah mines don't cook yet we're not there so i'm not too sure on that one i might just continue on my basic uh slices here and i will try probably another batch with um without the outer skin oh you've never done it wendy oh you're more into canning yeah i guess i know i know you're pretty good at canning but okay yeah i'm not too sure i kind of want to try to remove some of that uh outer skin yeah it's okay you know i'm i'm learning here it's all brand new i'm enjoying it it's fun but it's a learning experience i mean the first time i was not expecting it to take that long for instance it was like wow really i was checking every two hours at the end no it's still wet you know wendy i'm just hoping that um i don't know actually between canning and dehydrating uh i'm canning you can obviously keep much longer uh but i don't know which one preserves more vitamins and uh minerals here on the in the food because i mean the fruits you definitely want to keep all these good vitamins same if i keep cancer if i dehydrate some veggies and i'm not sure what would be the best option at least for the media term if you just want to keep it like for a few months a year to keep that uh most of the vitamins and minerals because i think you lose probably quite a bit as well when you um when you can oh hey homestead aquarius thank you so much for joining yeah so we just placed you missed the beginning what we had we did the berries already uh raspberries and blueberries the girls helped me quite a bit here placing them on the trays and now they're kind of like playing with the fridge and our magnets when i'm trying to finish on the on my lemon all right so that i actually peeled it so let's see hey girls what did i say about the magnets not on top of the fruit sir all right let me do slices here and we're gonna place these slices hey i think people have seen all your pictures you're the star of mommy's fridge it's all about you pretty much all right so that's my uh slice maybe i do it a bit too thick it's not that easy let me try a tiny bit maybe thinner oh that's definitely too thin all right trying to keep some of the seeds i did a few plantation last year um they're still growing actually uh it's just gonna take 20 years to get the tree with the fruits but they're growing um all right last one here and put them on the tray and then i'll finish we're back on the texas flag so anjali why do you like these flags sister said she liked the colors because i like blue and red you're into the colors too huh okay can you move i'm gonna put this on the tray here oh we still have some seeds on that one i don't want to keep the seeds huh so as i said guys if you're interested in seed we have plenty come [Music] here all right so we're almost done so that's one of my so that's the tray or that and i need to finish my little orange come check out the river house we got a note from dad okay go check out the fun house our channel oh the fun house yeah the fun house yeah i did create uh initially i created a kids channel for them that we called it the sna fun house and so place a few videos over there more like kids video playing doing puzzles more learning actually puzzles but kids channel are really not fun on youtube there are just too many restrictions so at the end i i'm not putting as much as i should probably on their channel but it's uh it's not picking up and it was more to share with my family and at the end i don't get notification when we post videos it's uh it's not that far all right so what are you guys up to this weekend uh let's check out daddy's channel it is beautiful here in terms of weather very sunny not too cold so hopefully we're gonna go out in a bit to enjoy that sunshine let's check out daddy's channel yeah i think everybody here knows daddy's channel [Music] can you take everything out of the fruits girls please not doing anything wendy so you still don't have any snow quiet weekend for you actually talking about snow i just talked to my mom back home and she showed me a picture so she's uh in the suburbs of paris uh in france she just showed me a picture of their no angeli out of her balcony she's got a pretty big bad cody she lives in an apartment with a huge balcony almost as big as the apartment itself it was covered with snow i couldn't believe it like but a good amount of snow kind of what we had uh in texas at the end of last week last weekend wow it apparently started uh snowing this morning it's already evening back there with the time difference and it's holding on to the ground so they've got uh she showed me a bit the trees and you got that much snow i mean it's i was surprised you don't get that much snow in paris that often it's probably not going to stay long um it's just um as soon as it warms up just one or two degrees and you got the cars it gets unfortunately i mean it's very very nice when it just falls but then it gets all muddy and brown so the city snow i guess but yeah east of france too it's they've got she was telling me like 30 40 centimeters so centimeters not inches of snow but probably around 20 inches i guess it's it's a lot uh we don't get that much so it's a kind of a crazy weather back there for this year and probably even more frustrating for people that um it's a there's a curfew now and the ski resorts were not allowed to open this year so all these kids are closed so you get all this snow but you cannot go skiing it's not that much fun hi free handymaid how are you doing this morning thanks for joining oh your last bit of snow is melting wendy yeah did not last very long huh you have a dehydrator in your pantry that belong to your mother your stepmother-in-law maybe you can try it out if you have kids i don't know if you have kids but if you have kids it's fun and they actually enjoy it and the fruits are pretty good concentration i guess of sugar you know when it gets dehydrated so if you're watching on your diet you need to make sure you don't eat the whole package right away because it's kind of a concentration of sugar so plenty of calories but it's uh it's really good little by little it's a good snack and uh yeah my goals don't have any weight problem they're pretty stingy so i'm happy if they just eat pretty much i want them to eat so i'm really waiting on the raspberries here because that's their favorite dried fruit we'll see i did some strawberries last weekend they're all gone and it wasn't the girls that was daddy he ate them all uh i think i had one and then i looked and i was like where are the strawberries and gone hi sony you've got a friend in france uh hmm yeah you want to visit one day yes me too i wish i could go home to visit my parents right now but it's not even worth it with the curfew the bad weather the wow she lives in the lake wow i have no idea where it's at but given the way it spelled i would go for brittany on the west side of france is that where your friend is at yeah it's just uh they um they have some names that they you know it's it's a different language they used to speak there some of the provinces and given how you spelled it that's what i would guess it's very very nice brittany it's still a bit wild in a way you've got some very good food that's where the crepes are from yeah see she's in brittany i have no clue where i've never heard probably a tiny village but yeah they make some pretty good crepes with butter over there i used to go on vacation it's a very nice very very nice yes one day it's um four two it depends where actually you can get uh the very end of brittany it's quite of a drive from paris but otherwise you can probably get to some of the beaches and places in the 4 hours drive 8 year old song well i'm thinking bananas in such case bananas can be fun oh i'm at a photographer yeah you can do beautiful pictures over there with the on the seashore it's still pretty wild with a lot of waves on the rocks you've got a lot of birds yeah it's definitely a nice place to take pictures i can only concur here he loves bananas see if we free handy mate it's just when you said boy i was like let's go for the bananas now here it's been a challenge to get them to eat fruits i mean you you saw out of the two only one eight fruits she went for the raspberries and the other one it's really really tough she eats strawberries fresh so i get a lot of strawberries but that's pretty much it a few apples here and there and when i see a few she takes two bites and she puts it down it's uh yeah getting them to eat fruits and vegetables it's a challenge and it's even more frustrating that me i love fruits and vegetables so i try everything but so all my trays are pretty much ready here with my little oranges so i have one orange clematine one lemon one banana another orange which i might actually try to put the oranges together and then here i have the blueberry one blueberry two blueberries and the famous raspberries beautiful raspberries we'll see how it goes i have another pack of raspberries in the fridge so if it works out good we might do another tray my guess is in 24 hours because that's gonna take 24 hours so i'll set it up in the laundry room behind closed door so that the motor can run but yeah homestead aquarius you are right it smells so good this little dehydrator um i mean last um two days ago i did it overnight and when i woke up and opened the laundry room door wow it was warm and kind of toasty smelling of fruits it was the apples and bananas it was so nice i agree with you on that one oh you're heading out okay what a fall but that sounds like fun it sounds like fun you have blueberry bushes wow that is nice yeah we're just starting uh our future homestead i posted a video a few uh maybe two weeks ago it's called the ranch uh so it's 20 acres uh in east texas so about four hours away north of here beautiful in the woods um and so my husband is actually there right now he's working we already have uh some um animals chickens ducks and so on but we have not started the garden as such i mean we cleared he cleared the land um started to work on the on the land itself because it was wooded so it's quite a lot of work just to make it to prepare it and we just ordered some seeds right now so we're waiting to get some seeds and we're gonna start planting this year so um so far we ordered mostly veggies so i'm i'm interested in your blueberry bushes i mean i how do you plant blueberries and how long does it take to actually grow into bushies and produce fruits because definitely we i mean we i want to have blueberries raspberries strawberries um but i haven't found any um any seeds online as such so we're probably thinking going to a local nursery and getting some of these smaller trees like apricot trees apple trees and plant them because that's really uh i would love to have some yeah that's what i thought you buy small blueberry bushies in a pot uh in spring that's what we're we're gonna do when the nursery yeah pretty much we might do the same with oranges and lemons because i mean as i said i have plenty of uh of seeds uh that um i have some uh right here see i mean i don't know how many i have maybe 50 seeds from what i cut but it just takes so long to grow 20 years before we get fruits because that's pretty much what we have this house was built about 20 years ago 21 years ago and i think it was the first owner who started planting these trees so oranges lemon and grapefruits i haven't done grapefruits i'm out of tray but i have awesome grapefruits i need to dehydrate because we've got too many as well but yeah we started oranges i think it took probably 14 years but the grapefruit the first ones were last year so it took a good 18 years to produce grapefruits there's a blueberry farm near canton good to know if you remember the name wendy otherwise i would google it and is it just blueberry or they just say blueberry farm but they have raspberry and all kinds of berries oh the soil is sony that's a good yeah we'll see i'm hoping our salt is good for everything but yeah we'll have to try you got strawberries instead that's not bad i will do with strawberries yeah it's on highway 64. just blueberry okay well let's start let's start we'll find another place for the for the raspberries and strawberries yeah i remember for me it was really uh the fun thing when when i was a kid i grew up in the city so no no such thing but every time we went away in the countryside in the mountains was to look for all these berries so of course you need to be careful when you're in the wildness what you get what you eat what kind of berries but you're growing a living tree michael you started from seed i left it outside this winters to see if it survived it's about three years old pretty nice so you were saying it was you mentioning whiskey and cantaqueena so how cold does it get because i thought citruses would not resist too much of freezing temperatures i have a little orange tree that i started three to four years ago so i leave it outside it's um pretty much yeah that tall for now it's it's doing okay but we're in the south of texas so it barely freezes i'm not sure where you are well let me know how it goes this winter if he's three years old i would be careful i wouldn't want to lose it but yeah it's uh it's interesting what i want to do this spring with our trees is actually uh do some like cutting some branches and try to start them up again from branches i heard it's much quicker and i met one of our neighbor here he's got his son working for some kind of agricultural company or so on and he gave us some kind of secret recipes on how to dip the branches and so on so i'll i might do a little video on that to share with you and we'll see if it works i've never tried so it's going to be another experience um all right sony you're gonna run yes uh sure you want to catch a show oh i need a cup of coffee yes thank you so much for uh joining us sony have a good one with your girls society grows great when old men and women plant trees under which they will never sit yeah that's pretty much what happened in our yard the the previous owners um i think they had oranges initially because when we bought the house they mentioned to us that they had a one orange tree but it had just started giving them oranges and they never had lemon lime or grapefruits yeah yeah yeah getting too heavy to back in and out all the time yeah i okay well if it's too heavy it means it's already pretty big michael i don't know maybe cover i mean i i'm guessing you cover it anyway now with some plastic or protection for the for the cold and the frost you know yeah the small ones i started out of seed which were grapefruits and lemons um that i started this year i brought in when we had the tiny frost here in texas you know it doesn't take much in texas we're like oh gosh it's cold it went down to 32 my goodness for a few hours overnight so i brought everything in i'm not sure it was worth it but they are light enough they're just tiny pots right now so it's pretty easy for me to do but i agree with you when it grows it's just uh yeah too much you don't cover okay well if you don't cover we'll

soon bye you", "OZ5EW-NKldk": "hey guys it's kayla from feeling with coupons here's maybe Tara market ha for you guys this week so I did things just toot a bit differently because I did pick up several items that were on clearance this week that was actually kind of almost the majority of my haul but I like i was saying i picked up several items on clearance this week and so I went and used the walmart app so if you guys are familiar with that to compare the prices that they would cost at walmart because i'm not sure because they were on clearance at Butera what they would actually cost at a different retailer so I don't mind price snatching or pricing or you know matching the prices from Butera to walmart because walmart is said to have the lowest advertised prices so this is just completely very very well average of what the total retail cost of everything would have been with 82 dollars and seventy two cents I paid twenty eight dollars and twenty cents plus 49 cents in tax and save fifty four dollars in Tuesday actually also had a total or almost two dollars not come off in savings from the in ad coupons I guess my cashier must have not got pushed their put the coupon in for a nag coupons would for on the eggs the peanut butter in the water which was about a dollar seventy one I think so it was a difference of that so i wanna i have everything written out for you guys and the prices that I found online also on some of the products and tell you guys what I safe so I'm first going to go over all the clearance products that I picked up so for example the shredded wheat post cereal was on clearance you guys can see down here it was on clearance for fifty cents now um at walmart when I scanned the little bar code on the bottom it says that Walmart in my area sells it for two dollars and forty-nine cents so since i only paid fifty cents i saved a dollar ninety-eight and then the cost sheaf which was also 50 census all it said at walmart it was three dollars and twelve cents i paid fifty cents for it so i saved two dollars and sixty two cents and then the ocean spray's I got six of these fruit snacks they were also is wall fifty cents and they say that they sell them at my walmart for two dollars so i say doodle are 50 which eats each box i bought so I actually saved nine dollars in total and then the this cereal now I actually look this up on their website they said that it was fifty cents at the store so I paid a dollar for both boxes and their online price on the website is five dollars and 49 cents so I actually saved four dollars and ninety-nine cents now of course that kind of figures and shipping as well but I do know that this brand of cereal retail is pretty high so I save nine dollars and 98 cents and then the Velveeta which I really was not sure at all walmart i saw on line they have the larger sized ones for six dollars and eighty cents now that's half the size of this one or double the size of this one so this one's only half that size so i figured these are probably right around 350 and i paid again only fifty cents for these as well which were on clearance so i saved roughly about three dollars bought four of them so I actually saved twelve dollars on those then this brand of muffin mix which was also fifty cents I looked it up online and they sell it for about a dollar fifty nine so I saved a dollar on I'm buying that then over on to the tuna this is normally a dollar 19 i paid forty nine cents with a mia coupon so i saved seventy cents on each of them are dollar 44 they're both and then i actually need pizza sauce this week for one of the meals that i'm making for myself so i had to pick up the pizza sauce it's normally cheaper dollar tree but i wasn't headed in that direction this was a dollar own behind i believe then the peanut butter which is supposed to be 99 cents with any i keep on like I said the Indigo pond didn't come off for me so the dollar 49 and in the water which is supposed to be a dollar ninety-nine with any I coupon was 250 so I didn't save 51 stunts on that and then eggs which are supposed to be 99 cents idina coupon didn't come off either on that so I just think they capture didn't put put the coupon in for that because I handed her the ad because she like oh I'll just do it off the ad because my coupon was kind of ripped so these were a dollar sixty-nine and then over on to the Prince pasta these are normally 99 cent store on sale for 15 or 69 cents saving only thirty cents but I didn't save a dollar twenty on all four boxes combined and then on the Quaker these are normally 329 I said I paid a dollar fifty forty nine and that's when you buy five boxes so i had to get five boxes of those and i was doing that because i had to get to attend all or total in order to get them I in egg coupons to work I wasn't planning on getting any of this stuff on clearance so at the time that's what I did you still wind up saving though a dollar eighty on each box so I saved nine dollars for all five boxes which was a really nice deal and then the cauliflower is 69 cents I picked up right at let's see right at a dollar so it was at one point for four or five pounds and then the broccoli which I did figure um Walmart is well I'll show you guys walmart sells doors for a dollar a 48 a pound and this week I picked up one point oh eight pounds so at walmart it would have been a dollar sixty one however because it was on sale at me tera i wound up paying 75 cents for it making my savings eighty six cents and then the egg they now the way they priced the cauliflower at walmart so i can figure the savings was per package and not per pound so I just figured it was whatever there was no savings on that um and then the avocados which you guys can see there there's a six pack they were 99 cents on produce markdown so at walmart they sell theirs avocados individually at an eighty-nine cents i picked up six of them so at walmart i would have been paying 588 however at Butera i only paid 99 cents so i say are saved four dollars and eighty nine cents so i just look at it a little bit differently because i don't see a lot of savings actually when I go to be terrible I decided to match the prices of the clearance I thumbs at from Walmart because like i was saying i'm not sure what they actually retail for at the store that I shop at so I wanted to see what's the next closest price that you know if I would have went to a store like Walmart what would they have costs considering walmart claims to have an everyday low price so that was it for this week for my hall if you guys have a hall from any stores I'd love to read see or hear about them via video picture comment you can also find these deals and more post on my blog killing of coupons calm they also follow me on Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Instagram and Tumblr up those links all those in the description below I'll see fela please subscribe and I'll talk to you next week bye guys", "HRUhtg6dhB8": "Hey, guys, we're going to make a green smoothie\nagain, but we're going to call it a berry green smoothie because it's going to have\na lot of berries in it. So it's not going to be the typical green\nsmoothie look, but it's still going to have a lot of nutrition in there, and it's going\nto taste really good. So we're going to start off with some coconut\nwater. That's about a cup, a cup and a half. Then we've got some pineapple. Awesome. Frozen pineapple there. Then we've got some kale, the usual for green\nsmoothies. You've got some spinach and some kale, so\nput them in, a handful of each, half a cup of each; some blueberries, half a cup; some\nstrawberries. Oh, yum. And what else do we need? I think that's it! Always put on the lid and rip it up on the\nhigh setting. Yeah! Alright. Yeah, baby. Check this out. All the way to the top, Instagram. Delicious. Awesome. So maybe you can put in half a banana, if\nyou want some more sweetness; some honey, if you want; more berries; whatever you like. But that's a great base and you can add to\nthat. Hope you enjoy. Cheers!", "ILNytNyKZqE": "[Music] good morning guys welcome back to 20 barns today we are gonna do some more frugal canning I've been doing this for quite a few years because fruit gets so expensive and I thought I'd bring you guys along while I can't up this by feeling let's get going all right guys let's talk about this for just a quick second this is just some no-name from our know first store mixed berries this is my favorite game of all time you I have definitely added like rhubarb and five apples kicking around the house I've added all those too so what I do is I look at the I look at all the different fruits right so blackberries blueberries and raspberries all have different times for water bath canning so blackberries are the longest so that's what what we're going to do we're gonna do the water bath canning for the blackberries this is a very inexpensive way to put pie filling on your shelf this was on sale for 1099 I believe it was and I'm gonna get enough jars for me for the next year maybe year and a half so this is a really good option for me I'm not a huge blueberry fan so this way I'm getting the blueberries but I don't really necessarily taste them I'm just not a big fan of them but I love them in a pie I don't know it's just weird but anyway that's what I do and because blackberries are really super expensive yes we have them growing here but I've never had them anywhere else and they just grow wild here but we will be picking them very very soon blueberries very expensive as all of you know and raspberries expensive again so this is my way of doing the pie filling getting it on my shelf but economical so I'm going to pick you up and move you over to my pot here already have my jars on you guys might actually hear a whole bunch of thunder finally getting rain I'm so excited okay so I'm going to turn my pot on fairly low about a four okay another thing is I don't use the clear gel okay guys so at this point of me dropping these berries in the pot if you want to add clear gel to it you go right ahead I'm gonna turn my jars on super low here and I'm gonna use the 473 the new ball jars can I have all these beautiful berries I haven't been defrosted you can even make jam this way I've done that plenty of times get all that goodness out of there there's all that so now we need some water you can use fruit juice just so you know definitely do that that was eight cups of berries now I'm going to add 8 cups of water so you're basically making a simple syrup I'm so happy it's raining cool down our house you oops we do not have AC in our house so good lord I was going to do this yesterday but it was 30 degrees and I don't have everything set up outside yet so okay so we have eight cups of water okay now I'm gonna do forgot my lemon juice I gotta go get that mm-hmm and I need seven cups of sugar so you're basically just going to add all this in together to measure up my sugar first there's two there's four and here's six I think that's plenty I don't want it so sweet I can't eat it guys I don't eat a lot of sugar and that will just work out just perfect and then I'm gonna get my lemon juice here clean up my sugar mess here which the guys I'm gonna have to pause you and go get my lemon juice I'll be right back alright guys I'm back so now I'm going to need 1/2 a cup of bottled lemon juice you never want to use fresh lemon juice in your canning you need to ensure the citric acid level we have a lot of new cameras on the channel which i think is fantastic always bottled lemon juice and the reason you add the lemon juice is to ensure that it's safe for water bath canning or anybody that's stuff out of here so I'd sanitize my spoon and my ladle Oh one hears them all right so now all we're gonna do Oh is bring this up to a very slight simmer so this is where you really want to add that clear gel guys I actually just um add flour when I'm making my pie it's hot and Oh for anyone that's new to canning if you're doing any jams or anything like that you want to use a metal spoon friend Diane actually asked me this question and I never think to say it that is so your plastics will transfer say you've cooked with garlic or whatever it will transfer into your jam so always try to use a metal Sun metal spoon these are older pots so I'm not too worried about it so we're gonna bring this up to a boil let it kind of sit here and simmer for a few minutes we're gonna jar up this beautiful pie filling get it up on our shelf like I said I'm doing the 473 I may not have enough jars in there I may have to wash a few more jars I might do a couple liters I'm not a hundred percent sure but it's 35 minutes for processing I [Applause] like it in the winter time to make a pie every once in a while but I don't want to pay a fortune to make my pie filling so this is this is what I do turn my stove up a tad all right guys I'll bring you back when this is up to a boil all right guys I had to switch over to the overhead light that big one over my head ooh way to warm excuse me so as you can see it's starting to come up to a very gentle boil you want some of these berries to kind of break up a little bit you can take your immersion blender to this and blend it all up but I want that beautiful fruit okay in my pie you do it as you want if you want to use a potato masher you go right ahead I particularly don't do that but that is up to you at this point all right you would be using the potato masher to UM to match the berries I'll do a few of them just to show you how easy it is with the potato masher okay can you just basically release some of that pectin in all these wonderful berries and it's very simple I mean it's whatever whatever your preferences okay as you can see it's really super easy to do or with an immersion blender before you heat up the berries you can blend them up with an immersion blender you don't really I mean I'm infamous for doing stuff with the immersion blender when it's hot but or you can even put it in your blender and blend them all up but this is kind of how I do it but in your kitchen you do what you want to do it's your kitchen but there we go so I just gently broke some of them up releasing some of the pectin out of those berries and I'm just gonna gently let this come to a very gentle boil and boil for about a minute like you're making jam really then we're just gonna stir that up you do not want this to boil over it is a horrible mess don't ask me how I know but I do know and just gently mix it around and as you can see we started way up here it's actually going down which is fine because you want it you want a nice consistency instead of water you can also add like an apple juice or you know maybe a blueberry juice would be really good if you're into blueberries but it isn't that gorgeous like look at that syrup and then when I go to make my pie I just had some butter and some flour and I just bake it in the oven and I have wonderful pies all winter or if I want to do Jam pasties or like fruit pasties or fried pies or anything like that I have I just thicken it and I go to town making those but all right guys so I'm gonna let this finish coming back up to a boil because now I disturbed it and I'll bring you back when we're ready to can all right guys let's do this right so I want to can these jars here first I turned up my Kiner you want to make sure you stir this around quite a bit so you ensure that you get berries and juice and every single char bring a little closer you want one inch of head space if you're using clear gel guys give it give it space to expand sorry quarter inch of head space do too much personal candy apparently man we're just gonna move to the next jar like so you're gonna want it to bubble because there is fruit in here that is full fruit you want to ensure that you're getting all those air pockets out okay I'm just going to move to the next jar you can see that yeah get all this in here now I'm filling up these jars because these are the jars I really want for this pie filling I do have some 750 s in my canner I did wash three I don't know what I'm gonna need them all but I'd rather have them all sanitized and ready to go just in case I have my lids and boiling well kettle boiled water sitting there chilling out for a little while there you just get these filled get the deep bubbling done get them back in the canner it's so warm today I don't need to really worry about my jars getting cold we don't have AC in this house so well we can't have you seen in the house we have wood stove so turn this again easier and just keep filling then I will be bubble with you and white rims with you and check all my headspace is c1 I need to talk up there absolutely awesome I'm just gonna top up a couple of these I've turned up my water bath canner this must be water bouts two guys not one and I'm gonna leave all the processing times down below okay so now we are just going to debug these and like I said if you want to use clear gel you go right ahead I'm just lost a blueberry not a big fan of clear gel but like I said your kitchen your rules you do what you are comfortable with Obama can enclose those rims really really good so sugar in there don't wanna ruin those rims you know checked all these jars before started that's just a little bit of vinegar I'm just being super careful all the way around these have been sitting in my canner for at least an hour so I know they're good and sanitized now we're just gonna add this to here fingertip tight it was just like I said hot water out of my kettle get these lids on and then I'm gonna put them into camera guys and I'm going to let him process 30 minutes but I gotta finish up what's in my camp drop my pot here and I'm gonna do that and I will bring you guys back as soon as they come out of the canner and we'll finish up this beautiful pie filling all right guys we're gonna keep these out of the canner here we go making sure you give yourself enough space those jars to breathe don't tilt your jars when you're pulling them out of the canner if there's water on the it will go away don't be tipping your jars and when you're processing your jars make make sure there's at least two inches of water above your rooms all right there we go guys 35 minutes processing coffee at all close move you over and I got one 725 here so if we have enough company I have one great big jar I'll show it all to you hey there we go all right guys you're like in this frugal for canning please give me a thumbs up but you know what you guys are liking and what you're not liking guys $10.99 one jar one can of hot pie filling is seven dollars look at the savings right here I think that's pretty frugal all right guys thanks for hanging out with me today and I'll see you super super soon bye [Music]", "76u-C4uzDss": "hi thank you for joining us to the second part of the health talks uh organized and hosted by campus health professionals uk we have only two more talks left the first one is by dr areli cuevas ocampo i hope i'm pronouncing her name right she's a medical doctor who follows a raw vegan lifestyle she is a board certified in anatomical uh sorry anatomic clinical pathology and neuropathology and she's also certified in plant-based nutrition by the university of winchester she's an expert in raw vegan diet and that is what she's going to talk to us about today if you have any questions just comment in the chat box and i will ask her so aurelie are you here do you want to join us i'm ready to join you hello hi so i think you have a presentation for us don't you i do yes whenever you're ready go ahead okay i'm gonna share my screen let's see um chair okay yeah and that's my presentation can everybody see it i can't see it so i assume everybody else can see too so i'm gonna put like a presenter mode is that okay yeah that's fine perfect okay so thank you so much leila for inviting me to this plant-based expo 2021 i'm so happy because for me it's just an amazing opportunity to make the plant-based uh movement aware of the correct way to to follow a raw vegan diet um my name is aurelie as you mentioned cuevas ocampo i am originally from mexico city and i studied medicine and pathology in my home country i also repeated my residency in pathology and my sub-specialty in neuropathology in the u.s and then i moved to the uk to work for two years but i'm back now in the u.s again after two years of living in the uk and through all my my career medical education i've experimented on myself all the spectrums of dietary patterns that you can imagine i grew up only more i gained a lot of weight on during my internship in medical school that was back in 2007 2006-2007 um i wanted to lose away so i followed the atkins diet because i didn't know anything about diets i lost the weight but i wasn't feeling great then i started reading more about nutrition came across vegetarianism veganism and eventually that led me to raw veganism and just as u.s was a skeptical there are so many stories that are not necessarily very encouraging to follow a raw vegan diet there is a lot of misconceptions surrounding this concept this extremist way of eating and has a lot little bad reputation uh honestly unfortunately but you know i'm here to dispel the myths hopefully it's a short period of time just to explain everything but um i'll try to be um you know uh to the point so having said that introduction that's my disclaimer and um i'm gonna go through some of these outlines definitions and clarifications what is the human specific diet evolution versus adaptation how where is the science supporting this lifestyle and how we can incorporate desire to prevent inflammation because as we know inflammation is almost a root cause of most of our chronic degenerative conditions nowadays and a little bit of about microbiome and epigenetics with this lifestyle so definitions clarifications um the names that you see in pink fritery and frugivore raw vegan raw food are those dietary patterns that you don't necessarily have to cook your food and there are so many adepts to these categories but then we have all other type of lifestyle for example the vegan movement vegan is an ethical stand as we know but many people use vegan diet to refer to a plant-based diet we have plant-based diet we have whole foods when people talk about whole foods it's not necessarily vegan some people include meat in that category that's why we use whole food plant-based um we have the nutritarians that only say focus on the highly nutritionist food we have omnivores so all these definitions but what does it mean to be a raw vegan well it means that we eat our food in the natural state at the room temperature however we find it in nature from the original source that means that if i have a fruit tree i don't have it but somebody collected for me and i bought it at the supermarket so if i had a fruit tree and i just reached my hand you know an apple and i cut it that's exactly what it means to be a raw vegan raw because it's an altered non-cooked is perfectly cooked by the sun um the sun really is an important aspect in our lives for on overall health uh and also plays an important role in cooking our food that's you know one of the principles of this lifestyle and vegan because we are not supposed to be depending on other living beings to get most of our nutrition so that's the lifestyle that i advocate for um there is uh some people who are raw foodist but some of them include raw milk for example from animals or raw eggs or raw meat even raw fish so i'm not talking about raw foodism can be interchangeable sometimes some people call themselves raw foodist i think raw vegan is more like what i actually embody now when you come across raw vegan channels or accounts you're gonna find a lot of crazy stuff and it's not crazy because every single one of these items probably has its time and place but that doesn't mean that this is what all raw vegans do when people think about raw veganism they think oh the fasters you know the ones that do enemas the ones that always are juicing or dry fasting or sungazing or breatharianism or 30 bananas a day or water fasting rental for you know all these approaches and terminologies that people have used and it's not necessarily bad you know sometimes people need enemas because they're so constipated nothing wrong with that but until what point you're going to rely on enemas to flush your colon you know if you have a high fiber diet you don't need enemas but that's another story i just want to clarify that when we talk about ravenism i'm not talking about any of these concepts if people are doing that and they claim to be raw vegans just you know follow the message of raw veganism but not necessarily the other things again it's not bad sometimes fasting you know it's therapeutic but ravionism has nothing to do with this okay now let's move on on the human specific diet um i just want to point out that if you're religious the way the best argument to convince someone who is religious i mean in the christianity you know adam and eve what was the first type of uh diet that they followed robbie gonna say they were in the garden of eden and they you know even god commanded them to you should eat everything that grows from the trees from plants from the bushes that's that's for you to eat and those were the first ravigans if you are christian and believer if you are on the other hand atheist or agnostic more scientifically oriented and you believe in evolution anthropology etc well remember that for life to originate we have you know this uh kind of uh experiment where you resemble the original conditions for life to occur on earth when you have humidity you have sunlight you have warm you have water and if you agitate those elements you know there were some hydrogen molecules carbon um oxygen etc to form the first elements carbon you know carbohydrates proteins and then living organisms etc that's what evolution says right first we have a nice primitive environment then unicellular organisms multicellular organisms fish amphibious reptiles birds mammals and then the homo species etc etc whatever you believe if you believe in this evolutionary approach we necessarily needed the right environment and the right environment for that is the tropics some people argue you know especially the palios and the kiddos and the carnivores like we were neanderthals and that we were living in caves chasing mammoths and big animals and then we ate a lot of meat that's probably the ones who migrated because i can show you here according to this map about anthropological studies live originated in the equatorial areas and then we migrated like in this map you can see different hot spots here in in orange and most of them are in countries and in regions that are in the tropical areas in the ecuador close to the ecuador as soon as humans started to move obviously obviously they had to adapt right they had to adapt if they moved chasing food chasing you know the i'm referring to raw veganism because yeah initially before the fire existed before agriculture existed before hunting and developing of all these tools to chase animals we were collectors we were so lazy we were like yeah you know bananas papaya we were in the tropics eventually we had to move and we had to adapt agriculture started fire discovery tools creation hunting etc so is it does it mean that because we cook our food we are supposed to be eating cooked food we can adapt to eat good food nothing wrong with that what is my livelihood my chances of survival with raw vegan food versus a whole food plant-based diet healthy cooked vegan food what are my chances to you know living a decade longer than if i eat cooked food i don't know but the quality of life the preservation of um i don't know good skin good tissues pain-free more vitality more energy for me that's a great exchange you know i don't want to be immortal but i just think that my body functions more optimally when i feed it with the food that is designed for us to eat many say well i live in the uk i used to live in the uk as well and i follow a raw vegan diet over there you say well the uk has is an island we don't have tropical fruits it's not natural for us well nothing is natural nowadays uh fortunately our modern lifestyle allow us to have all these imports allow us to have heating in our houses and all these things that make our life easier so you know if you want to take a natural approach to that yeah you should eat locally you should eat ethically sourced you should eat um as organic as possible but also don't forget about your origins you know just because we adapted doesn't mean that is the best for us and if you can accommodate your environment and your sources for you to procure your vehicle and keep it in a healthier state take advantage of it take advantage of the imports take advantage of the money that you have so you can buy the best fuel for your body so i spend a lot of money in fruits and vegetables but i don't care because it's an investment on myself in my health and i feel at my best and it's an investment because i'm not going to be relying on pills or procedures you know knocking on the wood in the future to preserve my health as long as i can now this chart you may find it online honestly i don't know who is the author i think i need a citation to give credit to whoever created this but it's a very nice chart if you google or put in your browser i don't use google anymore i use uh dot go but if you put for example um human specific diet or humans are frugi words this is gonna be the first image that appears in your ch in your search and you're gonna see how comparative anatomy makes us understand what is the most suitable diet for us and if you look at the columns that are to the on your right hand side um the fruit giver which is you know the the chimpanzees the bonobos etc really really have the same dentures the same mouth opening angle the same salivary structure punk um surface etc the length of our column the length of our small bowel etc is very similar obviously we are not climbing trees but we have that capacity we have lost uh most of our mobility uh abilities because of our sedentary lifestyle and everything in the modern societies made us deviate from what we were originally designed to do and eat so if you compare by comparative anatomy um all the features of a fruit giver versus a human we are very similar and i mean this is not a conference for carnivores to convince you that we are not carnivores but this chart is very good to explain the differences and the similarities and again you know our colon salivary glands liver size limbs locomotion cooling system nails all these things we really resemble the homo species we are homo sapiens but there are many homos in that uh genre or classification in terms of evolution now for me the human specific diet is something that is natural that is attractive to the eye that's why we have color vision because we can detect what is ripe we can smell what is good for us there is no need to cook it you know it's just right there obviously if we live in thailand or in costa rica we will have access to our original diet now pubmed pubmed is a collection of medical literature and biological sciences that collects all the evidence to support something in terms of health related issues so if you go to pubmed and if you put fruitarian diet or raw vegan diet um you're gonna find not many results for example i think i did this search maybe a year ago if i put plant-based diet i came across more than 500 results vegan diet 53 results etc etc probably there are more studies nowadays but if you put raw vegan or raw food diet you find less than 100 and most of them are probably rough diets for cats rough diets for pets etc the evidence of raw food diets on humans have not been necessarily studied at the scientific level now remember that back in the 50s and 1920s to 1950s doctors recommended smoking does that mean that just because doctors nowadays do not recommend raw food that means that doesn't apply to us now we know that tobacco smoking is the cause of lung cancer in the past they promoted it the medical system promoted it now you know the medical system promotes steel still unfortunately a moderate approach to everything right everything in moderation um yeah plant-based is getting momentum but it's not quite there you have all this push back and forth of the animal and the um meat and dairy industry to say yeah milk is great and all these things you were always fine some scientific study to support your particular bias or your particular agenda honestly so we shouldn't as i mentioned in this uh slide we really need to wait for scientists to publish an extensive study to prove what is obvious what is obvious for us is our human specific diet based not only on our anatomy but only but also uh on those anthropological facts that i gave you and science for the most part is descriptive right uh you can find science again to describe every single dietary trend that you want and you're going to find science to support it but not for raw veganism and don't take me wrong i know science is good science helps us understand reality to avoid mistakes and to follow the best approach for our greatest benefit what are the features of a good scientific study well has to have a big sample with cases and controls longitudinal long-term randomized double-blinded free of bias or assumptions in the raw vegan diet you're not gonna find a great sample let's say let's compare raw vegans versus cooked vegans you're not gonna find the right sample why because the raw vegan diet is usually promoted by chiropractors naturopaths hippies people that are you know living the van lifestyle or the bicycle or the backpack lifestyle and we kind of discredit and look down to those people because we think that they don't have the credentials or things like that but if you open your mind uh you will realize that probably the wisdom of anecdote still exists and we should not disregard you know some of the teachings that these people are doing and just because it's a single case report or anecdotal evidence shouldn't be disregarded every scientific endeavor starts with a case report an observation an anecdote and from there we can collect a big sample and put it to a test in the case of ravigans you have you know people who follow a kind of like gourmet raw vegan some people who are more into raw nuts and seeds and um you know raw vegan resemblances of every single food item that we know like raw vegan pizza raw vegan burger raw vegan pasta or things that are more elaborated but are not necessarily the most optimal so the topic of this talk is how to do um arabic and diet i'll just mention quickly that again in pubmed if you look for raw veganism some articles are gonna pop up like this is a case report uh vegan triple iron man on raw foods and vegetables another one um changes in the quality of life and in new markers after staying in a raw vegan institute a pilot study so you're gonna find a little bit of evidence here and there my favorite one is this one dr brook goldner on social media she's goodbye lupus and she guides with diet and lifestyle teachings women with lupus to overcome that autoimmune disorder and she studied or she presents two case studies of two women who reverse in six weeks lupus nephritis with a raw vegan diet so for me that tells me a lot honestly now um there is another phd i think candidate or maybe she's already a doctor from new york university and her thesis was about is fruit eating responsible for big brains and you can find this article in nature or science magazine and basically the premise is that yes probably the reason why we evolved from our homo cousins is because we actually or the branch or the group of chimpanzees or bonobos whoever are our more direct ancestors those are the ones who actually were chasing for the most colorful nutritious food and that's usually colorful tropical fruits so she explains a lot about that if you're interested this is something to check um this is basically i'm going to skip it because probably i'm over time but i just wanted to explain how to how to follow arabic and lifestyle so what foods you should eat and i put you know in different sizes in my characters at the top our lifestyle is based on fresh fruits people think oh fruit has so much sugar fruit is not enough fruit is deficient this is extremist i'm not saying only fruit i'm saying the majority of our calories in this lifestyle should come for fruit from fruit but not every kind of fruit i'm not going to get all my calories if i just eat strawberries for example i really focus on tropical fruit because those are the most digestible friendly or digestion friendly those are the most hydrating softer to my organism for my digestive tract everything is packed in a nice presentation with tropical fruit i can eat for breakfast you know a couple of papayas and i'm satisfied until lunch that's just an example or i can do you know mixing bananas with blueberry smoothie or spinach things that are combining or in the right combination that's another whole subject but i would encourage you to investigate more on yourself and educate yourself don't blame the ex-vegans or ex-raw vegans of um their failures and don't blame the diet you know just let's just be honest mature enough to understand that probably they didn't do it the right way um and how is the right way to follow this your calories should come from carbohydrates and our carbohydrates in a rowing and lifestyle is fruit and again prefer tropical fruit over mountain fruit like berries blueberries those are great as compliments like to increase your antioxidants to increase all the benefits of berries but not necessarily should constitute your meal your meals should come the bulk of it a big juicy ripe preferably local but if you're in the uk obviously they're not local bananas well rely on imports you know that's my big emphasis people forget about the consumption of fruit and they focus on raw vegan burgers raw vegan brownies no the purpose of this lifestyle is not to keep it raw is to keep it as close as nature intended for us to eat as possible so the fruit is a key then the vegetables of course uh monkeys and our cousins in the homo category eat a lot of leafy greens and that's a big component of our diet as well vegetables you know the ones that are fruits actually cucumbers a fruit tomato is a fruit zucchini is a fruit peppers are fruits everything that has a seed is a fruit so yes we eat a lot of fruity vegetables but we also eat roots like in small quantities obviously like shredded carrots beets uh cruciferous veggies sometimes most of the times we prefer um sprouts for example those are great sources of protein antioxidants nutrition all the things that the greens gave us i mean probably some of you are knowledgeable about the benefits of eating more greens fresh greens if you're gonna eat spinach for example and if you want to incorporate more raw foods and vegetables don't cook your spinach eat them fresh they're more nutritious more satisfying more hydrating and you're going to preserve all the enzymes inside of them then sprouts as i mentioned i mentioned nuts and seeds below because our priorities again is carbohydrates raw nuts and seeds are fats and we keep our fats low um in the winter sometimes i increase my fat intake just to get me through it but it's not 30 or 40 you know many people don't realize how much fat they're eating until they document their intakes so in our lifestyle fat is secondary lettuce has fat bananas have fat yeah we should supplement our diet with you know maybe a handful of seeds and nuts but not everything some people say oh rubbing a lifestyle let's eat the whole bag of nuts that's not the way because you're gonna get constipated you're gonna feel bloated you're gonna feel terrible fat slows you down focus on the fruit i'm not saying deprive your calories i'm saying the calories should come from fruit and obviously you have dry fruits and vegetables not milks not raw nut butters seaweed at the bottom i put olive oil coconut oil with a question mark because again this is processed food probably was not heated during the extraction probably it's cold press probably it's extra virgin whatever adjective that is for marketing purposes that gives you the the comfort to say oh it's super healthy you know extra virgin cold press um it's a processed food oils are processed foods so i put question mark because let's be honest a tablespoon on your salad of olive oil is not gonna hurt you but i don't need it i would rather eat like a third or half of an avocado and i get my fats you know or sometimes i put in my dressing chia seeds or flax seeds or hemp seeds and i have my omega-3 requirements fulfilled when i do that or in my smoothies there are so many ways to do it but this is the list of priorities fermented foods again controversial do you need it to have a great microbiome probably not because if you have your microbiome being fed by high fiber fruit and vegetables i don't think you need a little bit of help with fermented food some people may need it for transition people who are living the omnivore diet maybe they need it because they are not having fiber so you know if you if you want to incorporate it it's not bad but it's not a must so just to summarize carbohydrate is our main fuel prefer fresh ripe seasonal local and if possible organic if not just wash it pretty well um then if you cannot get all your calories from tropical tropical fruit because it's so expensive well rely on root vegetables cook them but never boil them sorry boil them but never fry them or use like uh you know yeah oils basically to cook it you should steam it boil it or bake it rely on vegetables keep the fats low how much is is low eight to ten percent of fats is ideal and to have that awareness again you can use apps like chronometer.com you can put your daily intake or whatever just document your your your calories document the food that you're eating and you will find out how much fat you are consuming you will be surprised sometimes you will reach 25 and you didn't know you thought that you were eating low fat and it's not the case i wouldn't go above 20 for health purposes and this is a chart of comparing comparison of oils the red ones are the most saturated ones and the most uh not optimal for our circulatory system in our heart so you can see coconut oil it's like has this big red band because it's saturated and it's bad for you coconut oil for cooking is a no-no um canola oil sunflower oil flaxseed oil probably but again oils are processed food i will avoid them honestly and protein don't worry about it again this is a screenshot of my chronometer track of what i eat on a day i don't know if you can see but i put bananas blueberry frozen and sweden because i ate a smoothie that day i put some dates i put some chia seeds and basically that was a big jar of smoothie and i did it for practical purposes but if you can eat whole foods rather than blend it that's much better but you know it doesn't hurt you so i documented everything that i ate and even though i'm a petite woman i eat over 2 000 calories on a raw vegan diet and you can see here on the left hand side column the bars the blue the the red and the green my total uh protein and carbs and fat again um at the top of all my requirements you can see here the vitamins you know i'm exceeding vitamin b's vitamin c vitamin a uh sometimes vitamin e i incorporate different type of nuts just to get my levels up you don't have to eat 100 of everything every single day your body is so wise that when you don't need something it stores it when you are deficient on something it gets to the stores until our own stores are depleted then that when we fall in deficiencies but again this is just to point out that you don't have to have everything at once um my amino acids you know with this same breakdown of all that food that i eat on a day i have almost all my requirements in essential amino acids there is no deficiency whatsoever iron again 82 well tomorrow maybe i'll get 120 and i'll be fine focus on the greens many people neglect leafy greens prefer them fresh don't cook them and that's why i say tender leafy greens you don't naturally you wouldn't be inclined to you know go and grass on kale you will be more inclined to romaine lettuce or spinach or um i don't know like lamb lettuce all these tender leafy greens because they give you a lot of nutrition vitamins of course we are vegan so b12 is always a must and vitamin d if you live in cold weather iodine of course i mean seaweeds gives you plenty calcium every time everything has calcium origins as calcium greens have calcium and all the elements sink pumpkin seeds you know everything is out there how to get your vitamin b12 i prefer methylcobalamin it comes with lingual presentation or in spray you can get you can get intramuscular injections uh every three months or so but i prefer you know just sublingual that's a less traumatic for me and vitamin d if you can get sun exposure great if not get supplements especially during the winter so i didn't touch much on everything else because i want to have room for questions and i don't want to rush you know so i think this is a a message that i wanted to convey and um if you have any questions i'm you know happy to answer them follow me on my social media at robin doctor i try to update you with what's going on with my life in terms of the events that i'm going to be giving presentations or you know sometimes i share my food what i eat things like that everything with the purpose of improving the health of the people who follow follow me on social media so thank you very much so much for listening and uh i'm happy to to get any questions thank you that was very interesting i you know i don't know much about a vegan diet i have to say but uh i was actually surprised to hear that the bulk of their diet should be fruits so how many foods do you eat per day just a rough idea yeah like for example as i said i usually don't have breakfast because i do the intermittent fasting uh thing which is very beneficial but for beginners you know probably my breakfast will be one papaya or if i can pack two papayas that will be my breakfast then for lunch i will have like um i put uh to soak some chia seeds and i blend uh maybe two bananas and then i throw the chia seeds in and it's kind of like a nice pudding and i hope that with more chopped bananas and blueberries and maybe some walnuts on top so that will be my lunch sometimes if i'm still hungry i will eat something along the same line like more bananas or maybe i have apples with me i just keep it practical so many people do more elaborated stuff but let's see i already had two papayas so in my smoothie and my bowl with bananas and blueberries probably four bananas maybe a cup of blueberries maybe a handful of walnuts maybe two tablespoons of chia seeds and that was my my banana blueberry pudding if you want to call it that way for lunch if i want to snack on something more bananas more apples and then at lunch time i forget about fruit and i have a huge salad i mean huge lots of leafy greens chopped tomatoes half of an avocado i do dressings to to make it thicker with celery with zucchini so instead of adding more avocados i make a more thickened dressing just relying on a little bit of fat and it's so satisfying and delicious just a matter of educating yourself and being more creative but yeah sometimes i eat mangoes instead of papayas for breakfast but it's always fruit in the morning and lunch time and then i focus on the veggies okay that sounds interesting and i have a question somebody's asking what about legumes and whole grains do you just have them like sprouted or yeah i sometimes eat sprouts in my dinner like my toppings probably like alfalfa sprouts or lentil sprouts or but it's not necessarily like uh my main focus i know that beans are emphasized a lot in the cooked plant-based uh whole food diet but it's not necessarily something that is a must you know i can get all the nutrition from from beans from fruits and leafy greens and seeds it's interesting you say that because although i love legumes and i follow you know no oil whole plant-based diet i don't think i eat that much you know i actually eat more fruits and vegetables but one of the things you know i didn't know is that you mentioned it is actually okay to steam or even boil your vegetables and mushrooms so if you like you know because somebody was asking it is probably much easier to be a raw vegan if you're in a warm climate so you know in the uk when it is cold it is okay to actually boil and steam the vegetables and maybe even make a soup or something of course i mean there is a lot of myths in the raw vegan movement some people think oh if you cook your food is toxic the toxicity of cooking our food comes from heating the fats or heating things that are going to generate trans fats or acrylamides things like that if you cook or boil with uh you know just just boil or steam some veggies well probably you're gonna kill a little bit of the enzymes but not a hundred percent you're still gonna get some nutrition so i don't think there's anything wrong with that okay for me i don't choose to do that because i just feel like my energy is just like uh i need to rest after a meal that even if it's cooked steamed veggies or something but you know if you're in the winter i used to do that once in a while like okay i need something warm and nothing wrong with that you know okay one last question because i love coffee i drink a lot of coffee and tea but i always time it with my vegetables and foods because you know of the absorption of nutrients and also i think i i don't know i haven't tried it but i think it might actually give me like a reflux you know kind of a heartburn so how do you do that you drink tea or coffee with you know a raw vegan diet so i'll i have to be super honest you know i have a youtube channel and i put like a video how to quit coffee because i honestly think that if we follow a lifestyle that is healthy we are not supposed to be depending on a stimulant if you have your nice you know sleeping hours i just feel energized just with my seven eight hours sleep running first thing in the morning taking a cold shower positive mindset i don't need a stimulant to feel energized but i'm a doctor i'm sleep deprived all the time just because of the modernity and probably i take late night reading sometimes i use a little bit of coffee to kick out myself and keep making diagnosis in the morning just because i need the mental focus and glaring i don't think it's super detrimental like many people uh make it believe obviously if you have three cups of coffee per day well you need to cut back a little bit but you know if you just need to feel the stimulation a little bit once in a while when you really need it i don't think it's bad i do it occasionally but i procure not to do it that's very interesting thank you so much i really enjoyed it i think you know we don't really hear much about you know kind of a raw vegan diet on how to do that just one last question is coming true brenda davis says that a raw vegan diet may be beneficial for puberty inflammatory arthritis what do you think well obviously of course i mean i'm a runner and my joints hurt the most when i uh when i wasn't a raw vegan i had to recover a lot i have to warm up because in the morning i was stiff and it's inflammation in my ar in my joints so in chronic arthritis just go to uh dr brooke goldner goodbye lupus even though you don't have lupus you have arthritis or whoever has arthritis it's a type of autoimmune disorder and i'm sorry i didn't touch based on inflammation but a raw vegan diet amongst the whole food plant-based diet is the least inflammatory diet so fruit is anti-inflammatory raw is anti-inflammatory so if you want to decrease your pain in arthritis or any autoimmune disease incorporate like 90 or if you can rob again and you will improve tremendously yeah to be honest i think you know because i used to suffer from chronic migraines i think if you're in pain and you're desperate definitely try it why not you know just give it a try so that was lovely i really enjoyed it already thank you so much for joining us and i think it is lunch time your time isn't it no um yeah it's one lunch all right have a nice day and i'll speak to you soon then thank you yeah thank you for having me have a great time bye bye well that was very interesting i learned something new but a lot actually and our next talk is actually very interesting as well it is a topic we haven't covered before so that's why it is very interesting it is about the skin health and our speaker first of all i should actually say that unfortunately she cannot make it she has some internet issues but she was kind enough to actually send us a recording which we are going to play to you and she's going to join us for q and d so if you have any questions please write in the chat box she is going to join us after the recording to answer your questions so her name is dr sonia gandhi she is a gp and a lifestyle medicine physician with a special interest in dermatology skin issues and her talk is titled skin deep and i think we are going to play the recording now just give me a second yeah it's coming up thank you plant-based powered expo and plant-based health professionals for inviting me to speak to you today about skin the title of my talk today is skin deep scratching beneath the surface my name is dr sonia gandhi and i'm an nhs gp at a practice in south west london i have a special interest in dermatology and i'm also a certified lifestyle medicine physician working for the newly on launched online service called plant-based health online so without further ado let i'm going to take you on a whistle stop tour exploring what the skin is what its function is its anatomy the role of vitamin d sun and skin cancer modern day skin problems and lifestyle modifications for healthy skin so let's look at what skin is it's the largest organ in the body and it has a surface area of approximately 1.8 meters squared and weighs approximately 16 of the of the body's weight what does skin do let's have a look at its function well often when we think of skin we often equate it with aesthetics and whilst in 2018 the cosmetic industry was worth a staggering 507.8 billion us dollars it's actually projected to be worth around 758.4 billion us dollars by 2025. makeup and cosmetics have actually been ubiquitous throughout history with the ancient egyptians applying makeup not only uh to enhance their looks but also for symbolic and ritualistic purposes but aside from the aesthetic aspect of skin it actually plays a significant and essential role in our health and well-being it acts as a barrier against toxins chemicals and unwanted pathogens it plays a crucial role in regulating our body temperature it controls water loss it is a sensory organ it protects us against the sun's harmful arrays and it plays a critical role in vitamin d production so let's now have a look at the anatomy of skin well the skin is essentially composed of three layers the epidermis the dermis and the hypodermis which is also known as the subcutis or subcutaneous fat layer the epidermis is further divided up into four layers and the dermis plays host to sebaceous glands which are just here attached to hair follicles sweat glands blood vessels and nerves let's look at the epidermis a bit more detail was it's the outer covering and as i've mentioned it consists of four layers the stratum corneum the stratum granulosum the stratum spinosum and the stratum bisali the epidermis uh contains various and different cell types one of them is called the keratinocytes these produce keratin which is an essential component of hair and nails and it also provides physical protection and waterproofs the skin there are also melanocytes in the epidermis these produce melanin and provide skin its colour and they also provide as protection against the sun langerhans cells um are also found in the epidermis and these are part of the immune system they are the outermost sentinel of the immune system they actually keep guard um there are also miracle cells in the epidermis which are involved in a sensory they have a sensory role involved in touch the epidermis varies in thickness on differing body sites so from most of the body the epidermis measures about 0.1 millimeters but on the palms and the soles the epidermis can be in the range of 0.8 to 1.4 millimeters the dermis lies immediately below the epidermis and it consists of two layers the papillary layer and the reticular layer and the papillary layer contains nerve endings and the reticular layer contains the collagen elastin hyaluronic acid the um and together the dermis provides um structural strength to skin it has all that supportive connective tissue within it it contains the fibroblasts which make the collagen and and elastin it also as i said contains sebaceous glands sweat glands hair follicles blood vessels nerves and lymphatics and it varies in thickness from 0.6 millimeters in the eyelids to 3 millimeters or more on the back the palms and the soles and then we have the subcutis or the hypodermis layer and this sits below the dermis it is a loose connect a loose layer a layer of loose connective tissue and flat and it acts as an insulator and attaches to attaches the skin to underlying fascia now skin is not a static organ it's a dynamic organ so it changes as we age when we're younger the skin is smoother thicker and tighter as we age we then develop wrinkles deep wrinkles and as you can see in the dermis there's an abundance of fibroblasts uh an abundance of collagen elastin and hyaluronic acid but as we age you can see that there is a lack of these essential components that provide the skin it's tensile and elastic so what happens in the aging process well it's um is based on intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors so genetics thinning of the skin the presence of fine wrinkles dry skin telomere shortening telomeres are the caps that are found at the end of our chromosomes and shortening of these contributes to aging process also hormone fluctuating hormone levels particularly decreasing estrogen around the time of menopause oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction these all lead to an impaired function of the skin barrier now the extrinsic factors these are essentially environmental factors that speed up the intrinsic aging process these consist of pollution smoking alcohol nutrition impaired sleep stress and ultraviolet light so now let's move on to talk look at sun vitamin d and skin cancer sun is it our friend or is it our full vitamin d um you know we've known since the 1920s that it plays a crucial role in bone health and preventing rickets but we've also since then discovered that it regulates more than 200 genes and it plays an important role in immunity both in terms of infectious diseases and autoimmune conditions um such as um rheumatological conditions also in cardiovascular health and there's actually ongoing research looking at its role in cancer and vitamin d is not actually a vitamin it's a pro hormone that's produced in the sun in the skin during exposure to sunlight um and it's particularly the uvb rays that it needs exposure to in order to be synthesized you require around 10 minutes per day for paler skins and um around 25 minutes per day for darker skins in order for the vitamin d to be synthesized but the problem with countries like the uk that are that lie in northern latitudes is that during the ottoman winter months from october through to march we just do not get enough uvb from the sun to activate this vitamin d synthesis so that's why it's actually recommended that we should all be taking a vitamin d supplement and as we've already mentioned we know that vitamin d has a role in in protecting us against infectious diseases in respiratory infections and whilst the data uncovered specifically is not yet conclusive there is growing circumstantial evidence that it does have a significant role to play so on one hand we're told that we need more sun exposure for vitamin d activation yet on the other hand we're told to avoid the sun due to the risk of skin cancers so it can be really really confusing and the rates of skin cancer have risen so significantly since the 1970s that melanoma is now the fifth most common cancer in the uk and every year approximately 15 000 people are diagnosed with melanoma and the main risk factors for melanoma are uv exposure and in fact the royal marsden and hospital actually cite that significant sun exposure in childhood is the single most important lifestyle risk factor and that blistering sunburn during childhood or young adulthood actually doubles the chances of developing melanoma later on in life and then other risk factors are fair skin genetics immune deficiency or a large number of moles and with melanoma we are really looking at these changes here the abcd asymmetry if the most looking is more lesions looking um asymmetrical border if it's got an irregular border if there are any mixed colours or colour changes the diameter particularly if it's six millimeters or above and sometimes melanoma can be smaller around four millimeters and also if the mole is evolving if it's uh changed if it's become itchy or bleeding or irritating then these are all warning signs the other type of skin cancer is the non-melanoma type these consist this consists of either the bcc basal cell carcinoma or the scc squamous cell carcinoma and whilst these this type of cancer non-melanoma are not metastatic they can still cause significant local localized destruction of the tissue so can lifestyle play a role in skin cancer well we know that sun protection is critical so wearing a sun block of an spf minimum 30 to provide protection against the uvb rays and also it should have a uva rating is for aging of four or five we shall be also wearing a wide brimmed hat in the summer seeking the shade and avoiding the intense midday sun and also um there's been some research into looking at tomatoes because tomatoes are rich in a chemical called lycopene and studies in the last two decades have shown that eating tomatoes or tomato derived products has shown that there's a decrease in sensitivity to uv light and as a result decreased sun induced redness by around 40 now there's also a role of vitamin b3 which is also known as nicotinamide and this plays a role in the repair of melanocytes and studies in australia have shown that vitamin b3 is safe and effective in reducing the rates of new non-melanoma skin cancers such as sccs or bcc's and they possibly they might play a role in the prevention of melanoma but there is ongoing research in this and and whilst this is common practice in australia um it's not quite common practice right in the uk so let's look at modern day skin problems let's have a look at acne first acne it's really common uh the worldwide prevalence is about 9.4 and approximately 85 of adolescents are affected and it takes up uh 3.5 million gp appointments each year we think it's multi-factorial um genetics are involved hormones it's an inflammatory condition environment also has a role to play particularly diet and acne causes significant psychological distress and it causes a painful infection and scarring so what happens in acne well you can see from this slide here this is a healthy sebaceous um gland here this is the pore and this is known as the pile of sebaceous unit which contains the hair follicle when there's an accumulation of sebum from the sebaceous gland and accumulation of dead skin cells known as hyperkertinization this blocks the hair follicle it plugs it and then you then get a proliferation of the bacteria c acnes which results in inflammation and just on the right hand side here you can just see the different types of acne pimples this is a healthy highly sebaceous unit this is a white head where the core is sealed within the skin and open uh a commodore where are known as a blackhead where the skin is open and then you then get infection and then you then develop the papule into a pasture so let's look at the biochemistry what's happening um from a biochemical perspective in acne well um something called igf insulin like growth factor and this actually decreases something called fox 01 when um there's a decrease of fox fox o1 there's an increased activation of something called m torque one now m torque one is involved in cell division and metabolism but in acne what happens is that m torque 1 leads to a production of excess sebum and hyperkertinization which is the dead skin cells and then these then lead to the development of acne now dairy and meat contain an amino acid called leucine and leucine directly increases the activation of m torque 1 which again then feeds into this pathway leading into a high instance of acne also um having a diet that has a high gi index so high in sugars and also in dairy again increases circulating insulin which then results in increased igf-1 and increased igf-1 also directly increases sebum production it also increases the amount of circulating androgens which again increase even production again all feeding into the development of acne um now omega-3 fatty acids can help um to lower the inflammation aspect of acne so let's look at other causes or exacerbating factors of acne well over cleansing can be a problem the use of hair styling products oils and serums having a fringe wearing hats and helmets these can all contribute to something called forehead acne we already discussed the role of processed foods high sugar high fat and dairy um mobile phones and these are uh teeming with pathogens you know they are a transmitter of bacteria and also sweaty gym clothes you know if you work out and you don't change out of those sweaty gym clothes or have a shower then that can also trigger the development on or exacerbate acne particularly on the back or the chest so what are the treatments for acne well it's dependent on severity uh traditionally topical benzoyl peroxide topical antibiotics topical retinoids in more severe acne you might use oral antibiotics and females die in it and in very severe acne um oral accutane which is prescribed in secondary care or laser treatment which tends not to be available in the nhs but is available privately are there lifestyle measures that you can do to improve acne absolutely and we know that nutrition plays a significant role in our skin health a whole food plant-based diet which is rich in antioxidants um such as vitamin a c and e these are all crucial for skin health they also contain um a whole plant-based diet also contains omega-3s which are anti-inflammatory and citrus fruits such as vitamin c which are antioxidants these also help stimulate uh collagen productions and as we've alluded to tomatoes which contain lycopene they are anti-inflammatory sweet potatoes and carrots which are rich in beta-carotene which is vitamin a play significant role uh avocados walnuts rich in vitamin e very good for skin health and dark leafy green vegetables contains a type of caratinoid called lutein which is also an antioxidant and we also know from studies that stress can exacerbate acne so it's also important to employ techniques to manage your stress levels so let's have a look now at dermatitis or eczema dermatitis is inflammation of the skin we think in 50 of cases it's genetic due to mutation of the filigreen gene one in five children suffer from it one in 12 adults and it causes severe itch redness and a rash so what happens in dermatitis or eczema is that there's a breakdown of the skin barrier and then you have immune changes due to these um antigen invasions again resulting in the itch rash and infection so triggers are the triggers for um eczema dermatitis absolutely cow's milk allergy protein and infants can be a trigger contact allergens um pollens central heating particular problem in the winter months air conditioning a problem in the summer months clothing such as wool food allergies swimming in chlorinated water house dust mites hard water and pollution can all be triggers so what are the treatments well exclusion of the trigger factor if it's identifiable the use of topical emollients uh steroid topical steroids or immunomodulated creams such as eledel or protopic and in more severe cases of exam or dermatitis we would use phototherapy or systemic medications such as methotrexate isothioprine cyclosporine or biologicals so are there lifestyle improvements for dermatitis absolutely yes exclusion of the trigger allergen and the most offending foods for dermatitis are cow's milk eggs soy gluten nuts fish and shellfish also washing powders shower gels soaps um all can be triggers for dermatitis as we've already discussed to clothing and hard water hard water increases the exposure of sodium lothril sulfate in soaps and shower gels which irritate the skin and there's a trial called the softer trial which has been running by king's college and in conjunction with um the saint john's dermatology institute guys in st thomas's hospital and they're looking to see whether water softeners can have a role to play in the prevention of um eczema we also know that decreasing processed foods um improves dermatitis eczema and having a diet that's rich in whole food plant-based diets so including fruits vegetables legumes nuts and seeds um improves dermatitis and also there's been some interesting studies from korea looking at fermented foods such as kimchi which have also been shown to have a reduced incidence of dermatitis so let's now move on to psoriasis psoriasis it affects two to three percent of the global population the p concept of age is around 15 to 25 and 50 to 60 years of age 30 of people's psoriasis also have psoriatic arthropathy and there's an increased incidence of psoriasis um with cardiovascular disease and diabetes and also um psoriasis is an autoimmune condition it's inflammatory it it has a high cell turnover and um there is a genetic component to psoriasis there's a family history in 40 to 50 and 75 if the onset is less than 20 years of age the lifetime risk of psoriasis is 4 if there's no family history and 1 um one 28 if one parent is affected and if both parents are affected then that risk goes up to 65 now psoriasis um has a huge social stigma attached to it and we mustn't um underestimate the the mental health impact um that psoriasis has on its patients and the decreased quality of life as a result so as i alluded to there is normally um there's a normally the skin turnovers every 28 days however in psoriasis this is sped up so the skin is turning over every three to four days um due to an inflammatory response where the t cells trigger release of cytokine chemicals resulting in redness itchiness scaliness and plaques and are there triggers for psoriasis absolutely stress alcohol smoking infections obesity drugs such as ibuprofen beta blockers lithium and even injuries such as a cut and abrasion or sunburn and this is known as the kubernetes phenomenon these can all trigger psoriasis so what are the treatments for psoriasis well um emollients vitamin d analogues such as calcitriol or calcitriol tar preparations and in severe cases we use phototherapy and oral systemic medications such as methotrexate cyclosporine or acetone and also biologicals such as the tnf blockers um so are there improvements that you can do through your lifestyle for psoriasis absolutely indeed and there's an abundance of evidence showing that a whole food plant-based diet can help decreasing stress will help um exercise increasing your exercise will help improve psoriasis as well reduction limit or elimination of alcohol and the cessation of smoking so um just a couple of um thoughts as the presentation comes to an end i hope i have shown to you that through lifestyle improvements such as sleep which is important for the repair and regeneration of skin cells it decreases cortisol levels improves hydration maintaining a healthy weight because obesity alters the skin barrier by increasing the amount of exercise we do and maintaining physical activity because it slows down it's aging reducing our stress levels because this decreases inflammation stopping smoking because of the association with oxidative stress um take watching our environment terms of sun protection pollution hard water decreasing or eliminating alcohol because this decreases in inflammation and you know a whole food plant-based diet that's rich in antioxidants such as vitamin a c e omega-3s lycopene lutein all of these are such important aspects of our lifestyle which help in ensuring that we have healthy skin because skin is the outer reflection of our inner health thank you very much and i just have some references here for you if you wish to have a look at these thank you very much for your attention thank you oh that was very interesting and we are very lucky because sonia has actually joined us so she can answer your questions sonia are you there yes i'm here can you see me yes yeah hello hi hi today one day so that was very interesting talk thank you so i'm just going to start with the questions the first one is where was it yes what about prickly heat rush so prickly heat um is actually a rash that tends to come on in conditions of heat and and sweating so hot humid environments um and it tends to be ah a rash that it presents with itch redness again it is a severe itch little bump so it looks prickly that's why it's given the name prickly heat the the actual dermatological name is malaria and it as i said it tends to come on when when the skin is occluded so it's the sweat and glands they can't quite function properly so it becomes a hot sweaty environment so certain clothes might precipitate it you know if you're wearing something that just doesn't let the heat or your sweat transfer that transmit easily that could be a a trigger factor and with regards to sort of lifestyle um improvements for prickly heat i mean really you want to try and keep the area exposed if possible waiting light cool clothing um using you could use something to cool the skin but the mainstay of treatment really is using a topical steroid cream something like hydrocortisone but um it tends to resolve it it's nothing it's not a chronic condition it's not anything uh life-threatening or significant it's just it's annoying and it can be painful but it's it's easily treatable thank you that was good so last question well actually i have one question myself but one question from the audience you mentioned that vitamin c helps to stimulate the production of collagen are there any other foods you would suggest um i mean really just you know having a whole food plant-based diet um will ensure that you're getting all the the antioxidants that you need not just for healthy skin but just general good health and but as you know skin is an outer reflection of our inner health so if we are eating in a healthy healthful way that will manifest but i mean you know there's an abundance of foods that have vitamins you know mainly it's like the citrus fruits you know kiwis of vitamin c and there's so many foods out there that have got they come as packages that don't just have one vitamin but they have other you know several vitamins in them so the aim really is to try and ensure that you're eating the rainbow um every you know every day and trying to eat at least 30 to 40 different varieties of fruit plant-based foods in a week and that's really the healthiest way make sure you're drinking lots of water as well because um you know things like alcohol and caffeine these can actually dehydrate the skin so you really want to keep the skin hydrated so a combination of having a good varied whole food plant-based diet will ensure that you're going to get enough vitamin c in there to to have them good collagen production and unhealthy skin yeah and i think you know it is really good because when you get your vitamin c from foods as you said it comes packed with other nutrients so it's not just one single you know vitamins so you get a rainbow you get a lot of different nutrients that's really good thank you and uh you don't really have a lot of um well there's one more question which uh sun cream lotion would you recommend and which factor that's the last question by the way from the audience okay go ahead um so sunscreen uh really you want to go for a minimum of spf 30. there isn't much difference between 30 and 50 in terms of the percentage protection that you're going to get and it's just a couple of percent more you know so spf 30 is fine and i said it's just two or three percent difference in terms of protection you'll get from sun but 30 is fine there's an um i won't i don't i don't have any allegiances to any particular brands and i think you you just have to find something that suits your skin that also has a uva rating of at least four or five stars on it as well and i guess it depends on the activity you're doing i mean if you're going to be going into a swimming pool or you know you want to make sure that it's um waterproof it doesn't wash off straight away either so it's just finding the right brand for you and if you've got sensitive skin but um there's a there's an abundance of sun lotions out there i think if you go to any reputable pharmacy and they'd be able to point you in the right directions but i don't have any particular allegiances to any particular brand percy it's just a matter of personal choice really finding the one that suits you thank you and the last question is from me you know we talk about the importance of having vitamin d and we know actually if we don't take the supplements we get it from you know sun exposure but at the same time as you mentioned in your talk actually you know sun exposure is one of the main reasons for skin cancer so how can we juggle that you know how can we actually make sure that we you know make it enough but not too much yeah it that's a really good question and it's such a tricky one to answer because on one hand as i mentioned it's really confusing on one hand we're told we need um sun exposure to get our vitamin d production but on the other hand we're worried about you know the development of skin cancer and really you know for paler colored skins um you only really need 10 minutes exposure and that's not necessarily 10 minutes of sun bathing you know this is just 10 minutes of just you know you're out and about you're walking in a park just some sun exposure on your face or your arms or your hands just for 10 minutes for darker skin you need about 25 minutes i think you know if you're beyond that then obviously you might want to think about making sure you're wearing sun protection and i'm taking sensible precautions you know you don't want to necessarily be in the direct sun's rays you know seek shade wear a wide brimmed hat and you know don't put on that tanning oil because you don't want to burn the skin actively um so i know it's a really conflicting one it's really confusing there isn't there isn't a clear cut answer um but i think just it's about being sensible you just do not want your skin to burn you do not want it to get red and so so just walking down the street in the park for 10 minutes without any sunblock you know should be sufficient for you to get enough if you're pale skinned if you're dark i said you need 25 minutes but you know as you know we live in a country that lies in the northern latitude and for six months of the year we just do not get enough sun um exposure here so you need to really supplement during those six months everybody should be that's the advice that everybody should be supplementing vegan or non-vegan i think you know that's uh yeah irrespective of your diet you everybody should be supplementing between october and march thank you that was really great and uh i know you post quite a lot about you know skin issues where do you pause where can people find you um so you could find uh some of my posts on plant the plant-based health online facebook page um and also i i if you want to find out more please con you know do look us up on plant-based health online and also there's some amazing resources on plant-based health professionals as well so um yeah just have a look there um i am on um instagram and facebook as well as dr sonia gandhi um so yeah you could you can find me there as well thank you that was really useful thank you so much for today and i think tim is going to join us now team yes especially the last two talks actually they were new there were something different weren't they so we haven't touched them before it's a very nice sunblock view there oh you should have told me that before yeah mineral based think site fantastic with um you know a nice vegan obviously not tested on animals it's got it's good 25 25 spf 25 there's no chemicals in there it's just uh just since oxide so makes it quite a thick paste yeah but it's you know it's it's pretty good it's got a uva uh equivalent of three-star i think so it's a 25-3-3 okay i must admit i'm one of these people that doesn't wear sunblock actually i was put up in there i was brought up in greece it was just sort of hung out in the sun for like 14 hours a day pretty much without much clothes on some clothes obviously but unless um you probably weren't having you know you're moving you're not lying like you know the waves i like sunbathing actually night in the hot sun at like 40 degrees in a hot sun 35 40 degrees is my idea of a very nice pleasant way to spend the afternoon i know it's shocking really um and doing everything at the opposite of what you said really but to be honest as they get a bit older and and obviously you know as you do get older first when you pay attention more generally you listen to your body actually more because you're you're aware of some of the deterioration naturally yeah um but you do listen to the sort of common sense a little bit more and the science is obviously so i think what you said is really true is a bit you know to get some fresh air and get get your sunlight on your body it's really important but but to really over expose yeah i'm lucky i don't burn at all so i could quite happily lie in the sun for a few hours yeah quite happy more than quite happily the other aspect of that is that um you know people's lifestyles have we are kind of unhealthy aren't we perhaps 40 years ago and from a lifestyle perspective your family would have had all of their habits and we don't realize that that actually has an impact on immune system so you know there's that balance even like what you're consuming can actually protect you against something like lycopene and tomatoes that that can have that's been now shown in studies that it has a perfectific effect against stems on red burning erythema so you know it's i think there's a lot behind it's it's complicated you know the one is the advice it's advice you have for people i know you mentioned that sort of fair skinned people perhaps 10 minutes people asian people maybe 25 minutes what about if you're a black black person you know if you've got very very black skin is that that make a further difference would that be well so the darker you are but obviously uh you're better protected against the sun because you've got the melon and protecting you but having said that um black people and asian people they they can get melanomas it's not it's not that it doesn't happen and then it's just very rare but it can happen so because it's the sun's rays it's ultraviolet radiation you know so if you've got too much of it it can burn you but um in terms of vitamin d absorption the darker you are the longer you need to be in the sun to get the absorption of the sun's rays to activate the vitamin d so it's not the same everybody depends on what color and it's not doesn't matter matter on ethnicity either that's another misnomer people think you know if you're like black or indian or arabic you know that you just you're all one category but you're not within those ethnicities you've still got sub-categories of color coloring tones now there'll be people um who are asian but they could be extremely fair skinned and or they might be darker skinned within i mean you just look at a country like india you know you've got such a variety in skin coloring so not it's not homogenous cohort people it really it depends on your actual skin color rather than your ethnicity does that make sense yeah it's really interesting but my son he's really pale really pale skinned i mean i'm indian and he's he's so white he's just paler than i am and he burns you know if he's not covered in sand block he will go red he'll burn so from that way perspective his skin behaves as if it's a caucasian skin and whereas you know i've got other family members who are much darker and they don't have problems the sun they don't burn you they can stay out a lot longer and and not wear sunblock and and get away with it but i think it's also the ozone layer there's a problem with that now as well you know the breakdown of those on there um i guess due to climate change and how we've been living on this planet that that protective layer in the atmosphere has now gone as well so we're getting we're more exposed to the harmful radiation yeah it is really you know a complex issue isn't it it's not just one aspect we just do our best with what we have available you know yeah and try to optimize it yeah so i didn't really i didn't go into that in detail in the talk because i just wanted to do an overview of lots of different skin conditions i just touched on it but perhaps i should have gone into in a bit more depth i don't know it's really interesting to just talk about it it's perhaps broadcast subject and encourage people to you know go to the resources you mentioned the plant-based professionals website and to consider these aspects especially about the balance i'm sure you both agree that underpinning it the one thing we can do is always you know start seeking that whole food rainbow plant-based diet processed goods exercise mental health you know good lifestyle uh approaches positive thinking is is really important especially when you're you know combating mental health issues and a whole whole aspect of of our modern day living which as you say is so conflicted these days there's so many different considerations as you were but the one underpinning one is that is that whole food rainbow raw food diet i would say having listened to the raw talk i've been raw three times in my life i went we were in 1990 in the year 2000 and again in the year 2010 um both the last two times actually have been paying attention to all those aspects uh mentioned in the talk even so i did get quite i lost a lot of weight a lot of strength felt quite under that energized i think it's important you shouldn't pay attention to your own body and perhaps this comes to the same with skin and sun and you know you listen to your own body and what that's saying and not necessarily fight against it if you come into a back balance that you think rather than being dogmatic and holding on to a set of rules uh is to be flexible and i think with the raw diet i would certainly say from experience of over three decades we would be careful definitely careful you know for a long period although i do know people like kate magic been raw 25 years brought up three kids raw really successfully really helpfully so uh it certainly suits you know some people but uh again it was a really interesting tool to listen to and later thank you thank you for putting together thanks lineup and afternoon and so like accessible and relevant so detailed but easy to access and understand uh it's been a pleasure to listen to thank you for having us thank you yes it's been great and all your members all the people i know you've got a big team there participating and it's growing we've had some really amazing sessions over the last six seven months you know yes always a popular popular viewing for people i think very very very very positive development that we've seen over the last 18 months it's a real growth of the plant-based sub-professionals uh and of course the plant-based just just tell us a little bit before we end up which i know we're gonna do in about one minute because we're just about it six but lately the new development which is the plant-based um health online where you can go and actually seek sort of one-to-one professional consultations now is that yes you can actually kind of you know if you look uh look us up and sonia is part of it i'm part of it and laura freeman so yeah and jennifer fernandez was here earlier so we are a team of healthcare pro plant-based healthcare professionals uh we are advocating lifestyle first and it is yes as you mentioned one-on-one so you get you know your private consultation and you can really focus on nutrition how to you know improve it uh so it is for people who are already following a vegan diet and they want just you know they have health issues there is actually you know we have different specialties as well like you know sonia is obviously covering skin issues and we have lisa simon fertility so it is you know we are actually a nice group of different specialities yeah so have a look and you can book a 10-minute free inquiry call so that is good you know just to get an idea what we offer and if you want to book an appointment so that's great lina i think we'll post that those details in the facebook so keep an eye out for that but we also somebody in our team will be doing a mailchimp shortly find some time to do it get that done but that's going out actually next week there'll be a whole mailchimp about the the the new developments from the publisher professionals so that's just great again thank you thank you to shireen and to all the participants um and for all your supporters too all the people who've been supporting i got a growing membership i think sheree merchant earlier members now that is really impressive so we love to see that go and keep growing i think the next time we see you is in our magazines yes hopefully looking forward to that thank you bye-bye thank you thanks very much", "TZ0_pEQed9Y": "hello my beautiful friend i am just gonna give you some startup tips on what to do just to get your health on track and just remember uh that it's a process you know it's a little step by little step as you get the habits down it's gonna work um you are gonna do great and i'm in it with you so um so the first thing you know to do is to drink water right so we're drinking water um until you get to where you're going you want to make that pretty much all you drink if you like coffee coffee is fine but we just want to be careful about what we add to stuff so coffee is not bad tea is not bad but it's mostly what we throw in it that makes it um bad for us so we throw a lot of sugar in there and i used to not put sugar in my coffee but i would put cream in it and the cream had sugar in it so i was saying oh i don't put sugar in my coffee but i was still getting a lot of sugar because um the cream that i was using had sugar in it so that's that so for drinking water if you get bored with water you can throw some lemon juice in it or some people put fruit in their water like um you could throw kiwi slices in there some people like cucumber water um blueberries pretty much and you sit it in there overnight and your water will have this fruit flavor with it and so as long as it's not you know it's good fruit is good so i wouldn't tell you um not to have fruit you know that kind of sugar is good for you if you want to eat the um you know the fiber out of this fine but um we'll eat the whole fruit because it's fiber with the sugar that's fine but for now just you know put i've seen people put strawberry i've seen people put mint uh when i was fasting i had to do a water fast i i did cheat a little bit i put mint in my water i think i put strawberries i think at one time i put watermelon in my water so just get you a couple water bottles and um you know ones that are big enough to take the fruit and throw some blueberry strawberries raspberries whatever berries berries are good because they are low in sugar so if you are watching a sugar blueberries raspberries strawberries all of those taste really good but they don't have a lot of sugar so water is so important your body you should have at least eight cups of water right so that's 64 ounces but depending on your weight you want to increase so pretty much take your weight divide it by two and that's how many ounces you should have so if you're a hundred pound person then technically you need 50 ounces if you're 200 pounds you need 100 ounces you know you will tinkle a lot at first but that's the best thing um so fruit in your water fruit infused water walmart has some little sugar-free uh crit like crystal light but different flavors that you can throw in your water that kind of make it taste good but be careful for caffeine if you're sensitive to caffeine or pregnant you know you probably don't want to do one with caffeine okay so water um the other thing i want to show you you should be running somewhere i did a video on it i want to do one just for you here it is okay so i made these cute little diagrams for the health course on what your plate should look like so let's see let's see if i can put you on a tripod try pie and okay so this is what american diets usually look like we have our plate we do like half carbohydrates we do a lot of meat and we do very little vegetables and the problem with this is that this will usually be something like mac and cheese or potatoes brown rice or white rice um pasta salad stuff like that you know spaghetti nothing's wrong with that stuff but it's taking up too much of the plate then you have some meat now your meat should be as lean as possible so chicken breasts um um if you do steak a lean steak if you do pork lean pork like nothing that's been fried or even if you did pan sear it to give it some flavor it shouldn't have a lot of fat on it if you have fat you want to trim the fat and not eat the fat just to be real but i believe the carbs are the main problem because the thing about carbs it doesn't have sugar in it a lot of sugar in it but it turns into sugar in your body so once you eat too many carbohydrates our bodies we can't use them all so our body stores it as it turns to sugar and we store it as fat and our bodies have a hard time trying to break down all that sugar because we really don't need it um so that's the basics the skinny of it uh the skinny the basics that we call it the skin okay and then we usually just have a little bit of vegetables and the vegetables are usually like you say it from a can or um you know sometimes we cook them to death which i mean i get it like greens green beans sometimes you slow cook them they kind of they might lose but we want more of those right so here's what your plate should look like and this is what your plate should look like so notice half of it is vegetables and you still got a decent amount you know of your carbs your mac and cheese and stuff and you got a decent amount of meat but you see how much vegetable so if you got a salad it's easy to fill that up if you got broccoli you might have to do more um if you got like you might want to do two vegetables sometimes if you don't love it like you just gotta make yourself eat it do some broccoli and do something else you like like um some zucchini uh squash okra green beans peas peas um are high in carbohydrates but when you're just starting out it's gonna be okay if you're eating peas instead of mac and cheese you're gonna be okay so this is what your plate should look like okay mostly vegetables um you can even switch this up with more meat than the carbs you know than your macaroni because like i said in our bodies uh when we have too many carbohydrates your body really doesn't know what to do with it and so it stores it it breaks down to sugar first and so it's almost like you ate a whole cake it's almost like you ate this much cake of course we know not to eat i have to plate a cake but when we eat this many carbs it settles in our body almost like cake it just it it's too many sugars it breaks down the sugars um and then you know it's okay if you're pregnant not to be active or you got like bed rest or you know something some reason why that's okay um you can still lose weight without being crazy active you know what i'm saying you know but you just want to be careful with your amount so i'm going to show you the difference you see the difference nothing's wrong with me in fact if you have a day when you do do too many like this could even include your bread i didn't mention bread bread rice pasta stuff like that when you have this much say you have a baby like me and i went for it well let's try to have more protein you see what i'm saying because protein balances out carbs so i didn't experiment when i was 27 i was eating uh fruit snacks with the kids and you know fruit snacks supposed to give you energy opposed to making sugar uh i had a pack of fruit snacks and i was like i was like so drowsy i was like oh i know what that is and then i have another pet cause i'm just thinking maybe i'm tripping so i had two and i fell asleep like my body was like i can't handle the sugar and i was like oh that's scary and so i'm not gonna put a label on that because guys heal me but i did something different i had some chocolate which of course very sweet very sugary and i had nuts with it almonds and it didn't do that to me so i realized that if you're going to have a lot of carbohydrates like cake or something try to balance it out with eating nuts with something with fiber so nuts um almonds cashews peanuts um walnuts all that um that balances out so if you had to choose the cake i would suggest get a cake that has some nuts in it um you know or cookie if you have a cookie get a cookie that has nuts in it or oatmeal because that's fiber with the sweet stuff oatmeal has fiber oatmeal is high in carbs but it also has fiber so your body it cancels out so um on a day like today i'm not gonna they like to say a day like this when maybe you have too much bread and so much carbs if you if you know you're gonna go in try to eat more lean meat of course more vegetables but the meat is what's gonna balance out the carbs you can also throw beans in over here because beans have protein um a good amount of protein and fiber and so they will balance out some of the carbohydrates and even though beans have carbs too they kind of get cancelled out with the amount of fiber so beans are like a perfect food because they have carbs protein and fiber and balance themselves out pretty much listen to your body um any as as close as you can get to nature the better um i like juice nothing's wrong with juice but i have stopped drinking juice because there's so much sugar in juice and i really like it i just drink it like like i'm supposed to be drinking water the thing about juice is not bad but juice has sugar which isn't bad but the problem is um this sugar and juice is bad because it when we juice a fruit we get rid of the fiber and all the minerals we get some of the vitamins but we lose the fiber of the fruit so if you ate an orange you'd be getting all that fiber all the pulp you know you're eating all that that's fiber but when you juice the orange all you get is the sugar of the of it so your body's not getting you get some good vitamin c you know other vitamins but you're not getting the full effect of an orange because you kind of juiced it what else can i tell you like um like you said uh frozen is better than canned canned you know vegetables and vegetables is good but when it's canned they usually put a lot of salt in it and so that you know they might not have you know i wouldn't do that i would do um frozen so if you go to walmart they have a lot of dollar bags i do a dollar bags with kale i do dollar bags of shrimp um that's a shrimp i wish dollar bags of spinach and dollar bags of cauliflower okay so it's not about getting rid of everything you love it's just about making small changes for the better um like you said um mac and cheese is is good but what if we split our mac and cheese in half like over here square mac and cheese in half and then took up some vegetable salad did cauliflower with cheese and some bacon to make it taste smoky or smoked paprika tastes like bacon you know and bake that bad boy that'll taste pretty good and what i've done before i've actually mixed them i've actually mixed my carbohydrate my rice with cauliflower and put the cheese and bacon and stuff on there and the guys couldn't tell the difference so i was literally cutting their carbohydrates in half and giving them vegetables and they couldn't tell because it was mixed in that's something you could do too it's just about healthy um swaps so for breakfast what i would consider is your basics eggs bacon is fine is the carbs you're looking for bacon does not have carbs there's a lot of fat but it's is is the carbs looking out for right now so i would do bacon and eggs we are we american diets we love our bread you know so a bagel is a lot of carbohydrates if you were going to have a bagel i'd say have half a bagel and uh i would definitely not eat a bagel on its own i would eat a bagel with bacon and eggs or turkey sausage and eggs or turkey bacon eggs okay eggs are perfect food a lot of people do white egg whites you can do that but for this purpose i'm not concerned about fat the carbs are what we need to look at because carbs break down into your body as sugar and sugar does turn into fat and it gives you that slumpy feeling and that's what gives people type 2 diabetes and we're not playing with that gestational diabetes whatever okay so yeah for breakfast i would do bacon and eggs with turkey sauce and eggs um you can have some fruit on the side you just want to be careful if you do if you do a bread if you do toast i would do one piece of toast if you do fruit i would do a moderate amount of fruit because it is kind of sweet so maybe like a handful of fruit um yeah so if i had a um a breakfast plate i'm not trying to confuse you but if this is my breakfast plate this would be eggs so maybe two eggs and then i would do maybe two pieces of sauce two pieces of bacon and this could be one toast or one toast and some fruit i wouldn't do a whole bagel i wouldn't do two slices i wouldn't do breakfast potatoes i wouldn't do rice i would not do that for breakfast and then for your drink for breakfast i would do water if you do coffee that's cool but be very careful what you put into it for coffee i put half and half and i do sugar-free syrups if you don't like sugar-free i understand you can do real half and half and a real i'm half and having a real syrup like i'm not a real but a full sugar syrup but you want to measure it because if you pour it it could be too much so i have a tablespoon and even though i'm doing sugar free i do two tablespoons sugar-free two tablespoons of half and half in my black coffee so yeah um i think i'm gonna leave it there for lunch um look i'm gonna leave it there and then keep going for lunch again this is your model if you like salad grape salad some meat and then some carbs this is a good start and if you want to flip it you see how this carbs come a little bit more to me you can actually do more me and um and do less carbs if you want to flip it but your vegetables are what make you full they give you fiber they give you vitamins the vegetables are going to start doing stuff for your body like balancing the sugars out balancing things out that you wouldn't be able to do if you just ate the carbs and the meat like the vegetables are life that's what we come from we come from the ground and everything from the ground is so good for us so as close you can get to natural it's good anything that you have to put together in a pot and cook is good stuff that came ready to go is not good it's okay to have it sometimes like uh my husband jay was saying um get the boys in hot pockets get them some ramen so they have something to eat after school and i'm like i don't want to feed them that every day but if you gotta have something around if the kids you know they need something real quick okay i would pick hot pockets over ramen because ramen has tons of salt and ramen has nothing but carbs there's no protein in ramen because it's all noodles so that is not good unless you're gonna add meat to ramen and use half the seasoning i wouldn't do ramen i would do high pockets because hot pockets does have the bread on the outside that's the carb but it's got meat and cheese inside which gives you um protein so you probably won't feel crazy really slumped out eating a hot pocket and when in doubt drop throughout the day keep you some almonds with you almonds um are protein and their fiber and it can keep you full nuts are really good for you um keep fruit with you fruit is okay as long as you eat the whole fruit we're not just drinking juice but listen to your body if you start to feel a little sluggish or you start to feel like uh sleepy or the itis i don't know about you but that's how i feel when i ate um basta if you want something sweet here's what i've been doing i've been taking fruit like blueberries and raspberries i put them in a bowl and i got a few chocolate chips i threw on top and then i put some sugar-free um whipped cream on top and so i'll share with you my walmart grocery i think i sent you a list but they will literally deliver it to you for free or you can pick it up like you get in the car and they put in the trunk for you and they do take cards cat when i cards they take cards and uh ebt so if you have eva team no problem um what else um so yeah that's what i do it's like a parfait so um yeah so again your fruit whatever you want i have a few semi sweet chocolate chips they're very small so you get this chocolatey flavor on this raspberries and i put whipped cream on top sugar-free whipped cream and it tastes really good to me and it really satisfies my sweet tooth for dinner again go back to this what i would do is have um for my typical dinner if i could say um probably like salmon so i take some salmon bacon saute it pan pan sear it that's not deep frying so you're not battering it you just put in a pan with some oil seasoning it salt and pepper maybe some lemon whatever you like um and that is your protein then on the side you can have some green beans or if you think that's a lot of green beans maybe green beans and a salad um or if you do some beans you can do some um some white beans kidney beans whatever things you like um and then uh you know salad or beans or peas uh greens and then if you want something carby i would do a little bit of beans here and some brown rice white rice mac and cheese you know whatever just be really careful about the portions and so that's pretty much it you got desserts covered you got drinks covered snacks you can do protein bars i will show you one that i get that is kind of good so i got these from publix they were on clearance so i bought all of them but i'm out now uh pure protein this one's called chewy chocolate chip it's got 20 grams of protein only three grams of sugar 200 calories so it's like a chewy protein bar i do this um when i'm on the go or when i need something that i know it's not going to make me crash you can also do protein shakes i don't know how you feel about protein shakes but that's a quick one in the middle of the day because it's got a lot of protein it's balanced it's not a lot of sugar and protein shakes usually because it's for people who are exercising and there's a lot of minerals vitamins and minerals in that this is long sorry what else um yeah fruit nuts protein bars and there's some luna bars too i don't know if you like that but luna is like a women's uh granola bar the lemon one so good they have chocolate they have lemon but it's luna like the moon l-u-n-a and they usually about a dollar each or a pack of probably five for five and they're called luna i like the lemon um but i can't say i've ever had luna bright it wasn't good they've all been pretty good and then the kind bars too they could be a little bit um they do have a good amount of sugar in them but they usually have nuts in them too so the one i get is the dark cherry chocolate it tastes like a candy bar but it's got cashews and nuts in it with dark chocolate which is good for you and then most the sugar is probably coming from the cherries that are in there um so that's like a healthy sugar but again listen to your body see what you think um yeah yeah and then if you get like i said if you get tired of drinking water you can try bubbly water i don't know if you like that but bubbly water kind of tastes like soda without the sugar so if you find yourself a sugar-free sweetener to put in there while it's cold you might have something on your hands um if you need a soda if you need a soda get a small soda or get a diet soda don't buy no whole 2 2 liter soda don't buy 20 ounce buy you a can of soda and now they got the baby cans get you a baby can of soda um i think that's everything when you're seasoning your food be careful how much salt you're using don't add sugar to nothing i can't think of anything i make that i add sugar to unless i'm making the cake unless i'm making the cake um pancakes in the morning we've been making sweet potato pancakes so and they don't even ask for sugar and they're really good so i'm gonna send you that recipe too because i know i mean they're not i once said it was like healthy or low carb or anything like that but they're wholesome ingredients so it's sweet potato is the sweetener and you put you put cinnamon nutmeg butter butter's not bad for you margarine and the fake stuff is bad for you okay i know a lot of people think butter's bad of course it's it could be fattening it can be really salty if you use too much of it but butter is natural what else that was weird so i made a fart sound but anyway i'm gonna stop because i go on all day i'm really encouraged and again you're the reason why i'm doing this and um you really inspired me in the beginning to start this so i think this is just another way uh the gods moving this along so i'm sending to you love you and have a blessed day bye girl", "245I8xDIy0A": "what's going on YouTube a suppose you see if you touch a man welcome aboard for my returning please out there welcome back alright so this video we're gonna talk about the top 10 muscle building foods I'm pretty sure you've heard of somebody's and I guarantee you some of these other ones you're like wait what I know it's crazy great stuff but your image am you killing it you hit no waste you're doing the calisthenics push-ups pull-ups all that good stuff that's just one side about you can also make sure that you're consuming the right foods you're putting the right things in your body so number one actually I just finished working out so that's why I'm drinking my protein it's just about done but what I've talked about was this whey protein the primary source of protein should always come from food but a protein shake is a good way to increase that intake to make sure you're getting all the protein you need but of course you want to make sure your primary source of protein and everything is gonna come from food all right otay shakes are supplements that's what they are they're supplemental to your diet your primary source are always comfort food I'm gonna keep telling you guys that like forever it's not going to change pretty sure you guys knew that building next up it's actually going to be oatmeal so there's several different types of oatmeal there's old-fashioned still cuts instead etc different types I do instant oats most of the time Wow instant else is going to be a much better option than pancakes and serving a lot of other breakfast things out there it's still not going to be a better option than some of the other ones I mentioned y'all don't don't do what I do like this Apple Cinnamon stuff don't don't do that don't do that but whole meal is one of the best sources of copper hydrate and it's packed with a lot of nutrients that is pretty important to the whole muscle building process I usually eat oatmeal and the mornings I pop this instant thing in there and I keep it moving but like I said do what I didn't don't do auntie and next up one Alyssa's guess what you guessed it eggs which is in one of my paints the most complete and versatile foods it's also one of my favorite things to include in my diet the protein and eggs have a high biological value that aids in back breakdown also muscle contraction and all you can cook eggs in many different ways I choose to boil eggs I know I read something saying that bull and sometimes home more of the nutrients that's inside without frying them away but at the end of the day boiling is more convenient to me in the morning for getting ready I just throw someone stole and go about doing whatever I got to get ready to come back they're ready to go and they also contain many up minerals bottles to keep you healthy ready to go next up on list don't eat one of these that's going to be avocados so pretty awesome tool to have in your arsenal or toolbox I guess regularly consuming healthy fats like the ones found in avocados help boost the production of testosterone make growth hormones in your body we all know those are two very important things to build in muscle now that doesn't mean you're gonna have a huge massive amount of testosterone woman hormones flowing throughout your body but it's going to help keep your body's natural production of it at its highest throughout the day your testosterone levels rise and fall throughout the week they rise and fall throughout the month a rising fall throughout the year they rise and fall tricks like this is only gonna help you keep it at that highest level that peak that your body naturally produces it's not gonna add any extra stuff in your body similar to the same concept of doing legs before that day and you're trying to work on a certain body parts after leg day your body's testosterone levels have P so you want to work the muscle group that you're trying to work on the most right after that leg day that's best for another video I don't I try to get you some avocados yeah it's pretty good next up on my list is absolutely one of the worst things in the world hottest cheese how do you got that absolutely like cottage cheese like you enjoy it if you do look at this stuff pretty nasty stuff take that bad dog and I kind of let it settle in what kind of cheese is surprisingly a great source of packing on muscle mass one cup contains approximately 27 grams of protein which provides your body with a great source of muscle building fuel so honest thing about a guy's all time not to like it to eat it eat it for what it does to your body next up on the list is going to be another one of my favorites actually eat this probably every single day which a lot of these things I eat every day actually but and this one you guys are gonna know I mentioned it before it's pretty awesome that's going to be some chicken this is another one of my staples I'm not gonna spend too much time talking about chicken and how great it is for you because most of us know that chicken is a great way to pack on some muscle when you talk about your diet it's lower fat and high in protein more do you need to know and the reason I said skinless chicken is because the skin only contains primarily fat so take the skin off or buy it without the scandal on it either way and next up on my list actually going to be a lunchbox and on this kid it's what's inside of the lunchbox which is what I'm going to be actually taking when I had to working a little bit some ground beef actually this is ground turkey mixed with ground beef but we're going to be talking about ground beef but this is another tool that we all probably have not toolbox we know ground beef is an awesome source of protein it does have a little bit more fat than chicken and and stuff like that but it definitely has a lot of protein and of course next up on my list is going to also be vegetables we all know we need vegetables I'm not gonna spend too much time on vegetables and beef and what it does to you some of the best vegetables though for building muscles gonna be bees and spinach broccoli sweet potato and old stalks and just eat broccoli most of the time I'm talking about the testicles but it is - that's the polls go ahead put my lunch up really quick gonna be fruit I eat lots of fruit I through every day not only because I like it Nanako tastes good let me tell it's good for you who's gonna give you a lot of those vitamins natural source of sugar granny I cut out a lot of other sugars this fruit is high in sugar in general but we can go on for days about the benefits of fruit in your diet especially trying to put on muscle there's so many different fruits so many different benefits we be here all day but you need fruit and leave vegetable you're digesting too often sorry excuse me next up all this is going to be tuna fish and so I used to eat tuna fish a lot but kind of backed off from it but that does not take away from how beneficial it is to your diet because it does have a lot of protein factors in place and fish in general contains a lot of omega-3 fatty acids beneficial to building muscle and breaking down that back you want to burn fat you want to build muscle fat is the goal so I know my favorite all-time fish is fried catfish like that is my favorite not really that great for you but it is also to eat it tastes great that's what my favorite fishes my favorite seafood in general don't ever come it's like a shellfish it's great it's awesome I only go to Miami just to get some come right now and last but not least is going to be almonds I do not have almonds with me I just ate the rest of the almonds last night should have picked up some but I did not so we're gonna just talk about a little bit another great source of healthy fat and also protein and the antioxidants in is great for controlling your blood sugar after you eat meals and ultimately great for fighting diseases and stuff like that just a handful of almonds is equal to like one gold egg which is pretty awesome but ultimately looking at this list you can see it is a variety of things you have fruits you have meats you have vegetables you have nuts you have everything it is a variety of things even cottage cheese like I said I have not yet gotten to the tracking of the macros down to the team I just make sure I'm making healthy choices healthy decisions on a date for wife so I just make sure I'm making healthy choices healthy decisions that's what it's about it's not about necessarily sticking to a diet it's about making a healthy life decision choices on a daily basis that's what it's about living a healthy life and that's what I'm gonna help you guys do as always I've got a big nice crowd to tell you do so join the pudding nation so soon to become a bully bird but first we gotta get to to on the game we got to get there fast also makes you follow my Instagram account and I

Cooke welcome hi it's so good to be here and thank you Matt and the North Kent library for inviting me I'm sorry that I'm not there in person I'm sure all of you are sorry that you couldn't do this in person but it's actually kind of fun to bring me right into my kitchen I'm in North Northampton Massachusetts and I love cooking here and I make all of my cookbooks right in this kitchen and today I am going to teach you how to make strawberry shortcake and we're so lucky because strawberries are in season right now I just went to our local farm stand for crimson and clover and I picked up strawberries and here is one of them but I also noticed today that some of the pick your own farms are open to and if you haven't been to pick your own farm it's so much fun to just kind of go there and bring your containers and bring some water to drink and pick some and a mask right now obviously and just pick some berries and the best berries are like the smallest ones and the fresh ones right now are so much better than the ones that you would get like in a regular grocery store so I highly recommend picking and eating and making strawberry shortcake with them so this recipe is sort of three-part we're going to make a biscuit which is like the little shortcake and then we're going to make a little fresh strawberry sauce and we're going to make whipped cream and as matt said i'm the author of lots of chilling cookbooks here's one much the words are backwards that this is from baking class and if you want to and privilege pick it up at the library and it has step-by-step directions on how to make all the recipes we're all made by kids and they work and they're really easy so I hope to pick up the book so what we're gonna do first is you always want to make sure you're like wearing an apron and pulling your hair back then wash your hands and we're gonna preheat the oven to 350 and it's always important to get the oven kind of warm before you start baking because if you just stick here big good right in the oven it might sink so it's really important to get the heat up nice so if you have a piece of paper you could write down some of these ingredients but we're going to start with 1 and 3/4 cups of flour so I'm going to start with the big top measuring and what you want to do when you're measuring flour is to always use this kind of level off like a knife so then you get a really precise measurement see that that's one cup and then I'm going to add 1/2 cup and then 1/4 cup and that will make 1 in 3/4 cup so I'm in again I'll just level it off like that and baking is really like a science so you have to kind of measure correctly otherwise it won't work cooking is a little different you can wing it a little bit more but baking is more of a science so so that's the court so we have 1 and 3/4 cups of flour in there and then we're gonna add 3 tablespoons of sugar and this is basically a biscuit recipe but it's a lot sweeter because you can see there's sugar in it because this is something that servers or papers for the dessert so about 3 tablespoons there and then we are going to add 1/2 teaspoon of salt got a little bit here and salt this kind of a flavor enhancer just like bring out all the flavors in the biscuit and it just tastes good so you always want a little bit of salt and then we're going to add a tablespoon of baking powder and this is the webinar like this when with baking soda baking powder reacts with the liquids and then with the heat it makes it rise it creates like little air bubbles so that the biscuits the short words are missing fluffy I'm just gonna whisk that together those are our dry ingredients and then take four tablespoons of butter and then just cut it i soften this just a little bit just so that it's a little easier to work with we're just gonna take 4 tablespoons stick it in here and chunks so there's a little easier we're going to mash the flour and the butter together to create kind of a little crumbly beginning of the dog and so I'm just gonna take this this is a pastry cutter I don't know if you've ever seen one of these these are great for making biscuits and doing a lot of cooking and you just kind of wanna know if you can see into my bowl but I'm just breaking up the butter so it's in little tiny pieces so it's nicely spread if you don't have one of these open these are great to get they don't cost a whole lot of money you can get them at any kitchen supply store or I even saw them at the rooms for a general store and the other day you can get get them there but if you don't have that you can just use before and I I'm just going to pour that in stir that yeah and the great thing about cooking is that it's gonna never springboard for learning about all kinds of things like math and science even where food comes from and it's also just a fun activity and it's great to do if one celebrates these birthday you want to show a teacher the end of here that you're kind you can make something for them or right now a neighbor maybe who's shut-in okay can't get out that kind of thing so okay so I'm going to stir it a little and then I've got this nice beginning of the dough I'm just gonna kind of knead it in a bowl see that it's so much fun to need wonder if any of you have ever made any bread before so this is a much easier so similar to making bread but it's a quick bread so it's a lot easier to do that okay you just kind of want to Pat it and then I'm gonna put this in the sink just to get it out of the way we're going to Pat it just knead it a tiny bit and kind of like a big cake so yeah and I started cooking when I was young my last name is cooked so I kind of grew up thinking oh I should learn how to cook and my siblings always like they love to watch TV and for some reason I wasn't some into watching TV so I used to always make them things while they were while they were watching TV and cakes and cookies and snacks and things like that for them okay then I'm just gonna pack this with about a quarter inch thick thin there see that and then I'm gonna use a round cookie cutter and just go ahead and cut this out and cut out these short threads and you can also make a mini shortbread if you want to shortcake you don't have to make them big you can make them different sizes this is just a little kind of as a fun round cookie cutter I don't know if you can see but it has edges so it's a little bit of a flower shape and this was actually my grandmother's cookie cutter and have her full collection of cookie cutters it's just so much fun whenever I bake with them I remember her so and then I'm going to place the shortbread just on an ungreased cookie sheet like that and spits it a little bit apart and you can nibble this tool if you want to it's it doesn't have any rag and it it's just basically butter sugar and flour and it tastes pretty yummy excuse me we're gonna go this one's a little thick so I'm just going to Pat that down a little bit and interesting Lee there's put the butter in it and on a hot day like today when I paint my hand is warm and when it touches it it kind of like milk melts it a little bit so it's actually better to keep the dough cooler but and to keep the butter a little bit cooler specially in a hot day so that you have nice and there's something more short but it's too hot tops in it so I'm just gonna make do and then you pick up the scraps like that and again you just keep going until you've used up all the go and then this just gets tossed right into the oven and cook it for about 10 minutes and I think we're gonna have time to see when it comes on the oven to do a couple more here if any of you ever made shortbread before sorry short cakes before is a shortbread I'm sure cakes I remember as a child smiley um my birthday is in June so I often asked for strawberry shortcake for my birthday instead of a regular cake there you go so you can see these ha yeah I'm just gonna toss those right in the oven I'll set the timer for ten minutes and we'll let that bake and well that's baking we're gonna make the strawberry sauce so what I've done is I've already rinsed the fresh berries that I had gotten from the farmers market this morning and you want to rinse your berries just before you use them you don't want to rinse them and then put them in the fridge because they can get moldy so it's better to just keep them in the fridge right when you pick them and then rinse them right before don't rinse before you put them in and then we're going to hold them and pulling a strawberry means basically cutting off the green part the end right there you just don't do that with the knife and you can't compost the holes for water and yeah just go ahead and slice it up and if you're working with little kids like blue toddlers or preschoolers you can actually use a plastic picnic knife for that and just let them cut it with that and then they can cut it up so it's actually a really great activity to do with kids in a preschool or a daycare center in our you have little ones at home because they can eat them as they're making this little strawberry sauce too and cooking is a great way to kind of spend time together as a family I love when I cook with kids to kind of hear what's on their mind what they're thinking about they open up a lot more when they're just sitting there and for the strugglers mmm right now everything's still fresh and I'm gonna just cut up one to two pints you kind of want to do this a little bit in advance because you want to create a little sauce so probably if doing this at home you want to first do the strawberries and then make the biscuits because kind of want to give about an hour for the strawberries and we're gonna put a little sugar on it to kind of create gets a little soupy and nice and syrupy because that's here okay so you mean on on the shortcake so keep cutting up here yeah you could probably use a couple of pints to make enough for this batch of strawberry shortcake and you know strawberries too are great to try growing in your backyard if you can't have a little strawberry patch they're a little tricky to plant and to grow but having it right there and the patch is just wonderful to be able to run out and see even the first strawberries and the season or right my brothers and sisters and I used to have a little contest and from here to see who could find the first strawberry and Arden seasons and then right now it's so great to support all of our local farms and to eat locally we have wonderful farms we're so lucky to live in the Pioneer Valley or we have so many great farms and strawberries lunch this this new one in North Hampton is called Strawberry Fields and it's all it's open right now for secure Island but it's it's a beautiful setting down minato so North Canton cutting into the airport and it just opened I said today is the first day of a zucchini day their picture and their organic strawberries and organic is important i if you can because regular strawberries have a lot of pesticides so if you can buy organic with strawberries it's definitely important food to get organic versus regular so and working with knives you know I just to give my kids but I think when they turned about seven I would give them their own paradise after prep sing a lot with this plastic knife and once you mastered using a plastic knife you can really learn to use a paring knife carefully and it's it's great for kids to use real tools and and the seven year olds can definitely nice apparently so and you can gauge it and if you feel like that's too young for your kids you can wait a little lot more but it's so much fun to see them when they do actually something it makes something feel so proud of their creations so we go so we have pipe of strawberries stick a compost backyard and this week it really brings out the juices - I mean if you don't have to add the sugar it creates more of the juice I guess you could use a little bit of like orange juice or something if you want to get it seriously but you know it's not quite syrupy yet this if you let it sit for about an hour it will get more syrupy and I can show you what it looks like listening out an hour goes the other way and you can see the Jesus I don't know if you can see that but there but it's like half there's a lot of juice there's a few so - they're just from the sugar being added to it in this little strawberry sauce is great for short cakes but it's also great for putting on yogurt or making like a little yogurt parfait or the yogurt look I love that slide he'll maple yogurt right now it's so yummy take a little of that some of this strawberry sauce on top and then put a little granola on it too and it's makes its rific healthy breakfast okay so we're gonna set that aside and then the next part of the recipe is to make whipped cream and I've got gonna started a little bit all right because I mean y-you can just sit here listening to the machine running but to make whipped cream this we start with just a container a pint of whipping cream and it should be really cold and the bowl should be cold too and you pour it in and you add a little bit of vanilla just a little bit of vanilla and a little bit of sugar like about a tablespoon sugar and maybe a capful vanilla and then you mix it up and you want to use the next attachment or if you have a handheld mixer you can use that too but have this for whisk looking pal not the paddle but marvelous and I'm just gonna run this I started this a little bit and we're gonna run it for ncpc and you want to put it into the lock mode if you have a stand-up mixer with this especially if you're working with and you want to do it until soft peaks form and you can see know if you can see this so I do have some kind of soft peaks I had started this before you have to kind of watch whipped cream very carefully because if you over mix it which I've done especially the butter it's the fat separates and it becomes like this thin liquid plus butter that attaches to the whisk so we want to really watch it closely because especially I one minute you turn to butter very quickly and in fact it's kind of fun to see how it makes the butter so if you have two containers you can try one we just let it mix and mix mix and you can see the butter and add a little take it off the whiskey and add a little salt to it and then with the other container just do it enough for to mix the whipped cream see that yeah and I didn't heavily sweetened this I think I just put couple teaspoons of sugar in it but you can taste the vanilla adds a lot of flavor and if you're going to go to the trouble of making strawberry shortcake from scratch he doesn't want to mix it with the cream to save it pies if you make a pie or crumble or crisp or any kind of big dessert um it's just so much better if you put whipped cream on it instead of the cans the cans are kinda guess your like ice cream sundaes things like that but it's worth it to take the time to make home stretch okay so oh the Tigers have to go off it's perfect timing and then he's gonna move the flower out of the way see this and you see that there it's very slightly brown there's just a slight bit of brown on the top but they taste something they smell so good and this gets seven short cakes are really easy first making recipe because there's not a lot of ingredients and its ingredients you mostly have on hands and it's a little bit like making playdough but you get to eat it because you couldn't really shape these into any shape that you want to if you want to do a heart shape or anything like that so and I baked these just before so you want it when you make the strawberries for kids you do want it to be a little bit cool and I let it cool for about an hour on this cooling rack so just clear off my table here a little bit behind a little bit one Shortcake like this we're going to cut it in half carefully cut it in half to two and then you can either put the whipped cream first when the strawberry first or you can kind of layer it I think I'm gonna layer it a little bit so I'm gonna first put this is so nice and juicy put some strawberries on top it can be pretty generous strawberries then a little spoon can always add more whipped cream if you want to and then I'm going to add a little bit more strawberry to the top just get a little bit of juice juice give me this more strawberries maybe a no and then you can just eat it just like that or I was like to garnish my desserts a little bit and we have all this wonderful fresh mint in our garden right now so I just write up right before this I just ran outside and kick some and I'm just going to snip a little bit on top there's a little extra garnish what mint it smells so good you could make a little bit of mint lemonade we're gonna just make lemonade and then put a little bit of I'm into that or even just lemon water so with this hmm because I need to have taste since you guys can't have a taste I'll have a little taste but the homemade Shortcake's to taste so much better than the store-bought but sometimes the store-bought have been sitting there for a couple days or even just one day but these are the best to eat kind of right away so mmm so good hmm I wish you were all here to try it whoo Deanna that looks fantastic any questions at the moment I'm wondering if you could tell us so next recommendations for things people might cook after this as you mentioned it's a wonderful starter sure great yeah I mean everything from making your own snacks making your own lunches even making things like dinner if you couldn't raise your hand and tell your parents offer to make dinner one night one of the things that my bro's used to love Tomatoes peanut noodles and peanut noodles are pretty easy just a peanut butter a little bit of soy sauce a little bit of water and you can make a little sauce and put a little ginger I look in it and then toss the noodles in it any kind of noodles really but Chinese noodles taste better but some peanuts and some cilantro on top that's a really easy dinner especially if something can help you cook the noodles that's a great one another one that I'd love to make with my kids and the kids that I cook with is I love to make caprese salad it's just fresh mozzarella tomato and basil and strawberries are very soft so it's easy to cut and same with fresh mozzarella so it's pretty easy to just slice fresh mozzarella and little slices or if you want to use the balls just cutting that with a plastic picnic knife and using cherry tomatoes too so you could make a little salad you could toss it all together fresh mozzarella 2 packs have some cherry tomatoes and a little bit basil and put some olive oil on it and a little bit of salt too that's a great one trying to think there are so many in my books I can show you making class yeah those are some wonderful ideas and actually that kind of leads us right into a question that somebody has about baking Sofia asks what's your favorite thing to bake strawberry shortcake you sleep one way out there it's one of my favorites because it mixes something fresh with a big sit I also like making I love making these cinnamon muffins it's a basic muffin and then you can dip it in butter and then you dip it in cinnamon sugar and there's a fresh French breakfast muffins and my kids always love to make those those are also in baking class but everything from making homemade pop-tarts with with with pie crusts essentially and you just put a little jam in the middle of the pie crust and use a fork to crimp the edges that's another one to think I'll have so many I love to bake opened during the quarantine I don't know about you but we've been baking so much at home and we've made lemon squares snickerdoodles we bake bread make biscuits so I just find that when there's chaos in the world like there is now during the quarantine that cooking can bring a lot of comfort and it can kind of make you be mindful and in the moment and it can bring joy to other people in your family to where you can share you can make something and bring it to them but if they're having a hard day it like totally turns around thank you so much these books as dnm mentioned are they are available at the Dickinson Memorial Library and uh one person asks out there she mentions Lisa mentions that she loves your baking class book oh excuse me and she's made you bread too and she wonders how do you come up with the recipes for your books oh that's a good question well a lot of times I start with something that I made when I was young or something that I loved to eat that I maybe try at a restaurant or something that my kids love to make her eat and then I usually just adapt the recipe so that's or even simpler for kids and part of my recipe process is showing every step so I do step by step photographs so that if you are a pre reader or if you really want to see how something is put together that's that's sort of what the signature of my books is I'm going to slow it down and write it in kid-friendly language and show all the photographs so that it's really easy - to make it and then the kids feel like so proud of what they've made it's easy - to have success when they can follow along the pictures yeah I really appreciate that about your books another thing that I love about your books is that you are gathering recipes from around the world as I mentioned in the intro that's kind of how you got your start with that Watson fellowship and I wonder what strawberry shortcake in particular have you found that seems like in my experience that seems like a very American thing have you found anything any adaptations from around the world well that's a good question I I mean I have seen a shortcake like that in other countries but I'm thinking of the sweet potato cookie that's almost like a biscuit cookie but I have friends in Bob way in my recipe in my cookbook global cooking class and things like waffles waffles are kind of similar like in the Swedish waffles have whipped cream and then they have strawberries on top too but it's a waffle that you make the milder muffle service in Swedish but those are kind of similar with the topping would you make a little bit of a sauce and you can do that with apples or with strawberries but putting whipped cream on the bottles it's different but that's what the Belgium in Belgium they do so I'm just looking quickly at my book to see if there's any other one so I mean there's a lot of recipes for a lot of recipes for baked goods and yeah I do remember in France that strawberries were popular too so and for anybody who's curious about that sweet potato dish you mentioned people might have seen recently on Google they had a doodle about the little thumb piano I don't know if anybody got a chance to see that but that was from Zimbabwe to who and so you can make that connection by trying a recipe from Deanna's book and little instrument yeah yes I know cooking is a great way they just kind of learn about other cultures and to celebrate all the different voices and all the different tastes in our world when I worked on this book I was inspired by this international night that they had at Jackson Street School which is where my kids went and they all the kids set up booths and they had little taste-test foods and they had maps and things from the countries of their heritage and it was a celebration right in our own community of over 50 different countries and it was wonderful event and I love that food was included in it because everybody eats and food is just a great way to kind of celebrate all of our uniqueness and and just our love for each other the food is a great way to kind of share love to I agree that's so beautiful and I can't let you go without asking a question I'm always curious about it with authors I'm wondering if you what you're working on next oh that's a good question well I have a book it's a little toddler book that's called food faces I wish I had a copy here but it's just it's coming out in September but it's all these different food faces that you could make just that snack time that are really easy that make toddlers and preschoolers feel like they're cooking even though there's no heat involved but it has things like a little mouse made out of a strawberry with a fruit leather tail and almonds sliced ears but it's all just kind of a celebration of food and having fun in the kitchen it's kind of enjoying process oh I love it we will definitely be on the lookout for that I wanted to ask about one in the recipes I saw on your website it was like a tomato salad and they had a lot of yeah and that made me think that this this whole farm-to-table movement could work for kids too I mean you can grow tomatoes pretty easily right oh yes yes kids any cancer and the audience if you have a garden just go outside kick it and try a recipe from a tomato that's growing in there you can find recipes on my website for using fresh ingredients pick the peas kids that are that garden and cook are much more likely to trial different kinds of foods and they're not as picky and it's fun to just go out there and kick something work to go to a farmers market and choose something maybe it's something that you've never tried before like kohlrabi or something or fresh turn up and bring it home and work with your parents to find a recipe and and taste it because there's so many wonderful flavors in the world and it's just great to to expand our palates it's sort of like a fun part of growing up it's trying I still remember when I first tasted knowledge I don't like I don't like olives and then I tried one and I was like oh my god these are so good picking peas I didn't think I liked peas because you know I've had them a lot of firms in my friend's house have some canned peas but when we grew them from our garden and we tasted them I just don't love it's almost P season - oh yes I agree that is great you know the strawberries I showed at the beginning I know that our audience is from all over the place but for those of you who are in Northfield there is a farmers market every Thursday and that's where I got these strawberries oh okay and you got them on Thursday yeah it's a couple days let's do this thing I wanted to mention this that fresh strawberries like three days storing them as tenant masks so when you have them you want to cut them up and eat them as quickly as you can where the other the store but once the telephone year they last longer yeah but I'm so glad you've got them at your farmers market oh me too and as Deanna says you know check your Gardens to your own Gardens not just a farmer's markets but I made a little video for our library listeners the other day of me playing in the garden and what the peas climbing up the trellis that time beautiful time of year on my website - I have some principal activities like I have coloring sheets of different fruits and vegetables if you have a rainy day like today right now but coloring I just have a farmers market scavenger hunt on my website that's kind of fun to print out and it says you know look for the tiniest vegetable for the biggest vegetable and that's kind of fun and also the recipe for this strawberry shortcake is on my website - its DN a-- f cook calm so if you want to make it print it out yeah and we have another question from a watcher out there you mentioned that as a kid you were more tempted to cook then to maybe watch TV and the watcher is wondering if you remember what age you started baking and if you remember some of the first things that you made yes well I remember baking a lot with my mother so I think I probably started baking when I was like three and helping her and we used to make carrot cookies from scratch with her guard she was a big burden or so she grew like the most amazing carrots so I do remember making carrot cookies and they were so yummy in fact that recipe it for my website and then I remember wanting probably when I was really wanting that easy bake oven and I got things I pick up in and I did a lot of cooking but I was so disappointed because the cake mixes never tasted very good so I started making my own recipes that I put in the oven so but you know I think I made I made a lot of birthday cakes I love to celebrate I'm from a big family one of six kids so I'd love to like big cakes and cupcakes I think that was one of my first love for baking great thank you and can you make this recipe with other fruit someone suggested what about raspberries yes could do raspberries on you could do blueberry and raspberry you know 4th of July is coming up that's kind of fun both of our usually it season around them you can get the last of the strawberries in the first of the blueberries and just mix them keep it mixed up the sauce just like this but include the blueberries in it raspberries too you could do lots of different berries in there you probably you could even do it with frozen berries if you want to do in the winter if you are picking a socially blueberries they freeze really well with strawberries freeze well too but you you could over I would probably cook it over the stovetop and make a little bit more just make this but put it on the stovetop and make a little bit more the syrup syrup with it with the for some areas but yeah and I guess you could do it with mango or trying to think of some of the other fruits that we love here even mini or not might be kind of good I mean you wouldn't need to have a sugar if it was banana but adding a little bit of banana to this it was gonna using just local sorry alright um I was gonna ask about kale I saw some kale label to the other day dinosaur kale it sounded pretty cool I wondered if there really is a difference among the types of kale yeah I mean dinosaur is just a lot bigger I'm not a real expert on kale but I love that name dinosaur and so I have made kale chips with kids before with the dynasty dinosaur kale and you just cut up cut off cut it off from the stem and then I just toss it with a little bit of olive oil and salt and parmesan and then you roast it essentially a high temperature and then you know we want to watch it carefully because it can burn really fast but taking it out it gets crispy it gets almost like a potato chip and uh and it's fun and you know kale salad - if you cut it really small with the kids and they can use scissors they can just do safety scissors cut the leaves really small and make kind of a lemon parmesan almost like a Caesar type dressing I know kids that love kale Caesar salad for instance and that's the fun way for kids to make but yeah I love the name dinosaur kale actually it's if you have a CSA and you're participating this yes when you get your box definitely involve the kids and taking everything out of the box naming it and can't that's from the first time I think we had a dinosaur kale is it within our CSA box yeah I'm sorry - to continue to keep you away from that delicious food you made it's right in front of you do you have another question wondering what you're looking forward to next what fresh produce that comes out that you'll be cooking with well I'm so excited for peas to say and I don't I don't really do a whole lot with them but but I do remember as child just taking him out of the shells I had my own little saucepan that was like a little saucepan actually it's kind of like and actually this is really fun for kids to have a little and just shelling the keys right into the pan and putting a tiny bit of water just cooking it to a boil turning up the heat and eating them a little bit of butter in salt so that's a wonderful really easy recipe that kids can make we've got keys and although in my garden right now I have a Bradish fist and I just had a couple of and slice those up and in France they'd do this you put a little little butter and a baguette and then put a couple slices of fun radish on it and a little bit of chive and just eat those with some yummy and all the lettuces I mean it's wonderful Asus that are just starting to be available in the markets and then of course tomatoes and peppers not big of a fan of squash that was picky eater I was Lonesome still I still have to find the recipes for like zucchini that I love I do love zucchini yeah yeah when you sweeten it up it anything tastes delicious Vienna Cupid any stories from your travels when you were on that fellowship anything come to mind that you think kids might enjoy hearing about yeah I think um well it was really an amazing experience I spent the whole year traveling and I went to South Pacific Australia and New Zealand all over Europe in Canada and in Asia I went to China and and I think that some of the things that I found were really interesting is how every first of all how happy kids were everywhere that I went and how all of them pretty much love to cook and love to share their recipes and I would you know either take the school bus with them and I remember going in Australia and taking the school bus with these girls and talking to their whole class about cooking and then after school they made me these Anzac biscuits which stood for the Australian New Zealand Army Corps it's like a very simple cookie and they made sausage rolls they like made this whole meal and we ate it on their trampoline and it was really fun and then in Paul I remember the kids making popcorn and I was fascinated because he's four he'll try kids way up in the Himalayas and they they had they were just throwing the popcorn in this pot and they didn't have a lid on it and the popcorn was just flying out all over the fire and it didn't they put sugar on it and it was fun like they were dancing or the fire and you know picking the top corner off the grounds and um it was such a celebration that it's fun of kids you know it was fun to see how they cooked it and I've talked about how I cooked it with a lid or an air popper like we have this fancy air pop machines and and there and I don't so I don't know it's just it was great to talk to kids about their kitchens and the ingredients they have available what their favorite foods were so in in Mexico I remember the kids there was this one boy in it only a trace but that's all I wanted like he was so picky that he only wanted rice so put a teeny bit of sauce on it or he would put his brother did love avocados so they would slice open an avocado just put a little bit of lime on it a little salt not as like his favorite thing to eat so I have a question about the aftermath of cooking should the cook have to also do the dishes and if so do you eat first or do master you know every family has a different policy I guess when you're working with kids I get involved in all of it because especially little kids like washing the dishes is kind of fun we have to put the towel you know around it have a stool but you know giving dishes like a bath say maybe even all the water super senses it's really fun so I make that always part of the whole activity and then having tweens and teenagers who are cooking more independently I do think you know they can't just come in and make a disaster on the kitchen not making cookies so I pretty much say if you're gonna make the cookies you gotta do the whole thing get cleanup so yeah and then you know the great thing about cookies is they can keep eat they can have one right when it comes out of the oven and hopefully for a couple of days so after after we do the dishes they can come back there's another question I think this might throw me under the bus but that's okay Sofia's wondering how come you're not eating that mouth-watering while you you can take it take a nibble and I'll tell people a little bit about our summer program for those people who are in Northfield where you're gonna receive a mailing from the library that has all sorts of fun stuff you can do over the summer we'll start right after July 4th and one whole week is going to be dedicated to food and that'll be a really fun time for you to find Deanna's cookbooks and challenge yourself to make something new wonderful what's the best way for them to share with you um they can just share it through my website contact form or you can share it on Instagram via f books and just tagged me on Instagram that's fun I love to see us in fact recently I've been getting tagged so many times and it's just wonderful to see all the kids all around the world making making the recipe yeah so much for having me it's I hope that whoever's watching got some good information out of it and for I'm glad you're recording it because I think a lot of people will watch it who weren't able to tune in my there's a lot happening today so but I really appreciate I love supporting local libraries and I love libraries bring access everyone and yeah thank you Matt I mean so for inviting me to participate so it's great program oh we're so lucky to have you Danna thank you so much for being here we really appreciate it you're welcome everybody thank you so much for doing this it was it was really great in it it makes me hungry", "e2_QrsAj_pU": "hey everyone and welcome back to my channel today I have a weekly lunch idea video for you where I show you what I packed my daughter Belle and a couple lunches for the older kids for the week of Monday to Friday now first off for Monday I did a homemade lunchable kind of my own version so if you want to see how I put this all together then just keep watching so first off I'm starting with these pepperoni sticks they're awesome they come from Costco they were like three or four dollars off last time so I repurchase these they were something I've bought before they're nice they don't have to be refrigerated they're like a european-style pepperoni stick so I just slip the package in half store it and the other half I'm just gonna take two or three out chop them up and throw them in our lunch Bowl and if you're noticing my camera is sliding it's because it's connected to my cupboard door and I didn't realize it was sliding right away it's time maybe I invest in some proper equipment to do these videos [Music] and I'm gonna throw a yogurt drink and a neutral green bar in just to get it all used up she's pretty good with having repeats these little flower silicone cups I love them I found those at the dollar store again haven't seen them again the dollar store so bad for that so when you see something you like get it that day and if you've seen any of my other lunch videos you know Bella is not a big vegetable fan but guys I am persistent and I'm convinced that if she doesn't have very many other options she will eat the vegetables so now I'm just kind of messing around with how I want to set this up and organize it I kind of like being able to fit everything in she loves opening it she even says her friends at school get really jealous when they see her lunches [Music] now I'm just throwing in a few of those tappable crackers I think they're also known as club crackers some places anyway I'm gonna fit those in and you're gonna see I'm really gonna mess around with this it drives me nuts when I can't make it just right [Music] [Applause] [Music] so now that her basically her main dish is covered it's kind of a snacky lunch guys that's what we roll with most days here if we don't have leftovers because she doesn't have the option to microwave or anything at school so I tried to give her something I know she's gonna eat here I'm just scooping some salsa and 20 of these little dollar ramen containers that I have just to knock off Systema containers and this is just the Kirkland salsa it's got a little bit of a kick to it but not too much if I can tolerate because I do not like spicy and then I'm gonna throw in some tostito rounds into this little Rubbermaid container for her so this is a great little dipping snack for her [Music] also here's the tip on how to make sure that nothing shifts around in these take-along containers that are used from rubbermaid just put a piece of paper towel over anything that you don't want to move and it also absorbs any of the liquid so it doesn't make her crackers go soggy just a tip and I went ahead and threw in this banana chocolate chip loaf that I got at Costco their peanut free they're really awesome great for school and because I'm always obsessed she's not gonna have enough so here's our lunch and let's see what she ate all right guys so let's see what she ate here okay this was full so this is a good handful you know not even sure she used that well the yogurts come on the banana loaf is gone that's all extra-hot here Wow okay all right kid I hear ya I'm not convinced she ate the cucumbers do you know why because she had a sleepover and the kids made a joke that they like picking out her certain things in her lunch when they're in class so I'll ask her I'll be able to tell but honestly I hope I'm gonna have good faith I'm gonna have a baby she's no good job kid so I guess less is more I don't know all right signals the host schools were closed we were home for snow day here's a sneak peek at our breakfast [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh Oh and I know I use a lot of oil in my pancakes but it's how my mom made them and they're just super crispy and delicious and that's how we like them [Music] Oh [Music] now we did have lunch we just had lift and chicken noodle soup with grilled cheese sandwiches so kept it really simple guys I just thought my breakfast looked more interesting but honestly I ate two bowls of this it was amazing and it's not something we have normally so days like this make it extra special now here's Belle's lunch for Wednesday and I use a pretty neat container if you want to see how I use it just keep watching all right here we go packing Belle's lunch for Wednesday I'm just showing you this is the lunch cube from Systema you can put two separate things the top part is mainly for sandwiches because you wouldn't want to put anything that might leak up there but if you had dry things like chips or popcorn that would work too and then the two little compartments on the bottom and it all fits perfectly in your lunch bag I love this guys I have a container video you'll know I'm obsessed next I'm just putting a little bit of ranch into the Dollar Rama knockoff sistema containers for her to dip some celery [Music] now of course I have my little silicone container so I'm just gonna start putting different things in them to kind of help me keep stuff regulated like I know I needed to give her some fruits and something crunchy like a cracker her vegetables I don't know I like seeing everything all compartmentalized it's probably a military thing especially watching this back and I see I put the celery in the green and the blueberries in the blue and here we go flakes a ham for bail I'm so happy this is something that she does enjoy and I know it'll fill her up at lunchtime she also swimming today after school so I just like to know she has a good hearty lunch I'm gonna go ahead and mix it up with some America wit from my giant jug from Costco [Music] and that's it we keep it pretty simple I know some people I think when I was younger my mother used to put relish in it it's just not something that we like I don't even put any additional spread on her bread I just stick to this it's pretty moist as it is sorry nobody likes that word [Music] now I will set that to the side and I'm gonna go ahead and slice her up some cheese this is the dairy aisle cheese here on East Coast I absolutely adore it it's delicious Jamie grabbed it yesterday I knew there's a reason I love that man and now for the fun part putting it all into the system a lunch cube yeah so I just put her sandwich in here I'm gonna grab a piece of paper towel just to secure it a little extra and again to keep it from getting soggy or releasing any moisture like I said it's it's not air proof or anything like that it's just it's just a really neat way to keep everything packed so this stuff goes on the bottom so it won't tip they fit perfectly these little square ones I their Wilton silicone muffin cups from Walmart highly recommend them so she's got blueberries cheese celery a little bit of dip of course a good ol faithful I'm gonna stick a nano yogurt in there for her the Kirkland chewy granola bar which you'll see I remove later the moths fruit stations fruit snacks this is really hard for me to get through and of course the banana chocolate chip bread that she really enjoys so this is kind of cute it's like a little lunchable underneath her sandwich like I said she has swimming so anything she doesn't eat she can eat on the way to swimming when I pick her up from school today but ya guys take a look at how cool this is I don't know I'm just I love it it's one of her favorite containers that I bought I may have a lot now I just threw her a handful of tostitos she does like those to snack on and a Clementine at this point I realized she had way too much food and took two granola bar out it's her least favorite anyway so this is everything that she has I'm super happy with her lunch this morning very basic guys really easy for a cold lunch if your kid doesn't have a microwave or anything like that now quickly I just wanted to show you how easily the lunch block and everything else fit in a pretty standard sized lunch bag it's good to know because a lot of these are nice to look at but if they're not practical then what's the point now I'm gonna show you quickly what her youngest stepbrother took he just took a snack because he has hot lunch they go to different schools so it's a little bit more complicated he's got some popcorn that his dad popped for him a raspberry splash flavored water a nano yogurt drink I also threw him in the nutrigrain bars strawberry one and he also has an apple and a banana it's always a little few excess snacks but Dad packs his lunch in he wants to make sure he's all set up now the next one I'm gonna show you is her older step sibling Sebastian he's in high school and they have a microwave so he wanted to take some leftover meatloaf from last night I also just put it into this Costco disposable container but honestly we use them over and over again put them in the dishwasher they're great he just wanted an apple he had some popped popcorn as well and he has one of the school safe banana chocolate chip looks so yeah he's all set and he didn't want to drink he's gonna grab something at school next is Kylie she's the oldest of her step siblings she's got a blueberry nutrigrain bar Clementine and a banana chocolate chip loaf because she is going to buy uptown today so that's why you don't see too much about their lunches here's everybody all lined up and [Music] I think eat at Del Rio I don't like the end reason 20 come on [Music] but you're not eating it are you gonna take it no one giving you don't hurt happy yes I just thought this was so funny and you guys should see it it's literally just a typical morning at our house so here's what Bell took for lunch and I'll show you guys what she ate when she gets home [Music] all right so it's after school it almost looks like she didn't touch her lunch and she told me that she'll get a chance to eat her lunch today because she had to help the friend or the office and get ice for something I don't know anyway we're getting ready to go to swimming because we live really close to the school so we run home as she contains before we go to practice before and this is what she ate so okay she ate all the blueberries she ate some of her cheese she made me watch her dip she might have had one or two things of celery the veggie war is still on my friend and she has the whole sandwich no she did ask if she could eat her sandwich before swimming because she's very hungry so that's the plan I'm gonna take this with us there we're gonna take a lunch with us she must have had these for snack time when she had her yogurt and her banana bread so she had yogurt banana bread toasty toes and Mogu berries so he's gonna have this for before swimming and after and yeah so it's nice I guess she did something nice for a friend but I wish that the school would give her an extra five minutes to eat lunch since I've got like a crazy mom thing I don't know anyway that's what she ate her lunch on Wednesday now hopping right on over into Thursday's lunge I packed a couple of lunches today but I lost the footage on one I am gonna show you a really neat lunch container that I have so if you want to see how I pack it full of goodness just keep watching I quickly want to show you guys the systemic container I'm obviously not sponsored by anybody let alone sistema but I love their containers they just have really neat innovative ways to pack a lunch I'm so easily impressed guys but these little purple sections pop out and you can put stuff underneath you can either leave them out entirely and just use this part of the container or use it all combined there's even a little dish that goes where the smaller section of the purple is but I'll show you that later let's get into lunch making first off I'm using these old el Pasto small tortilla shells to make a couple mini wraps for bail I'm just gonna go ahead and use ham and cheese and did you see that lettuce it's it's not it's last leg but I managed to find a couple salvageable pieces and if you guys know belt doesn't like vegetables but I can usually sneak a few pieces of lettuce in here although I don't think that it really does that much for now I'll go ahead and add a very small amount of mustard it's about the only condiment that she likes on this when she takes it to school and to keep it from going soggy I usually put it on the lettuce or in between the slices of ham I never put any condiments directly on the bread or their tortilla or otherwise it's completely soggy by the time she has to eat lunch and here I'm just gonna add a few slices of ham that I bought from Costco and a three pack on my last haul I'll link that video above if you're interested I just freeze these so I took this out last night stuck it in the fridge and it was good to go for today it's just the best way because we don't go through that much lunch meat but I do like to have it on hand because you never know if you want to make substr supper rafts or sandwiches for the kids for school so it's a good thing to have on hand but it does go bad quickly so I like to keep it in the freezer [Music] and I don't know what's going on in our household may be a few less Taco Tuesdays but this massive bag of cheese has lasted us a couple of weeks and if you remember last month I was stocking up on Club size bags of cheese every week I swear so must have just been a phase and now I'm gonna go ahead and roll them up for some reason some people seem to be intimidated by this honestly I start about a third down the tortilla when I'm filling it up leave a little bit of space on the ends start rolling it up tightly folding the sides and continue rolling it and you have a little burrito tortilla wrap things so I don't know it's not that complicated if you are struggling with it by all means get a toothpick or something kind of a hold of clothes so it's not a mess when it gets to school for your kids now moving on to the rest of her lunch I'm gonna go ahead and give her a Clementine it pits so perfectly in this little section I've got some goldfish I'm gonna give her of course to the handy dandy nutrigrain bar it's a strawberry and her banana chocolate chip loaf I think we're starting to run low on those now I mentioned to you this container also comes with a smaller container that fits perfectly if you removed a small purple section I've used it in the past to put yogurt with granola or just pudding or anything in there that might leak that you want to send them you could even send it outside of this unfortunately I don't find it fits in her lunchbox well unless I put it directly in the Box I'm also gonna go ahead and throw a yogurt in here you're gonna see later the top purple does not fit with a yogurt on the bottom of course I'm gonna try and sneak some more vegetables guys I'm gonna go ahead and give her some ranch like I said yesterday she actually devoured her celery on route to swimming so I was super pumped about that at least I know she will lead it when she's ravenous now here we go I'm gonna finish off these goldfish don't fret guys I bought these at Costco I got two massive eggs still to top up this container this little section is perfect for goldfish or emptying out of package gummies or just putting a few treats in there love it all so Jamie cut up the celery for me and he's so smart because he puts it in water and it really does keep it fresher and a little bit sweeter so I'm gonna go ahead chop up some celery now I'm just gonna go ahead these pepperoni sticks I got from Costco I'm gonna go ahead and chop up two of them for her I don't know guys I just always feel like I'd rather she has a little bit too much than not enough and what would her lunch be without a silicone muffin liner honestly I think I'd be lost and completely confused now you're going to see me a mess around with this configuration because it drives me bananas when I can't make it fit just right and Here I am discovering the yogurt and ain't gonna fit now Here I am finally happy with the configuration and I've decided that I wanted to throw a few blueberries in there for her too a lot of her lunch is usually pretty snacky because she doesn't eat a massive portion of anything so guaranteed somebody else in her class is probably gonna eat one of those wraps but I'm okay with it I'm just happy to know that she's got everything she needs in here I go ahead and throw this piece of paper towel in there so she has a napkin and it keeps the blueberries from rolling around although I'm pretty sure it was a tight fit with that purple section anyway here you go a quick recap of what I suck into this container you can see it really does hold a lot of food it's probably one of the favorite ones that she owns so here's everything I packed for Belle's lunch now I'm going to show you Kylie her oldest stepsister who decided she didn't want to buy today now sadly when I thought I was filming I was not but here just a quick glance of everything that I put in there now what Kylie wanted today was vegetables with hummus and cheese so I went ahead after I thought he was filming and cut her up some ham and go ahead and stick it in this little Rubbermaid container with a little silicone liner and I'm gonna go ahead and stick crackers in there so basically she had snap peas carrots celery AB Alderson old white cheddar cheese that we got in a pack from Costco not cheap but super delicious I gave her a little system a knockoff container from the dollar store filled with hummus and I went ahead and cut up a dill pickle and put it into a disposable cup from the dollar store I'm gonna go ahead and give her some of these sesame rice things they're super salty super delicious really good with everything so she's got a good little charcuterie board to take to school here she's super happy with that I threw in a yogurt drink and an apple for her and she is all set all right so here's everything I packed for Thursday now let's take a look at the end of the day and see what they actually ate okay so mom fail again unpack her lunch so this morning I've already taken out her wrap she didn't eat both of them I probably shouldn't have had to chew I'm not sure why did she literally eat everything else sorry but it's completely empty guys blueberries the pepperoni she had a yogurt drink and I believe she had a nutri bean barn here so yeah I'm pretty happy I'm impressed and goldfish too so perhaps but honestly that was a moment fault I shouldn't pack her that much in these containers off everything's good and that's it for Friday alright guys it's Friday I've packed Belle's lunch it's a hot lunch today and the older kids are just taking snacks so stay tuned if you want to see how I pack Belle's lunch for Friday alright so her hot lunch today is going to be leftover chicken pot pie from Costco from Wednesday I had the video on that one for my what's for dinner she's a super fan of chicken potpie so this is a no-brainer for me when we have shepherd's pie chicken pot pie or spaghetti she wants it in her thermos all you got to do guys is make sure that you fill your thermos with boiling hot water let it sit for at least 15 minutes and then you're good to go so everything will stay super hot for your kids throughout the day I'm just throwing in snack she's got a Clementine nutrigrain bar and the yogurt you guys know the drill she eats pretty much the same thing every day I'm gonna throw in some goldfish for her I just like to make sure she's got a fruit a dairy she's got something crunchy something a little bit sweet I just want to make sure it's well-balanced speaking of something crunchy if you guys haven't tried these barbeque munch shows you need to run out immediately and get them I'm throwing some into a baggie for her and this is one of her favorite snacks so yeah here we go [Music] [Applause] now I know she's gonna have her thermos with a hot lunch in it but I still wanted to have something else in here so I'm gonna go ahead and take two of the pepperoni sticks I got from Costco and sliced them up guys this pairing Heights is on its last legs yeah really hoping Santa comes through this year now she does have swimming practice again tonight so if this all doesn't get eaten at school I usually intend I pack her lunch with intention knowing that there's going to be leftovers and she can eat it on the way to swimming now her thermos is ready all I'm doing is wiping it out with a paper towel so there's no added moisture cuz with the chicken Popeye you really don't need it I usually take the crust and kind of dump it on the bottom and then pile up all of the filling on top so it's like a little chicken pot cup pie thing make sense okay here it is good to go smelled amazing my house at 7:30 a.m. it's not a chicken pot pie so here's everything in her lunch and like I said the two other kids were buying uptown today they both go to separate high schools uptown here and they just each wanted a nutri green bar something sweet so they got the banana chocolate chip loaf from Costco and an apple they're super easy I guess I don't know they'll just like skin spoiled by my lunches [Music] ketchups could she like ketchup on her punch to judge my kitchen don't judge anything just enjoy listening to music and watching them go chicken kinas ready for lunch all right folks last day of the week but see how she did so we got back from swimming and she ate everything except her Clementine and her nutrigrain bars so I was super happy she had that as a snack for after everything went well and there you have it guys another weekly lunch ideas video for you I hope this gave you some inspiration for packing lunches for

certified naturopath and creator of body typology system for lasting weight loss so let's see how you can stay really on a budget and eat healthy at the same time we'll start with breakfast my number one tip is to start your day with oats these are old-fashioned oats much better and cheaper than the pre-packaged kind the little packages that are really high in sugar and salt so you can use the old-fashioned oats if you have a double boiler you put this in your pot with water underneath and just soak them overnight in the morning you turn it on and it cooks while you have your shower get ready and it's super delicious adding in some apples or bananas or berries whatever you like to make it really tasty number two eggs are still a really super economical way to start your day for you and especially for your kids instead of starting them off on that sugar high with really expensive sugar sweet cereal protein is the best way for your kids to start their day so eggs are super economical you can buy a bread maker if you want to be industrious and make your own bread now moving on to lunch it's always best to bring your lunch along right brown bagging it rather than going to the mall or you know eating something fast on the go that's going to be really pricey because you're paying for someone else to prepare your food so prepare things in advance bring them along and you'll save money and stay super healthy now moving on to snacks a lot of people grab a lot of unhealthy expensive snacks because they haven't eaten enough for lunch and they're still hungry so make sure your lunch is really substantial and for snacks my favorite go-to is trail mix now i buy a lot of my food in bulk which is a really great money saver i put in almonds raisins sunflower seeds pumpkin seeds you can add in things like dried apricots take a little bag along with you and you're good for your snacks of course fruit is also another super healthy snack and at night what could be better than popcorn popcorn is not really fattening as long as you don't pile on too much butter and salt but if you buy a hot air popcorn popper that costs about twenty dollars and you can buy your popcorn in bulk and make a super easy healthy snack for afternoon or night time that doesn't pack on the pounds that is really really inexpensive just avoid that microwave popcorn because it's laden with tons of chemicals and preservatives and is really not good for you now for dinner a great way is to make most of your meals more vegetarian nothing is cheaper than revolving your meals around beans so these are kidney beans i have a lot of my beans already cooked and in two cup packages in the freezer so when you cook your own simple cook them so soak them overnight and then after they're cooked in the morning separate them into two cup portions and throw them in the freezer when you're ready to make a meal just defrost them and go it costs really pennies it's super economical which is why many of the countries around the world base their meals on things like lentils and beans and brown rice which is also another great staple that's really not expensive you can also always find chicken on sale somewhere we often buy two whole organic chickens roast them the next day the bones go into the pot for soups nothing's better for the body than a really good bone broth and then finally always cook in large quantities buy in large quantities especially seasonal items right now i'm in montreal and apples are available everywhere so i'm going to be stocking up on a lot of apples sometimes even the organic apples are cheaper than the regular apples so shop wisely check those savings buy in bulk berries in the in the spring and now is also the time for root vegetables and squashes make large quantities freeze these delicious soups and you'll be good to go for a long time finally you can always grow your own a lot of people are jumped into that bandwagon during covid so even if you live in an apartment you can grow basil and parsley and herbs and maybe even a small cherry tomato plant things like that on your balcony so grow your own whenever you can if you live in the country which allows that we can do that here in the summer and that's about it those are some great tips if you start implementing them i'm sure that you can eat really healthy and save money be sure to check out my website bodytypology.com there's tons of information there to help you stay healthy and lose weight and if you like you can get my free ebook when you sign up for my

overdo it healthy food is super easy to put on the table especially if it has a funny message to it let them know the names of funny or exotic foods like papaya mango zucchini or bok choy cut the vegetables into funny shapes get the children to taste the food to test the texture before you put it on the table introduce new things to your children ask them how they could cook something or tell them where the meals they eat comes from 5. make your dish the only meal they'll eat don't give in to your child's mood by cooking another meal for them you have to stick to the healthy meal that you put on the table if you continue to cook him specialties you tell him otherwise that the healthy meal you put on the table is not really important and you encourage him to continue with his eating whims eat a meal and stick to it you can always offer a variety of choices to accompany the same meal such as spaghetti with red sauce or a little olive oil 6. serve the meal as a family put your meal on the table and let the kids choose what they want to eat instead of making them a separate meal or serving them children like to feel like they are in control of their own decisions and are likely to derive their behavior from your behavior this strategy also prompts them to take a large amount of the new food on their plates because they want to taste it first to get an idea and actually start eating ask them to put a bit of everything on their plates but let them choose how much help yourself first so they can see how much of each food you eat 7. be persistent but not aggressive you may need to introduce your new healthy food 10 to 15 times before they try it take your time and avoid yelling or forcing the child to eat this will only give him bad memories of the meal and you will have difficulty getting him to eat anything else later put the meal in front of them and ask them to try to enjoy it but don't be frustrated if they can't finish the dish thank them for their effort and try another food try to prepare food in different ways for example prepare raw vegetables one evening cook them the next day then steam them on the third evening show them that cooking changes the taste as well as the texture of the food prepare healthy meals that children enjoy one replace processed cereal packets with high fiber or whole grain cereals the best time to sneak fiber into your diet is often at breakfast since many cereal packets these days are made from whole grains that your child won't even notice take this time of day to make high fiber or whole grain cereals their favorite foods 2. make oatmeal porridge and let your child adjust to it oatmeal porridge is an alternative to discreetly introduce fruit and milk or yogurt rich in calcium into your children's breakfast you can also let your children adapt to make it their favorite meals here are some other tips you could implement add cocoa powder add dried fruits or pieces add nuts add agave syrup honey or natural sugars in moderation add cinnamon or spices three use whole wheat flour to make pancakes or waffles your child is likely to see no difference and the extra fiber is good for their body 4. combine granola yogurt and fruit for a simple yet diverse breakfast so your child will be able to enjoy so many flavors of granola and yogurt in addition lots of fruits like bananas apples mangoes and berries can accompany this meal as well for lunch one pack your child's breakfasts around to make sure you cook up a good nutritious meal 2. eat lunch together to make him feel supported your meal should contain a piece of fruit or vegetables a grain and a source of protein take the opportunity to also add a little desert if you are sure that it will eat everything 2. buy whole wheat bread instead of white bread this change may be hard to bear for a week or two but your child will quickly get used to it once you make sandwiches with this bread add fiber to your diet without being overbearing whole wheat bread as the staple of healthy breakfasts 3. find out what their favorite fruits are naturally sweet the fruit is one of the easiest healthy foods to put into your children's lunchbox what fruits do they like what fruits do they hate remember to be creative for example you can take watermelon and put it safely in a plastic box for school for example there are different varieties of apples engage your child by organizing a tasting party during which you will let them taste three to five varieties of apples to identify their favorite variety 4. ask your child to describe their dream sandwich and find a way to make it healthier which seasoning should stay on top what meal or garnish does he like when you know how he likes his sandwich you can figure out how to make it healthier tuna sandwiches a tin of tuna can be mixed with light mayonnaise and black pepper with a slice of cheese a slice of tomato and sliced avocado all prepared like a grilled cheese peanut butter and jam with apple slices inside a sandwich turkey or ham sandwiches served with cucumbers lettuce leaves spinach or lightly sliced tomato spinach or tomato can be added to a white bun 5. replace classic breakfasts with healthier meals can you find a healthier meal that can replace processed food items like homemade cookies or jam rolled buns what are the main meals in breakfasts and how can they be replaced for example pretzels that are baked in the oven are much healthier than a bag of crisps even if children do not recognize that this solution is healthy for dinner one make a healthy pizza if you're not going overboard on the cheese pizza makes a decent balanced meal that kids love you can gradually add healthy toppings or whip up a special condiment with cheese that they can eat after a break add finely chopped onions peppers or caramelized mushrooms these vegetables become soft after cooking for 10 to 12 minutes in a pan with a little oil sliced spinach is almost impossible to detect once it's cooked and shrinks a bit in size 2. mix the vegetables into your pasta dishes try using a hand blender to mash squash carrots or peppers and add them to the red sauce or saute finely chopped onions and zucchini and add them to the red sauce mixed with the pasta before serving no one will notice it but these vegetables are important for a healthy diet going for whole grain pasta is a great way to get more fiber into your daily diet 3. roast vegetables to give them a texture similar to french fries roasted vegetables are often the easiest for children to digest try roasting parsnips sweet potatoes carrots beets squash and brussels sprouts in an oven at high heat with a little olive oil and salt for a crunchy crunchy filling 4. bake the chicken in the oven instead of frying it this is actually applicable to a lot of meals frying requires the use of a lot of oil which adds more fat and cholesterol to the meal however if you bake the meal you can still feed your child their favorite foods but in healthier ways if you can bake something in the oven instead of frying it it will almost always be healthier 5. encourage your child to spice up their meals spicing up food is a great way to get kids to cook dinner on their own just before adding the spices call your child and ask them to smell the different scents which one does he like which ones do you usually mix your children can then feel free to make their own special mixes or give the flavor of chicken or fish a personal touch remember however that you only need a pinch of spice to bring out the taste for snacks one try to make an assortment of dried fruits a personalized and naturally delicious dried fruit cocktail is a great snack for reluctant children it is generally a mixture of cereals granolas dried fruits nuts and a touch of chocolate 2. make your own hummus this dish is an excellent source of protein and you can often add mashed vegetables to it all you need is hummus oil and a food processor add salt chili herbs and spices to personalize your cold sauce dip 3. make a bean sauce instead of just going for salty salsa or cheese sauce beans contain protein that will make the snack more filling and less salty plus kids will love to eat baked tortillas which look like junk food 4. make everyone their own cup of yogurt let them choose their favorite flavors and let them know that these mugs were made with a lot of love they will be excited to have their own food and will take it from the refrigerator each time you give them the opportunity to consume their own cup of yogurt they will feel like they are in control and will be happier about eating healthily 5. pair fruits and vegetables with excellent cold sauces for example apples and celery go perfectly with peanut butter raw carrots peppers and cucumbers pair well with hummus children will be more receptive to eating healthy foods if they can immediately dip them into delicious food how do you start

tooth especially that you know the holidays like this are like major sugar holidays and I used to eat tons of jellybeans I live my jellybeans I don't eat them now but um I do like something sweet so I want to show you what I do and maybe give you an idea or two that could be helpful for you and your and it's good for you so hi thank you for joining we need hey hi everybody so I'm gonna get right to

comments in the video after the broadcast goes live and then I can at least see you hear you and then communicate with you personally okay so what I do and I do this almost every single morning I keep a stock of apples in my house um here's my stock of apples and then I also keep a pack of cuties and then I also keep a stock of frozen berries blueberries blackberries raspberries because everything in the berry family is full of fiber full of great nutritional value antioxidants they're super super super healthy I'm going to show you what I do [Music] so when you come to my house in my freezer I always have frozen blueberries cuz they're so healthy I always have I love Casco I shop Costco all the time I always have three berry mix again these are the berry family which is very depend to be the lower sugar fruits and they tend to be some of the most healthy fruits you could eat and a beautiful thing about frozen is that you can have them you year-round and sometimes frozen fresh frozen is even healthier than fresh produce okay so what I do is I take some like mixed berries and then I take the blueberries which I love and I put those in the bowl too and then I put them in the microwave for about a minute to thaw them I don't overcook them I just want to thaw them because these are frozen look at all those beautiful berries I put them in the microwave I thought these for a minute just to kind of get the juices out and to get them frozen this out but they're still cold and fresh right and then while that's happening I chop my onion Mike this is not an onion by the way this is an apple I chop my Apple into don't laugh at me into little chunks and it's super healthy it's filled with fiber it's not the most fun in food to eat you know like who gets excited about eating an apple I don't but I eat them all the time and what I do is I just have found ways to make apples more exciting right so it's really just about being creative with your foods and putting them together in a way that's really delicious and it will surprise you I think that when you see what I do here I'm gonna surprise you okay so I chopped up my I'm gonna show you just a second hi everybody thank you for joining me Happy Easter for those of you just joining me so I just chopped up my Apple here I'm gonna show you chopped up apples I just chopped up my apples into chunks and then I'm dyeing my blueberries my bad berries my blackberries look at those beautiful berries look at that and when I do that I get all the juice this sweet juice out of the berries and then I just throw my apples in my chunks and then I mixed up the blueberries blackberries all that juice and I just cover the apples with all of that delicious nutritious juice and it doesn't even look like an apple anymore the next thing I do is I take my QT I'll take one of these and open it up and you might think we'll apples or Macs raise blackberries blueberries and then uh a Clementine fresh Clementine don't exactly sound like a mix but I promise you if you try this you can be surprised so I throw that into my salad this is my fresh bowl and I just mix all those things together all right so now I have chopped up Apple all my berries and I have a cutting time and that in and of itself is delicious but to make it a little more interesting because texture is really sort of one of those things that I crave in food like I wanna crunch I want you know I want so this is sweet something crunchy I want something that feels a little bit salty all those things mixed together it's really what makes food delicious so what I do is I buy bars so I'm going to show you what I got I keep some healthy bars as snacks that I really enjoy that are low in sugar they give me a little bit of crunch also give me fiber and they're very low in sugar is good for you so Kashi bars are an example of a bar that I eat this one is a Kashi this is the chocolate almond sea salt so I get the salty and I get the crunchy and then I get a little bit of fat from the almonds okay and then I also like the peppers this is filled with almonds and nuts and so I'm getting the crunchy salty I'm getting the fats that are delicious from bars that are very low in sugar on average five grams of sugar per bar so I feel I feel good about eating these they're they're not like a 25 gram sugar bar which a lot of them are so what I'll do is I'll open this bar up are you paying attention a paper okay I'll open this bar up and then I chopped it up here's what the bar looks like so you can see it's grainy grainy so this is all almonds and then it's dark chocolate and some of these have millions they have seeds in them and I'm getting fat from natural sources raw nuts seeds is exactly where you want to get your fats on that's where you want to get the char you're fat from and that's where I go so all I'm doing is chopping up that bar and I'm throwing the chunks inside my salad and now I mix it in and now I have this delicious fruit salad here canal shape I have this delicious fruit salad with all these great ingredients and after I have my breakfast like I have you know egg whites and I'll have maybe a side of oatmeal or some sort of veggie patty when I want something sweet because I still want something sweet I have my fruit salad and it's super healthy and it's super good for me and it's packed with antioxidants it's packed with fiber it's low in sugar and it's giving me all the natural nutritional value that my body really wants and needs okay it's so yummy it is so yummy so I thank you for that George I will absolutely post the list of exactly what I do it's really simple you can see it and you know the really interesting thing about eating like this is I do this like pretty much every day and sometimes I'm craving cookies or ice cream or I want something really decadent and rich and I look at my salad and I think I'm not really that's not what I'm craving I want something sweeter but I go to this salad because it's ready and it's in the fridge and when I start eating it I'm like oh my god so good and I enjoy it and then I move past that sweet tooth moment and I'm good and I'm healthier and I'm better for it and digestive Lee there's so many good things for you in this salad the problem with the sugars and heavy carbohydrates is that it really mobs you down your digestion is bogged down it's not really serving you physically and even mentally as well if something that mother nature provides does so that's why I want to share that with you these are like my rituals so I got watchfully here is a little quick you probably thought I had a chef in my kitchen doing all this stuff for me but not yet um not yet anyway I hope this is super helpful if you like this video don't forget to like me like like me like crazy okay and don't forget to subscribe to my channel because I really need and appreciate your support and leave a comment a suggestion or a question or share with me what you eat that is delicious and surprisingly nutritious I would love especially if you're you know located somewhere else or you have local traditions or local foods that are specific to your air I would really love to hear that so to recap right I took an apple which I always have in the house I took one of my Clementine keys and then I took frozen berries blackberries I get these at Costco and mix berry these are raspberries blackberries blueberries and then one of my bars either a Kashi Barlow sugar or paleo bar chopped that mix it all together and then I have a fruit salad that I enjoyed morning I enjoyed afternoon I enjoy it at night and that helps me with my sweet tooth in a big big way got that the beautiful thing is is that the most of this all of this is low in sugar and the things that might have a little bit higher sugar levels like the Clementine I only opened a small Calvin time do it in there for taste you don't have to abstain you from the things that you really really love you could just do a little pinch of it that's my approach it's really about balance and you know serving size and keeping keeping everything kind of in moderation right I think somebody's asking about how much sugar I want to take a look at this and you answer that see fiber and sugar if you beat the labels this bottom particular has around 7 grams of sugar okay compared to like 25 and 30 and 35 grams of sugar that you'll get in other bars okay so um anyway I'd love to answer your questions if you guys have any questions and and do you like grey bunny ears I put these on for the holiday hi Rolando hi Robert hi Billy Damon let's run hi everybody thank you for joining me all right how is everybody doing how is everybody doing with the lockdown with the holiday thank you thank you so much thank you for joining me thank you so much thank you for the money today today I went into the gym and I did a shoulder workout I'm gonna share some of those photos with you two and it's sometimes it's a struggle to you know do all the things that you know you should do that are good for you because the motivation is hard to come by sometimes especially when we're stagnant but um but we got to keep going going and so today I was doing some funny hop and jumping um yes I will I will absolutely share more nutritional meals and ideas and suggestions on what I do to stay on a really good diet that also tastes good so yes I will share that thank you for asking for that Bruce Tyrion five miles today oh that's fantastic so I can't wait so I can start running again I think I'm gonna try to start running on my foot again in a few weeks that's fantastic that's awesome thank you for that because you just reminded me that I really should start trying that that's that's oh yeah yeah you're right I am I am today I was in the home gym and I just started I started making believe that I had a jump rope and after about two or three minutes I was out of I couldn't believe how just doing the motions of a normal jump rope felt like such a great workout it just just to get your body going and then once my body's going then my mind starts to fire and I feel more creative and I know I keep saying that but it is so true and so if you're stuck at home if you're in an apartment you know if you don't have a lot of space for for whatever reason because there are little things that you can do I shocked myself today by just doing thank jumping now I didn't have the bunny ears at the time but it's even better with the bunny ears you know but it's kind of like it's kind of like doing push-ups dropping down and pushing doing ten push-ups or doing like squat jumps where you're just using your body to create some heat and some movement and it thanks you I mean my body thanks me my mind thanks me every time I that so I want to encourage you to do that thank you so much fruit oh my superheroes are in the room - thank you so much Brock and bug and Beck I love you guys happy Easter happy Easter to all of you hi Brandon so working on the students so you've gotten better since it's a gift I think a diet all right so I love your opinion on this um is it harder for you to get the workout in to get motivated to do a workout or is it harder for you to get motivated to try to eat healthier what what do you find is harder to do I think I think for a lot of people the diet is the toughest thing thank you for saying that George I love sharing what I know with fitness and so thank you for encouraging me on that I'm gonna keep doing that eat healthier is harder you didn't clean this stuff yeah being clean is tough yeah it is so that's why I wanted to share this little fruit salad that I do with you because it's really simple it's affordable it's really tasty and delicious and like I said I have a sweet tooth - every time I have a meal I look around for something sweetie I enjoy dark chocolate I'll share that with you too but I think the diet is the hardest thing but what I want to say about the diet that you don't have to give up everything you love you don't have to give up all flavor you can make small modifications to your diet that will make you feel like you're enjoying your meals you're not deprived and I think it'll make it easier for you to stay on a healthy diet you know diet is a four-letter word and I think people always look at it like it's sort of this curse word but it doesn't have to be I mean because we're all on diets right it's just some of us are on better diets than others and so small modifications to your diet make big changes to you and so that's what I'm going to share with you do hundred fifty four steps at home okay yeah so cutting back on the sweets and the carbs is a really smart move but here's what I like to tell people whenever I'm training people I I don't like to take take things away if I'm gonna tell somebody let's not consume that I like to replace it with something else so what I do is is you give me that we won't do that but let's do this instead so that you don't feel like you're left with nothing you know it's like it's like trying to take a toy from a baby the baby's gonna scream when they should give him something else right so that's a great idea of crumbling dark chocolate into nuts and almonds and hemp sighs that's a great I think there are so many cool ways to put food together that you will be surprised don't be surprised I will share my ideas and I'm interested in yours too so pony up pony up your ideas on what you're doing to you well eating out their size I think that the other truth for me too is that because every day is starting to feel like the day before motivation is tricky - like getting motivated I have a setup in the gym and I'm coming up with some other stuff to work out with but every single day I find that it's a struggle to get started but I do it and then once I get started I feel great and so if any of you are struggling with you know getting up to do your push-ups or your walks or you know your rope or your run know that you're not alone in that it's just it's a struggle for sure and so I look for other people I look for photos and videos and in the moment I also remind myself that once I get going I know I'm gonna feel better and I always do so I just want to put that out there that motivation is something that you have to really sort of you have to go after it you have to make it happen so my rainbow cookies I do I did not make my rainbow cookies this year though because I was recovering from surgery but yes I do my rainbow cookies once a year because those are not low sugar I do but I enjoy making them we're gonna give them away - you spent five months dollars a year on cashews raw cashews Phillip cashews are fantastic yeah so all of the most of the raw nuts are so healthy and the thing about raw nuts is that so they're high in protein they're also high in fat some higher than others almonds are great I always have almonds in the house I always keep dry roasted pistachios either raw or dry roast and when I was walnuts I love all nuts there satiating so if you eat you know a bunch of nuts and you wait 15 20 minutes you'll see that you feel satisfied right quickly so they help with cravings and they're healthy so there are great snack I should I'm gonna give you a list of all the nuts that I keep in the house that I need for snack which is also great for the sweet tooth and my very delicious dessert so thank you for asking me Chris Rex so I do the very delicious dessert and if you look at that recipe in fact I'll share a link to that recipe with you in the comments here on the community page the very delicious desserts is a sorbet that I make from the frozen berries that I died blueberries the blackberries raspberries mister and strawberries are also great all the berries are really really great because they're low in sugar so I make a sorbet out of these things and then I put a little bit of real peanut butter and some protein powder with water and I got a super healthy sorbet dessert a frozen dessert so I'll share that with you again - thanks for asking about that Rex I was loving my berries melt and that's not a good thing so so um thank you thank you thank you again for joining me I hope you're having a nice Sunday a nice Easter and that you're all feeling well that you feel

this week so stay tuned thank you Happy Easter", "B8l5a_W9efg": "hello everybody and welcome to a day for adventure the premier outdoor podcast will get you off your butt and outside I'm Ben I'm will and I'm Trevor and for this episode we will be talking about how to plan meals for a weekend camping trip so I know it sounds boring it sounds dull but why would we be teaching or talking about meal planning and meal preparation the simplest answer is you have to eat on any trip you go on whether it's a short one or a weekend or even a couple of weeks long you've got to be able to have food in your stomach so that you can keep on going and preferably that food should be relatively nutritious should be relatively filling should actually taste somewhat good and just overall satisfying because I'll tell you right now if there's one thing that is better than anything else at the end of a really tough day it's a really good meal yep and before you decide to plan your meals there are a few things you want to consider the first set of these the most important is how many people you're cooking for as no one wants to go hungry and we also don't want to end up having more food than people additionally you want to be able to cook that food so keep in mind of what type of cooking equipment you're bringing along if you're not bringing anything be prepared to do those no cook lunches and no cook meals if you have a lovely camp kitchen then you can prepare what you want and if you just have a backpacking stove you need to be able to just use meals like in boiled water in addition you want to focus on the general climate as in warmer weather some things will melt and it's harder to keep certain perishables and in the cold it may be harder to properly eat things that have some sort of caramel erm and lasses as they freeze and harden another thing that you got to consider is how big your portions are for two main reasons one you don't want to over buy food and then just waste money on food also you don't want it under buy food and not have enough to eat and then you also don't want to have food waste where say you make spaghetti and then you have like three servings of spaghetti leftover because if you're in somewhere like Philmont it's a big worry that if you just have food lying around that bears are gonna come out or really anywhere you go camping there's always a worry of animals coming and eating your extra food waste so when you plan out portion sizes and you can control your portions you won't have that food waste and you'll have enough to eat for the entire week and so now that we've got all that information out of the way let's start actually talking about actually prepping meals so of course we'll start off with the first meal of the day some may consider it to be the most important meal of the day and that is breakfast so there is a lot of commentary on how to create the best camping breakfast and there's a large debate that always kind of goes around which is the the idea of cook versus no cook for those of you who maybe aren't well aware the idea is you have to kind of balance the idea between having a cooked meal that you gather the ingredients for you cook you make it warm it's awesome or the other option is is you can just have a bunch of granola bars or something like that personally it all comes down to personal preference it all comes down to what you're doing whether what type you want to go for so if you are for example if you are hiking a hundred miles through the Rocky Mountains or something to that extent for example you probably don't want to be cooking in the morning because you already have so many other things going on you probably don't want to cook in the morning because at that point time time is precious because otherwise it'll be too hot to hike by the time you get out there's there's all sorts of good reasons why not to cook a breakfast but there's also a lot of reasons why to cook a breakfast cooked breakfast tend to be a bit more overall more new Tricia's if you will they tend to be a lot more morale-boosting it's a good way to start your day I mean think about it on weekdays for example you probably at home probably sit there and yeah make you get up in the morning you're half grogg you haven't had your coffee you make your I don't know let's just thanks sure yeah that's a pretty good pick-me-up on a Friday or Saturday I mean or a Sunday morning or something like that but on like a weekday what do you do you're just going for some cereal or something like that and you're like okay it's done I'm done it took me five minutes to eat but does that really get you up in the morning and you're like I want to keep going right or does a cooked meal do that better for you so you have to kind of gauge that out if you're just kind of hanging out I'd recommend you cook a meal if you've got stuff to do I'd recommend you just pull some granola bars that's kind of just a common rule about that and no matter what you're doing you want to keep it simple as Ben said you get up you're kind of groggy it takes some time to really get going a simple meal whether you cook it or eat or you don't allows you to just kind of get right into the process so for a cooked breakfast especially if you're starting out something as simple as boiling some water for some oatmeal or quickly making some scrambled eggs and you throw in some vegetables in it and cook it all together you don't want things that are overly complex you just kind of want things that you can cook with cooking clean quickly and then get right to the adventure yeah yeah I'm talking about this cooking versus no cooking I have a great example so a little bit of backstory at Devils Lake so one of the state parks in Wisconsin every year they have one weekend where troops and venture crews and girls Scout know those are troops as well yeah all the scouting programs come together and they do a big hike and I've gone with both my Boy Scout troop and my venture crew and they both do breakfasts completely opposite of each other so my troop always cooks on a satyr morning with the idea of getting up early cooking usually eggs or pancakes that's always our go-to so we have energy for this full day hike that we have and then Sunday we do know cooking is just like our milk and our cereal so we can get up clean right away and get out of camp where's my venture crew our Saturdays are no cooking so it'd be our milk and our cereal so we can get out on the trail right away and then Sunday some pourcel usually me has to wake up at 3 or 4 a.m. crack a ton of eggs mix in some meat and some potatoes and stuff put it in a slow cooker basically turn that on and let it run so on Sunday morning everyone has a great breakfast and they're all happy so we can clean up and get out now that philosophy is the exact opposite of what our true boys used to do and I'd like to kind of bring into like the idea of keeping it simple so a really great example of what is not simple is something we used to make in our troop all the time William you will remember this it was called iron man so it's simple in theory but in practice it's not so what it is is it's essentially eggs mixed in with potatoes peppers sausage or like breakfast sausage a ton of butter tons of grease and they always tried pulling all the the guys that came well before William and I would I say oh this is the hardiest breakfast you'll ever have right but it would every single year when we go to Devil's Lake we would always have to have this and it would take us two hours to make that breakfast so we wouldn't ever get on the trails until 9:00 o'clock and by then you know everybody's walked on the trails and you're already way behind and you know there's also you've missed half your day just by sitting around is that a good thing to do when you're just kind of hanging out and you just hanging out with the boys or with your friends or whatever yeah yeah sure it is but when you're trying to get something done mmm no that is not a good choice I will give it a few tricks for iron men since we've aged out I have done that cooking on my own in a kitchen and the biggest way to save time is to use frozen sausage yeah and use pre-made hashbrowns as that cuts the cooking time in half it's still not something you want to do on your first attempt but if you've gotten good at meals which i think is a kind of a separate thing if you don't have a big schedule that's the perfect time to experiment but when you are doing a more hectic adventure getting a meal that is something you have done before and you can knock out makes life a lot easier yeah I've done I've done Ironman actually at home a couple times and I've used a couple of those little tactics you just were saying there now the thing is Ironman if you cook it properly it is probably one of the best breakfasts you'll ever have in your whole life but only if it's cooked properly again it's pretty easy these people are surprised how easy it is to screw up eggs you know it's so simple and yet so difficult to make a really really good egg so you have to kind of gauge that so again it's a great pick-me-up in the morning but and if you got a ton of downtime it's definitely a great option but if you don't have the time or you need to get on the road or you need to get on the hike or you've got something else going on in the morning I can guarantee you getting an extra hour of sleep and making yourself oatmeal is perfectly fine this all being said what is of course the purpose of breakfast well the answer is its fueling yourself for your day so does it need to be something to Plex no it doesn't it shouldn't what are you looking for well you're looking for mostly carbohydrates maybe some protein preferably at least a small amount of protein in it if you can but you definitely want to have carbohydrates in a pretty large portion of it that's your that's your quick burn energy that's the stuff that gets you running in the morning your protein will pretty much give you a little longer period of time so you have to kind of balance those two things sugars energy okay that's the idea is a fuel breakfast is fuel it's what gets you started in the morning it's what gets you out there and of course William I think William you may become it's about cleanup right or was that Trevor I believe that was we'll all right well clean up keep it really simple again a man is a terrible example of something to do okay it is the most complicated cleanup I've ever seen if you'd make it good you're probably made in cast iron and if you made it in cast iron it ain't clean and easy so you don't just just avoid that if you've got stuff going on so I got one good example and then we'll wrap up breakfast if you want to quick easy actually I think it's really good some people have made fun of me for it but best quick I think's the brand either anyway they make these little yellow packages they're little plastic containers of pancake mix it all you have to do is add water to them it's like three cups of water or something like that you shake it in the container and then you can pour it right onto a griddle and make pancakes out of it so the only thing you have to clean is the plates that you ate it off of and whatever griddle you use and if you just buy that in syrup that's a whole breakfast right there and it's it's fast easy and tastes good and you can throw like fruit on it if you want or you can throw bacon around it you can throw bacon around - yeah that's actually I actually think that's a really good idea we never really did that Boy Scouts but or in our troop but it was we literally either did those pancakes or breakfast or garbage plate which is similar to your Ironman but it doesn't sound as complicated I don't know it's just meat potatoes and eggs and then you mix it all into one pot before serving it you don't have like four ish dishes to clean yeah maybe one day we might on maybe one day we'll do something on breakfast in general but yeah it's a breakfast keep it simple keep it easy you could choose whether to cook it or not cook it just gauge that to the adventure you're going on yeah and so we were talking about keeping breakfast easy lunch can be even easier for the main fact that again base it off the Devils Lake trip you are hiking when you have lunch so the easiest way to do it is just have no cooking what we always did was we made sandwiches we threw some snacks in there usually some fruit packaged cookies are super popular as well just other small things like that and you put them in your little lunchboxes your little paper sack and you throw that your backpack because then you can carry that with you and then you can eat lunch at any point on the trail that you want if we say keep breakfast simple then it keep lunch even simple or yes that's English but another big thing is to make sure whatever you bring for lunch it is gonna be in your backpack so try not to let it get smashed like we had bananas one year and some kid decided to put his lunch at the bottom of his back back and he had bananas all over his bag so either get a nice lunchbox like little plastic linings inside of them that keep them square or put at the top of your bag a few things in general that tend not to pack well are bananas and berries because they'll smash or fresh bananas berries traditional bread can get smushed so if you're making sandwiches keep them at the top of your pack if you're using crackers or chips that type of thing usually again either keep them at the top or they will get smashed for some easier ones granola bars and jerky are easy to throw into side pockets and if you want something in your main bag stuff like trail mix or dried fruit can get smushed without really ruining the lunch essentially yeah a big thing having what almost some people would consider snacks as lunch is totally normal both times I've been to two different national high adventure bases and scouting and our lunches sometimes have consist of the main meal being a bag of beef jerky and then we have some trail mix thrown in there Oreos or combos sometimes I think that was one of the lunches at Philmont and they just in little bags and usually it's towards the top because you don't want to take out your entire contents of your bag when you're hiking but a lot of times your lunch will be almost these snacks because a downside of sandwiches is they have the bread that gets smashed but they also have meat so like deli meats so if you don't keep them cold like if it's a long period of time like Philmont where it's weeks if you don't keep it cold they go bad now if it's just your general I'm gonna hike for about four hours and then eat it you'll be fine another fun thing I've learned from my second time at Philmont don't put pickles on your sandwich I like pickles so I put it on my sandwich and my bread was soaked I've had that happen a few times to me so one thing I just to add one thing I don't remember if you guys said it cuz I thought one thing I've seen I never I've never done this before but one thing I've seen that sometimes people who really like to make their lunch more extravagant because they have to have a taste of home every time they go out somewhere brings what do they call it like is it another ziploc not ziplock bags but the but the ziplock containers the hard plastic containers hard frame heart frame plastic containers really hard framed ones and they control things like yeah Tupperware that's what they call it and done and people will put all sorts of things in there for hikes I've seen some pretty interesting ones mostly online and some people who are being showy but you'll see everything from people who just put a sandwich in there or a couple of sandwiches in there or maybe put their entire lunch in that container because it just makes it really easy to soar you can store it wherever you want that's kind of the thing you can put a banana in there you can put berries in there as long as you have them in a hard container that being said harder containers are heavier but you know who cares yeah you know an extra pound doesn't ever hurt said no one ever so that there's that but seem like those kind of simple things that people literally bringing sushi with them like it's insane but it's a really kind of a smart way if it's a square kind of container fun fact this kind of goes into something we'll talk about probably later on in another podcast but square things store way better than round things so if you can have a square container that will store way better in a bag or something like that so that's something to consider maybe for your your food yeah and then uh moving a little on from lunch so we talked about sometimes lunches will be just snacks but then the next thing is pocket snacks is what I like to call them and that's when you are hiking and either it can be little leftovers from lunch or specific things you pack and sometimes you can either keep them in a very accessible pack spot on your backpack but if you're say at Philmont we're taking off your backpack is a hassle you literally keep snacks in your pocket so while you're hiking if you get hungry you just pull out your little pack of Oreos and you snack on some Oreos while hiking and that came with the great phrase that I learned that pocket snacks are not a joke so if you're the kind of person that gets hungry even after eating throw a few pockets necks in with your pack or in your pocket so yeah Mike my kryptonite is with pocket snacks is definitely fruit snacks I am a small child with fruit snacks okay William will attest to that yeah trying to ignore the pile of fruit snacks wrappers as right next to me for me it's Larabars or trail mix good I'm sorry I have a love-hate relationship and the only love part is I got hungry so I ate some well I've had larger jelly ones and that's almost it some of the other ones don't look bad but I've just been ruined by the peanut butter and jelly Larabars that I can't even anymore it's a shame I don't think it's a shame anyways at the very end of your camping experience could be the creme de la creme dinner this is usually your show off the piece and is almost always cooked even in backpacking unless you're exhausted you're likely gonna at least boil a little bit of some water to make a hot meal now the big trick when starting out with meals is the idea of a one pot meal in which you put every you put and cook everything in one pot as one pot meal for example one way you would use some sort of starch so instant rice noodles that type of thing and then you'd have your protein this could be a ready-to-use chicken or a packaged fish and you throw that in those little pre cooked sausage to blink things that come in a horseshoe those are good mm-hmm aren't those kielbasa is that kielbasa I have no idea it might have I don't know I don't the deal with that is but that it was a really good to have yeah sometimes some dried vegetables and then some sort of sauce this could be everything as simple to a homemade sauce you you brought or just a simple cheese powder that you throw in to make some cheesy rice there's a lot of very very very good options for dinners you could do everything the truth is you can do anything you really want for dinners one-pot meals are I think for for what we all three of us generally do when we camp one-pot meals work really well for us but some of us are also more the kind of leisurely campers and I'm sure somebody would love to have some girls food putting a fire on and cooking some burgers over the top of a fire or hot dogs or brats or sausage or whatever you want to call them it's a really good option as well of course you got to kind of make sure that you get them up to heat those kind of things but that's another option another good one that I really like mi troop did all the time is what's called a hobo meal the best ones I remember is we have the little frozen burger patties you put that in you cut up some potatoes you put that in you really just put anything that you want in there a little dollop I think of cream of cream of potato cream of chicken soup just some corn and all those like little general things and it's all in your tinfoil you wrap it up tight and fold it up a few times to make sure that nothing like leaks out write your name on it and sharping you put it in the coals of the fire and let it sit it really depends on what you put in if you put potatoes and it sits forever and then you flip it over let it sit again and then you take it out peel it off and you just set your little tinfoil on your plate and you open that up and you just eat right out of there and it's it's some of the best stuff I've ever had yeah I've had that before it is I will actually highly recommend that actually as a possible first-time meal plan that's a real it's really good to do when you're in a group by the way if you've got like four or five or six people on your trek and all you've got a couple people who are maybe picky or aren't really the kind of people that want to eat what everybody else is eating because reasons or if you have dietary restrictions I'll tell you those hobo meals or those kind of those kinds of more solo kind of meals are really really good so one pot is really good for if you're either in a really really large group or in a really small group the hobo meals the more individualized meals I think are really good to have when you're kind of in a medium-sized group and you kind of are at the point of the night where you're just like yeah I don't really want to deal with like actually cooking or anything so those that's a really good option one thing actually I'm surprised nobody's mentioned is freeze-dried meals so mmm freeze there's of course there's a couple advantages and disadvantages the freeze-dried meals so first of all for those of you who don't know what freeze-dried meals are they're essentially like get these kind of meals from places like mountain house where they essentially it's a meal in a bag where you have all your all your stuff on the inside and it acts as a one-pot meal where you basically pour hot water over the top of it close the bag for five to 20 minutes depending on what you're cooking and the water will soak up into the freeze-dried food and then it's it's palatable now throws to that art it's really simple it's really easy and if you are coming out of a really really tough day it is probably one of the easiest ways to make a meal that will actually taste somewhat decent the cleanup is really simple unless you throw it into a pot you know you got to do is just close the bags and throw it away the next time you get an opportunity but I will mention that there is two big cons first of all freeze-dried food does not always taste very good because sometimes taste freezer burn I've never really seen that or experienced that personally but other people have way better taste buds than I do the second part of that is it's actually quite a bit more expensive it's like the equivalent a freeze-dried meal can sometimes cost more than going to like McDonald's to get a full course meal at McDonald's okay so that means like we're talking 10 to 15 bucks or a freeze-dried meal for two people so it's a little bit pricey another positive I want to throw in there is they last a while and they're pretty light because a lot of weight from things come from the water contents inside of them so they last forever in your bag most of them can get smashed up and still be pretty fine oh and they're pretty compact too yeah they're they're quite compact anyway but I do have to agree they taste quite bland I would invest in a little spice wheel if you plan to do all freeze-dried food that's what we did for my Apostle Islands trip we had all freeze-dried food just a camp paid for it and then we just bought a spice wheel as well big thing is that with a lot of these meals you have so many different options of cooking and with setting up your food that it's a good idea to just experiment with your cooking style in each individual campouts the one when you have time to fail you'll be able to succeed when it counts yeah and now that we've talked about meals and given you some suggestions of things you can cook another important thing you have to plan for is who's going to buy the food who's gonna cook the food and who's gonna prep the food I was a little out of order but so the best thing to do is come straight out of my troop is after you decide what meals you're gonna have list off the ingredients that you need for that give that to what's called your grub Meister and that's just the person that goes out buys the food brings it to camp with them and then we have little cooking schedules so we have like cook one and cook two and one of them's prep and one of them's cook depending on the meal and then we also have people that are assigned for cleanup as well so those are just things that you should always think of now once you get further along and if you keep camping with the same people we've gotten plenty of times where we've only a sub two assigned a grub Meister and then as as for camping we just know who's goodness or who's good at cooking what and who also just wants to cook that night and that's pretty easier than whoever doesn't cook has to clean up and that's what it just comes down to so let's talk about some of the common mistakes I mentioned the first one a little earlier is buying either too much or too little of food again I think that goes back to the planning it's easy just to when you're planning food say you're doing the pancake one where you just add water to make sure on the little bottle thing is they'll say about how many servings it is so if you know you're going with five people that's going to take either one of the big ones or two of the smaller ones that's kind of how our Patrol did it and we'd know that that would be enough food for us so basing things just off servings like on the box is probably one of the best ways to go but also some of those servings are just like your standard general ones so there are people that eat less and there's people that eat more so you also just have to know your group when you're planning for it a next one is improper storage so that would be colic when we talked about when you were with your lunch if you throw on the bottom of your bag and you have bananas in just a paper bag it's gonna probably get smashed so you just want to make sure that you store things well especially if you have things that need to stay cold put them in a cooler get some ice or ice packs or whatever and then lastly is just checking to make sure your equipments good so big thing is our troop always used the nice big stand-up kitchen stove or outdoor kitchen stoves whatever you call them that has like two burners it's just making sure that the flames come out of the burners correctly there's no holes in your hose and that your your tank of gas is filled and same thing goes for the smaller backpacking stoves and just even down to your knives making sure they're sharp and all your other cooking tools you guys want to throw some more in on common mistakes you've come across well campaign nope I think you've not I think you've got a hit just about all the ones I've made mistakes on so yeah yeah also make sure to turn your gas off when you're done cooking that astons yeah yeah careful with propane I mean it's I'm people light full stoves on fire because there was a gas leak if you're using white gas I repeat if you are using white gas do not let it leak that stuff blows up I can't watch scout burn his eyebrows off after I taught him how to do it correctly which I guess might be partially my fault by the kid before him did it right so anyway that that's my rant be careful with white gas toast those are kind of popular backpacking stoves they've gotten less popular I think they were yet they're popular with some of the backpacking stoves yeah yeah yeah essentially just like when you're cooking normally be careful with your equipment so you don't get hurt just a little comment about those stoves just a kind of a joke that's also a little darker we used when that when we were at NY LT my team we were given a white gas stove and all of us kind of knew the implications of a white gas stove so he gave it the nickname the suicide because the guy who had to carry it was the suicide ER because he had to carry a white gas stove in his hands there was a little bit of a an incident according to incident a couple of days earlier where somebody had almost blown themselves up with a white gas stove so we call them that wait did you get a good time did you walk the entire way to your campsite with it in your hands it was in your backpack yes they're not that dangerous it's got a ticking bomb you can turn it off we also carry it I mean we were also carrying an eight-person tent on somebody's shoulders so I mean you know ah back in the days and we didn't know how to plan our own trips exactly the best part is there was the staff leading us for that and we still were doing it wrong yeah alrighty so in our next episode we are going to be doing another gear guide but this time it'll be on tents sleeping bags and sleeping pads and other nighttime stuff you need if you need your little teddy bear and pillow I like a pillow anyway once again this has been a day for adventure get off your butts go outside and have a great day", "0DKMPi9Jbjc": "if you put that in front of me it's pretty gonna be really hard for me not to eat it i would have never done that before i feel absolutely full and satisfied my legs are getting shaky i feel like i want to lie down so monday morning the first thing that i do on a morning i fill my two liter water bottles so that i know if i have enough fluid intake without having to count to not get it back into the counting headspace usually by now i'm trying to avoid counting for the benefit of my mental health let's take some of this water and make myself a cup of coffee and after that we're going to switch over to tea i have one cup of coffee usually in the morning well the coffee is slowly let's think about breakfast after the surgery i don't really feel hungry but i feel an appetite and i feel a healthy appetite which is really good i love enjoying food again that's one of the most amazing things and today i feel like a smoothie bowl so i start my smoothie bowl by using a frozen banana i use it frozen mostly for the consistency and then you can either go with some frozen fruit we need to make a decision here what color do we want the smoothie bowl to be today so i want it to be a little like reddish purpley i'll take this like mixed fruit and i'm just going to try and pick some of the darker ones out you can obviously also use fresh fruit for this my problem with fresh fruit usually is that i don't use them up quick enough with smoothies you have to be real careful because it's very very easy to overeat with smoothies as soon as it's creamy and liquid you will most likely eat more fruit than you would if you would have to chew it people saying oh smoothies aren't that good anyways because the nutrients are lost when we are putting them through the blender i'm eating it because i like it and because my body feels energized after it i eat as much as i can until i feel full and then i stop and that's what you should do too i'm adding some oat milk i'm mattering it now and i'm also adding protein powder i even put this in my coffee i don't always put frozen fruit in here what i also use a lot is the company kenko i'm going to link it down below i love their smoothies named after the color that they end up being i've picked purple for today and that includes three blackberries six blueberries two raspberries two cranberries a half a date two strawberries half a banana all organic all fiber nothing else so i put it in here for additional nutrition for me and for the taste and by now you can already tell i would have eaten one and a half banana three blackberry six blueberries two raspberries two cranberries and then the teaspoon of fruit that i added in already just eating it today i am adding some mix with like pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds then i'm adding two teaspoons of coconut flakes half a teaspoon sesame seeds two tablespoons of honey granola i just love the crunchy topping of the smoothie now this is a normal big portion size and i'm not going to be eating this in one sitting so either i'm going to pack it up and eat it for my breakfast tomorrow or i'm going to have it as a morning snack between breakfast and lunch and or as an afternoon snack between lunch and dinner now for my coffee i also add a little bit of milk so 50 ml i sometimes do like to sweeten a little bit with hazelnut syrup which is pure sugar but what i also do is put protein powder in it and put one in because this powder just if you have a protein powder that you can use in water it actually works the taste can be really good it's in the afternoon so it's getting time for a little bit more of a hearty meal i still have two thirds of my breakfast i'd rather save that for an afternoon snack or tomorrow's breakfast because i want a change in food i'm following the meal plan by clean food dirty girl whole food plant-based meal plan i feel very good after eating it the yummy portion sizes are perfect for me for two meals i also like on the meal plans that usually on monday tuesday wednesday i might have a little bit more cooking to do and then on thursday friday it's just throwing together because i usually make something today that i reuse like the sauce the dressing or something on later dates please do not mind how my kitchen looks especially things like the oven the sink and everything i have a teenage boy that cooks his own food and i could be cleaning all day and there's my lunch i know i know i know please do not mind my timings i have a little bit of a different schedule than most people i had lunch at what like new niche i did not have a snack in between because i was full i just made myself a cup of tea black tea with 15 milliliters of oat milk and now we have the salad which i most likely will not eat much of but i do continue trying often times my stomach just says no to the raw fruit stuff the dressing that i used was not from this week's recipe because i had so much dressing left over from last week but basically my dressings are made the same as you've seen with the other sauces it's a lot of nuts and then spices in the blender cooked up or sometimes not cooked up sometimes with paprika or tomato included there's no processed oils all the oil comes from nuts and seeds and it feels wonderful to eat it and then we have the sweet potato with the cheese sauce that you saw me making and the bulkur i think it's called a coney island sauce and then topped with the coconut some mustard and green onions and obviously i won't be eating the full thing either and i will decide after the meal if i will give the rest to my son or pack it up and have a second portion um for dinner which will most likely be around like 11 p.m or something we now have 6 p.m my lunch is at 6 p.m so don't mind the hours please my schedule is off so you've seen me make a tea this tea now i will not be drinking this while i have my food i have my coffee with breakfast yes but usually it's advised not to have a beverage together with your food intake you don't want your stomach to fill up on drinks clothing mechanism of the stomach doesn't work the same as before because sometimes especially with a bypass it's switch and there's a chance that if you drink too much fluids while eating that it doesn't stain your stomach and it just go through and then you can overeat again that was one of the harder changes for me sometimes i take a drink to cool down what i have in my mouth or at the end of eating when i'm saturated that i take one or two sips now let's try the put the two i would have never before testing a plant-based diet put this combination together for one i love the sauces anyways that are nut based and everything because it's so much more healthy than the oil stuff i just feel like i'm getting good nutrition but also pairing a potato with a grain like burger i would have never done that before and i don't think it's because it's a vegan diet that it's good it feels good because i'm varying the ingredients much much much much more than i would on a boar diet the only thing that could make it better bacony coconut flakes let's see how much i will end up eating so i actually ended up finishing the salad i still have my breakfast smoothie i just made a another cup of tea to um get cozy splash of milk it's 10 p.m is roughly 4 hours after having my dinner and so i will be finishing the smoothie bowl well let's see if i will finish it so i have that as a snack because i know that sitting down with a book i then like to snack sometimes i also have some tangerines or something after the manga i will be recording something for some friends which might take half an hour and then i will do my workout i do still have dinner which i might eat after the workout if i feel like it it is close to midnight and i still have not done my workout because i was filming my manga monday and i was filming some discussion points around the weight loss journey and i'm starting to feel a little bit shaky and i haven't had any dinner so i'm thinking that i might need some nutrition thinking about do i just want to drink a replacement shake because that would kick-start my nutrition and potentially take care of it if it is a nutrition deficiency i don't know what's going on i don't know how i'm handling this i don't know what i'm doing but i'm just trying to figure it out i think let's make a toast and i hope that it works so first of all i am making a tea and i'm going to drink an herbal tea or a green tea i had two black teas today so maybe a coffee and two black teas is also what's causing the feeling a little off after drinking the next cup of tea i'm almost done with two liters which is amazing i don't always get to that goal but if i'm drinking tea i usually can so this is most likely my last meal of the day i'm probably not gonna eat it all in one go um probably one half and after eating this i will probably be up for another three-ish hours so i will have eaten three hours before bed so even if my dinner is past midnight i will still have three hours before i go to bed so after eating this i don't think i will want another snack potentially i should eat something sweet like one piece of chocolate just for like my head and to continue to tell myself that it's okay to eat chocolate let's close this for now let's go for the jasmine phoenix eye dragon pearls i needed some quick food because i feel off so i'm just going to make some avocado sauce i like this so much when i eat it it really helps my digestive system i'm probably going to finish half and then have a half as a snack in the afternoon in one and a half hours there are tea meetings so let's see if i can cook until then because then i can have dinner during the tea meeting one of the best things after the surgery is that i am able to enjoy food again maybe i should wait to work out for like half an hour let's work for half an hour do some emails cook so yeah that's what the whole meal looks like it's a huge asperger and i made the kale with the palm cabbage that i found and with normal kale and i'm let's see how i like the normal kale if it if it's any it's okay okay the cheese makes it good i think i'll chew that forever without drinking this is a tough one too much bun i think i need a smaller bun for this this might be one of these foods where i can only eat two three bites and then i'm done this is heavy potentially because of the bread i don't know let's see i'm done and that's it i'll try eating in a couple of minutes again to see if i can have another bite tasty i wish somebody else would enjoy this with me i love the creations that i get in the end but when i only eat like two bites it's not worth it is it eat the patty and sauces since i ate this i am having a nauseated feeling overall i love that i can enjoy food again but right now i just feel sick eating this now is a few hours ago i'm just making myself another cup of tea i'm going to try and make some food something that never usually fails one of my favorite types of food i'm going to make some ramen and only if i cannot eat this i will go for a meal replacement shake and hope that this picks me up so obviously this is a mighty portion again which probably is two three four portions depending on how i feel i find it incredibly hard to make a smaller portion due to the the ramen being a packaged thing so i'd rather make this big portion and spread it out and eat this two three times so i'll have something tomorrow then have less ingredients i like the variety i like that i can just use up all my leftover veggies so usually when i cook i have this big bowl of veggies so when i use i don't know 20 grams of onion i put the rest in there and then throughout the week with dishes like this i just use up everything that's left i was considering putting some collagen powder in there as well but i just went for the egg now let's try and see if this makes me feel a little bit better i feel a little bit shaky a little bit nauseous a little bit weak so i ended up eating quite a bit like a third of the ramen i feel absolutely full and satisfied even potentially a little bit too full morning i already made today's soup so um or prep now what do we want for breakfast i already had my coffee i am a little bit in the mood for a smoothie bowl again take one frozen banana so today i want the aquamarines kinko which is a six pineapple a quarter peach a third zucchini half a parsnip one date slice of lime 0.3 grams of blue spirulina and a pinch of fennel seeds i bought these due to an instagram ad and i have to say i didn't like much i think they seem to be good quality wise with a lot of vitamins and but i just did not like the taste i should have put a scoop of collagen powder into the soup so assuming that i will finish this as an afternoon snack i haven't finished everything that's on the list and i don't think that i will by the way really interesting my um smoothie bowl was this like aquamarine bluish green when i made it and now it's brown it's probably the banana doing it but i don't know the spirulina usually makes it this like bluish green color if you know why it's turned brown now please let me know i would love to know oh before i forget this i've been using the kenko thingies and i love them and they actually have a referral friend kind of thing where i can give you a code with ten percent of you for 10 euros i don't know how this translates to international other countries if it's 10 as well off your first box and i get some points um that got get taken off my next box so if you are considering testing them check in the description box i'm going to put a referral link down below i made a mistake i had a neighbor come over and drop off homemade donut and i ate half of the donut and now i feel sick i had enough dinner i had enough everything i decided to get rid of the um kale salad i finished the ramen and i finished the smoothie bowl it is now 9 p.m just wanted to show you this is what i ate super yummy super amazing i wanted to work out but my legs are getting shaky i feel like i want to lie down i'm wondering if i would stay awake if i keep sitting up or if i'm going to puke i'm probably going to fall asleep and sleep for half an hour good morning i look like a mess the coffee has started to brew putting a spoon of cola powder in it i feel a little bit off today potentially that is still because yesterday i ended up only drinking up a little over a liter yesterday and after i started feeling better after having the doughnut started getting really in immense appetite i don't know if you have ever had that where you wake up and you feel like oh my god i need to eat something i think it might be the result of crashing after the sugar and my body is saying oh now the insulin level is getting really low so i need the new sugar fix i actually ended up finishing the donut last night now um i don't feel hungry since the surgery but i feel this this weird feeling of fullness where i just do not want to eat more and that's what i'm feeling this morning so let's see if it probably go for a little walk and potentially i'll have breakfast when i come back one hour later i'm back from my walk and before i jump into the shower i'm just getting some breakfast going i feel like a hearty breakfast today so i'm steaming some veg like frozen veg i love to have a an array of veggies in my freezer i was contemplating broccoli because you can never go wrong with broccoli i love broccoli but then i saw this like a cabbage version but i really like it it's something in between cabbage and kale i'm heating up some brains i have this mix of grains that i cook actually i was really in the mood for rice but the rice berry that i that i have needs to soak for 30 minutes and i didn't want to wait for 30 minutes so i heated up what i already have then i'm currently soaking the raspberries so that i can cook it it's like this reddish brown rice and i love it so let's put in the grains and then one teaspoon of soy sauce and one teaspoon of sesame oil put the veggie on top and then i'm poaching an egg that goes on top and then some hot sauce and that's it so this is something that i would never have eaten growing up because it's not a breakfast thing honestly if you can eat bacon beans mushrooms sausages for breakfast why not cabbage and rice it just hits this like hearty meal spot that i sometimes need it's the soy sauce and the sesame oil that just make everything taste good and one thing that i've done for the past couple of months that made a huge difference for me let's try and make the presentation look nice just by adding some parsley i also think that hot sauce immediately makes it look fancy in a way i'm most likely going to eat a quarter to a half of a portion fun fact i didn't eat a lot of hot food before the surgery i had a very sensitive stomach issues with digestion i enjoyed spicy food but not hot i did not eat hot sauce at all before and i thought that after the surgery because my stomach is going to be smaller less fluids in my stomach working that i wouldn't be able to eat any sort of spiciness but for some reason i can and i'm enjoying it i might also enjoy this because i love kimchi i love in this kind of dish when the egg yolk is running and creating a sauce why not everybody eating this and this is left again i'm probably going to have this for potentially dinner so i have a different meal in between and it doesn't get boring that was yummy and that felt good so i'm having a day where i'm feeling a little bit off to be honest i'm not entirely sure what the reason is it could potentially be that i didn't sleep enough making myself my second cup of tea i'm doing the pure wellness ginger and aronia smells really good it has fennel seeds in it penal seeds just smelled so strongly it looks beautiful i love the look of beautiful pure loose leaf tea this is 22 ginger pieces fennel and a seed aronia berries some root sage lemongrass peppermint roses beautiful my son cooks and he cooks well for his 16 years of age i'm really proud of him being able to he he plans his meals he goes shopping everything and he actually told me he asked me yesterday if i can give him cash for his monthly uh for his weekly budget so he can walk to the store so you get some exercise i mean perfect world but then done clean my kitchen look like crab all the time i think i'm going to make the meal from the meal plan first because i can always make a kimchi chicken for my dinner and then eat the rest either give the rest of the grains and stuff to my son so he can skip preparing one meal or heck i can even freeze it and and put in the microwave on a day where i don't feel like let's get going and make easy artichoke quesadillas and zesty olive salad without lettuce because i hate olives so make let's make a salad as the cheesy quesadilla because i have prepped almost everything like the sauces and a lot of the ingredients i'm probably going to just rely on the sour cream that i made and the dressing that i made and it's beautiful how um let's see how quickly um i can toss this together now on day four where most of the ingredients are pretty much prepped so i already mentioned i'm having enough day tried having dinner again the rest from my breakfast bowl and usually i actually do enjoy this a lot but today i couldn't take it i actually still feel like like there's a big pound of dough or bread in my in my stomach i've actually i don't know if you can see this but like honestly something's like i look pregnant right now that's not normal my stomach feels hard and bloated and i feel gross and exhausted at the same time just after eating a couple of bites of um at the dinner it wasn't supposed to be today it was not supposed to be so right after the surgery a feeling like this i i would vomit this out so quickly and now my body is trying to keep it in and is trying to handle it it still feels wrong and off and i don't know what it is so usually people after the surgery have like one type of food that they don't digest anymore properly and that causes this stumping out of stuff or this um feeling really bad but with me as i mentioned i'm lucky that i don't have this one type of food but on the other hand i don't know what's causing it today i wanted to show you a great week that i'm feeling amazing that i'm so happy about doing this and how active i am and now i haven't done  because i've been feeling really bad this week i guess that's just the reality of it that you're gonna have battery good morning first of all let's get some coffee going let's talk about what we're doing for breakfast today so what we're doing today is a kimchi pancake because after yesterday i feel like i need some comfort food and a kimchi pancake to me is one of the biggest comfort foods i can have and i love it for breakfast and i actually love it with cheese oh that's the best thing it's total comfort food and i need that today let's make kimchi i just love kimchi kimchi feels so good so yummy just feels like my digestive system loves kimchi it's not as beautiful today as i like it to be because it broke and i looked like a klutz but that is probably because i for the first time filmed making it i love the big chunks of onion and kimchi let's see if i even eat half of this beast so throughout the day i had the rest of the kimchi jun i now have eaten the whole freaking thing because it's already late my kitchen is clean we're ordering food tonight ordering food having all the yummy forbidden stuff is possible now it's not forbidden it's about limiting the intake i'm also having some fries with it and fries is the only thing that could become critical so i'll probably just try very very few and that's it and then i'll have my fifth meal from the meal plan tomorrow and let's see i do want to work out later so i probably do that before eating but first i need to finish up two more things at work and i hope that by 9 pm i'm done with work and then eat and then finally read i'm in such a reading mood i need to read i didn't want to have another meal after the workout because i had the kimchi john and then i had a small portion of fries which i ate with mayonnaise which is my all-time favorite junk food and this is like my guilty pleasure that you can always get me with if you put that in front of me it's pretty gonna be really hard for me not to eat it so i ate it earlier and they were so so good and i think you know that you are in a good place when you eat three four french fries and you enjoy each bite so much that you do not need to eat a big portion to find so much enjoyment in this i ate a normal portion and then my stomach started acting out my body flushed it out but it wasn't painful or anything but i still didn't finish it there's still tons left like ton i do not feel the urge at all whatsoever to finish that bit good morning now that the coffee is finally running after me putting the coffee into the water compartment of the coffee machine i am now going to make the pancakes and no this video is not sponsored by shape republic hashtag wish it was this is vanilla and raspberry pancakes you just add water to this so i'll show you how easy this is we have our shaker like coin shaker bottle oh let's put the water in first let's throw them into the pan and think about if we want to decorate them with anything or if we want to eat them like this lunch today today is the last day that i'm doing a meal from the clean food dirty girl a meal plan and today is the day when we just throw all the rests together in a bowl and today is build your own cheesy pepper jack macaroni bowl first things first we're gonna cook some macaroni pasta and i'm wondering if i should cook them in the microwave i know it sounds potentially a little bit weird to cook a pasta in the microwave but it feels like it's using less energy compared to such a small portion on the stovetop now we're making some kale as per recipe the kale is supposed to go into the cooking water so i could either add it to the microwave but i think i'm just gonna fry it and then we're just gonna add some stuff some of our sauces that we made and just add it together so this is how much i have left actually most of it especially the pasta for some reason it's just feeling a little bit heavy in my stomach right now i had the pork choy left over so i really wanted to make it the whole thing is super tasty but it just doesn't feel right right now so potentially i will be eating a little bit of that later but yeah it's sitting here for a couple of hours now i am feeling a little bit packaged but i don't want the heavy feeling of the bulgore or pasta maybe like some pork choy but honestly it doesn't taste good cold ah no so i did make myself a little snack what's on my plate right now is one avocado and a small orange i think i first seen this combination on one of the clean food vertical recipes and honestly this is such a good combination i would have never expected it but it's so so good if you like avocado if you like oranges you don't even have to love either of them just if you think either is okay try together because honestly i like oranges okay i i don't eat oranges really but i buy oranges just to make this now and this way i'm loading up on some healthy fats today good morning it is sunday and i am having a hard time waking up today so i'm making some yummy comfort breakfast i'm making porridge and i do love the my muesli brand for porridge there's a few other brands that i love too i have like this full drawer full of porridge sometimes i enjoy quaker but this is like the unhealthy i want a quick kind of thing kind and sometimes the unhealthy kind of i love it quick way is roof as well this is not my favorite but they have like vanilla raspberry and blueberry yogurt and they're so good but they're more like a dessert and then i have recently thanks to the book boxes that have been sent to me discovered these they are so so good they feel a little bit more healthy i don't know if it's necessarily true yeah they have a little bit less sugar than this one but for some reason they don't taste overly like unnecessarily sweet and then one of my favorite brands is three bears they have amazing porridge and this is even less sugar i think this might be the least sugar that i of a brand that i like but yeah my porridge has some sugar in it because i like fruit or just something in it and then this one this one is what i'm having today it's a blueberry cheesecake which is one of my favorite flavors they have some flavors that i don't like necessarily but this one is so so good and actually this one has not even less sugar than this one now let's make that let's put some normal like whey protein into the porridge i'm using this one putting another scoop into my coffee and then we should be good to go and maybe finally wake up a little me to goo i have eaten not even half of it but this is really tasty and i'm most likely going to finish the rest as an afternoon snack done with my breakfast now i'm going to have my coffee so let's make some dinner i am in the mood for some cookie but i do not want too spicy so i do have this like ready sauce here but i think it might be too spicy today let's try and make a more creamy version that sounds good let's do that it was years ago but how can i forget were 16 up all night love and heartbreak was our life we got drunk and smoked your dad's cigarette jumped our life so i have finished the second half of the porridge my son doesn't like the top cookies i'm gonna hit that up as a dinner and that is that for today if you end up still having any questions please hit me in the comments below i'm happy to answer any question you might have i'm happy to do any follow up that's needed let me know what you think if you liked give this video a thumbs up hit that subscribe button let me know if there's anything else that you

this whole time and i hope that you have a wonderful rest of the day i hope to see you again on my channel real soon until then bye they would just assume that i know it's like asking an alcoholic to stop drinking stop i'm gonna stop this right here [Music] don't you know that i i'm would loving this moment can we stay here forever", "7aL_mpg-8No": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] [Music]

the day 15 of 90 days of no sugar no dairy and little to no carburetors so I'm feeling very good one thing I didn't I forgot to post at the beginning is my starting point so I started at a 188 pounds I am between basically 5 11 and a half so 71 and a half inches 188 pounds I forgot to measure my waist when I first started but as of right now today this morning on the same height I and I weigh 185 and my waist is 35 inches 35 and 18 inches like I said I forgot to do it at the beginning but i will say that is significantly different I definitely noticed a big change in my my waist size so I'm not trying to get too small as far as weight I'm not really concerned about weight at all I just want to have my body look better and I want to be in shape you know so depending on what your goals are make sure you set a reasonable goals make sure you set achievable goals that way you can achieve your goals you know so yeah that's that i also want to get into a little more detail about how I'm feeling I'd know I've been saying I feel good I feel good but what exactly does that mean all right so um the the main thing is I've been able to actually hold on to my cutbacks like when I cut back on sugar and cut back on Gary I've been actually able to do that and uh and that's something now I thought was going to be the hardest thing for me because uh like I said before my other videos i am a Candy Man and I mean is true and uh so last Sunday night yesterday the last Sunday was really rough for me because I was running late for my second job in the morning and I forgot to I didn't forget I didn't have time to eat breakfast cuz i was running late and man i forgot to pack my snacks for me because i usually go to work with snacks whether it be fruit or vegetables and i forgot to pack a snack so basically i didn't eat breakfast I don't have a snack or anything so when it came lunchtime you know Sunday the closest restaurant healthy restaurant is closed to us is chick-fil-a but since it was Sunday chick-fil-a wasn't open so outside of that there was just burger burger joint so I was so starving i just ate a burger made a double bacon burger no cheese a double bacon burger and some disgusting fries so that was bad and that was bad but I do allow myself to eat carbs for lunch so because of working out and stuff like that so then you know when you think of it it's uh it's still a win because it was still within my set goals that this past week has been rough too because of my first job has been very demanding this week so I really didn't get a chance to work out as much as I wanted to I didn't get to go in every day like I initially set out to so that's been rough but this next week shouldn't shouldn't be as bad so I shouldn't have such a an issue with working out and stuff like that so um if you're anything like me make sure that you take time every day to work out even if you're just walking around a block a couple times or running around the block a couple times make sure you do that every day make sure you pack your lunch pack just your snacks and stuff it's best if you do it the night before that way if for some reason you're rushing in the morning is already made because just grab it and go snacks are very important in this for me because uh if you don't if you don't eat well then you won't be able to lose weight you have to you have to eat which is pretty ironic another thing I've been drinking either water or these ice sparkling waters they're flavored sparking water you can get in my either walmart or the gas stations they are very good i drink those all the time i even drink i'm up for breakfast too which kind of sucks cuz i know what you're saying like why don't you just drink orange juice well if you look at the bottle orange juice has a lot of sugar in it and the thing is with fruit period oranges period has a lot of natural sugar but the thing is I would rather eat an orange or drink freshly squeezed orange juice that I made knowing that there's no added sugar rather than getting some minute maid orange juice but you don't know if they're hanging sugar to it so so yeah I haven't been drinking orange juice even though it's healthy for you because of all the sugar and me not knowing if it's added sugar or the natural sugar so this for for lunches and dinners and stuff especially dinners I've been eating salads but i did was i got this spring the spring mix from from winn dixie is a local grocery store it's pretty plain I mean it has like four different types of lettuce in there and spinach but uh what you can do is you can get some chicken tenders that's already scanned and stuff in boneless and you can season it and put it on a skillet or you can put it in the oven and cut it up it's easier for me to cut it at first while it's uh uncooked and then season it that way you can add almonds you can add carrots shred ups and carrots you can cut up some celery kind of some bell peppers or any other peppers that you like you're gonna hard-boil egg cut that up put that in there you have a lot of options instead of just plain old salad so yeah do do that for your dinners it's going to you probably want to eat half a bag just for dinner because uh it's just going to be that hungry you know II to have a bag for forgetting what else and you can pretty much you're pretty much it's the way my diet is you're pretty much a fair game for anything from lunch so that's the one good thing because you are working out your body does need protein your body does need carburetors so you know because you're working out so you're pretty much fair game for lunch I would you know if you have the opportunity do like wheat bread if you eat a sandwich or burger or something like that I wouldn't suggest eat fries I would suggest to substitute that with like a bowl of fruit or something like that but if you you know eat the bowl of fruit make sure you have your vegetables for your snacks like your carrots of your celery stuff like that and that's about it if you're doing the diet with me go ahead comment below let me know how you're feeling let me know some of the recipes that you're using even though some of the menus that you have that we can share we can expand our minion like I said it is day 15 of 90 days and I'll see you next week if you have any comments suggestions questions hit me up comment below and I'll see you later oh one more thing i say i'm not worried about weight so much because i am trying to build muscle and muscle weighs more than fat and there's some people who they'll hold that stupid one pound of muscle is the same as one pound of fat well check this out i'll put like this 110 pounds of bricks is the same as 10 pounds of feathers they weigh the same but 10 bricks weighs more than 10 feathers say this again 10 pounds of bricks weigh the same as 10 pounds of feathers but 10 bricks weighs more than 10 feather right so the amount of fat that you have weighs less than the amount of muscle that you have so somebody's ways yeah you got to people that weight 180 pounds one it has 0% fat and one has 75 percent fat they are going to look significantly different the one that has service in fact that weighs 180 pounds is going to look smaller more fit alright so that's my goal so even if my weight stays at 185 or doesn't get that low I'm okay with that because the muscle that I'm gaining is going to take over there that's all I want to say about that and okay", "H1wCxeckW6o": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so

to start editing i didn't have an intro so this week is a all cold food week when i was making my menu i could not think of anything hot that just tripped my trigger nothing nothing sounded good nothing sounded like i want to mess with it except for the french toast casserole which let me tell you is delicious oh it is a recipe i found in a taste of old magazines i got at the thrift store the other week i changed the recipe to lighten it up i cut it in half i used a whole different bread and i think the bread's what made it so good it's this limited edition pepperidge firm strawberry swirl bread limited edition of course david's like well just get some more put it in the freezer i think it'll be good with the original recipes and raisin bread you know raisin swirl bread whatever um but when i saw the strawberry i had to change it i think it would be good with their other swirl breads i think it would be delicious come fall with their pumpkin swirl brand so this is definitely a recipe that i'm keeping i will be making it again because it is that good i tasted a little corner that's how i know but the rest of it is just assembly it's just an assembly line pretty much um a couple things i made in the beginning i didn't show at the end because i made them yesterday the uh honey mustard dressing from jones pointed plate i made that because i want to have that with my sandwiches i didn't pull it out and show it at the end and i made some jello fluff and i didn't pull it out short then but we got through it on the videos so let's just let's just go right into it and see what i'm gonna have for this week and i'll i'm just telling you right now i'm gonna stay on track because of these foods i don't have i don't have an excuse this meal prep gives me no excuse to not stay on track so let's just go get started i'm gonna start out making the honey mustard dressing from joan over at jones pointed plate i already have in here three quarters cup of mayonnaise three tablespoons of honey and five tablespoons of dijon mustard we're going to whisk that up until it's really smooth now we're going to add two tablespoons of sugar it's not much fruit it's sugar four tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and two tablespoons of soy sauce and there again we're going to whisk it now here i just want to show you how much it makes of a pint jar so i'm going to say a cup and a half for the jello fluff use any box of sugar-free gentlemen flavor that you like to that we're going to add a half a cup of boiling water and then we want to whisk it around until it is completely dissolved and once we do that we're going to add a half a cup of cold water and just stir it around let it sit in the fridge for about half an hour that's all it's going to take to cool it down and then we're going to add our yogurt now i'm using full fat greek yogurt but the original weight watchers recipe is for non-fat greek yogurt but whisk it in until it's really really smooth we'll see here in just a second it um turns a nice pastel color then you know you've got it whisking correctly pour it into four half cup uh containers that's how much it makes let it sit in the fridge now i want you to see how it sets up just like jello except it's creamy and it's very smooth now it does have the the tart tang of the yogurt so just be aware of that next up is our french toast casserole made with this pepperidge farm strawberry swirl bread limited edition so future ones will have to be made with some other braces i took half the loaf which is eight ounces cubed it half is going into the bottom of this sprayed eight inch baking dish this is four ounces of cream cheese i'm just using regular cream cheese and we're going to dot it all over the top the whole four ounces then we're going to top that with the rest of the bread crumbs or bread cubes i should say now we're going to mix the egg mixture so we start with four eggs to that a quarter cup sugar-free pancake syrup quarter cup of muck fruit one tablespoon of vanilla and three quarters cup of half and half whisk that really really well until it's completely combined pour it over the bread mash all the bread down into it get everything covered and kind of coat it as best you can cover it put it in the fridge overnight the next morning let it sit out for a half an hour to come to room temperature then we're going to bake it covered for 30 minutes uncover it and bake it for another 20 or until the knife inserted in the middle comes out plain now this part is for when i get asked what is liver mush people want to know what is liver bush this is they call it liver pudding but here we just call it liver mush i'm trying to show you the ingredients it's pig liver it's pig meat it's cornmeal it's spices it comes in a loaf it's fully cooked you can eat it as it is if you want to eat it cold i've done that but the best way is the pan fried see how it's just a nice little um square of whatever you want to call it i don't know here i just want to show you how it browns on the outside i'm undercooking it simply because i'm going to reheat it throughout the week now the casserole baked exactly like i described 30 minutes covered 20 minutes uncovered and you see that knife is perfectly clean now what we're going to do is we're going to cut it into nine servings because i think four is going to be really um really too big once we get it cut we'll divide it into our little breakfast containers there'll be two pieces left i'm saving that for david see how nice that is listen i tasted it i'm just going to tell you it's delicious then we add two pieces of living mush to eat plate each plate and there you have it breakfast is done now on the lunch our sandwich tray i'm starting with this favorite lettuce of mine they're washed and ready to go green leaf lettuce so i'm just taking it out cutting in half done there's our lettuce couldn't be easier next up are our onions i'm just slicing them in half and then separating them apart i thought that would be a good size for sandwiches this is just to show you keep a container of onions in your fridge for cooking later in the week makes it so much easier now i want you to see this tomato knife i got this along with the cutter you want to see with my peaches in 1985 as a wedding gift from my first marriage that is how these last this rada cutlery i will link it below spinach this is just because i had some in the fridge and david likes them on his sandwich pickles because what kind of sandwiches doesn't have a pickle then i didn't have any banana pepper rings but i did have these vidalia onion strips they're pickled so david won't eat them but i will and there you have it there there's a quick and easy sandwich tray there's the meat we're gonna use some lemon on bologna for me and then roast beef these are the little squares from the dollar tree that you put between hamburger patties but they're just little wax paper squares so nothing's gonna stick and it'll separate it out i'm gonna weigh them into two ounce portions some are more some or less but they're close enough so first i do the lemon on bologna i got like two sandwiches out of it and then i do the um [Music] what is that roast beef and i just stack them on top of each other with the little wax paper as dividers then for the cheese now i take a butter knife and try to because that's a thin cheese and it breaks really easy you can see i have one there but i catch them that way when we go to make our sandwich we don't have to go through this trouble see it's just ready to go i just put it in there with the meat there's our meat and our cheese here i just want to share food proof boiled eggs cover them with water bring them to put a little pinch of salt in it bring them up to a rolling bowl boil them for 10 minutes dump the water out flash them with cold water and peel them as soon as you can touch them you'll see coming up they're beautiful eggs look how pretty those are so i'm putting two whole eggs in each tray yep kind of fitting pretty tight but that's okay now this is a cottage cheese that container that that section is a cup and so half of that's gonna be a half a cup of cottage cheese and that leaves room for my peaches this is the other cutter i was telling you about it was just cheaper to buy a can of peaches and chop them myself instead of those little cups and you can see here it it does the trick that is also erotic cutlery that came with my win gift um i will have them both linked now these are just applesauce cups that i saved oh my gosh probably three years ago i keep using them so i just separate the the um peaches out stick them right there in the tray next up is my frito lay cheese dip half of that little container is two tablespoons so i'm just eyeballing it i'm not gonna get out the tablespoon which i said i was gonna weigh and measure but i think i'm close enough so we'll just put those in there and then the next thing up are these um pretzela pretzel puffs i don't know what you call them pretzel nuts i don't know but they're delicious whatever they are i have used pretzel sticks and i have used honey mustard i have used um the little pretzel twist just whatever you're in the mood for and so i put six of those in each tray so there you have it there's our snacks okay we're just getting right to it here's our breakfast for the week the french toast casserole with liver mush here are our ingredients for sandwiches i'm using the atorius lavage bread that i got at leedle dave is going to use regular bread but i thought hey that's perfect there's beautiful veggies that is one way that i will eat my veggies so that's a bonus and then here's the snack trays which i'm not gonna sit down and eat the whole snack tray in one sitting i will have it throughout the day so hopefully what you see here is going to keep me on track this week it's going to keep me from trying to scrounge around for something i really shouldn't eat and i hope you enjoy this video and i will see you on my next one [Music] you", "fXk_Zd90a1w": "[Music] [Applause] [Music]

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] oh", "Ht3L3b52JRs": "hi friends welcome back to my channel and welcome if you're new here it is Monday so that means that it is meal prep day I can't wait to share these three recipes with you guys we do a breakfast a lunch and a dessert that is out of this world and wait until you see the smart points and on top of that it is clean eating you cannot go wrong at all with these three recipes so if you want to see what's on my prep for the week stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] breakfast this week I'm going to be making individual baked oatmeal cups I'm really excited about this very clean healthy breakfast I'm going to pair this with eggs and fruit so let me show you what is in our oatmeal cups first you're going to need some rolled oats I'm going to be using my favorite ones from the thrive market these are the organic rolled oats highly recommend the thrive market you guys know I love it of course the link is down in the description box it'll get you 20 dollars worth of free product when you join the thrive market and you're gonna be seeing of course a lot of thrive products in this meal prep as well as most of my videos they really have affordable prices and they have literally anything and everything you would need for a healthy clean diet so definitely check them out again the link is in the description box we're also going to do some chia seeds milk or milk alternative of your choice I'm going to use a forager cashew milk baking powder unsweetened applesauce cinnamon and vanilla extract some salt honey in egg and then whatever toppings you want for your oatmeal cups I'm gonna do zero point toppings so it doesn't increase the points of my oatmeal cups themselves so I'm going to be doing some fresh blueberries and then some of these organic dried goji berries from dried I count these as zero because all that's in here is goji berries so there's no added sugar or anything like that so I don't count points for these because to me this is basically like a regular fruit so those are gonna be my toppings for my oatmeal cups so let's get started so in a fairly good-sized bowl we're gonna mix together one egg we're also going to add one cup of unsweetened applesauce so go ahead and we're also going to do about a teaspoon of our vanilla extracts we have one mashed banana I did not show you guys this when I showed you all the ingredients so I apologize you're also going to need one fairly ripe banana that you mash up and then last but not least I have a quarter of a cup of my raw honey so I'm gonna go ahead and add in that and then we are going to give this a mix until all of these wet ingredients are nice and combined before we add in our dry ingredients once your wet ingredients are combined we're gonna go ahead and add in two and a half cups of our rolled oats we're also going to add a pinch of salt I just use the pink Himalayan that's just really gonna help bring out the flavors we're gonna do one eighth of a cup of chia seeds a little bit of cinnamon or a lot of bit of cinnamon whatever your preference is the recipe calls for a tablespoon so we need quite a bit of cinnamon added to our dry ingredients and then one and a half teaspoons of baking powder so I have a half of a teaspoon here so I'm just gonna go ahead and add three of those and then we're gonna give this a quick mix together before we add in our almond milk all right last step is we're gonna put in our almond milk or whatever milk you're using and give that another stir and that was one in a quarter cup of milk so we're gonna make sure that it gets nice and combined and then we'll be ready to put these into our muffin cups and get these into the oven so I went ahead and pulled out my muffin pan this is a fun silicone one super cute I got this at Fred Meyer so I went ahead and just sprayed it with some of the avocado oil nonstick cooking spray you can also use a paper liner whatever your preference is and we are going to fill these with about a quarter of a cup of our oatmeal mixture we want to make sure we get 12 muffins so you can always go back and add a little bit more but it's a lot harder to take away so I'd go a little bit light on the amount to start and then again we can always go back in and add some more so go ahead and fill all 12 of your muffin liners with your oat mixture and then we'll be ready to add our toppings and get these into the oven [Music] I want to be daring baby dance the night away I let my hand outside one now that there fills with the Omo mixture we're gonna go and add topping so again I'm going to do some blueberries so I'm just gonna kind of plunk these in to the oatmeal mixture and then I'm also gonna go ahead and add a couple of goji berries I'm gonna kind of push those down in I want to make sure that my fruit stays in the oatmeal Cup as it goes through the cooking process so I'm doing about four blueberries in about four or five of the little goji berries and that's gonna be my topping so let's get the toppings on so we can get these into the oven hey I won don't you just get tired chasing Fame and feed pretty alright they're ready to go into the oven 350 degrees until their cooks through it's going to take about 30 minutes I'm so excited for these the oatmeal cups are out of the oven don't these look delicious next time I probably or for you guys if you're gonna use a dried fruit like these goji berries I put them on once you pull them out of the oven because you can see they got a little bit Brown because they were already dry so that's one difference that I would make still going to taste delicious not worried about it but for you guys that's probably a good tip so I'm gonna let these cool for a couple minutes we'll pop them out of the muffin tin here and I'll show you what I'm having for breakfast and give you the smart points so our oatmeal cups are cooled I just popped them out of the cupcake liner they came out like a champ so make sure you spray it your muffin tin if you're not going to use a paper liner my gosh these look so good look at these you guys they're nice and thick and just dense with oatmeal and then we topped them with those goji berries and blueberries these look amazing so each one of these oatmeal cups is for smart points and that's on the blue and green plan if you are on purple these are only two smart points because your oats are zero points so I'm planning having one of these oatmeal cups an egg whether I fry that or be hard boil that and then I'm just going to pair it with just a few extra of these organic blueberries and that's gonna be my breakfast that way my breakfast is only 4 smart points so can't beat it I am going to store these in a plastic container with a lockable lid so they stay nice and fresh and I'm just gonna put them in the fridge and each day I will take one to eat but how amazing of a breakfast and it's only 4 smart points [Applause] [Music] for my lunch this week I'm going to be making turkey meatballs with an apple and onion the original recipe calls for red onion but I don't have any so I'm just subbing minced onion and then I'm gonna roast some veggies so I'm gonna roast up some butternut squash and some organic beets and I'm gonna have those on the side with my meatballs and in my veggies or for my veggies I have avocados and then I'm going to be topping my veggies with the DAX green zest you guys know this is my all-time favorite seasoning for vegetables it's so good the veggies come out so flavorful I love Dax because not only are they all-natural so there's nothing artificial no fake anything so it's a nice clean spice there also natural MSG free and all of the ingredients you can literally pronounce in the seasoning so it's very very simple very minimal ingredients I love the Greens asked for veggies I actually have all of the DAX seasonings because honestly I love them all I do have 10% off and free shipping for Dax that code will be here on the screen give them a try they're a small business great to support them during this time and you won't be sorry because with their seasonings all being salt free they're great before weigh in or if you watch your salt and they're full of flavor like full of flavor so I'm gonna put some of this on my veggies and then I'm also gonna put a little bit of the Trader Joe's onion salt and then for the meatballs you're going to need a pound of ground turkey so I just have some 93 seven organic ground turkey you're going to need an egg salt and pepper again I'm using minced onion in place of red onion poultry seasoning garlic powder and you're gonna need a granny smith or green apple so let's get started on this week's lunches so the first thing we need to do is go ahead and chop our beets I'm just going to put them in a bowl here and we also need to dice up our apple and I'm gonna put that here in a bowl as well and then we can start assembling our meatballs you get the better let me show you what a cool tie looks like it's so much better [Music] ah [Music] Quizlet Arnold loves you know better [Music] baby so let's put together the meatballs with my beat hands it's hilarious so I have my 1 pound of 93 7 ground turkey to that I'm gonna add my chopped apple I ended up having more apple then my little Bowl would hold here so I have the remainder just on a paper towel so we'll go ahead and add that in and then we're also going to add one egg that's going to help bind our meatballs and then for onion it calls for a half of a cup of red but because these are minced I'm only gonna do about a quarter of a cup of minced onion and then we're gonna add some garlic powder and again you can season this to your liking the recipe calls for about a teaspoon of garlic powder and then we have some poultry seasoning as well and we want about a tablespoon of that that is what is going to give our meatballs that authentic meatball flavor so it's really important to add in that poultry seasoning and then we're gonna do just a pinch of pepper and again just kind of to your liking and a pinch of some pink Himalayan salt and then we're gonna use our little spoon here and combine this all together to create the meatball mixture and then we'll get ready to roll these out and get them on a sheet pan we are going to put these in the oven right alongside our vegetables and where they're both gonna get roasted at the 425 degrees so let's get this combined and get these meatballs or ready to go so we're ready to do the meatballs look at how good that looks so this recipe makes four servings so it really doesn't matter the number of meatballs whatever the number you get you want to divide that by four to make the four servings so I've lined my pan here with some parchment paper I'm going to use my cookie scoop to scoop out my meatballs it makes it really easy and that way I'll have to dig my hands in these scoops I find these on Amazon and I will make sure that I link them down below for you guys but I'm just gonna use those to form my meatball and again I'm not really concerned with the number of meatballs that I get because I will simply just take the number that I get and divide it by four for the four servings so let's get these scooped out onto our sheet pan here and then we'll go ahead and get those roasted veggies on a sheet pan season those up and we'll be ready to put everything into the oven I went ahead and put my beats and my butternut squash here on my sheet pan I decided that I'm going to add a bag of broccoli as well I have a ton of frozen veggies right now and I think I mentioned but our microwave isn't working we're in the process of getting that replace from our home warranty company and they're really quick to take your money but not really quick to replace your appliances so we still don't have a microwave so this is gonna be the best way I think for me to get in some greens is by just adding this bag of frozen broccoli directly to my sheet pan so these are my veggies so to that I'm going to add about a tablespoon of my avocado oil so I usually do one quick swipe across and then one quick swipe this way and I count about a tablespoon worth of avocado oil which I believe is four points so I will add an extra point to whatever my meatballs end up for the vegetables and then I'm going to season these with some of the DAX and hey the more the merrier when it comes to seasoning on these uh veggies so I'm gonna go ahead and add the DAX and last but not least just a very small amount of the Trader Joe's onion salt and that just kind of brings that onion vibe into our roasted veggies and then this is going to go in the same 425-degree oven as our meatballs so let's get everything into the oven so that we can have lunch ready to go all right our veggies are out of the oven steaming piping hot so I'm gonna go ahead and add these to the meal prep containers the meatballs are already in there as you can see here and I'll be back to show you the whole lunch and give you the points all right so here is lunch you guys I cannot wait for this lunch first I want to show you did not end up using all of the roasted veggies which is fine I love to have these as an easy warm up side dish I even like to add these on to salad with dinner or lunch they're really really versatile so I'm totally fine having extra but I'm going to count one smart point for the roasted veggies just because I did end up using the olive oil so I'm going to count one point for my veggies and then we have three meatballs per day so it ended up making 12 meatballs it is for smart points purse serving so all three of these big meatballs is only for smart points and then you add the one point for the roasted veggies you guys this is a five smart point lunch look how amazing this looks you even have room for a fruit if you wanted to add a fruit and you can also add something sweet to finish off your lunch and you have plenty of points to spare so this is a five smart point lunch so I decided with my lunch I'm gonna have some papaya and I just thought that I would show that to you guys I went ahead and just cut this all up babs it up and that's gonna be kind of my fruit or sweet treat with lunch [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I lose my breath whenever I see you you stole my heart what is it that you do life was great too you added colors money system we don't care about the others [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're my heart things I look at how yummy this looks oh my gosh I'm so excited literally you guys this is the best marinara it's that simple it takes five minutes to put it together I'll show you guys once it's done how I packaged it up I just freeze it and pull out a jar as needed so wait till you guys see this it is seriously the best marinara this is the skinny ish dish and of course this recipe will be on my website so I'm gonna go ahead and turn this on I think I'm going to do mine on high just because I'm starting this a little bit late for four hours and then I can come back and change it down to low if I feel like it's just cooking a little bit too fast for another four hours or so so let me get this closed up and we've got marinara going so I want to show you guys how I do my crock-pot marinara you can see we still have a couple hours left but I sort in mason jars so I have these really large ones these are like 32 ounce and I will put a few of those and then I generally do a couple small jars as well this is if I want to make pizza or maybe chicken parm or something that I don't need a lot of the marinara at once I will have some small jars and then I'll have quite a few of the big 32 ounce jars the rule of thumb is if you're gonna freeze it it's just shallow the jar a little bit so when it expands when it freezes it doesn't pop the lid off I've never had a problem I've never had the jar break I've never had the lid pop up nothing of the sort so that's how I store my marinara I literally just put them in jars put them in the freezer and when I need them I pull them out defrost them and you have zero point marinara whenever you want it [Music] [Applause] [Music] for a snack or sweet treat this week I'm filling all things spring so we're going to make a lemon poppy seed loaf we are making a glaze with frosting loaf and wait till you guys hear the smart points and we're using good whole clean ingredients full fat yogurt full fat milk I can't wait to share this recipe with you so let me show you what's in our lemon poppy seed loaf you're going to need some whole milk just some all-purpose flour this is the organic all-purpose from the thrive market again thrive is linked down below LeConte Oh monk fruit sweetener and they're powdered sugar and this is for the frosting or the glaze of the loaf you'll need some almond extract vanilla extract some poppy seeds baking powder baking soda some sort of oil I just have Auto Cod oil here it doesn't have any flavor so it doesn't affect the flavor of the loaf you'll also need some full fat or whatever you want to use not Greek yogurt a fresh lemon and last but not least some salt so let's make some poppy seed lemon bread so to start our loaf I have a fairly good-sized bowl here to that I'm going to add two cups of the organic all-purpose flour again you can use whatever flour you have on hand and then I have the zest of that large lemon I went ahead and just zested the whole thing I always figure the more lemon zest the better I don't worry about measuring it out because I really think it brings that brightness of lemon to your your bread so there's my lemon and then I have two tablespoons of poppy seeds so I'm going to add those and then I am going to do about a half of a teaspoon of my peak salt and we need to go ahead and add our leveling agent so we need three-quarters of a teaspoon of both so there's half of a teaspoon and then another quarter of the baking soda and we're gonna do the same with a baking powder and then we'll give it this all a good stir get those dry ingredients combined and then we'll be ready to add in our wet ingredients next we're gonna mix together some of our wet ingredients so we need one tablespoon of oil again whatever oil you are using this is just the chosen foods avocado oil and then we're going to add in one egg I don't think I showed you guys at the beginning I don't know what my deal is today but you're gonna need one room-temperature egg as well and then about a teaspoon of vanilla extract and then we're just going to whisk this together before we add in the yogurt and the rest of our wet ingredients next we're gonna go ahead and add in our lemon juice I have about two tablespoons of fresh-squeezed just what was left of that large lemon that I stood and then I'm also going to add the 1/2 of a cup of Greek yogurt mine is the whole milk full fat it does not adjust the points really to add the non-fat it may save you a small amount I honestly didn't figure that out into the recipe so you can certainly reput the ingredients into the recipe builder if you want to use nonfat Greek yogurt instead of regular Greek yogurt but like I said it for me I don't think it's going to change the points and I've been only having full fat dairy so whatever your preference is so go ahead and give that a mix together and then we're gonna start alternating between this mixture our flour mixture here and our milk so I have my dry ingredients here I have six tablespoons of whole milk and then I have the yogurt egg mixture that we put together over here so first I'm going to go ahead and add a little bit of the milk to my dry mix and we're just going to slowly incorporate all of these ingredients into our dry mix until we have batter and then we'll add this to our bread pan and get this into the oven [Music] I right so we're ready to get our bread ready and go into the oven so I'm gonna go ahead and spray my bread pan really really well with some nonstick spray this is just the chosen foods avocado oil and then I'm ready to go ahead and add my batter my oven is preheating to 350 degrees and we're going to cook our loaf until it is cooked completely through it's probably going to take between 40 and 45 minutes that's just going to depend on your oven so we'll get the batter in here and get it ready to go in so our bread is going in 350 degrees until it is cooked through 40 to 45 minutes so while our breads in the oven we're gonna make our glaze so I'm using the Lepanto powdered sugar this is 2 times sweeter than regular sugar so it's actually half of the amount of this versus regular sugar so the recipe calls for 4 tablespoons of powdered sugar so I went ahead and just did 2 tablespoons of this because it's 2 times sweeter so we want to use half the amount and then we're also going to add in just the tiniest bit of almond extracts and we're also going to send it out with some milk so I'm just gonna put in a little bit of milk to start and then we'll start stirring until we have that glazed consistency you don't want to add too much milk right off the bat or your glaze is going to be too thin this actually looks really good so we're just going to go ahead and set this aside until that loaf comes out of the oven and is nice and cooled all right our Lemon Poppyseed loaf is out of the oven we're gonna let this cool just a few minutes in the pan then I'll pop it out and allow it to cool completely once it is cooled we're gonna go ahead and add on this please and then I'll be back to show you our completed bread and we'll go over the smart points once we put on that place all right our loaf is fully cooled so what we're gonna do next is take this glaze that we made and we're just going to drizzle it right over the top oh my gosh you guys this is gonna be so good I cannot wait to try this I'm actually going to have this for a snack today because I love everything in anything lemon as you so I'm excited for this so I'm gonna get this glazed oh it's so pretty well cut this into 12 slices and I'll be back to show you our completed lemon move and give you the smart points all right so here it is so this is a slice so we want to haven't cut it into 12 equal slices so that is a good sized slice as you can see here so the loaf again it makes 12 slices so each one of these sections gets cut into three and it is only three smart points per slice on all plans you can have a frosted Lemon Poppyseed loaf basically cake for three smart points cannot wait of course this recipe will be on my website which is linked down in the description box [Applause] [Music] so here are my snacks for this week I actually have three snap options I don't eat all of these every day these are just my options for the week so I did haul these in my recent thrive order which you guys will see in Wednesday's what I eat in a day I found some really great new products that thrive these are the Mary's gone crackers these are the real thin no wheat crackers so these are very similar to a wheat thin without the wheat so I'm really excited about these you can actually have nine crackers for five smart points I'll probably only have half of that amount of crackers and I like to dip that and my good culture caught is cheese this is the really full fat double cream classic cottage cheese I believe this is for smart points for half of a cup so I'll usually do half a cup of that for four points and then two points worth of crackers and it's a six mark point yeah way to go Jen or you can do less and less whatever your preference is but I like having this it's a good source of carb and protein mixed together and then I have these two good yogurts I like these I really prefer the ciggies full fat but like I've mentioned they're really really hard for me to find in my area so these two goods are only two points and they have good ingredients and then I like to top it with my progra NOLA from Julian bakery this is the espresso cluster there's tons in tons of different flavors you guys if you're looking for a clean granola Julian bakery progra NOLA is as clean as it gets and the smart points are amazing you can have an entire half of a cup for two smart points which means you can have a quarter cut for one point of clean granola I literally put like a tablespoon on my yogurt so I don't even count it where you would have to count normal granola so I love this granola it's really good here are your stats on the granola so there's tons of fiber there's even protein so you get that little extra bit of protein boost and again ingredients are stellar absolutely stellar ingredients so I love this vanilla I do have 10% off I'll put that code here on the screen for you guys and there's a link down in the description box but this is only two points because I literally do not add more than a tablespoon and that is zero smart points I love the espresso cluster but they have tons of great flavors just check them out over on their website and lastly is belt bar you guys know I like to have these as an option as well because they keep me full and I get that little boost of protein so this one is one of my favorites this is the coconut almond it's a legit almond joy it's so good and here's your nutritional information this is only three smart points and you're getting 18 grams of protein for those three smart points you can't beat it also I love their nut based bars and this is the peanut butter you'll notice that the protein is much more as well as the fiber and the fat so I find that the nut bars even though there are four points instead of three keep me much more full and satisfied for longer and I think it's that extra boost of protein fat and fiber so I love the bill bars there are three to four points depending on the kind of bill bar that you purchase but I also have a code for 10% off and free shipping of built bar and if you're new to Belle bar and you've never ordered before or if you have a

man deliver hay and he throws it down onto the truck and it's like everywhere literally yeah when i get undressed later i'll be able to fill a hayner out of my underwear which would be nice are we all okay let's have a nice weekend i was really really active this weekend um had to be because my cravings are through the roof at the moment um it's monthlies as you've i've told you already earlier on so it's monthlies and oh yeah you just know i'm sure most of you are the same you ladies gents you probably wouldn't know but if you're in tune with your ladies funnily enough you also get cravings with them so it's double trouble then isn't it because it's not one of you to hold back so yeah hi amanda nice to see you back again and those who are watching so um yeah so i've had a few cravings and i kind of had a bit of a weak moment we will have weak moments so i had a couple of things i thought no i will have my cravings because if not if i have a little something morning i know that i'm gonna stay on track but if i have a big something then in my head i've ruined it and that's it days of white power and if you have a wipeout day it then rolls across the whole day then it rolls across into the next day then you can't get back on it and then it's just a downward spiral and summer comes and you think oh damn it why didn't i stick to it so if you saw my little um my little picture earlier on with my weight i've maintained i've maintained my 10 stone which i'm really pleased with one stone 9 weight loss so far i say so far because i really i've never been this way well i say never when i was 16 i was this way and this size but i haven't been down to there since and i'm 44 so you know menopause knocking on my door it's time for me to think about getting my weight to a sensible place before menopause comes because i know that can really affect it and um so yeah that's why i started doing it and and i love it and i've lost one stone nine which is great and i want you to do that as well i want you to get your goal if you want to lose weight if you want to gain weight i can show you a healthy way to gain weight too and but i really just want to see that number nine at the front of the scales even if it's like if my scales did quarters i'd be like nine stone three quarters of of a pound you know 13 and three quarters sorry i'd be happy with that but um yeah to see that nine so next week i'm on it i'm on it so i've had i'll explain to you i had i still have the mcdonald's so i've written it down because i've worked out i remember all the calories but mcdonald's you could have a big mac if you wanted to go to mcdonald's and that would be 563 calories for that big mac you could have a sweet chili wrap and you might i used to think this think well that's quite healthy surely it's a wrap they're 474 calories so for an evening meal i suppose as a treat that's okay um and i had a salad the crispy chicken salad with no bacon and a balsamic dressing and that was 262 for the crispy salad there's a big bit of chicken a big bit of crispy coated chicken and a balsamic dressing on top 262 for the salad and it's a big box of salad and then 23 calories extra for the balsamic dressing which is lovely and without the balsamic dressing it's not very nice so and also what i did the other week was we went just me and benjamin morale and he ordered a mcdonald's for lunch i was like okay maybe i can pick up a snack there so i had um i didn't look at the calories of that before i came on but i had a bag of grapes and apples which doesn't seem to be a full apple so i count that as one lot of fruit and i ordered a side salad which was 15 calories and it's a box about this big full of salad and again i had i said oh have the balsamic dressing to put on there so that was 23 calories so that was great it's a little snack it was filling and i felt like i'd had something because you eat with a knife and fork it's proper eating it's slower eating am i talking too fast i know i talk really fast someone told me that the other day they said i watched your video back twice because you talked so quickly i had to watch it again sorry and um yeah so that was my little snack and he had his happy meal cheeseburger thing with his toy and his fruit shoot and i bought the water with it as well so i was okay with that it's okay because i know that what i'm doing is safeguarding my weight loss and helping myself i'm not going to undo it all and then feel dreadful and then come off the wagon and that wagon it won't roll without me on it so unless i get back on it it's not going to get going again so get back on that wagon was my decision so then this week i will explain to you what i've had i've had a little bit red wine i've had two small glasses of red wine they were 125 calories so it wasn't too bad it was a little treat for me with my evening meal i had a couple of dishes that really went well with a red wine and it was lovely my goodness did it go to my head though on a real cheap date when we finally get out and the chocolate it's just my snacks and i think i've shown you before but i'll show you again this over here is my snack cupboard here we go it's turning around there we go so in here is my snack cupboard so we've got um chocolate wise i've got skinny bars which are 75 calories they're skinny crunch i've got i've got my naked bars obviously not chocolate but again they're under 100 calories i've got um chocolate whips they're 99 calories i've got um chocolate fudge i think they're 80 so although 64 calories even better and then what you do get stuck with if you're not careful is not reading packaging correctly and this is what happened to me when i first started skinny bars from the skinny food company it says clearly there look 99 calories there's two bars in there and they are 99 calories each so get your partner to share one with you luckily paul likes them so he has them with me they are absolutely delicious but be careful because they are 99 calories per bar not per pack right okay so that's my chocolate so i've been able to have chocolate red wine big mac and i've maintained on my what i would call my star week my period week and um that's great i'm really pleased with that um and the only thing that that really helped as well i suppose yesterday was i burnt off more than i put in the calorie deficit it's really simple science if you put in more then you burn off you'll put on weight if you put in less than you burn off your body will take it from you from you from your body from your fat stores use that as the calories you need and you will lose weight you can do it any way you want to my way is the juice plus way because it's the way that works for me i've tried all different ways i've tried starving myself and being miserable weak lethargic and just generally looking horrid i've tried all sorts of ways i've tried calorie counting i've tried point counting i don't like it all i like to know it's simple and done for me all i've got to think about is my snacks and my evening meal so i will just quickly say for anybody who's following a different plan weight loss plan um you can all be benefited by using boosters and these are the juice plus boosters they form a natural plant-based gel in your tummy they burn 25 extra calories by gripping hold of it and taking it away so you don't digest it and they are for good for gut bacteria so anybody can order these from me you don't just have to be doing juice plus you can just try these against your own calorie controlled diet especially if you're on a budget these work out really cheap you get 90 of these for 76 pounds or you can split that down and pay for them over four months at twenty pound fifty so they're a good little tool um and also if you're doing juice plus for the first ten days we do a tread ten shred ten is amazing it gives your body that boost that you need it gives your mind that boost you need because it shows you a definite weight loss on the plan you'd have one of these before breakfast one before lunch and one before your evening meal about 30 minutes before to allow it to make that little plant-blaze gel in your tummy fill you up for longer and doing it for 10 days on plan with your breakfast your lunch your two snacks and your evening meal and fruit if you want it you will lose weight and you'll lose weight quick but it's not a quick fix plan after that obviously you need to have learnt those healthy healthy plans and learn those ways of making sure that you keep the weight loss off but they work really really well and um yeah i'm sold now i'm sold on these so um this morning for breakfast i had a chocolate shake i had a really thick chocolate shake i made it in my amazing um usb portable blender these are brilliant the top's not been washed up yet it's been rinsed out but it screws on there like that these have got a little blender in there i say they're rechargeable so if you work and you can't like some of the girls have said oh can i make up a shake in the morning and take it to work yeah you can it'll be quite thick but what you could do is put your milk in there and have your shake powder in like like we do like with babies with bottles every shake powder and a little tub ready put it in you just whizz it up and then drink i drink it straight out of there it's quite comfortable to drink out of and it makes a shake i put in um half a banana because benjamin had real pancakes smalling the size of a frying pan he loves his pancakes with mini marshmallows and honey all over it and he also had half a banana on there so i use the other half in here i used a chocolate shake powder which is this one here juice plus chocolate shake powder so that is full of good stuff no sugars no extras no whey it's just full of good stuff but um 20 grams of protein in there per scoop put that in there and i put in go through my littlest collection here salted caramel i gave it a good glug of salted caramel from this skinny food company one whisked that up and that was delicious and that's filled me up i've just had my hay delivery i've been humping bells and moving bales and rolling round bales around i've just mucked out so i've been really active this morning and it's kept me going i'm looking forward to my shake lunchtime shake now that i'm gonna make but um that's because that's what it's all about if you don't feel hungry or your tummy doesn't let you know that there's food going in and coming out then your body's not working is it so you shouldn't be feeling absolutely stuffed all the time because that's not that's not correct you should be feeling that you want to eat therefore you'll really enjoy your food and the thing is with these shakes you can have vanilla or chocolate or you can have a mixture of both um because they're full of good stuff that is somehow this crazy science it makes you crave good stuff so it's like your body's like oh yeah i like that that was good give me some more and so automatically you start craving a really healthy diet people call it clean eating and to me that just meant eating things that you'd taken out the ground and cleaned i didn't understand what clean eating was but that's a really good way of making sure you're getting the good stuff into your body but it also helps you to crave that extra good stuff so you're not then craving sweet things because it's they are fairly sweet but without any sugar they're naturally sweet it keeps you going so it's mojito monday i've decided today so i know you all think i'm a bit crazy because i try these things i haven't tried it this is me just doing it straight off look i've been bought my mint i've got myself a lime that's what i need isn't it and i've been on amazon and ordered i thought i was ordering a little tiny tiny bottle of like flavouring but look at the size of this so this is rum flavouring and i've also got so mint lime and rum and i decided to make it because it's going to be made with vanilla shake and soya milk i haven't got any coconut milk so i thought why not put some coconut in it as well but like i say i've not made this already this is like trial and error so i'll get hold of my blender make sure that's not glued in over there and you know my blender is super noisy so i apologize now for my super noisy blender there we go i've got my blender here it's just it's not a posh one it's just um well it's years old now but it's one that you can make smoothies in so it's got the blades in there screw that on turn it upside down makes a horrendous noise and makes a shake so um just quickly as well so it's period week mentioned it already and i always get spots really really bad spots this is a scar here from a really bad spot i had i've got really bad deep deep scars from spots and that's because i'm a squeezer i know it's not very nice but it's one of those things so i haven't had a spot look i can't believe it i can't actually believe that i haven't got a spot because normally it's this great big angry horrible nasty spot it's been quite good recently because i've been able to put my knee for mask but they're usually around here or sometimes you know like slap bang in the middle your forehead somewhere you can't hide them or right on the edge of your nose you know and they stay about four weeks and then another one comes along to join the party and it's like and i think the older i'm getting the worse my spots are getting maybe that's because i am heading in that age group that way towards menopause that skin so what i did was that's why i found juice plus in the first place was i i saw the berries being advertised and i thought well i must try them because they were advertised for skin conditions just like for a glow up for your skin your nails and your hair and as you all know you might have seen my hair is definitely growing and my hair never grows that quickly at all my hairdresser's if i've any hairdressers i've ever had we have a lovely relationship but we only see each other once a year because that's anytime i need it cut in so um with these i'm now typically i'm now due for a haircut and i can't get one can i so the berry blend it's all different bends of berries in there with vitamins e and c helps with your skin your nails i don't have nails and i've finally got nails growing they're growing strong as well it's taken a while because obviously this takes a while for your nails to grow through but they're growing strong and i'm amazed especially with what i do with them and then i added to that the amigas and this is amazing supplement for menopause problems so they are typical of any amiga but they come straight from the plant they're not from a fish so they straight direct from the true source and there's you know we get three omegas there's five omegas in there um i can't i've got the memory to list it all off i should have from the from there shouldn't i but um if you want to know more about the amigas i can ping you over the information about the amigas and the berries and these two together are what we recommend for real strong skin conditions like acne like menopause acne any skin condition that you've got may be helped with these and has been shown to be helped with these loads and loads of transformation that i can show you and stories that i can send you and share with you about how brilliant these are together and they're great for energy great for energy so that's the real good thing because i know a lot of us are like especially today i mean yesterday i was like oh sunshine let's go out we went for a walk yesterday um took benjamin for a walk along the riverbank and normally he will just put along we have to pull him a bit and stop a bit and come on then off we go and you know it stops start stop stop but he got quite a pace on yesterday to the point where actually when we got to the point we have to turn around and walk back he didn't want to come back he was like oh no and i had my watch on my phone and it told me i did 18 000 steps yesterday and just on that riverbank we did nearly 4k oh my goodness which is a good job really because having had those few extras this week i might not have maintained my weight if i hadn't have done that so i was pleased thank you benjamin for helping me out and just so you know whatever whoa whatever capsules we do this is the fruit and berries you may have seen about the fruit and berries heard about the fruits and berries 30 different types of fruits and berries oh sorry try again fruits and veg this is the fruits and veg fruits veg it's 30 different types of fruits and veg all picked at the ripest made into a powder and put into a capsule and these are the capsules here they aren't terribly big they're in a vegan capsule so a vegan friendly capsule so it's all plant-based it's all natural what's in there and what they help to do is bridge the gap between what you do eat and what you should eat and that really helps with me because i don't always have what i should be having every day and i think if you worked out you beat in loads to try and get it all in your system so these help bridge the gap between them and if you were to buy these these and these together this is the triple whammy the super duper pack that's called the premiums so if you're wondering what the premiums are it's the berries and the fruit and veg together but you can buy berries by themselves or fruit and veg by themselves and each one comes on a monthly plan or you can buy them outright at full price and the full price does work out slightly cheaper but you'll always get a full four months worth of capsules for your money so you get it all delivered in one go four months you pay it off or all delivered in one go because you've paid for it already and the same with the amigas you would get um four months worth for your amigas as well okay so then mojito monday right i've got soy milk as i said this is a non-dairy unsweetened soya milk fresh pack this one doesn't have to be a posh one not perfect ours quite posh i buy audi's wherever i go just depends where we've been shopping paul likes tesco so he gets this from tesco's but i quite like audis as well because they do their own which is a bit cheaper so 250 ml of my milk going in there that's the lovely thing about these shakes they're not made with water they're made with milk so um it's all vegan friendly it doesn't mean you have to eat vegan it just means these are vegan friendly but it's more filling because it's milk it's got some substance to it and you can have them just by themselves and they are delicious just by themselves the chocolate and the vanilla they're both natural products natural cocoa natural vanilla delicious by themselves oh sorry but i like to mix it up because i like to make it interesting or difficult as you might realize so i've got my mint here i'm gonna just if i can open the pack i'm just going to um put a few i don't know what i'm doing help me out here a few leaves in here motion detected at the front door i've actually detected the front door every time i'm on a live isn't it every time i'm on a live i'm just going to like do i don't know what i'm doing i'm just gonna do a sort of a flower girl impression and just scatter a few leaves in there at my feet so i'll put those in there so what is your goal then what is your goal is your goal better skin better energy better health better immunity is your goal weight loss is your goal weight gain because if your goal is weight gain using our shakes alongside your health your normal eating we can help you gain weight naturally in a proper way with proteins to help you build muscle as well um if your goal is to be ready for the summer just so you can take a few layers off or to fit back in your summer clothes i know that'd be that's a big one for me i hated the fact that every pair of shorts i put on the button and the buttonhole would not be friends there was no way they were going to be friends especially by the end of lockdown that summer of eating outside and watching the only thing in the sky was the birds flying past wasn't it so yeah it was like an all-you-can-eat buffet so i think i might have put enough mint and i do like mint so i'm just going to put in a couple more leaves while i'm still there chatting whatever your goal is i can work out a plan for you i can give you a free consultation you don't need to speak to me on the phone um you don't need to uh oh someone's orders on their way they're just pinging me to say thank you they're all just on there i'll just text them a minute ago so you're always on your way so they're all excited um yeah you don't need to it's just information and advice you don't need to buy you don't have to buy just because you've asked for advice you can have a time to think about it i won't hassle you uh all i will do is give you what you need what information you need and whoever put that and if you join me you get me for free so there's no join up fee there's no weekly fee you don't have to weigh every week you don't have to report in with me but you do get my support for free so the only thing you're actually paying for is the products that you get i've also got a private facebook page which is really taken off there's over 50 of us on there now and every day people are putting messages of well done and how well they're doing and meal ideas and snack tips and just generally helping each other and that's a really nice community to be in i love it so this is the rum it hasn't got a dropper on it but it says to put in let me check again five or two drops per 100 ml so i thought it said five well good if i looked okay so i've got my calpol syringe because we've all got one of them hopefully is that around the house okay so i'm going to put in well one two three because there's 250 mls in there of milk hopefully that will be coconutty then i'm going to put in some coconut it's rum sorry then i'm going to put in some coconut i just want a little tiny bit of coconut so just a couple of shakes of coconut in there right so far we have this kind of floating mess in there i'm going to quickly get a sharp knife and cut my liner i'm not going to put the lime in i'm just going to squeeze the lime in obviously we can have fruit every day but we do have to make sure we don't have over it over too much so i'm just going to be considerate that i've had half a banana this morning and this would be something towards the other half so i'm just going to squeeze my lime in there beautiful okay so that's lime the good thing is she says i was going to say the good thing is this shouldn't curdle because it's not dairy but it looks like it's curd a little bit that's fine it'll mix up fine i'm sure so i'm going to grab my scoop and i'm going to have three quarters of a scoop in here because i want it to be quite thick um but if i put in a banana or if i put in like you can have peanut butter you can have all sorts of different things in there obviously making sure that you on plan with it um it won't need that you'll only need half a scoop but i'm going to put in three quarters of a scrape today that's only half don't do yourself short jojo there we go three quarters of a scoop so that's going in there that just looks well not like a heat there's clouds of powder going everywhere not like a mojito right you know a monkey let's see what this does it's going to be a bit no whoa when he undid it then oh my goodness let's see what this does shall we [Music] do wowzer look at that how good is that all right let me get myself a nice glass what shall i have it in today oh i don't know i might have it in this one i was going to get my cocktail bits out but i'm a bit late to do that now so i'll get this out like i say my hayman came so it threw me off guard i was like i was expecting him to come later and he came so here we go oh it smells amazing there we go look at that oh yeah wow super cheers so i'm going to get a straw got these amazing straws in half well check for them look at these reusable straws so i'm going to put my straw in there that does taste like a mojito that that is probably i'll make some concoctions you've seen them that's probably the nicest ones i've made that is really good so that's me i think i think i've told you everything i need to tell you if you want any information you want to join me you want my help and my advice and my support more than happy to help you out like i say if you want to buy the um any of the capsules which are here the premiums or the amigas which are absolutely amazing for energy and amazing for health they're the ones that are really really selling out really quickly i've already sold a set of these this morning to a lovely lady so they're on the way to her if you order i do the ordering for you you get an email you just pay and then it's delivered to your door so i don't take money and i don't hold stock it's really quick two to three days but quicker for some people depends on what day you order if you ordered on friday probably wouldn't be delivered um leave the department until monday but if you order today you can have it by wednesday you could be the other weekend you'll be bang on the plan you'll be going for it so um anyway have a lovely monday cheers to my mojito and i'll speak to you all soon", "WDfBBxG5a04": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "0weYi-mtYPk": "[Music] hello so today is what i eat in a day but we are on a low day today so i will show you tips on how to stay full um we're looking at 1150 calories and then 135 grams of protein and of course everything will be plant-based um just to let you know obviously this is my macros this is what's working for me um everyone else will be slightly different with what their low calories would be maybe i'll take more than me or or less so um it does just depend but hopefully this will just give you some sort of vegan meal prep ideas throughout the day 11 o'clock and i'm hungry so i'm gonna make one of my favorites um if you do from instagram you know this is one of my staples some protein pancakes yes so um yeah that'll be breakfast i i'm actually considering eating earlier to be honest i just i just don't get hungry until now but i go to the gym in the morning so i train maybe from seven to like half eight and then i don't eat until eleven so i need to ask my like online trainer if i need to you know get some food with me before like am i now ruining all my gains i don't know but yeah this is honestly the best thing i've ever bought from amazon super cheap probably not even like 10 pounds and it makes the pack fit pancakes can you say i'm excited i'm just like bouncing around okay let's make so we're using the protein works um vegan pancakes this is just in their summer fruits flavor so 80 grams in this bowl and then you want to just mix 150 gram grams millimeters of almond milk just whatever dairy free milk you can use pour that in and just give it a stir once it's stirred i will let you know it does go a bit lumpy but that's fine we haven't had some lumps that's i think what helps it go thick um yeah once that's stirred through just let it sit i guess for like a minute just so it can thicken up and then you can start frying so literally just put two tablespoons in each section um i've set alexa on for a minute and a half once that beeps i will then flip it with a fork because i'm not pro um but it will just give you those perfect round thick pancakes ah honestly this is my favorite breakfast so please try this if you can because it's so good the protein works did a really good job okay so just added 90 grams of frozen berries and two grams of chop chop into spice here fist is served oh it looks like good i can't wait [Music] um i just got back from my second gym session so what i'm doing at the moment because it's so bloody cold um i do my weights in the morning and then i'll go on my lunch break just to get my steps in normally you know i kind of walk outside for an hour but it's just too cold and i'm a bit of a snowflake so um just go on treadmill watching youtube and yeah i enjoy it a lot more so i'm hungry now the time is 20 past two so it's been a while since i've eaten so i have already meal prepped soy mints so literally just pull up soy mince um with some frozen veg really pain and boring but i have to keep it plain um so then it's more filling to be honest with you um but what i'm going to do and this is what i wanted to show you as a snack because this is a non-tracking snack that i can have um again everyone will be different i just don't track my vegetables if they're not anything like like i'll you know i'll do sprouts or chuck sprouts um but let's stuff like broccoli carrots celery watermelon um spinach kale very low calorie i just don't try them so i'm gonna roast carrots and celery so it takes about an hour um and they go really crispy and i love them because it literally tastes like crisps so that's my new favorite snack right now um so yeah i'm gonna let that cook while i eat my sweet mints and then i'll probably be out like hungry after then because it'll be like an hour later let's be real does anyone else snack while they prep okay so i literally just seasoned it with some garlic powder rosemary and chives and yeah let's bake this and you'll see they'll literally shrivel but hopefully they're crispy oh and i just sprayed some fry light on there as [Music] well so this is just 50 grams of soy chunks um seasoned with a stock cube and nutritional yeast i've just added some kale as well and i had it with some mixed veg already prepped just just frozen literally 99p or whatever it is in sainsbury's basics um like i said it just gets dropped on it looks very hot i really don't mind it but you know i guess if i wasn't on a car it wouldn't be like the food i would choose um obviously my vitamins and then i also also always always um drink a green tea after every like meal so every breakfast lunch and dinner i think it just helps with digestion may be crazy but it helps when you're eating a lot of greens you know okay well i'm gonna just eat this and um i'm sure i'll be back really excited with my roasted carrots [Music] yay okay so as you can see they go crispy on the end which is so nice that crunch is what i crave um and yeah and this is just a non-tracking snack for me just helps in between especially you know when i'm working it's now quarter to four and i'm kind of just bored so you know you just want to graze on your board well i'm like that anyway so yeah literally just rosemary garlic and some chives you could add salt and pepper on there as well if you wanted to i highly recommend having a fizzy drink as well just to keep you full it's now five o'clock so i need a little snack just before my dinner so i've just got 200 grams of out brown sugar yogurt and then non tracking watermelon because it's literally calorie less and yeah i sprinkled

this every one of my videos I'm sure you all know who I am by now but anyways hi and today I wanted to show you my different meals of what I eat during the day can i eat healthy for pretty much most in my life but sometimes I like to cheat and make like enchiladas or something so you'll see my three easy meals and a couple of snacks throughout today I'm going to be making yogurt in jars because I'm always on the go I'm in my car right now because I'm literally always on the go especially around like morning so I'll have my my morning breakfast and then my snack and then lunch I usually just have about a salad and then dinner and making enchiladas to show you guys there a healthier version of an enchilada but it is one of my favorite meals ever so I thought I would show you one of my favorite meals and let's get started so I'm excited to tell you guys on the side now before we start this video that my birthday's on Friday but my birthday party was on a lot Friday I had it and this year just totally is like my life right now is cannibal today I'm like finally starting to feel recovered from my birthday but I've left sided so stay tuned for the video if you want to look at my birthday and the decorations and everything like that touch your belt side you're gonna be ejected come on join me I want to be ejected I think there's a seatbelt belt alarm in every one of my videos that I do this with anyways be on my outfit super cash today just wanted to show you guys that and I just went to the grocery store and I'm going to show you guys my food for the day okay so the first thing you're going to need to make mason jar yogurt is strawberries berries any type of fruit you would like any type of yogurt granola I used it from Bob's Red Mill which is super yummy and healthy place to get food and some mason jars you're going to wash your strawberries and fruit whatever you'd like on your drivers and lot berries you're going to clip your strawberries into slices little slices like this and then you're going to layer it however you'd like I'm starting with yogurt on the bottom and it's in LA yogurt then putting my honey granola on top and then adding my blackberries and some strawberries I am topping it off with some yogurt again and then granola and there you go just keep adding it until it's layered I love these marks because they're great on the go so when you're in a hurry like going to work or whatever you can make this on the go and then eat it at work and the flavor is all mixed together and it's super yummy you can add any type of flavor reviews like I'm a very plain I love only vanilla and a blackberry strawberry's type of girl and then I'm just topping it off with some more granola because that's my favorite part and it is more filling and you are good to go yum yum yum stir on your lid and I am actually taking this to work so I am using my cake babe lunchbox that I will link below putting an ice pack in with my yogurt and my banana as my snack for in between breakfast and lunch then I'm off to work and I brought my box water next I am making a salad for lunch simple I'm using a in various strawberries and blackberries and sunflower seeds and some spinach that is already in from the box at five dollars I'm going to take it and put it into a vegetable sized bowl and I'm going to put in my already washed spinach and lettuce add in my fruit as you can see fruit is just so pretty and yummy I feel like I'm getting a treat when I eat fruits and then I'm adding some sunflower seeds into the mix because I love sunflower seeds and now we're going to make the dressing so all you need a sea salt a clove of garlic olive oil apple cider vinegar and a pepper you're going to put 1/4 cup of olive oil into your measuring cup and then you're going to take your apple cider vinegar and put about a capful in you can use balsamic vinegar as well but I really like the taste about the side vinegar and then after you add that into your measuring cup you're going to take your garlic clove and add about 1/4 of the garlic clove I usually shred mine with some little shredder thing and then just add that into your mixer and then I'm going to take a handful of salt because salt is always good to have and then just sprinkle it into your dressing mix and this dressing guys goes so well with everything and it's really healthy as well add in a sprinkle of pepper and then you're going to mix it all together and you are set but it's super easy I usually do the test tape first to make sure it tastes good and there you go Walla you have a free salad I have not mixed a yes I wanted to show you how pretty it was before I mixed it and then I usually make some water I put mint in lime in this water with super yummy and this it's almost my birthday of my birthday Cup next for our snack I have rice cakes peanut butter honey and a banana this is a super easy healthy snack to make you're just going to spread some peanut butter onto cakes I usually have about two rice cakes because pretty filling but I like to have two I don't usually always eat my - and this is another snack you can pack away when you're going out or if you're at work or something I'm going to slice some banana to put on top of the peanut butter you can also use almond butter which is really good as well or you can use Nutella whatever you would like whatever your preference is I am a peanut butter girl so I'm using peanut butter and then I'm going to slice my bananas and put them on top as you can see right here I usually make a pretty design like a flower or something and makes me want to eat my food more when it's pretty Suzanne of what you guys feel the same way sometimes just making your food pretty makes it more appetizing so yeah I'm just adding on all my banana you can even add just peanut butter and jelly whatever you'd like and then I'm going to sprinkle a little bit of honey on top to make it a little sweeter because I have a sweet tooth sometimes so yummy I'm love honey and there you go wallow your snack is done I usually have my box water with me or some type of water and then I'm ready for my snack okay so for dinner I'm showing you guys one of my favorite dinners of all time enchiladas so sorry I forgot to show you the ingredients but I use lean ground meat which is super yummy or you can use turkey meat I use low fat cheese green onions cilantro a olives cut up and all you're going to do is add it into your mixer you're going to use corn tortillas and you're going to take all the meat cheese everything and put it in here tortilla you're going to roll it up and then you're going to start your next one so as you can see I'm doing again so you can use ground lean meat you can use turkey meat whatever you like I usually is turkey me but today we are using link rum B and then I'm just rolling it up again use as many your pan make sure you make sure to put green chili on the bottom or Pam I usually use green chili because it's about the same then you're going to add the green chili on top you can also use red chili but I like green and then I'm you taking my cheese again and sprinkling it all over the top of it then I'm going to add more cheese I like to cover it all up guys this is where I'm saying it's not as healthy but you can add less cheese if you want to make it more healthy but I usually only need about one or two add your green onions and cilantro and then add in your olives again on top I usually use the girls because they're prettier and while you are done you're going to put it in the oven for about 20 minutes I would say until they're like melted and ready to go and look you have a party size meal as well so you can make dinner for your whole family this way which I love I'm going to add it all on the side so I just took regular lettuce some tomatoes feta cheese because I love that a G's even and all that doesn't really go with my theme right now and some snap peas as well and voila you are done I usually you wanted to enchiladas and then salad so it's a good proportionate size just don't eat too much and then it's healthy and you are done with food",

barbara sturm i actually really love this brand i don't usually venture out of brands besides sonia because of my skin but this is like a really really really gentle mask so i think barbara sturm says she literally wears this every day so it's more of just like a morning wake up so i'm gonna sit with this i just finished my walk and kind of just i don't know a face mask like calms my soul like when i just put it on like i don't know why i just feel like i can breathe i'm gonna do a lot of meal prepping today so i thought i would take you guys along with me just because meal prepping is so important in my routine i just feel like i have more of a successful week i feel less stressed about food excuse me i just chugged my breakfast chug my breakfast i don't know if that's a thing i'm also babysitting a dog if you see him in the background and babysitting ballet's dog he'll make an appearance but yeah i feel like meal prepping is just setting yourself up for success it allows you to or for me it allows me to not just eat whatever's in the fridge if i have things that are prepped i really just find it super easy to grab those healthy and nutritious foods when you have like a really busy day i feel like it's so nice to be like i have snacks prepped or i have some meals prepped i'm really gonna focus on the snacks for you guys today and then i'm gonna show like one meal i prep just because snacks are something that's so important to me when i'm like have that break where i want something to eat to be able to grab a healthy snack but also for me i like a little like treat kind of vibe to it have some chocolate in it it's just so satisfying and also i'm just keeping my body fueled helping my muscles with a lot of my snacks have like high protein in them which is so good a lot of times we don't realize that we don't have enough we don't take enough protein in especially if we are working out quite a bit so yeah i'm going to share that with you guys but i went on a walk this morning with a couple girlfriends and i hope this can help anyone that's why i want to share it because it really resonated with me i was just telling my girlfriend that i feel like i to my family to my friends am the one that opens the door to be like vented to and that's just a role that like i've taken on because i do really love to be there for people and like help in any way or just even listen but what i noticed is that i was like holding on to a lot of people in my life's energy and um it was slightly draining me and also i feel really overwhelmed but it doesn't feel like mine if that makes sense and so she was like picture your body and your mind and your soul like a house right now you're renting out spaces for people so you're renting out rooms for people and they're just like living there and i was like oh my gosh i have like so many people that i'm thinking about are just living in me not their fault it's it's definitely mine so she was saying try wearing like a shield or imagine like a bubble around you and when those people do enter into your space that you don't feel like you're gonna hold on or take on their energy because you have almost this like imaginary shield on that is mostly just sealing your energy so you're not feeling drained again that might be like a little interesting to hear but i am gonna practice that into my routine of like putting a bubble over me and then also like she was like imagine if you have a plug in you and then you have a plug in that person and you guys are just like a cord and she's like you need to cut that cord and allow allow yourself to just like protect your energy and like protect yourself that you're not feeling like so so drained so i'm literally gonna visualize and imagine myself like cutting those cords and that doesn't mean i'm cutting them out that just means i'm allowing space for them to come in but not taking it on so i don't know if that's helpful for anyone else but i really needed to hear that today and not like i'm like i got it i know how that's gonna work it's like i'm just gonna start practicing it and visualizing it and see if it works for me so um yeah i love stuff like that so i'm gonna take off this mask kind of freshen up and gonna do some meal prepping with you guys today and let's do it here's mr wilson oh he's just relaxing all right i got a little fancy for you guys but also i have to shoot some photos today for some brands so i'm just feeling refreshed feeling good these jeans are from zara which i've shared before they fit incredible they do stretch out a little bit so if they start out tight i wouldn't be worried because they start to stretch and then this top is actually for zara too i actually got it from miami and then it didn't show up so now i'm just racking it here in la and then i have this little crop tank top that i love from brandy i'm gonna start with doing my meal prep so i am prepped for my week and again it really sets me up for success i feel so good when things are in the fridge especially snacks because i feel like that's the number one go-to to like head to the pantry so these are some of my favorite snacks i'm gonna share with you guys as well as breakfast i feel like when you're on the go that is like the meal we miss out on the most just because we're like i don't have time i have too many things to do and then we don't eat end up eating breakfast so i'm gonna walk you guys through some of my favorites also trying new recipes so that will be if they work i'll share but we'll see but i'm going to start with my protein balls which you guys know are my obsession i've shared them here before but i'm going to share them again just because i truly meal prep them every week they have protein in them they have flax in them they have nut butter so healthy fats in them i need a lot of fiber right now i mentioned in my last video with my hormones it's really good for me to bind my hormones with a lot of awesome fiber so i'm having some gluten-free oats i mean we're just gonna have some tastiness plus the chocolate is just like game over so i'm gonna make these first and then i'll show you guys what's next first i'm going to add one cup of blended gluten-free oats i added one scoop of vanilla protein make sure you like your protein powder then i did a fourth cup of flaxseed and a fourth cup of coconut shreds i added a half a cup of peanut butter i realized i could not get it out so i needed to grab a spoon then i added a third cup of honey next we're going to mix it really well option to use your hands or you can use a spoon of any sort but i find it easiest when i just mix it with my hands but yes it will get messy next we're gonna add some dark chocolate chips i try and get eighty percent cacao i love adding the chocolate for an extra sweet taste i usually use a soft spoon first to really stir it and then use my hands but i couldn't find the spoon so it got very messy quick once your dough is ready to go then you're going to put it saran wrap over and leave in the fridge for 20 minutes to let it harden just a little bit after 20 minutes i came back and the dough is ready you're just going to roll up pieces into balls really you can make them the size that feels best for you but they make about 12 to 15 balls [Music] okay so protein balls are done these are seriously so easy you guys i share them all the time because again super easy but you're getting so many nutritious things in here so i'm gonna take a bite so good i'm gonna put them in the fridge let them sit next up i'm gonna do a chia seed pudding this is so good for a quick breakfast especially eating before a workout if you do like to eat something i find it really light refreshing and also it has chia seeds in it which is incredible again i have to eat a lot of these right now for some good fiber i'm going to mix it with some almond milk coconut cream and vanilla extract and maple syrup and then the next day so you leave it overnight i'll just add my berries and i just love it i do think you have to like coconut if you're going to use the cream that i'm going to show you but if you do not option is to just use the milk and you can meal prep like four to five jars and stay them in your fridge for the whole week i am going to meal prep a couple jars i put two tablespoons of chia seeds in each jar also i've just collected these different jars over time or you can get them on amazon then i'm going to add a little less than half a cup of almond milk i like mine to be a thicker consistency so i'll do a little less milk option two is to add a scoop of coconut cream if you really wanted a thicker consistency next i'm going to add a drizzle of maple syrup and not shown was the vanilla extract i also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract then you're going to cap your jars and we're going to give it a really good shake you could also add a spoon in there and really stir it you'll leave them overnight in the fridge and they'll be ready to go in the morning i was going to share this recipe but it is new my girl emmy just helped me make it it's the baked oats which i feel like has been all over like tik tok and everywhere and i've actually been wanting to try it so we made it just to make sure it was tasty before i talk about it it is really good it kind of tastes like i feel like it just tastes like oatmeal but you're not having to like sit at the stove and like stir you kind of just stick it in the oven and then it's ready and then it's a little bit more of like a cake consistency i would say so it was yeah i feel it does feel richer so we really liked it but the only thing with this ingredients i would say is we needed to add more like cinnamon or something to make it a little sweet because i think that is the thing with oats they can be super super bland obviously they don't have a lot of flavor so you have to kind of have really good add-ins so i'm gonna keep playing with this recipe but i do think this is a really good option if you were like again in a hurry but wanted to plop and plop i wanted to plop in the oats you can just stick them in the oven and leave them in for 15 minutes so that when you come back downstairs from getting ready your food's ready rather than sitting there i think that is like the biggest discouragement that people don't like want to just sit at the stove because you just feel like you're wasting time if you don't have it so i think finding recipes like this is super super easy so i'm gonna master it and then i'll share another recipe with you guys okay next on my list for meal prepping this one's actually newer to me but i've seen people do this so i'm gonna try it i make a smoothie every single day like truly no doubt after a workout i just love having a smoothie i feel like it's easy again you're getting that protein in especially after a workout so you can feel those muscles and build and tone so instead i'm look at my hand instead i'm gonna meal prep this smoothie in one of these like recyclable bags which are incredible i honestly really love these i'll list the brand below but i'm going to try meal prepping this movie obviously i'm not going to add the milk or the water and then i'm also not going to add the nut butter that i'll add on the day of but at least i can prep like the fruit the banana everything and stick it in the freezer and then these would just be ready to go and i can just plop it in the smoothie and be done so i'm gonna meal prep a smoothie bag [Music] i'm gonna add some banana which i think is so nice because it'll be frozen adding a cup of frozen blueberries and a cup of spinach this is super nice because you can just leave it in the freezer and then in the morning when you're ready to go you can add it all into the smoothie bowl and add the protein and any nut butters plus milk okay so other things that before i show you guys a like lunch dinner meal prep other things that i already have meal prepped in my fridge is boiled eggs if you guys know me i feel like i am such an egg lover i feel like jc is always like you're so gross i could eat eggs like for dinner as a snack so i just meal prep these it's so flippin easy and again you just grab it you could put it on your toast for breakfast you could have it as a snack just put some everything bagel seasoning or salt and pepper so these are already boiled i just put them in the fridge and they're ready to go then as always i just keep hummus and vegetables this is another easy easy easy snack that you could pack in a to-go but also just having in your fridge as an essential you could obviously pick whatever vegetable you wanted to dip in but i find it really great i think hummus i always try and look for some of the cleaner ones because there can be a lot of different ingredients in there but i haven't tried this brand so we'll see ifaka is that bad you guys don't judge me okay so another thing i always always meal prep but you could also buy it just like frozen is rice i think it's so easy to throw into a bowl anytime you're making a bowl some carbs in there i always love rice jt loves it too so i always just make a huge thing of some white jasmine rice but again you can just buy it frozen at trader joe's or wherever you shop from they usually have frozen rice but it's super easy and helpful that it's already ready to go so i am going to make the sausage dish that i've shared before it is so so easy you guys if you have an oven if you didn't even have enough what's another thing you could use besides an oven um if you guys have an oven this would be perfect all you're going to do is grab one sheet and then you're going to put a protein you're going to put a vegetable and then you're going to put a carb you guys can pick i'm going to show you guys some of my favorites but really the options are endless i am going to use sausage but i might sprinkle in some chickpeas too because that's another one of my favorite when you put them in the oven and then i think i'll do broccoli and potatoes let me see what i have though hold up so let's see we have sausage check um oh okay i'm also gonna sprinkle in these peppers like having vegetables just all can cook at once in the oven is so great so i have two peppers here so i'll probably use those plus the broccoli and then i'll do my yellow potatoes over here let's do it so i'm gonna do a orange pepper and a red pepper the best part is all of these are going to be in the oven at the same time so you do not need to remove certain items they all can go on one sheet for my carb i picked these yellow gold potatoes i think they're really delicious you could also do sweet potato or any potato that you would like just make sure you chop them up into small enough pieces so that they can cook on time with all the other items for my protein i chose these chicken sausages again you could choose chickpeas anything that really suits you also could add chicken in there but i find these really easy to just plop onto the same pan for seasoning i like to add some olive oil himalayan salt pepper italian seasoning and some garlic powder this was kind of a small bowl so i will probably be re-seasoning more when i put it onto the pan i turn my temperature on my oven to about 375 380 fahrenheit and i pop it all in and leave it in for 25 minutes again this makes it super easy where i do not have to be sitting at the stove or paying attention to what i'm cooking i just set a timer for 25 minutes and i'm back and it's ready to go well this is another moment where i'm watching the video back and my microphone is not working so i thought i would just tell you guys a new outro while this is playing and my mouth is moving but you guys have no idea what i'm saying but i was just saying that i hope you guys enjoyed this video and that this meal prepping video helped if it did please um share below and also share what video you guys want to see next and make sure you like and subscribe and i'll see you guys next time", "qmB4we7VRLs": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] oh", "vUNEA4chwr0": "[Music] hey everyone so it's kind of cold out and there's not much to do in garden at the moment so I thought I'd switch it up a little bit and discuss more they on a shoestring element of these videos I don't think I've ever discussed the impetus of this budget life so here's the quick rundown almost two years ago we created a goal of paying off our house in four years while also saving for retirement which we have some catching up to do like a lot of us since then we've greatly scaled back our spending there's a node dining out very little travel only like nearby field trips or visiting family occasionally and only buying necessities every spending category has a set limit including food our weekly food budget for two people is $65 a week that's for breakfast lunch dinner and snacks the parameters are well we're omnivores with no dietary restrictions though I do try to make meals as healthy as I can while attempting to please both of our palates which can be a little bit of a struggle but more on that later big challenge to scale back that kind of spending I think I before I'd regularly spend 100 bucks a week or so at the grocery store and just buy whatever caught my eye now there's a lot of planning involved a lot of spreadsheets we've I think since then we found our groove and I'm gonna show you how it goes your mileage may vary for stuff we do things a little differently than most a lot of these grocery savings videos are aimed at big families with kids and those strategies just don't work for singles couples or small families like ours so for instance buying in bulk does not suit our life we live in a small to average size home and don't have big basement or a freezer available for us to put an extra food in our pantry is literally one cabinet and we have a normal sized freezer so we buy what we're gonna eat that week pretty much and not a whole lot extra also I don't coupon first of all I do not have the time or the patience to deal with all that but primarily it's because typically the coupons in the paper are just for food we don't eat it's mostly a lot of prepared and convenience foods and I like to cook from scratch because I know exactly what's going into our food and I think generally across the board it's it's cheaper however I do recognize that since I work from home and I don't have a commute to deal with or a second job or anything like that I'm lucky in that I have time to fully prepare a meal from scratch and I also have pretty decent cooking skills so if you work from low you know long hours if you have a long commute if you have a second job or if you just don't really know how to cook you know do what you got to do get those convenience foods and definitely use those coupons sometimes the stores do send us coupons for foods that we already buy these very sort of targeted coupons and I will definitely use those so I'm not gonna say no to a discount all begins on Monday with the sales circulars fries Nona Kroger and I another name in much of the country is our this ones are go to the Safeway Albertsons is number two sometimes give some killer deals and then I like to hit up sprouts for bulk items and other natural foods occasionally I check out is Fry's slash burger and I'm mostly looking for big-ticket items which are gonna be 13 and our one luxury allow ourselves soda though now we've scaled it down to I think we're allowed one kanaday and I've put mine even further back - so - only on weekends so you know our lives would be healthier we'd save money if we didn't drink it at all but that's our treat so proteins tbonz 27 on sale even that's still high and it's a value pack which doesn't usually work with a small household touches ours may have to end up freezing some for next week but it still comes out of this week's budget which is no good but at this ground beef deal is pretty good we use ground beef in a lot of different things and reminder pound is great and also this chicken deal see it's not a value pack either so you need a small look at that justice is pretty much garbage it's alcohol and some food processed uh that we don't need for comparison Safeway usually has a killer deal or a here they even run on one right now this week it's just cream cheese 25 cents and pass that's like a luxury item it's not something I need a really great one week before last it was 5 pounds of potatoes loaf of bread or half gallon of milk for 25 cents now that's a deal this is garbage eggs donut lookee here also chicken that's high but it is the value packs or whole chickens I can make a lot of stuff with the whole chicken it's 97 cents a pound that's probably gonna be like a three dollar chicken so I'm probably gonna hit up Safeway to this chicken deal they also have t-bone 20 cents a pound cheaper also value pack days that's gonna be a pass prices on cheese coffee woman ice cream - might have a splurge on that some good deals on berries to make my own breakfast because I prefer something sort of whole grain and fruity and I'll make a big batch and I'll you know all week whereas my partner's more of a bacon and toast type of person quick look at sprouts and they have the same deal on chicken and as fries but I like the quality a little better but I'm still gonna go to Safeway because it's 97 cents a pound for veg always great good as fast that because of the peas they got the mandarins for Bucky and check this out 3/4 dollar avocados and to $4 mangos so I really have to think about what I'm gonna have for my breakfast this week - amazing except 25 cents off old spices is a great place to go for spices except I of course and just went and got peppercorns and garlic powder but I have the same bottles I reused once my store-bought jars are empty coach sprouts and refill them for a steal of a deal next up I open up my shopping list and I use Evernote and I use the same format every week at the very top I have a section for deals and then I have the menu and underneath that is going to be the shopping list and the shopping list is based on the menu I take what I think are the best deals and I just pop them up there in the top and they are separated by store so I know who has what and the prices are listed right next to each item the ones in purple are the ones where you have to buy five to save five dollars so I have to get five of those listed there minimum in order to save five dollars so that's a dollar off each item which is pretty significant now knowing what's on sale I jump over to Pinterest which is how the two of us share menu ideas for the week we're both editors and so we can contribute to this you can use whatever application website you can just talk about it if you want to talk about what you want to eat we'll look and see if there's anything we've saved already or we'll just sort of search around and see if there's anything that fits the bill what usually happens is I send my girlfriend a bunch of ideas and she goes I hate them all and then she sends me a bunch of recipe ideas that are irrelevant and somehow and all that mess we come up with a menu it's amazing but it works so meal planning is basically just a combination of what's on sale what can we agree on and stuff we already have and we try to get the sort of middle of intersection of all of those things in order to come up with a menu that we can live with for the week and after much discussion this is what we come up with because chicken thighs are on sale super cheap we could use it for the oven fried chicken and the foie we also have phos stock in the cabinet we'll have powered format so that works out also ground beef is on sale so it'll work for the tacos and the Korean beef and whole chicken is also on sale 97 cents a pound so Amy's gonna put that in the smoker and then we're gonna use the leftover so getting two meals from wine to make us some little sliders and you'll notice these things in brackets my love has an A version to that Devils which I love so I figured the best solution is just to start with something basic and then I'll just add on to vegetables separately for me and these are usually things that are in the garden so the garden really functions is my personal veggie supply and that works out fine for the both of us once we finally agree on what we're gonna eat that week we have it all set in the dinners part and I've deleted the deals section from the top and put any of the winners down into the shopping list part and I have it split up by a store and the ones in purple are the buy five save five dollar deals so I have to get at least five of these the ones in bold are the ones I am going to try and get but sometimes things sell out so I've got a couple backups in there as well and I have it by store and then the rest are for fries and they are roughly ordered by row by aisle so they start and produce and then bakery and then the rest the household stuff is always there in case there's a little extra room in the budget to pick up one of those items the red ones being the more critical items after the grocery list is set comes budgeting the next document I open up is this Google spreadsheet and I have it a running log going this is actually the New Year's I have another one from last year and I use the same format every week and I'll put our this is what was in our grocery list and the store and then the fun part of going to every store site and trying to figure out how much stuff costs it's never accurate but it is a rough guide and it's a good place to compare to like I was going to get slider rolls at Fry's but it's a flea actually has a pretty smokin D right here for these potato rolls so I'm gonna sub that in and for two bucks and then I fill out our little spreadsheet and we get an estimate we're aiming for under $65 so right now we're almost $10 under budget but there's always a some room for error there because especially when it comes to the meats they kind of guess on the grocery store site about how much these are gonna cost sometimes it ends up being a lot more and also I'm not sure that Safeway sells bean sprouts but I'm gonna look they weren't on the website so I'm just guessing how much they are after I finished visiting sprouts and Safeway I'll put the actual numbers so use it the estimated I'll put the actual numbers here and try and figure out how much I have left before I go to fries and do any sort of rejiggering I need to do at that my athleisure retire on my produce bags to say the earth and I've got my coffee so I don't go to Starbucks and then let's do this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we do with that extra five bucks well they could sit in our checking account in case we have something come up a little emergency I don't know what five dollar emergency would be but you never know or we could apply it or some of those household items that we need but more than likely there'll probably a day when we don't want to eat off the menu and I'm just gonna get out of house so we get something like two chicken sandwiches and fries for $4.99 that happens sometimes it's not all budgeting another thing we do is I pay for the groceries but using my credit card and it is a rewards card so I get cash back on all purchases so for this week it's only gonna be like a dollar it's like a free dollar and they add up every week so I just use the cash back to pay down my credit card corollary to that is as soon as I get home from the store I pay back my credit card with our checking account so I don't carry a balance now stay it was great that I was under but what often happens is that I'm over somehow and in that case the amount over our sixty five dollar budget stays on my card where I have an allowance every pay period of how much I can spend for gas pet food just things I might like so that goes into that budget so it's very motivating for me to stay on budget so if I put every week's groceries on my card $65 pop and my allowance it works out to about $500 a month that I put on my credit card which I pay off as as the checks come in that works out to about seven dollars and fifty cents and rewards cash so that's free money every month I have a coupon nine nine nine eight five that's it", "Gdpc8qLmKrY": "(upbeat music) - When I look at and you look at me. (mobile crinkles) Good morning, HealthNuts. Welcome back to the blog. If I sound a little nasally, it's cause I have caught Sage's cold. She had her first cold the other day. She's, like, just getting over it. It broke my heart. It was the saddest thing ever. We made sure, like, it\nwasn't a fever or anything. And honestly, I think it\nwas related with, like, she's definitely in the teething\nstage, like drooling a lot. And after I talked to a few\nmoms, I heard that, like, it can kind of be related. Anyways, she's feeling\nbetter today (sniffs) and now I have a stuffy nose. Yeah, pretty sure it's just a head cold, 'cause I've just feel,\nlike, a little bit of, like, tension in my head, and it's in my nose and sinuses and stuff. And the crazy thing is I\nwas actually sick this time, like almost exactly last year. 'Cause I remember March\n2nd is when I found out I was pregnant with Sage, and then it was like a\nweek after I got sick, because it almost helped\nme hide being pregnant, because I, like, also\nwas feeling nauseous, so I just blamed it on having a cold. And now here I am, a year later, like, almost to the dot I'm sick again. So I'm hoping I can just\nget over this pretty soon. If you hear Sage crying, she's with dad. She's just trying to go\ndown for her morning nap, which by the way, we just started working with this baby sleep\nconsultant, and oh my God. Last night I actually had\na little bit more sleep, and it was the best thing. I'm probably gonna do a whole\nvideo on babies and sleep and what our journey and\nexperience has been like, 'cause it's such a, it's a hot\ntopic when you're a parent. Yeah, so anyways, last night was actually a pretty good night, but I did wake up in the\nmiddle of the night with, like, a little bit of a runny nose. So I'm just gonna take care of myself. And I thought, I was planning on doing a what I eat in a day video today, like a real-life, like, vloggy-style one. And I was like, oh maybe I won't do one. And I'm like, you know what? I'm just gonna do one, and it'll just be, like,\nwhat I do when I'm sick. Because I think that is just, like, a lot of people are probably dealing with colds and flues right now. We're still in the winter time, and it's never a bad idea to help boost and support your immune system. So, I'm going to just share a little bit of what I'm doing today and eating, but also just having a chill day. My stomach is grumbling. Matt made me a little ginger\ntea with, like, fresh ginger, so I'll probably make another one today and show you guys what's in it. I'm thinking of making, like, a green juice this morning, too, but I might need to eat something first, 'cause, like, my stomach\nis growling right now. So let's go eat something, and then I might take a nice hot shower just to, like, (sniffs)\nclear my sinuses, you know? Sagey is crying. Go Matt, you can do this. Hopefully she has a good nap. She definitely needs it. In my diffuser I have some Thieves, which is really good for\nsupporting your immune system. I also have a little bit of\npeppermint and some lemon, and it smells really great. It's gonna help me breathe\na little bit better today. Yep, oh, Matt's having pancakes. - Frozen pancakes, homemade. I'm just gonna warm 'em up. I'm gonna warm 'em up on the stove. - [Nikole] No, the toaster. - No, I like the stove. - [Nikole] Oh, okay. - [Matt] Do you want some? - Yeah, actually, I\nwill have some pancakes. I'm gonna make some green juice. Yeah, so I made those the other weekend, 'cause I just like to\ndouble batch the pancakes and then freeze them, so I\nguess I'll have some of that. First I'm gonna show\nyou guys a little, like, warm tonic that you can make\nwhen you're not feeling well. It's just, like, feels really good. Ginger, lemon. (upbeat music) (knife clicks) (packet tears) (slurps) (sighs) So to go on top of our pancakes, I'm actually gonna just wash\nsome of these strawberries. Strawberries are high in\nantioxidants and vitamin C, and I'm just gonna try to eat\nlots of fresh fruit today. So to wash them, I'm actually gonna use my Thieves Fruit and Veggie Soak. And I like to just give my\nberries a good rinse and soak just to get off any stuff on the surface, 'cause you eat the skin. (upbeat music) (water rushes) So I'm gonna have my lemon ginger water with some pancakes for breakfast, and then probably later\nI'll make a green juice. By the way, these pancakes\nare in my cookbook under the breakfast section. Honestly, my favorite\npancakes I've ever created. Everyday gluten-free\nfluffy pancakes, page 49. I'll have my cookbook linked down below. There's lots of yummy, immune\nboosting recipes in it, like salads and mains and lots of smoothies and juices. So when I'm sick, I like to make sure I'm taking some probiotics. I also always take vitamin D. I do about four drops of this one. And then this is like a holy grail, the propolis Throat Relief\nfrom Beekeeper's Naturals. I always take this as soon as I feel like I'm catching something, and I swear it just,\nlike, works every time. And then I also ordered\na bunch of stuff online. So I got some medicine for\nSagey and Matt and I to have. I really like--\n(baby cries) Oh, okay. Okay, Sagey, okay. So I really like this brand for babies. I got their teething one. I also got their cold one, which is what she's been using right now to help support her while\nshe's healing from her cold. And it's basically, like,\nhomeopathic medicine, so I just feel safe giving this\nto her when she's so little. And then by the same brand,\nI got some for Matt and I. This is their cold one\nfor nasal congestion, so I'm gonna probably take this one today. And then I also got this one, which is for flu-like symptoms. So body aches, headache, fever and chills, just to have on hand. I always like to just have, like, a backstock in our medicine\ncabinet for when we are sick 'cause there's nothing worse than, like, getting sick and then not having anything. I really like this vitamin C. I've listened to a whole podcast about it. It's really high, and it's, like, this liquid formula. I'll link that down below. I'm gonna also link the podcast, actually, that I listened about vitamin C. It was really insightful. And then I also got this\nElderberry Force by New Chapter. My friend Joy from Joyous Health, if you guys know her, she's\na holistic nutritionist and she recommended this one. She said that they source\ntheir elderberry from Austria, which is really high quality. And I have heard about\nelderberry for years now, and I've gotten, like,\nlozengers before with it, but I'm gonna actually take\nsome of this today too. And this is just really great to have if you are feeling like\nsomething is brewing. I just like to be proactive instead of reactive when\nit comes to feeling sick, so I'm just gonna take all the immune boosting\nthings today to feel better. I'm gonna link all of\nthese things down below for you guys to check them out. Whether you have little\nones that you're looking for just more natural\nproducts to give them. I'm not a doctor, so always check with\nyour health professional, but these are just things that\nI picked up to have on hand. And in case you're wondering, this is the probiotic I give to Sage. It's just a powder form. And then since I'm breastfeeding, it's important to make\nsure you are giving them a liquid vitamin D, so\nthis is the one I do. I do about one or two\ndrops every single day, and that way it just helps make sure that she's getting her vitamin D intake. I'm just gonna add a\nfew drops of eucalyptus to my shower to really\nadd that spa experience and just help clear out my sinuses. So I am showered, refreshed, wearing the comfy clothes. It's actually disgusting how\noften I wear this sweater. I have two. Everyone always asks\nme where they're from, so gonna link them down\nbelow for you guys. Sagey. So we're gonna do a little play time. Matt had to go run and do an errand. I'm just stocking up on the liquids. And I feel like my lips always\nget really dry when I'm sick, so I got my Lip Butter\nfrom BeautyNut Skincare. By the way, if you guys\nwant to get 20% off of this, we have a subscribe and save option, and it gets you 20% off today,\nas well as going forward. And you can set your\nfrequency on how often you want to get shipped out new products. I have five products right now in my BeautyNut Skincare line. We are testing and formulating new ones, launching later this year, so be sure to check them out down below. It's honestly, like, the\nbest lip butter ever. I'm very passionate about lip butters, and this one's so moisturizing. And it's good, 'cause\neven when you're sick, it's like a big chubby\none, so you can just, like, put it all over, under\nyour nose if you're, like, dry from blowing your nose, right Sagey? And it's safe to kiss Sagey with. Also, I don't know if I've\naddressed, I cut my hair. (laughs) I love that I say that, like,\nhalfway through a video. I feel like I filmed Wednesday's\nvideo with short hair, too. I got a good chop, although\nI'm definitely getting, like, so much postpartum hair loss, like, right around there. My mom says that's because it's, like, where your hair is the weakest. Let's see this one. Yeah, definitely some hair loss there. Babies are fun. (laughs) (sighs) It's worth it, but, like,\ndefinitely is just sad when you're taking a\nshower and there's, like, clumps of hair falling out. So, but we're gonna get a book. We're gonna do some reading time. I'm trying to get her a little\nsleepy for her next nap, and also just, like, something chill, too, 'cause, like, I just wanna\nrelax, but mom life, you know? There's no break time when\nthe little ones are up. So I'm gonna entertain her,\nplay some music, sing to her. She likes when I sing. But yeah, it's funny how just, like, taking a shower and putting, like, I put just a little bit of makeup on, it makes you feel so much better. Like, I don't even feel sick. No, I do, but maybe I don't look sick. I feel it. So hopefully, (inhales) hopefully it's like a one, a\n24-hour cold kind of situation. I honestly feel like when I'm sick it doesn't last too\nlong, so fingers crossed. I'm just gonna drink all the water. By the way, I'll link this\nwater bottle down below, too. I love it. The wonderful things you will be. (gasps) Look at all the babies. This one was from (indistinct). When I look at you and you look at me, I wonder what beautiful\nthings you will be. (mobile crinkles) Whoa. All right, so I'm gonna make\na little pre-lunch appetizer. We're gonna make some green juice. To be honest, I get asked\na lot whether I'm, like, team green juice, team smoothie. I would say, I mean, it's quite obvious I'm team green smoothie, but I do think there's a time and place for a nice hydrating,\nnourishing, green juice or juice in general. But to be honest, like, I usually try to make my\njuices pretty much green 'cause I feel like when\nyou're taking the fiber out of your juice, you want to be careful with how much fruit that you're adding because it's taken out that fiber that's gonna help kind of\nbalance the sugars in it. So, when it comes to green juice, I love to drink it, A,\nwhen I'm not feeling well, just to give my, like,\nbody a boost of vitamins and nutrients without having to, like, break it down a fully. And the other thing, I love to drink it during the summertime. Like, hot weather, it's so, so hydrating and it just feels really good drinking it. So it's been a while since\nI've made a green juice. I drank green juices while I was pregnant, but I never made any because\nit just seemed too much work when I'm pregnant. But what's nice is, like, you\ncan make a big batch of it. And what I like to use is, like, a juicer that does more of a crushing way of getting the juice out\ninstead of heating it up with a metal blade. So I really like this one. So I got my juicer, I'm actually gonna link\nthis one down below. A friend of ours actually sent this to us about a year and a half ago. It's such a good juicer, and\nyeah, it's really compact, too. It's nice and tall and skinny,\nso it just fits underneath, like, the cupboards, so it\ndoesn't take up too much space. So I'm going to juice all\nof this delicious produce. I'll show you guys what I have. I feel like I have a kale wand. Okay, let's do some juicing. So this is what I'm\ngonna be juicing today. I have some crunchy\ncelery here and cucumber, which both are so hydrating. I have a lemon I've already peeled, a nice knob of ginger. It's organic, so I'm\njust leaving the peel on. One apple. I just want to add a\nlittle bit of sweetness, but I try not to overload it with fruit. And then I have a few leaves of kale just to add in some green. So I'm gonna juice all this up, and then we're gonna have\nit for a pre-lunch snack. (upbeat music) (juicer buzzes) (gasps) (laughs) Oh my God. Give it a little stir. (straws clink) Oh yeah, a lot of ginger. Cheers. - [Matt] I was just thinking. - [Nikole] Here you go, sir. - Thank you. - [Nikole] Is that too much juice for you, or are you gonna drink it? - I'll try it. - [Nikole] It's very gingery. (laughs) There is an apple in there. (Matt groans)\n(Nikole laughs) - It burns, it burns. - Burns the germs away. (moans) So green. All right, I'm still\nfinishing my green juice, but Mr. Matt is starving, as he said, so I'm gonna actually start on lunch. To be honest, I feel like\nif I wasn't vlogging today I'd probably just, like, eat some, like, crackers and hummus, but,\nlike, really what my body needs is some nutrients, so I got out some eggs. I'm thinking I'm doing, it's\nstill, like, super easy. I'm thinking of doing,\nlike, an egg scramble with some veggies and some avocado on top, and that just being kind of a light lunch. And then I'm planning on making, I have a bunch of veggies in\nthe fridge I need to use up, I'm planning on making like a nice, big vegetable soup for dinner, but then also so we can\nhave throughout the week. That's the plan. I actually want to, like,\nretest that recipe for the soup 'cause I want to put it on the blog. Oh, and new angles. What up? By the way, someone asked me the other day how I clean my mushrooms, and I actually just dry brush them 'cause apparently you're\nnot supposed to soak them, so I just have this little mushroom brush I will link it down below. I'll put it on my Amazon shop. Just give it a little, a\nlittle sweep, you know? (upbeat music) (knife clicks) So I just chopped all my veggies. I have mushrooms, red onion, and zucchini. I'm gonna scramble up a few eggs, and then we'll put the\navocado on top at the end. (egg clicks) (upbeat music) (pepper cracks) Garlic. Someone slept so good today. Someone slept so good. Yeah, you slept really good, huh? Want milky? - [Matt] Milky, you wanna have it? (upbeat music) (veggies sizzle) - And now for the big moment. (gasps) Yeah, so good. And I'm gonna take the other half. We're just gonna eat the one half. I'm gonna take the other half and I'm gonna just marry it\nwith one of our avocado huggers, give it a little snuggy hug. These are great. We sell them on the thehealthnutshop.com. They're great because they actually keep your avocados fresh for,\nusually around, like, three or four days. They work amazing and they\nhave a little button here, so if you have the pit out,\nyou can just push it in. Was that Sage farting? (laughs) Sage just farted. Whether you have the pit in or out, you can just pop it in or out. And it comes with, like, a larger one, depending on the size of your avocado. So there's two sizes. They come in a twin pack. I'll link it down below. Honestly, one of my\nfavorite kitchen gadgets 'cause it actually works. It's so good. It's like a little avocado saucer. And there you have it. Lunch. I got scrambled eggs, veggies. I just throw on, like, a\nspring mix on the side. And then I have a little lemon wedge that I can just squeeze on top, since the greens don't have a dressing. And also I put it in this\nfancy bowl, but in reality, this is Matt's plate. (laughs) So, just so you know, it's not\nalways Instagram aesthetic. But yeah, anyways, that's\ngonna be our lunch. Got lots of healthy veggies,\nprotein, healthy fats, greens, and just a little burst of\nvitamin C from the lemon, so this is just a nice\nnutrient dense lunch. (television emits foreign language) You should have been\nmaking me food, I'm sick. We're watching \"Mission\nImpossible\", so random. All right, so Matt is\nputting Sage down for a nap, so I'm just gonna, like,\nchill while she's napping. I just fed her. We checked my temperature. It's only, like, 97,\nso it's not even high. I just feel, like, really\ncongested in my head. Hopefully it clears up, but I'm just having a little snack, so I figured I'd share with\nyou guys what I'm having. I really like these Made Good snacks. These are, like, little bites. They also have bars. And then I'm also\nsnacking on some of these Neal Brothers, these are\nthe honey wheat braids. They're really good, so I'm\njust havin' a little snack. And I refilled my little ginger lemon mug with some more water. That's what I like about that one, you can just kind of keep refilling it. I really would love if my mom just made me some of her famous vegetable\nsoup. (graphic pops) I feel like every time I\nshare her vegetable soup on my Instagram, everyone's like, oh my God, that looks so good. She's, like, the soup queen. She's really good at making soup, so. But yeah, that's the update. We're finishing \"Mission Impossible.\" Matt loves to watch, like,\nold school movies like that. And I like to, too. It's, like, a little nostalgic. And sometimes I find I\nforget certain things from when I watched it\noriginally 'cause I was younger, maybe I didn't pay attention\nas much, I don't know. But I like rewatching, like, old classics and being like, oh, I didn't\neven realize that happened, or like, that was that\nkinda thing, you know? Things, you always,\nlike, pick up new things when you watch a movie a\nsecond time or third time, or this is probably, like, the fourth time that I've watched this, so. Yeah, I got a roll of TP for my nose. And Matt also brought some Smart Sweets. All the essentials, guys. Sometimes being sick just\nmeans eating all the snacks on the couch while laying down. But yeah, I just wanted\nto be real to you guys, 'cause, like, as much as I\nlove to make green juices, and I did today, it's, you know, I had the energy earlier,\nbut I do not now. So I'm glad I got in the good food earlier 'cause I think I'm just gonna be snacking for the rest of the day. (bag crinkles) (chews) - [Man] Was last divided\nby Martha and Peter Punt and (indistinct). Couple of hours still here. Sagey's here. Hey Sagey. All I gotta say is being sick and a parent at the same time sucks. This the first time that\nI'm sick since having Sage. (sighs) Just be nice, okay? Give mommy a break. (giggles) Sagey. Hi Sagey. Hi Sagey. Sagey. Yeah. Oh, Matt, God bless you. Matt just made me a lemon balm tea. - [Man] What do you think of that problem? - Oh, it's hot. And now we're on the second\n\"Mission Impossible\". And no idea what we're\ngonna have for dinner, but I'm just (sighs) relaxing. (giggles) Not how I thought today was going to go, but here we are. (baby's toy crinkles) Hi. (speech bubble pops) Hi Sagey. So I was planning on making\nvegetable soup tonight, but I just, I can't do it. I'm not feeling good, low energy, so Matt stepped in and made some food. He cooked up some at ground beef. Actually, this is the\nImpossible ground beef, so it's a plant-based one. It legit tastes like the real thing. It's so good. And then he added some black beans. I'll show you guys what\nthe packaging looks like. You get it at Sobey's. It's in the frozen section, and you just thaw it, and\nit cooks up really fast, and it tastes just like ground beef. All right, so we have our\nground beef and beans there. I've got the tortilla wrap\nto smash the avocado on them. (upbeat music) (spoon clinks) I'm adding some of this spicy vegan queso. My sister Chloe recommended this. We already sampled it. It's very spicy, so a\nlittle go a long way. Just a little bit. My sour cream hack is just\nto use some yogurt instead. (upbeat music) All right, Matt. All right, so that's what we have. I added some tortilla chips for crunch, and I'm gonna try to roll it up. This is always the tricky part. I forget, like that, and like that. No, the chips cut through it. (tortilla chips crackle) It's, like, all bread. Oh (beeps), no. (laughs) (beeps) Good morning, it is the next day. It's actually afternoon,\nbut I never ended the vlog, so I just wanted to say\nthank you for watching. Honestly, I'm feeling\nso much better today. I sound, like, really\nnasally, but I do feel better. I had a nice hot shower this morning. I did the oil, like,\neucalyptus oils in it again, and it just really helped clear things up. So I'm hoping, like, I'm\non the road to recovery. Sage feels great. Matt had a little bit of\nsniffles this morning, but I think we're all\ndoing really well, so. I feel like all that green juice helped. I actually had some leftover green juice this morning for\nbreakfast, and I just felt like it helped give me\nthat nutrients I needed. So, thank you so much for watching. If you guys enjoyed this video, as always, don't forget to give it a thumbs up so I know and I can do\nmore videos like this. And leave me a comment, say hello, maybe what you do when\nyou're not feeling well. And yeah, if you like more of these, like, vloggy style what I eat in a day videos, let me know, and I will\ndefinitely do more. (oven beeps)\nOh. That's our lunch in the oven. I will see you guys in my next video, hopefully (sniffs) smelling\nand sounding a lot better, and I will see you guys soon. Bye.

[Music] oh", "yfBRslLWP_M": "hey guys welcome to our fit family I just have a couple of tips for you today around what are some good snacks to pack and take with you if you're going to be away from home for an extended period of time I think one of the biggest keys to staying on track with any of the meal plans that beach body offers but especially the 21 day fix is making sure that you don't go too long in between each meal so if you know you're going to have breakfast and then it's going to be a long time until you get to have lunch you want to make sure that you include a couple of snack options with you throughout the day okay so I'm just going to share with you what I typically have and some tips that you may want to consider okay so first off if you're going to be away from home and away from a fridge where you can store perishable items i highly recommend you get an insulated lunch box or some sort of an insulated container to carry your food with you one that's really popular is this type of bag called six pack bags I just got this one so has a tag on it but um the gist is that it's insulated and it actually holds multiple food containers so that you can pack up an entire lunch or days worth of food and take it with you so that's an awesome one there about fifty dollars I think for the bag and they go up from there so an insulated lunch box would work just fine ok so again these are some tips that I these are some new ideas snack ideas that I would typically use because they err err on the side of not being perishable so just in case you don't have access to a fridge or you don't have a insulated lunch box you can still use most of these snacks okay so number one you knew this was coming right number one is your Shakeology this is by far the easiest way to get a quick meal 200 calories lots of nutrients in your stomach in about two minutes flat take your shaker cope with you and if you're not using it for your shake put some water in it you need to be drinking water old anyway but if you're going to make your shake on the road and you have no access to a blender then fill this thing up with i would say four or five cubes of ice water the rest of the way up dump your shake in shake it up really hard to get rid of all the lumps and then drink it right away so that it's still cold and still fresh but that's number one take your Shakeology with you even if you've already had one in a day take it take a second one with you just in case it's better to have a second one in the same day than it is to go hungry for a spell of time and then over eat at your next meal okay number one number two is a variation on Shakeology probably seen the recipe in our group but if you haven't tried Shakeology cookies yet I highly recommend them this is the chocolate Shakeology cookie recipe I've made the cookies in ball form I didn't flatten them out like cookies whatever just takes one more step but I don't need to do but this recipe is super simple it's Shakeology dry oatmeal peanut butter and honey mixed all together you don't bake them they do not need to be refrigerated so there again you can take them with you in the car I always make a batch of those before I go on any road trip they're super convenient and again the hardest thing you have to deal with what those is not eating the whole box and you just want to have one not 20 of them okay tip number three is fruit fruit is one of the best snacks you can take with you especially apples bananas oranges really durable fruit that you can literally just grab and eat the only thing that I want to say about this though is that you really want to pair whenever you have a fruit item you want to pair it with something else whether you a protein or effect so that the sugar from the fruit doesn't just like up your blood sugar real quick and then go away and leave you hungry again in like an hour so what I typically will do is I'm taking an apple with me for my snack as I will pair this with a 21 day fix to prove portion of almonds these are just plain raw almonds stick them in a baggie throw them in your purse that's really easy the other option again if you have access to refrigeration or insulated lunch box is to take a piece of cheese same thing fruit in fact okay these little baby Bell things are nice because they're individually wrapped you're not gonna get cheese and wishing this all over every place and two of these is one serving okay third or fourth option on snacks right now is a really easy one is to take carrot sticks and the individually wrapped packets of hummus with you I don't have any on hand to show you but if you go to your grocery store you can either get the big tub of hummus and put it into a little container or they actually have them prepackaged in the small containers but whether you get whole carrots and cut them up like I have or you buy the baby carrots from the grocery store either one works again carrots don't need to be refrigerated the hummus does so keep that in mind you want to put that in your employed lunch box but it makes a great snack in there again it's a vegetable and effect so you're really going to get a balanced snack okay a couple ideas on actual more substantial meals that you could take with you on the road you can you to as well one that I typically will do is I will take an undressed salad with me so I'll get a to-go container you know just a simple what I want Tupperware I'm not going to cut it up and show you right now but I'll fill it up with a couple handfuls of baby spinach I'll cut up half a tomato and half a cucumber and throw it all into that container then when you fill it up fill this up it basically makes it out one green container on the 21 day fix that's why I recommend putting it all in there together okay so however much you can cram in there that you want those are basic vegetables again that do not need to be refrigerated they can stay unrefrigerated for hours and be fine that's your vegetable okay then what I typically will take with me and you can find these at your grocery store too are these or you call it vacuum-packed packets of either salmon or tuna vs if you were to get tuna in the can and you have to have a can opener and drain it and all that stuff you don't want to do that you want these patches because you can just rip it open dump out the juice and then you can literally dumped the canned salmon or tuna on your salad there's a little bit of moisture in the meat and so it actually creates a little bit of addressing all on its own but if you want to pack a little tub of salad dressing as well I recommend oil and vinegar again because it doesn't need to be refrigerated okay so that would make a really easy healthy lunch that you could have on the go the only thing you need to remember to pack is a fork if you plan to eat it okay so that's great if you have a chance to sit down and eat an actual salad it's going to really fill you up because you've got the vegetable in the protein combo if you have even less time and you want to prepare everything before you go I highly recommend going old school with some peanut butter sandwiches I recommend using these sandwich thins okay because they are basically like eating one piece of bread cut lengthwise so you're not using as many calories or containers if you're following the 21 day fix to still get that same sandwich effect so literally if you're following the fix one of these is one yellow container and I would use up two of my teaspoons putting peanut butter on them so you basically just make a peanut butter sandwich I don't recommend using jelly it's not approved on any of the plans I've found but what you can do is instead is take a container or a baggie of some sort of berries right or you can again go back to the Apple go really old school okay so in that case if you're going to eat the peanut butter sandwich you want to pair it with some sort of a fruit or you know their carrot sticks or something like that I would I typically like to pair it with like blueberries just because it gives me a little sweet flavor okay so that's a couple lunch options and a couple of snack options if you guys have any other ideas or questions about how you would take a personal favorite snack on the road comment below and I will do my best to answer it but otherwise just to back in for more tips and tricks on our meal plan here and I will talk to you soon thanks so much", "muOYEMgTE_U": "hi this is John Erickson of coop at Lowe's calm and in today's video newsletter we're going to discuss how to transition from Weight Watchers on to the core fat loss plan I got a message from Kim she says that it's usually very easy for me to lose weight until recently I was doing Weight Watchers but what's it losing I need help finding the right diet and she goes on to say that she does not like eggs pork fish shellfish oranges pears rice and does not like most vegetables when I went over her eating program on her diet evaluation form that she filled out on my website she says for breakfast she eats either cereal or oatmeal now if you know the first premise of the core fat loss plan is you need protein carbs and fat at every single meal while on Weight Watchers their philosophy is based on calorie counting which does not differentiate between proteins carbohydrates and fats so on my plan you have to have all three ingredients in one meal so you can't have just cereal or oatmeal for breakfast you have to have protein cereal and some fat because the protein has to be something quick and easy for you to make and since you don't eat eggs I would go to Trader Joe's or stop and shop they have good either turkey bacon that's on cured they have mini breakfast sausage made of turkey or chicken they have you can have a quick protein shake in the morning consisting of one cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk one scoop of plant-based protein powder like Sun warrior warrior blend the one I recommend on my website and just shake it up and that would be a protein source or you can have the turkey bacon three slices or three to four breakfast links let's Turkey sources and that's your protein and your hydrates it's going to be a cereal and your fat is the almond milk that you use to put in your cereal now you have to put almond milk unsweetened vanilla in your cereal because if you use regular one light 1% cow's milk that's going to take up carbohydrates is 12 grams of carbohydrates and one cup of milk so that would be overload with the cereal and a milk so you definitely have to find the right cereal for breakfast you need to have a high-fiber cereal I tell you which cereal I recommend in my shopping guide if you go to a cereal section you'll see that I recommend the regular Cheerios in the yellow box because that has around 20 grams of carbohydrates per cup and make sure you look at the serving size because the cereal manufacturers manipulate the serving size of 3/4 of a cup to trick you into lowering the carbohydrates so make sure 1 cup has about 20 grams of carbohydrates and that's always total carbohydrates takeaway fiber so it's very important to do a quick mass before you determine how many carbohydrates are actually in your cereal the cereals that I recommend are I'll show you if you can read it write checks and the other gluten-free brands that I recommended on my shopping guide I show you the exact ones I recommend and as well as the recipes how to make cereal balanced on the core fat loss plan so you would have three slices of turkey bacon cereal 3/4 to 1 cup of cereal and 3/4 to 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk and we're done so I just balanced your breakfast and I'm usually adding food to people's diet now if you want accelerated fat loss you have to do the oatmeal because the 5 minute or the steel-cut oatmeal because the cereal based on its processing is going to absorb a little bit quicker into body compared to the old-fashioned oatmeal or the steel-cut oatmeal so you can add either one you have to have your protein your cereal or your oatmeal oatmeal if you want maximum fat loss and some kind of fat source would be a balanced meal so Weight Watchers is just call the hydrants you're allowed to have in one meal but in my plan you have to have proteins carbs and fats every single meal breakfast lunch dinner and even your snacks need all three ingredients so that breakfast I need to clean up ok that's a 10 o'clock kids next meal is a sandwich for lunch at 1:00 p.m. she has a sandwich with low-sodium ham or tuna fish which is fine I just want to balance this the same way I did with your breakfast your sandwich you have your protein which is your hand or tuna fish two slices of bread I want to add some fat source to this so can you have mayonnaise if you don't eat mayonnaise you can use have a couple of nuts on the side like six almonds or cashews just to get some fat in you so I would have a sandwich two slices of bread with three or four slices of ham in the middle or the tuna fish with mayonnaise just to make it balanced now if you look at the amount of carbohydrates bread has I want you to have 20 grams of carbs per meal so most bread has around 12 maybe 14 grams of carbohydrates so I want each slice of bread to have 10 grams of carbohydrates I also show you which bread is good in my shopping guide which the bread should be gluten free for most people people in free otherwise you need to have a high fiber bread that has a row of 10 grams of carbohydrates so you can have two slices would have 20 grams carbohydrates and again it's total carbohydrates particular fiber just to balance that meal if you have two slices in regular bread you can f be having like 28 grams of carbohydrates which you need to lower to 20 so most bread is check your bread if it's high in carbohydrates you have to take away the outer slice of the crust so we make a sandwich don't eat the crust or you can have one and a half slice of the dredge like it's a triple-decker cut in half now if you want maximum fat loss you should not be eating a sandwich because you have to get rid of the bread if you want maximum fat loss and instead of that you would turn that sandwich into a lettuce wrap so you would have your three slices of ham on lettuce you can have a slice of Alpine laced cheese which would add two fat wrap it up and then you eat that which is just your protein and mustard can go in that tube because mustard is free so that would just be a protein and your call the hydrogens from being Apple so that would be a nice meal for you if you have three slices of ham one slice of apple and lays low fat cheese or any kind of low fat cheese wrapped up in the lettuce leaves eat it like a lettuce wrap and have it fruit like an apple on the side so you just don't eat orange as a pair so you'd have to have an apple apple sauce snack pack a bag of a cup of breaks berries something else that I list in my book I show you the exact fruits that you should have when trying to get the maximum fat loss okay so that would be your lunch I gave you two options to breakfast so far the regular one and a maximum fat loss one a lunch you're also getting two options which is one is the regular one which is the bread or you can have two lettuce wrap for maximum fat loss your next meal between lunch and dinner Kim likes to have something chocolate of course now I just want to balance that chocolate just like a balance every other meal so if it isn't the bad thing if you have dark 70% chocolate you'd have a square of chocolate it should be around 10 grams of carbohydrates it's usually like one inch 1.5 inches by one and a half inches square it's not the most amount of chocolate but you can still have it you have to have a protein shake with it so you have to have one cup of almond milk one scoop protein powder shake it up slam it and have some chocolate with it because the chocolate has the protein in the fat and the protein drink is your protein so that would be all three ingredients so and you need to have something around four o'clock because if you eat lunch at 1:00 and dinner that it says you eat dinner at 7:00 you need to have a snack around four o'clock just to keep you stabilized for dinner otherwise you're going to overeat and be ravenous at dinner so it's important to have something if it has to be chocolate you can also have a kind bar look for the kind bars that have 10 grams of carbohydrates total optical fiber per kind bar because there's a tiny layer of chocolate that does the trick and it's only 10 grams of carbohydrates is amazing that you can get away with eating that let's trumpet in the kind bar and it gives you your chocolate fix that would be a good option for you and for dinner Kim it says varies Kim did not give me any kind of information about dinner just says it's very so I can't help you there dinner is usually something quick like protein either a chicken or turkey and turkey sausage chicken sausage that's going to be always on the corner of your plate and then you're going to have a sweet potato with butter and some kind of vegetable so that would be a standard dinner there's 160 dinners in my recipe so fabulous book so I'll give you plenty of options and if you go out to dinner restaurant eating guide and the last meal of the day we went through everything so far would be before bed snack and what does Kim had before bed nothing she's dinner at 7:00 which is fairly late if you go to bed within three hours of eating dinner which would be like 10 o'clock you do not need your before best snack if you go better around 10:30 I would have a before bed snack and that could be something quick like plain Greek yogurt a little blob of plate some berries and slivered almonds so I have proteins cosmic fast it would be 0% plain Greek yogurt scoop of berries and some slivered almonds 1 tablespoon and then that would be a nice before bed snack because it mirrors ice cream it's like cold creamy and sweet when you have the Greek yogurt berries and nuts and that's also a good breakfast for you if you like that combination you can have a blob of 0% Greek yogurt it should be like 3/4 - 1 cup on your plate one cup of mixed berries and a tablespoon of slivered almonds on top for 10 statues that's where your fat source and that could also be a nice breakfast for you and this moving on is cod liver oil what supplements does Kim take she takes a chewable cod liver oil most adults should have the regular fish oil from Nordic Naturals is a good brand or other brands are good if they're purified concentrated and third-party tested so it doesn't have any purity tuna steak kids can do better with cod liver oil because there's both lineman a and D in there kids can deal with the extra a adults vitamin A can build up so that's why we don't do the cod liver oil and cod liver oil comes from the liver of the face which has all pollutants and toxins ooh crap so it's gotten paraffin fish body oils come from the eyeballs and the guts and body of the fish which doesn't have high amounts of vitamin A and E so I would go for the fish oils instead of the cod liver what type with olive oil which is good olive oil or coconut oil works no alcohol she works out three days a week so as far as transitioning from Weight Watchers on the fabulous plan it's pretty much all about balance wait watches his corporate company they were invented by an IRS agent and the company has just flipped over so many times and it's just a stock market company where they're pretty much just worried about the numbers and it has great camaraderie if you ever saw the food that Weight Watchers serves it's the Box its processed food in a box if they weren't willing to serve you that I would be cautious of what their motives are they're just looking for profit and Weight Watchers philosophically the calorie theory is in 1850 science before we knew about hormones Weight Watchers based on the calorie model which is the point system they're only concerned about the calories in versus calories out theory which was developed in nineteen eighteen fifty it's really old science and they also think that fruit is free now fruit cannot be free cannot neglect fruit because fruit expression is bananas papayas mangoes and cantaloupe honeydew they're high glycemic and you have to be candied fruit and chef and you shouldn't have more than two fruit today because the fructose in fruits is the most lipo lipo genic fat which means the fructose supposed to deliver makes your liver produced stat so you have to question with your fruits Weight Watchers told millions of people that fruit is free now millions of people think fruit is free you can't go around messing messing with people's brains that way and changing people's behavior the wrong way because then I have to clean everything up and set it pretty straight because of the corporate overlords that teach people of this stuff this aimless advice so I would listen to my situation which would be to balance your food because we're concerned about controlling a blood sugar on a moment-to-moment basis if you have just carbohydrates in the morning your insulin is going to shoot up and go down you're going to be on a roller coaster all day you need protein to sustain your blood sugar levels and eating protein especially in the morning is like giving your car guess it's like revving up your metabolism because protein has twice the metabolic effect when compared to called hydrates and fat because protein revs up your metabolism and it's a long burner threat to days they're in mourning it's got to be consistent it's not a lot of protein three slices of turkey bacon and if that's too much food having turkey bacon and cereal or turkey bacon and oatmeal then you have to tone down your protein and your carbs simultaneously because you have to have all three ingredients in one meal proteins carbs and fats every single time you eat that's the first primary most fundamental principle behind the core fat loss plan is to have protein carbs and fat in every single meal a Weight Watchers it's just calories to them you're allowed to have just calories and Weight Watchers also make people afraid of fact that you can't be afraid of fat or else you got to be afraid of your own brain because the brain is 60% of the dry weight or brain is made of fat fat becomes your brain helps you think that keeps your skin healthy fat is everything your body makes hormones testosterone and hormones called acosta noise the types of fat but very important do not think that is just a list of calories fat is intelligent and it can control your internal chemistry by eating the right amount some types of fat fat if you don't need fat you're going to be starving that goes into your body and says the chemical signal t-brain saying that you're full and that's important on a diet you need to be full throughout the day so you don't suffer and on Weight Watchers if you follow a calorie counting diet which count your calories and really decrease your food intake it become a metabolism becomes drab or a weak your metabolism just sucks a slower after a while and that's a good revolving business model because people gain weight lose the weight and gain it back and then you need to keep joining so Weight Watchers is good for the camaraderie but the philosophical framework of the eating program is horrible and there's no owner of the company it's just twelve shareholders Oprah whose unsuccessful and every diet she goes on so I would change over to Weight Watchers and if you wanted to use processed food Weight Watchers sometimes gives you processed foods like the smoke ones those are problems with the worst ones on the shelf you need to have the healthy choice they make better quality or the Lean Cuisine that you can find certain ones that are balanced and also in my shopping guide I show you the exact frozen meals of course you shouldn't be having frozen meals all the time but there's certain frozen meals that are balanced then I give you a list of them in my book of which link Azim and healthy choice meals a balance or other breads that you can find that fit our criteria see on-court diets on quote a fat loss plan everybody has to fit your criteria you are the center of your universe so you don't let somebody just give you all their brand name logos and surround you with their own logo you're free to choose any logo that fits you so you can have Lean Cuisine any kind of product you can go to McDonald's and create the cool fat loss meal you can go anywhere based on use your own knowledge what I give you a based on the restaurant eating guide and the home cooking guide or the shopping guide I give you the knowledge to situate everything around you so you're in charge you don't let anybody else be in charge of knew your nutrition we live by principles and concepts which is proteins causing the fat at every meal if you want to lose the most amount of fat you have to lower the glycemic index of your carbohydrates and counting carbohydrates instruction and properly throughout the day then you have to eat the right amount of fats and glacial taking fish oil but take the fish body oil not the cod liver oil not a big deal but I would definitely rather you take the fish body oils and Nordic Naturals ultimate Omega it's the best one and finally the meal timing strategies which we went over your milk charm strategies okay you're missing that four o'clock knife snack that's going to make you stabilize for dinner and otherwise that's all you got to do this has been a video newsletter from John Erickson your personal trainer and nutritionist than one if you want if you want to get your own diet evaluated you can go to my website and fill out the diet evaluation form please allow 2 to 3 weeks for me to get back to you and if you have a good evaluation I'll do a video response", "W7TOfP6Dc0o": "hi I'm Emily Luke Eddie the executive pastry chef at waterbar restaurant in San Francisco and today I'm going to make a beautiful berry trifle and i'm going to use browse berries blueberries blackberries and strawberries the great thing about a trifle especially a berry trifle is you don't really need a recipe you can make it with it whatever you have on hand the most important thing is to draw out the juices of the berries so then you can get them to soak into the cake and that's what makes the trifle really really flavorful so the first thing that we're going to do is cook some blueberries with some sugar because that will really help them pop and get all that juice going ok now what I've done is I've added some sugar to some blueberries and I've just let them cook for about five minutes and you can see all that juice that's come out and the the berries are all all the juices come out of them so they're kind of dissolve flat and but what I want to do is I'm going to add some fresh berries in there so you also get some fresh blueberry texture and taste as well so we're just going to stir that in right at the end right before we turn off the heat now well the blueberries are cooling we're going to make the cream and what I have is just some heavy whipping cream and some creme fraiche now you can use all straight cream or you could use sour cream but i really like creme fraiche because it adds a nice really tangy flavor to the desert and you just want to use about half creme fraiche and half whipped cream and then i'm going to put in a little bit of sugar just to taste some vanilla extract it's about a teaspoon and a little bit of lemon zest and I'm just going to use the micro planer and this will just take a couple minutes to get thick now that the cream in the creme fraiche has been whipped I'm going to prepare the strawberries the raspberries and the blackberries and what I like to do is just slice some strawberries put them in a bowl with some raspberries and blackberries any combination that you want and then I'm going to add a little bit of sugar and again just to flavor them if they do if the fruit is really really fresh you need very very little sugar so always make sure you test your berries first and then I'm just going to use a bar muddler and just break up the berries some if I'm home and I'm making this I actually use a potato masher and it works really really well okay now we're going to be ready to assemble our trifle now the first thing I'm going to do is put some blueberries in the bottom and you can do any kind of berry that you want but you basically want to start with some berry and then a little bit of cream and you can see the cream mixture that I made to a really soft whip it's not really really stiff because you don't want it you want it to be nice and moist and then we're going to take our cake and the cake you can see is too big to fit in here so what you want to do is just tear up pieces apart and put put them in so they cover the bottom and then this time I'm going to put a few raspberries blackberries and strawberries on and you just want to spread it out so it's covering the bottom of the cake and then again more cream and you can use big bulls you can use this is a great dessert to do for a crowd because you just take it to the table and it's ready to go you can also do individual ones if you want in wine glasses to make it a little bit more festive and as the you get higher and higher up the bull the layers get wider so you really want to make sure that you have enough fruit on there and if you're going to have berries you want to have berries so now also what's great about this dessert if you look at it you see all the beautiful layers and it's a dessert in itself as far as all the presentation and garnishes are all in one you just take this to the table with a bunch of balls and some spoons and you just scoop it right out at the table and it's beautiful and it tastes great", "SsPVlf2Ij0k": "[Music] all right guys i am so pumped for this video and for this trip we have been planning this for years so we are going to galena illinois don't ask why we picked that destination it was the best thing available never been there don't care we get to spend the whole weekend together just us no babies no husbands it's gonna be great and i'm taking you guys along with because i want to show you a real life example of what it's like to eat whole food plant-based not only on vacation but with a bunch of people who do not eat the way you eat these are typical standard american diet style eating patterns so it's going to be lots of junk food lots of alcohol and i'm going to show you exactly how i navigate these situations so make sure you stay tuned and if you want some of the preparation for this video be sure to check out the q a strategies as well as how i prepared all the food that i'm bringing with along with my instant pot all right let's head out so first i'm headed about two hours west uh to meet my girlfriends and then we're all gonna carpool from there so it'll be quite the day it's about another two hours from there to our destination so we'll be in the car a lot but that's perfectly fine with me i'm so excited to get out of it's been here long time since i've done anything like this i'm so glad i get to bring you guys along with me all right guys we got about two hour drive to galena so we're at the

go find some frozen berries here's my girls they're picking up their own stuff all right now i'm gonna look for some sparkling water um i think i'll try some lemon all right guys that's what i'm looking for simple carbonated water no artificial flavors no sodium let's see what this one says you always want to check of course it's upside down see this naturally essenced non-gmo i don't even want to know what the meaning of naturally essence means but it can't be good so we're gonna go with canada dry so this stuff will make me feel like i'm not really missing out on the shenanigans okay now i'm gonna grab some frozen berries these are great for the oatmeal i'll be making but as well as to snack on so if you remember from some of my other videos you want to get these frozen berries because for one they're not organic but if you can't afford organic it's what you want to buy they tend to be a lot safer and have less pesticides and herbicides than other fresh varieties [Music]

doing all right guys so here's the salad i was able to prepare earlier fruit salad and a little love okay how do you say this chick chick no not cheap charcoal charcuterie [Laughter] [Music] [Music] i'm sending this to amy [Music] i got 10 000. [Music] good morning so last night was really interesting and i just want to unpack a few things because this turned out to be a lot more difficult than i had anticipated so last night was very difficult especially as the night went on you know and you get more and more tired and your your reserves kind of kind of fall down you break down those barriers but not only that but there was of course alcohol and there's always those thoughts going back in your mind like oh what if i did this or oh what if i just had one drink or oh that looks like so much fun i just want to partake but i kept going in the fridge and getting my sparkling waters and i just enjoy those so much that i'm like and my girlfriends of course would ask me you know i thought i thought you were going to be drinking like why aren't you drinking because sometimes in the past i would drink sometimes i wouldn't um obviously i just had a child and still nursing so that was always my go-to like i was really excited to have such a concrete excuse not to be partaking in alcoholic beverages drinking gets people into trouble and honestly the last time i drank on halloween i lost a 10 000 limit credit card with my name on it if there is anything more irresponsible i i don't know i don't know what it is so that is beyond embarrassing and not going to be tolerated in my mind i am 34 years old that is just ridiculous i have a child at home there is no reason to be acting like i'm in my 20s anymore i think those behaviors can stay in that decade so anyway my strategy for denying all of these very sweet and very curious yet very pushy um gestures were basically to play out in my mind exactly what would transpire had i given in to these temptations so with the food you think about biting into this deliciously tasting food but it's such a short lived piece of gratification as soon as that hits your digestive tract and you start digesting it and you start feeling all sluggish and gross and oily and it just doesn't seem worth it to me anymore i started thinking about my workout this morning and how how it just wouldn't be as enjoyable experience and um especially with the alcohol i started playing out you know waking up with that terrible cotton mouth and that uh dehydration and the headaches or the insomnia i i get terrible insomnia when i drink so i've learned how to use this strategy from dr doug lyle i'll link him below but he has this podcast called beat your jeans like g-e-n-e-s he's a revolutionary psychologist um i'm sure you've heard me talk about him before if you watch my channel but he is incredible when it comes to dealing with the social pressures of eating differently than other people and he promotes the plant-based lifestyle so he's very much in tune to what i'm going through and what i experienced last night so i get it it's hard it's really hard to stick to your guns and your health goals when you're out and about with um people who don't necessarily follow the same beliefs or perhaps they do but because they're on vacation it's kind of a free-for-all and i used to be like that too but it's i don't like feeling like junky in the morning i don't like the way that those foods inevitably make me feel so even though last night was super challenging and it takes a tremendous amount of willpower and education and forethought and strategy to handle these situations it's so worth it and i really hope this inspires you to stick to your guns the next time that you're on vacation so today we'll be going out um downtown and i'll show you guys a little bit of the historical areas that we're going to be looking at this is um where ulysses s grant apparently grew up so um yeah let's hopefully get to see a little bit of that or illinois we're in illinois a little bit of that illinois charm i should probably hop in the shower and go see what my friends are up to breakfast i'm just going to put a half cup of these oats because it doesn't sound like my girlfriends are too enthusiastic about um trying any and then i gotta do three parts water so what would that be a cup and a half of water and i'm just going to try this porridge setting because i haven't done that yet and i'm curious as to how this is going to turn out the less processed the oats are the more water you're gonna need so it's a three to one ratio with the um unprocessed oats and it's a two to one ratio with more processed so it's like rolled oats or old-fashioned so let's go make sure the valve is in the right place um and i'm gonna try the forage all right so the valve looks like it's ready [Applause] [Music] for a while a little too much liquid in the future i would definitely recommend using less water this has been sitting for about an hour and it's still not quite the consistency i was looking for but it'll still help to thaw my frozen berries this is about a cup of frozen berries and then i'm going to mix this with the chia seeds i ground up in my earlier video if you want to check out the preparation for all this make sure you click the video link here and then next to the chia mix is just some cinnamon and some other spices that i usually put on my oatmeal [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we spent the majority of the afternoon checking out the shops and different historical sites around galena we are just getting back to the vacation home and we are starving so this is the second salad i packed for the trip it is delicious and my friends checked out the restaurant menu at the resort we're staying at and these were some of their options and honestly i wasn't tempted at all by these menu options because all i could think about was my delicious salad waiting for me back at the resort it truly helps to have your food prepared ahead of time so you don't even have to think about what you're going to be eating and you don't have to play that game with yourself going back and forth oh this would taste so good maybe i should just try some we were all pretty wiped out after a day's worth of walking around outdoors so we decided to stay in on saturday night and just have a little movie time and we went for a nice walk after dinner it was a great great vacation we'll be leaving in the morning [Music] so [Music] [Music] that's it that's our weekend time to go home and face [Music] time to go home and face the baby and the husband [Music] all right guys we'll catch up with you later [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so it's sunday afternoon and i'm finally pulling in to my driveway that was a wonderful weekend i have some great new memories i feel refreshed and best of all i feel clear-headed and i'm not suffering from all the awful junk foods i could have been indulging in throughout the weekend or the alcohol i could have been abusing so there's nothing wrong if you want to embrace some of those things in our society it's so natural to like use food to celebrate and in social settings specifically and i feel like there's this subconscious sense of oh i'm on vacation let's do all the crappy things that i wouldn't normally do if it had been a normal day so i'm very proud of myself and i feel very fortunate that i was able to come up with some successful strategies that work for me ahead of time and have that mindset and i know exactly what i want to do moving into these situations because i already have it planned out in my mind some of those strategies again were preparing my food ahead of time number one and coming up with specific uh responses i was going to use when people were pressuring me to consume things that i don't find to be very in line with my health goals after you have those under your belt then you can incorporate more things like playing that out in my mind what was going to transpire had i eaten those foods so i started thinking about how crappy i would feel the next day and how i wouldn't enjoy my workout as much and as you guys can see i love to exercise first thing in the morning even when i'm on vacation and i was able to actually have a friend join me the second day so i was really excited to see that but i hope this video was helpful it is so challenging to try to stay on top of your weight loss and your health goals when in social circumstances especially on vacation so make sure you give this video a thumbs up and subscribe if you want to see more of these inspiration and motivational type videos and again leave comments with any of your strategies that you have found helpful so we can help out this community all right guys it's been a long ride i'm gonna go inside and unpack and i will see you in the next video you", "zcKvGK9aZ3s": "[Music] the animal kingdom a remarkable array of living breathing natural wonders [Music] compelling ingenious

of the largest strongest mammals roaming the planet young boisterous cubs have a charming cuddly appeal their lush fur and lovable antics inspiring generations of toy makers as adults however bears are daunting their impressive size and formidable presence commands respect in times past some cultures feared bears to the point that it was taboo to call them by their true name akto to avoid summoning these dangerous creatures the superstitious would use safer descriptive terms such as bear an old english word meaning the brown or dark one [Music] antarctica and australia are the only continents that bears don't inhabit [Music] with such large numbers seen in other parts of the world it may be surprising to learn that there are only eight different bear species in existence [Music] as a group bears are often described as dog-like this resemblance can be seen in their muzzles other standard features include thick coats of fur large pores with long claws small round ears plus short tails together these traits combine to form one awesome [Music] beast [Music] in biological terms bears are many things they are vertebrates animals with backbones having a sturdy spine is one feature that puts them into the class of mammals [Music] the fact that they're warm warm-blooded have fur and give birth to live young that nurse on milk are other specific mammalian characteristics [Music] the next rung of the taxonomic ladder has bears placed in the carnivora order mammals with claws and teeth for capturing and eating prey not all members are pure carnivores or meat eaters some are omnivores adding plant material to their diet [Music] the caniforms are a sub order a name that means doglike [Music] wolves and other canids plus seals otters the red panda and raccoons are some of the animals in this group bears are another they make up the ursaday family this name coming from the latin word for bear bears all have large stocky bodies covered in a thick double coat of fur [Music] a short undercoat close to the skin traps in heat while the longer guard hairs repel water [Music] bears have sturdy heads to match their brawny bodies with broad skulls and large powerful jaws [Music] the lips on a bear have a loose rubbery appearance perhaps due to the fact they are not attached to their gums inside their mouths bears are equipped with large canine teeth [Music] which are more for defensive displays than dining flat molars crush their food [Music] moving down to their feet a bear's pores have five digits with non-retractable claws like their canine cousins those on the front paws are longer than the hindsets [Music] while some large animals walk on their toes bears get around using what's called plantagrade locomotion with their feet landing flat on the ground [Music] some like polar bears have hairy well-insulated souls natural snowshoes in contrast species that climb tend to have naked soles for better grip the claws on climbing bears are strong and curved better for wrapping around tree trunks [Music] diggers like grizzly bears have long straight claws a common warning is to never run from a bear as predators they will chase and knowing they can hit speeds over 60 kilometers per hour there is no point [Music] what's more they can charge along at these speeds going uphill or down or across a slope up in the trees bears can be equally zippy [Music] intelligent strong daunting apt descriptors for these extraordinary mammals [Music] the world's eight bear species can be found in a wide variety of habitats throughout the northern hemisphere and in a few regions to the south of the equator [Music] brown bears enjoy the widest distribution roaming various continents in the northern hemisphere the largest member of the family is the polar bear males or he-bears can weigh up to half a ton the largest ever recorded was twice that females or she-bears are roughly half the size of the males from nose to tail males can measure up to three meters on all fours they stand about a meter tall when they rear up onto their hind legs their immense size becomes fully apparent polar bears sit at the top of the food chain they are the world's largest terrestrial carnivore seals are their favorite food as their name suggests the chile arctic is their domain polar bears equally at home on the ice as they are in the bitterly cold water [Music] due to their reliance on the ocean they are the only bears considered to be marine mammals the next largest members of the family are brown bears there is no mistaking these mammals are bears their scientific name ursus actos makes sure of this both words mean bear from latin and greek respectively they are a diverse group with more than 10 sub-species inhabiting regions in europe north america asia and the middle east despite their name brown bears can have a variety of coat colours ranging from pale cream to dark brunettes [Music] a well-known subspecies of brown bear is the grizzly from north america named for the silvery tips on their fur giving their coats a grizzled or streaked appearance they can be distinguished from other brown bears thanks to a large hump on their shoulders american black bears might be the smallest bear found on its namesake continent but they have the greatest population numbers in the entire family they range from canada down to mexico [Music] mature black bears can grow to a length of two meters compared to round bears they have longer ears and smaller shoulder humps [Music] with respect to their coat colour this bear's name is misleading they apparently come in a greater range of hues than any other north american mammal east coast black bears tend to be darker while their west coast cousins display lighter shades the komodi bear from islands of british columbia in canada is an extreme example also known as spirit or ghost bears these individuals are not albinos like other black bears they have dark noses and pores the pale coat of a spirit bear is the result of recessive jeans at work if both parents have these genes their cub develops a white coat in this isolated population approximately one in ten black bears will display this rare unusual trait [Music] asian black bears are easy to tell from their american relatives as they have a bright v-shaped marking on their chest sometimes called moon bears these mammals are found in mountainous forest areas [Music] sloth bears have similar markings plus light muzzles and bushy coats these mammals are found in sri lanka and india plus in northern regions such as nepal and bangladesh spectacled bears are the only species native to south america these mid-sized bears are named for the white fur that surrounds their eyes with their bold black and white fur there's no mistaking the giant panda an endangered species native to china large round heads and stocky bodies are characteristic of these beloved pairs which can grow to a shoulder height of 70 centimeters with so few wild pandas remaining many live in sanctuaries and zoos safe havens to ensure their ongoing survival [Music] the eighth member of the bear family is the sun bear the smallest of their kind similar in size to a large dog like some of its cousins this bear has a chest patch theirs looks like a rising sun at around 65 kilos these lightweights are tree dwellers the malay name for these bears means he who likes to sit high [Music] one bear-like creature that also likes to sit high is the koala these native australian animals are often called koala bears yet this is a misnomer as they are not theirs they are in fact marsupials [Music] red pandas are also not part of the bear family taxonomists have placed them in their own unique group from lush rainforests to arctic sea ice bears have successfully mastered an amazing range of domains bears are intelligent mammals rivaling the great apes [Music] brains and braun have no doubt helped these robust animals survive and flourish in such a broad range of environments around the globe in addition theirs have a vast array of adaptations and special skills to call on to assist them in their daily lives one of their best assets is their fur [Music] these lush dual layered coats have a variety of functions [Music] one is to keep the bear warm [Music] bears are further insulated by a layer of fat under their skin on a polar bear that layer can be 10 centimeters thick [Music] to the eye their dense coats appear to be white or cream but the individual strands are actually translucent this allows sunlight to penetrate their fur and be absorbed by their black skin a polar bear's fur demonstrates another important role played by their coat camouflage in their icy environment these massive predators can blend in and sneak up on any potential means [Music] the striking bands on a panda are thought to be a disruptive pattern breaking up their outline when amongst foliage allowing them to hide in plain sight from any lurking danger [Music] there is a theory about the chest markings on species like sun bears and sloth bears when fighting they could make them seem larger to their opponent [Music] when in dense forests american black bears are well camouflaged researchers believe their coats may offer them an additional more unusual kind of protection dark fur is rich in a pigment known as melanin it's been noted that black feathers in birds are scratch resistant [Music] some believe that black fur may have the same hardy quality [Music] strong claws are another vital feature for climbing species they can grip into tree bark [Music] on a polar bear they dig into the ice providing traction claws can also help a hungry bear dig out a meal or hold prey [Music] backed up by muscular limbs and large pores they make formidable weapons for both attack and defense purposes [Applause] [Music] the flexible front paws of a giant panda have a special additional feature an opposable thumb-like structure this enlarged wrist bone is useful for holding and manipulating their favorite food bamboo all bears can swim but polar bears are especially strong in the water also known as sea bears their four paws are slightly webbed and work like paddles the hind feet are in charge of steering these marine mammals have been observed to swim for over 160 kilometers without resting polar bears front pores make excellent snow shovels as well perfect for carving out a den in a snow bank watching a bear walk they seem to be bow-legged this does not hinder their gait instead their curved limbs give these large mammals good balance [Music] brown bears have a habit of standing on their hind legs to get a better view of their surroundings or to reach food their rear pores are larger than the front pair giving them a sturdy solid base like their canine relatives bears are scent-oriented animals the inner surface of their muzzle is covered with millions of olfactory nerves compared to a bloodhound a bear's sense of smell is seven times greater their keen noses can detect food sources more than 30 kilometers away [Music] a polar bear can smell a seal below a meter of ice food is not the only thing their noses can find they can sniff out potential mates locate their cubs and sense any approaching threats a bear's hearing is also superior similar to that of a dog including a sensitivity to high-pitched noises asian black bears have the largest ears in the family compared to other carnivores bears have unusually shaped ear flaps they have round cups as opposed to triangular on every species except pandas the ears can rotate and focus in on interesting sounds [Music] in terms of vision bears have good eyesight and can see in color their slit shaped pupils open wide in low light giving them excellent night vision as well [Music] thanks to their acute senses and clever adaptations every bear is well equipped to tackle life's challenges modern bears have been around for hundreds of thousands of years their ancestors date back to the dinosaur age small insect-eating mammals known as myasids eventually they gave rise to carnivores such as bears dogs and cats the oldest known bear the dawn bear existed 20 million years ago similar in size to a small dog giant pandas split away from the rest of their bear cousins about 3 million years ago one of its earliest ancestors was the pygmy giant panda half the size of its modern counterpart brown black and polar bears are thought to have shared a common ancestor about four million years ago today bears have many close relatives canids as previously mentioned plus seals or pinnipeds and musterloids a broad group including red pandas skunks weasels and raccoons the close ties between bears and raccoons has not gone unnoticed in many parts of europe and asia these masked mammals are known as washing bears thanks to their habit of dunking their food in water a close look and compare the family resemblances are strong [Music] spend time watching bears and they will gradually reveal a fascinating array of natural behaviors in general bears are solitary creatures large animals they require considerable amounts of food not having to share resources is a wise survival strategy [Music] an obvious exception to this is seen with mother bears caring for cubs as a group they are not territorial animals when home ranges overlap they will tolerate another bear's presence when bears are active depends on the species for example with polar bears when they are not on the prowl for food they are resting day and night are terms that don't apply to these animals of the arctic depending on the time of year they are either in total light or complete darkness in a 24 hour period polar bears will sleep for seven to eight hour stretches with additional naps conserving energy for the next hunt is a top priority if polar bears do encounter each other the smaller of the two will usually back off and leave [Music] in comparison brown bears can be active at any time but generally forage in the morning and evening spending the greater part of the day resting [Music] seasonal changes in food supplies can be highly motivating brown bears are known to travel great distances to browse plentiful berry crops regions with salmon-rich streams are also on their internal radar when food supplies are abundant these bears become more social coming together in large numbers foraging in family groups while brown bears can swim they are terrestrial beings [Music] as cubs they are capable of climbing mature brown bears don't or probably can't climb due to their bulk [Music] in contrast american black bears of any age are excellent climbers mother bears often leave their cubs in the safety of babysitter trees while they forage below giant pandas are also at home up in the branches asian black bears have a habit of making nests high in trees squashing down branches to create a leafy platform to rest in sun bears also like to lounge around in leafy tree tops [Music] bears living in cooler climates are often said to sleep through the winter to avoid extreme conditions and low food supplies while this behavior is often called hibernation this is a misconception instead these animals slow down and enter what's known as a state of torpor true hibernators drop their heart rates and body temperatures to match their environment they will not rouse despite loud noises or if they're touched in contrast an animal in torpa has a slow heart rate but their body temperature stays relatively high and should the need arise they can wake up quickly and easily bears in torpor survive by using fat reserves stored in their bodies during warmer months while dormant like this bears do not defecate their bodies recycle the waste materials she bears in torpa can however give birth [Music] bears from hotter climates have no need for this type of behavior as food supplies are plentiful year-round [Music] while bears aren't territorial they do wrestle [Music] during these play fights bears are actually communicating telling each other who's in charge size helps but a domineering attitude is what wins these debates growling adds to the show bears will fight for real if it's absolutely necessary but the risk of injury is a good deterrent why get hurt when a domineering posture can subdue a rival smart behaviors like this give bears the edge they need to survive in the wild getting the chance to see a bear right from the start of its life is rare as rare as this sun bear and her newborn in captive breeding situations baby sun bears arrive after a gestation period of three months being a vulnerable species every cub is precious here's the same cub a few weeks on with plenty of care and attention it's progressing well [Music] so is another zooborn a spectacled bear cub after exploring down on the ground this adventurous youngster is taking things to a new level [Music] as a vulnerable species many giant pandas are born as a result of captive breeding programs every effort is made to ensure these special babies have the best start in life by the time they're four months old panda cubs are able to run and climb [Music] young pandas start to chew on bamboo when they reach the six month mark [Music] up in the arctic polar bear cubs don't emerge from their warm dens until they're roughly three months old [Music] fresh air and sunshine are new experiences for these fluffy cubs polar bear milk is rich up to 36 fat the average litter size is two which means the cubs don't have much competition for food or attention brown bear cubs arrive in the winter she bears can have up to four in a litter [Music] as newborns these feisty brown bundles would have weighed half a kilo [Music] nursing on their mother's milk the cubs grow quickly by three months they average 15 kilograms mother brown bears can produce milk for two and a half years [Music] but her offspring do start to enjoy a more varied diet from five months onward mother bears alone raise their cubs by watching her they learn vital life skills such as fishing patience is the key finally fresh salmon is on the menu [Music] elsewhere some other cubs are giving themselves an aquatic workout play fighting hones their hunting and defensive skills while strengthening growing bodies [Music] brown bear cubs usually stay with their mum until their third or fourth spring by then she's ready to raise another litter [Music] young brown bears can start breeding sometime between their fourth and sixth birthdays they do however take a decade to become fully grown if they survive their first few years brown bears can live for 20 to 30 years in the wild in the wilds of india a mother sloth bear is enjoying some solitude while her cubs wrestle amongst the rocks sloth bear cubs start to explore the wider world when they're 9 to 12 weeks of age [Music] these shaggy mothers offer their babies an unusual form of transport sloth bears are the only bears that carry their young on their backs cubs cling on to an extra clump of back fur known as a saddle baby sloth bears enjoy the free ride until they're six to nine months old cubs stay with their mother until their second or third birthday learning how to survive in their habitat youngshi bears are able to start raising cubs of their own after they turn three but are often [Music] older in the wild sloth bears have a life expectancy of 20 to 30 years plenty of time to explore their fascinating part of the world every bear species has its own particular needs when it comes to habitat and diet [Music] as marine mammals polar bears depend on the ocean in particular the ice [Music] they need it to hunt from the edges of the pack ice or cracks along it are prime locations [Music] anywhere a seal might surface throughout the year they migrate across the frozen landscape following the moving ice [Music] polar bears have stamina they can travel more than 30 kilometers a day for several days [Music] diet wise polar bears are the only pure carnivores in the family their stomachs can hold about 70 kilos of meat one seal can provide a mature bear with sufficient energy to last them eight days ringed seals are their main prey other seals plus walruses sea birds fish and carrion also make up their diet for the moment this bear has an entire whale carcass to itself sometimes a polar bear will only eat an animal's blubber in their harsh environment fat has a higher value than meat as it adds to their own insulating layer [Music] after a hearty meal polar bears will groom rubbing themselves on the ice is an easy way to clean their fur these cubs have already mastered this valuable life skill [Music] in contrast brown bears have adapted to a wide range of environments they can exist in open meadows mountainous forests even harsh tundra [Music] when they require a den they can dig one out using dry vegetation for bedding [Music] unlike their polar cousins brown bears are omnivores animals that eat meat and plant material using their claws they can unearth fungi roots and insects plus small mammals from their burrows as the seasons change so does their diet for example summer is a time of berries tubers bulbs and salmon like many anglers brown bears have favorite fishing spots they will do what they can to reserve theirs to ensure others can't take advantage of it all in the timing from the end of the summer through to early autumn brown bears dramatically increase their food intake this binge eating is known as hypophagia its purpose to help the bear stack on plenty of fat reserves to see them through their dormant winter denning period while all bears are classed as carnivores giant pandas have gone against their nature they are vegetarians in the wild they live in forests with stands of lush bamboo their leafy fibrous diet is an odd choice having a digestive tract designed to break down meat makes bamboo a low quality energy source [Music] the majority of what they do eat passes through undigested which leaves them devoting roughly 14 hours a day to eating in order to gain what little benefit they can 15 kilos of bamboo is the minimum daily requirement these bears are fast eaters they can peel and devour a bamboo shoot in approximately 40 seconds when swallowing giant pandas have an especially thick esophagus to protect them from splinters traveling down to their stomachs [Music] sun bears enjoy a varied diet their keen sense of smell helping them locate ripe fruits and berries plus insects small birds rodents and lizards their 10 centimeter long claws are handy tools for ripping into old logs to expose the protein-rich buffet hiding [Music] within [Music] sun bears have especially long tongues perfect for accessing the contents of beehives this habit earning these sweet tooths the nickname honey bear as big animals bears play an equally large role in their respective environments in the arctic polar bears are considered a keystone species a creature connected to many others in their local food web the leftovers from their meals feed other bears arctic foxes and snowy owls polar bears keep seal populations in check which in turn ensures salmon numbers remain at healthy levels brown bears also act as apex predators in their ecosystems keeping balance in the food chain when hunting they weed out the sick and weak ensuring the strongest and fittest survive boosting the overall health of the animal community bears also scavenge cleaning up carcasses that would otherwise spread disease and pollute a locality with the majority of bare species being omnivores these large mammals help with seed dispersal and promote new plant growth an additional gardening duty is fertilization bears making generous deposits during their travels in a way bears are like furry custodians ensuring the health and well-being of their wild neighborhoods for countless generations bears have been making an impact on the world in the northern hemisphere they are celebrated every evening with stargazers picking out the constellations dedicated to these impressive mammals ursa major the great bear and ursa miner the little bear [Music] commodi or spirit bears are naturally eye-catching but they hold special meaning to some native american cultures who believe these rare creatures have supernatural powers depictions of bears often feature on traditional totem poles symbolizing hard work strength and great love culturally bears were regarded as teachers it is believed they taught people to collect berries and catch salmon [Music] finland and russia hold brown bears in such high regard they are their national animals symbols of pride and power in america the mighty grizzly bear roams the flag of california where it is also the state animal in western popular culture bears have long been cherished the beloved stars of countless fairy tales and children's books while the real thing can be fearsome the toy versions of these mammals are soft cuddly and friendly bringing a sense of calm and contentment with them bears are so adored some and national treasures like the giant panda in china their striking black and white fur is seen as a natural version of the famous yin yang symbol it is believed the gentle nature of pandas is proof how two opposing forces can bring peace and harmony when in balance in line with this belief giant pandas themselves are symbols of peace these distinctive creatures are also popular icons of wildlife conservation groups every aspect of pandas is special even their waste their bamboo rich deposits have been recycled into useful paper products [Music] in recent times chinese new year was extra festive thanks to the arrival of 17 giant panda cubs each precious baby an adorable sign of hope not only for pandas but the entire bear family [Music] in times past there were hundreds of their species of the eight that remain today only two are considered healthy and viable as a population one of those is the brown bear around the globe their population is estimated to be above 200 000 russia hosting half of them american black bears are the other healthy population experts believe there are between 850 and 950 000 of them remaining in the wild [Music] the rest of the bear family are classed as vulnerable bears face a range of survival challenges hunting and poaching loss of habitat to agriculture and logging and changes in weather patterns over the past 50 years there has been a major decline in sea ice directly impacting polar bears and their ability to hunt [Music] some bear species are still targeted for their bile and various body parts for use in traditional cures despite the fact they have no proven medicinal benefit hopefully awareness campaigns and protection laws will put an end to these cruel dated practices zoos and sanctuaries play vital roles in bear preservation they make these majestic animals accessible and heighten public awareness about their plights cubs are especially effective ambassadors for their relatives in the wild giant pandas are living proof that conservation programs work at one stage giant pandas were in danger but dedication and hard work have brought them back from the brink in the late 70s there were a thousand left in the wild [Music] by 2014 those numbers had risen to 1864 a small but significant rise as of 2016 they were upgraded to vulnerable status their ongoing success hinges on the continuation of conservation efforts not only on a local scale but globally and not just for giant pandas but for the future survival of all bears please [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "Ya-4a7FFy_4": "hey guys good morning so it is a Monday guess is off today for Veterans Day so we're going to head out in the boat the weather's beautiful today and that's one thing that we have noticed is it's a little bit of a challenge for us to do the Quito thing when we're out on the boat we've done it once or twice so far and it worked okay I'm still tweaking it so what I'm going to show you is definitely it'll work for you but we're gonna we need to incorporate a little more protein into it I just haven't figured out quite how to do that yet and that's just because a lot of the protein meats that we normally eat they're not really all that good cold and we don't have a grill out on our boat yet so we have to eat most of our food cold or if it's safe you know to leave it like an aluminum foil that it's sitting the Sun we can do that so I'll just show you some of the things that I put in our food bag when we get ready to go out on the boat so this is one of the snacks that we take and it's basically you can see it's just a mixture of some nuts it's um pistachios and some dry roasted peanuts and almonds and those almonds you can tell it got a little bit something on them that's the wasabi soy almonds so I just kind of mix it up make a little mix and then we share this off and on all day this is for both of us and then of course the that always go to is pork rinds so we're gonna take the pork rinds with us and these are the plain ones and then we've also found the BBQ which I checked and they don't really have it since they have some sugar but they don't have to have much at all it's just a trace amount so we'll munch on these to just try to eat these in moderation because of that flavoring but a little bit of I'm just a serving or so it's not gonna hurt you so that's our snacks and normally I will pack an avocado I don't like avocados but my husband loves them so I usually pack one of these for him and that way he can eat like half of it earlier in the day half a little later so that's great so this is one of our snacks and will munch on this a lot and it's just celery and cream cheese just the regular full-fat cream cheese so that's definitely a keto friendly snack you can see I've got quite a few in there and we can eat on those because usually we're out on the boat all day at least for like six to eight hours so you got to make sure you have plenty of extra snacks and then of course you know your fruits so these are some of the berries that are safe safe to eat and the strawberries the raspberries the blackberries I don't really care for the raspberries and blackberries but my husband loves them so that's good for him I'll eat some strawberries but again this is for both of us and we share this all day because of course the fruit remember has to be in moderation because of the carbs in it so that is that now for our protein [Music] for our protein I'll show you what we normally eat and take it out of the package here so you can see a little better are these you can paint harder to see them very well but the Johnsonville better better cheddar smoked sausages and we'll eat that is our protein so what I'll do is I will take these and heat them in the microwave they're kind of precooked you just have to cook them in the microwave for about a minute and so I'll go ahead and do that and then another go-to for us are these low-carb whole-wheat tortilla wraps and I don't know if you can see that you can see yes they have carbohydrates but then 11 grams of that is fiber so really the net the net carbs is only 5 grams in one whole tortilla so this is great to add with the protein so what I'll do is I'll take one of these and I'll take one of the hotdogs and after I cook it and heat it up and usually I'll heat up the wraps a little bit too and then put a little bit of shredded cheese normally you eat a lot of hard cheeses I got this blend and you know you just again in moderation and it's gotten 1 gram of carbs so you just want to make sure to add that into your total but this is what I use you can get any mix of flavor that you want but this is what we usually get so I'll get just a little bit you know maybe about like that sprinkle it on there and then the hotdog being hot it'll kind of melt it a little bit and then put a little bit of mustard and of course mustard keto friendly it's fine so semester down there roll them up and then I wrap them all together and aluminum fall then I'll just put those in a separate bag the bag that I put like these snacks and things in that don't have to be cold because you don't I don't want these cold they're fine to sit out for a while they're not gonna ruin or anything so I keep them in that aluminum foil and then when we get out on the boat I set that piece of aluminum foil with those in them out on the deck of the boat and try to let the Sun warm them a little bit they're already gonna be like lukewarm anyway and then the Sun will kind of warm them a little bit and then that is the bulk of our protein so and again your water make sure you take tons of water and one thing that I realize I didn't realize what I was doing we have one of those Brita pitchers and I was like oh I'm refilling it you know drinking plenty of water but I was still getting kind of dehydrated my minerals we're getting low then I realized okay that doesn't have any added minerals in it you really need to be drinking the bottled water that has the added minerals and if you can afford to do so which we buy some we don't buy a lot but when we go out on the boat we'll make sure and take a couple of these core waters with us and of course these have their you know they're for hydration they've got the balanced pH in them and the minerals and electrolytes so especially you know when you're out on the water on the ocean that salt air is just pulling water and moisture out of your body and you may not be sweating at all but it's coming out and so you've got to replace that and this is one thing that we struggle with is my husband and I both we're just get busy doing whatever fishing and we don't drink enough and I know for me it affects me even more if I get to be hydrated the next day I literally cannot move I mean my back won't move I just can't move it's painful very painful so make sure that you take plenty of water with minerals in it and the kind and I've been fine there's all kinds of different kinds but the time that I've been buying lately it's the Nestle Pure Life and you can see it says you know it has enhanced minerals and that that makes sure you're drinking plenty of water and I would say you know try to drink at least a bottle of that an hour while you're out there and course we don't do that but that's what we strive to do so you want to make sure that you're getting you know enough of your minerals and so my husband sometimes he tends to get more adequate amounts than me because he likes to avocado which has a lot of that in it I don't so it's harder for me to to get what I need so what supplement with the potassium pills and magnesium pills and yeah you can look and see the dietary requirements these each save one a day but you can take a little more of that of potassium and you can take just a little bit more magnesium but like I said look these up again we are not dietitians doctors anything like that so any of this stuff double check see what you can take especially if you have any you know medical issues or anything like that double check that and double check with your doctor and then also my husband doesn't like it he doesn't like the taste but I do and this is the Meo which they tell you that you can get that has the B vitamins and stuff and electrolytes and you can put that in your water if you get tired of just drinking plain water or you need some of those extra extra vitamins and minerals so you can put a squirt of that in your water and that helps as well so like I said we're still tweaking this I've got to figure out how to get us some more adequate protein when we are out there on the boat and so we will do an update on that and I'll let you know what more we've figured out but if you're trying to figure out how to do this and you're just getting started this can get you started to get out there and then we'll move forward as we all kind of learn more and get more educate you", "ndhDFy25P4Q": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] you",

she like always like out of the womb like your mom's just always like the default in charge she's the most type a personality i've ever met she's just on top of everything like and that's and that was her job like this her whole career is in like yeah she worked like retail so she would do all these like big floor moves in inventory and have to um she didn't usually work with customers uh which she loved because that just meant she had a team and she got to like tell people what to do and and you know how to make stuff pretty um ah hi josh um and uh and yeah so and she's missing you know she hasn't been to work you know because yeah pandemic um so she's like every now and then she'll be like i have to fix something today she's like i just have to i just have to reorganize something today like does she ever floor plan the house do you get is there a plan for your pantry if there's a plane for your pantry i now love your mother there's not but it's because she's a very short lady and she can't reach the higher shelves that would be so next level if it's like for top like the items for taller people are like that would be i don't even know how to um okay lazy susan yes or no steven foo lazy susan yes or no i i love it and like inside the pantry yes oh inside a restaurant oh is it a pantry no oh it depends on how big and what you have on there i'm not i don't have a big enough pantry so i've never used one okay daddy i would i would say yes my only concern is that it takes up so much of your real estate and you lose the corners yes and then you don't have a way to like reach over or around you know to the to the other corners without knocking stuff over well so they're okay they're usually only used in the corner and because because the corner is so problematic right they lazy susan right we've been so i'm thinking of my own pantry like in the other room it was just flat against you know in the wall i'm like that's so you know no no need if it's we're we um my parents my mom almost died in december uh and so i was like okay like i don't know how much time my parents like mortality became very real um and i've been telling my mom since i can remember so i don't know six seven eight years old and i'm 41 now so it's been three decades of telling my mom she's gonna come live with me so i was like you're doing this you're not you're gonna leave the hospital and go to iowa you're not gonna go back you're gonna just and so we've been designing a space from scratch from the ground up for my parents to live in um and i just that in that and you're butting heads over the idea of a lazy susan she's just so she's just so against the idea of lazy susan that it's tearing your family apart is that where we're headed he's okay but hateful i found out because it's really like my mom will throw an opinion or two out there and then be like you two do whatever you want to so then then i find out things about rachel i didn't know like late like i was she's she like wants to burn every lazy susan in fact when she's designing the downstairs interesting she was like no lazy and i was like where where did this hatred of lazy we've had one our whole marriage we've had a cabinet why has we've been married 20 years and i just jealousy jealousy who is this susan who is stupid what is your obsession with her i work so much harder than this oh man i love it okay stephen when you go hiking in l.a does that episode ever come to your mind you tell me although that's me but i do find myself like a lot of times motivating myself just like i'm gonna like run all the way to the top you know because the first time i ever did it uh there was this um it's i forget what the trail is called but it's so steep and i was like slowly climbing up i was like man how do people do this and this old couple this old asian couple just like passed me by i was like what's happening like i don't know what i'm doing wrong and then going down two people are just like jumping like goats mountain goats down incline i was like i don't know what i'm doing but i've gotten slowly better i was like this is pretty fun i understand it now i do i always think i always think of that that freaking hiking episode of dumbbells if i'm walking up hill because they talk about like step down with your flat foot like you're climbing instead of trying to walk heel toe and i'm like i just i always think about that i'm like i never knew this before like that helps a lot that helps it's educational okay so that's because my kids it feels like whatever i'm like preparing i watch the whole series and then i i'll hear my kids like like oh what's dad dad's watching this this weekend and um my son was like really got into that he's like i'm gonna do i need to i need to be faster so i'm going to do the tips in this episode on being faster oh that's so good the the iliopsoa kind of daughter my oldest daughter um the first time we watched it through when i fell in love she was waiting until we all left and then doing the workouts after at the end of every episode oh my god that's so cool i love hearing about that so much like it's so yeah it's motivating steven what was your experience when this so who pitched it to you i don't i have to look up who directed it and what was your experience when you jumped in there and saw that it was so much more than just a goofy story uh uh let's see jade jade was the director fantastic person wonderful lovely jay saxton okay um yeah she uh she cast me and she i just got a text from one day she's like you know what uh you want to play this character i was like oh sure i had no idea what it was and then i looked it up i was like what in the world is this show what am i getting myself into but then i watched like the first two episodes i was like i like this show like it's really cool it's not like you know surface level is like very sandband service and all that stuff but like deep in if you like watch it watch it it's really educational and you know it doesn't get everything correct i've i've gotten texts from my friend jeff's like it's like you got they got all this these terminologies wrong but like you know the heart of it it's in a right it's in the right place you know it wants to help people like motivate people to work out and things like that and make it very easy for for people to to get into it you know because working out is kind of hard and uh it's it's it's a barrier to kind of overcome it's like a mental barrier that you have to overcome to get motivated to do it and like the easier it is i think the better fantastic all right maddie what was your experience uh with dumbbells the exact opposite of stevens i knew everything about it from the get-go that's awesome so it was um it was announced um as like hey this is coming out this summer and i saw it i saw the key art for it like the first poster and i went oh my god i'm in love with it it's like it's a bunch of cute anime girls that work out i love it and i looked it up and i read about it and i did the thing that you're never supposed to do which is i wanted it um got it and i yeah and i i even uh i told my boyfriend at the time i told uh i told a friend of mine like we're just talking about like hey this show's coming up because you know we don't have hobbies we all need to get a hobby but it's like all we do is talk about work so we were talking about like the next shows coming up and i was like man i would really love to be in this show and it was it wasn't even like a it wasn't even uh like hey put in a good word for me it was just god this looks so good and so cute i god i would love to do this and even looking at the art i was like my stupid-sounding voice doesn't fit i like i don't think this fits any of these cute girls on the art and i'm like like i won't be in it it's fine it's like it's fine it's whatever and then i got a text from jade that said hey would you come by hibiki for me and i was in a car i was in like i was like leaving a rehearsal or something and i got in the car and checked my phone and i screamed and i was like [ __ ] just destroying everything um also and you could not have been better a better person to play i love her so much he's fantastic the most real anime characters like she knows where she falls short she's okay like the very last episode was such a heartwarming um yeah go ahead just like yeah just that very last shot of the show because so much of so much of the show is is her struggling to make progress and struggling to to motivate you know herself and that's something that's something else that i really like about this show is that it's all very respectful and very healthy and like the the impetus for the entire show was her best friend making a fat joke and being like well you're never gonna get a boyfriend and that was the last time that kind of thing ever happened and from then on out it was i want to be hot i want to be fit i want to do this i want to be healthy i want to do this for me and also i really like food um and i and i love that and there is so much genuine joy and respect in the way that the show was set up that you know like you had fun watching her struggle because that's relatable and then the very last shot of the show where she weighs herself in and she she likes whatever she sees and she know you know like she got to watch herself achieve a goal that she set for herself and that she was the only one who could have worked towards that and you know like there wasn't some big anime you know deus ex machina you know some fantasy god came down and granted her magic powers or whatever it was just i worked hard to do the thing and i did the thing yeah the the competition where they they uh you know the last episode is um how heavy are those um bells but uh oh my gosh how heavy are those what is the bench press called barbells how heavy are those barbells is that the last episode it's called how heavy are those barbells uh and they have that competition and she's like oh i'm supposed to i need to compete against him and she's worked so hard and it's gonna be the first time that we can compete on a level playing field this is so it's she's like she gets attention he looks over and he's like i didn't eat enough and then he's like crying he had this one chance and he was like nah he won fair and square that's the real me out there i guess and she was like and i'm okay i'm okay that i lost to you i like you said she did the thing she worked really hard and then got to the end and that that that less that healthy lesson of like it's okay to blow it you're it's gonna happen yeah yeah yeah for sure and you know like i think there's there's there's that mental health lesson in there too of like recovery is not linear like nothing is nothing is linear um yeah that's their own pace it's like it's it's awesome it's it's the show it's really it's got it's great it's one of my it's one of my favorite projects i've ever ever gotten to work on yeah 100 all right stephen what when that when he when he flexes for the first time and everything flies off did you know that he was coming or was that like in the booth as you're recording that line i i because i watched i like peeked at the episode oh my god you have you have the oh my god that is awesome it's very big on me that is amazing it's it's because it's so you can like place it in the game it doesn't rip it was it was amazing though the first time i saw i was like oh my god this tiny little man unassuming man he's like it was so great i it's one of my favorite memories to see like because i was like i get to do that like in the booth you got to make those weird noises um did you do any prep as far as the like you know the episode ends and then they then they teach you about fitness did you like did you do anything to prepare for that did you treat that any differently than you did recording the episode so prior uh i guess i i kind of like dabbled in working out for a bit um i used to like i wanted way back before i joined like voiceover got into voiceover i was like wanting to like improve myself uh with like you know working out things like that i like did those like p90x i like dabbled in that i was like ah that's interesting and then i started and then read it i got on a reddit and then there's our fitness and then they have like all these different like workout routines that for like beginners and stuff like that i did like five by five for a while and then i went to five three one uh was it grace goal lp something like that anyways so i had a little bit of a background with like working out and things like that but um aside from that not too much i was kind of learning along as i was recording i was like oh cool this is really interesting that's weird for me to hear because the last time i saw you i swear to god like you were ripped as hell you could break things in half have either of you done um uh t25 i have no idea what that is [Laughter] so i i love shaun t i have no problem at all admitting that i'm in love with shaun t he is world world renowned uh fitness guy let's see share anybody who has any exposure to beachbody has heard of shaun t and whose grantee is um i was at a point in my life when we lived in north dakota that i only had 25 minutes i'm not p90 i was like 90 minutes i don't know interesting well and then as if shanti heard me out loud to say i i'm not doing p90x too much time commitment they came out with this t25 it's just 25 minutes a day and they have alpha and beta and gamma and the workouts increased as you uh become less sucky uh and you can they have a modifier her name's i love taunt you can tell i'm like super into t25 but the modifier is the person who does what shaun t is doing but realistically but for a normal job yeah yeah yeah right and so uh i just i had this friend of mine who was a beachbody training coach and i was like all right man give me the real scoop is this worth my time and several of my kids have gone through t25 with me um we even found it the other day when we moved to iowa and we unpacked and we're like let's let's put it back in and it it holds up we started all the way back over doing t25 again like it's it's really spectacular um for any i highly recommend it for anybody that wants to like seriously get into and it's such a reasonable time commitment yeah so that's been that's been my problem is i fell off of when we when we first started doing dumbbells i just started working with a personal trainer and that stopped happening for a while um and i i started to try to get back into it and like when when the pandemic shut everything down i bought ring fit adventure for the switch and i was like i'm gonna make myself play this game and i played a lot of it for several months okay and then i started picking up extra work okay and i was like i have to spend all my time doing all of this extra work like i gotta focus on this and then the extra work didn't stop and so we got four five six seven weeks away from me regularly exercising and i was like i don't know if i get back into this and now i'm a big old you know couch potato i have the musculature of an al dente noodle um i can't get out of bed without giving myself a charlie horse like i am i cannot stress enough i'm the least fit person uh on the planet um i'm chronically dehydrated it's bad it's bad i'm like the pen i've been trying to like convince myself to just just get up in the morning and just stretch for five minutes like do some do some lunges it's hard when you're busy you know it's because it work takes a lot out of you uh i had no idea because i res after i moved uh i was like i had a bunch of free time but i still didn't work out this lazy um gyms are closed uh but um and then i started getting i took on more work as like maddie has and to kind of fill my time and then i just got more and more busy and as that went on i just lost a ton of motivation to do anything after work and like all i want to do is just veg out and as you can see i've become a potato and uh it was i mean i've actually this week i was like all right you know what i'm gonna like i'm gonna do 50 push-ups 50 squats 50 like as many pull-ups as i can do and like i started doing that and the next day i was sore i was like oh man i haven't felt like this in a while it feels pretty good like keep doing it you know it's it's uh yeah making the time is the hardest thing i think i do want to get back on top of it that's that's my recommendation then is let me see share here's my here's my favorite part you guys please yes please yes please counter on the screen the whole time so you don't even have like you don't even have to hide the fact that all you want to do is get to get to zero and stop like it's so realistic there's ton there's tanya in the in the gray she's your modifier she's always to the right of shaun t um and it's i'm the music is good like john he is a beautiful i human believe you can do it he's there for you the whole time like that's awesome and maddie there's a stretch video there's a whole t25 that's just stretched i'm terrified of what's gonna happen because i used to do you know what there's the episode of dumbbells where they did like they talked about dynamic stretches yeah and i was like oh i should incorporate this and that's what i started doing at rehearsals and performances when i was doing theater and i realized i hadn't done that in a while and i'm like i should get back into that because i'm gonna be i'm you know okay yeah you know those little toys that that we had when we were kids that were like the little puppets on a stand that falls with the string through them yeah you push the bottom and it collapses that's me no no same yeah we're the best shaped potatoes i've ever seen just so you guys know you know than youtube i hide it well yeah well you didn't you didn't see the four days this week where i didn't get out of my pajamas like you get out of here well today i did for you oh i live for you and for stephen i have my he's on right now like i don't believe in fact as soon as october hits i wear pajama pants every single day from october to april or may i did buy a whole bunch of new pajama pants like over the the last year when it's cold you just put your other pants over your pajama pants you never have your pajamas like that's the trick that's how we can live in iowa and north dakota and montana yeah [Laughter] i put it i tried to have the outer layer jeans just so it gives us the facade that i pressed myself today it's i so i have the uh the athletic uh you know the my my f but i'm telling you you're you're at leisure batman my batman and robin pajama pants are right underneath so nice yeah nice i have no fear i resp i respect that thank you i don't even know where i i learned i just getting dressed and undressed in the cold my problem i mean it sucks which you know i just texas just got hit by that ice storm a couple weeks ago and i was we were that power at my house for uh two solid days and then on and off for another day after that um so i hear ya i'm not used to that but also my problem is that all of my jeans are skinny jeans because i'm a mario so rachel will go leggings instead of pajama pants she'll go leggings and then other pair of pants i did i did like uh sweater tights like the really thick knit sweater tights and then my jeans and then some like big socks nice and then yeah yeah i'm a snob on my socks do you who's who sleeps in socks i can't i'm not yeah i can't either it's it feels good and like i have bad circulation but like i don't know i feel i feel trapped well i i'm like 40 degrees or 50 degrees in my bedroom and then i like to sleep in my socks i was about to say if it gets that cold though that's yeah i find that when i when i don't have my socks on i feel like i'm swimming like in my bed i'm like see i love that oh yeah i love that feeling like clean like oh yeah that and clean sheets just after a shower you just hop into bed we're gonna we're gonna finish this panel and i'm gonna go wash my sheets yeah i'm gonna put clean sheets on my bed because that sounds nice just go straight for the gratification yeah dude yeah yeah come on oh man that's so funny uh steven do you ever roll with bill butts out there in in la unfortunately haven't uh due to this current situation but prior to this when i've met him a few times uh there was the first time i met him he was like stephen fu he's such a nice guy and he's like i love he's like i love dumbbells so much i was like whoa man like when he found out that i did it he's like like his face completely like lit up and it was it was amazing and uh that night he ended up he's like let me curl you like me so i was like let's do it this guy's this guy's a beast i was like all right there you go i like i got it and then he i just lied laying into his arms and then he just started curling me and i was like this is crazy there's like a bunch of people around and stuff like wow when was this this was like last maybe two two decembers ago oh my god yeah yeah yeah this one it is i mean i'll never forget that i will never forget that i would have loved to have seen that there's a video somewhere i'll see if i could post is there really oh please yes yeah it might be on on bill's instagram from ages i'll i have to go find it please see if i can find it myself too and then what when the anime expo comes back stephen i'm gonna have you and bill we they they give us the opportunity to host people for autograph signings i would love to get you all down there for redundance like exercise and in anime and then yeah the fact that they even thought about attempting like kudos to them for trying to think their way through like what it might look like this year but it's like it's even with the entire like two city blocks like i i was rachel and i and autumn were talking i was like can you imagine guys the line six feet apart six feet apart for a hundred thousand people ready to like for the line to go to the anime expo if you were six feet apart yeah yeah uh so with any luck their their like thought process for this year will result in not taking an hour it's a good hour to get in if you're not on the vendor side it's it's legitimately an hour plus into anime expo my understanding is that's how it is when there's not a pandemic that's what i'm saying oh yeah yeah i like i i just hope that's the one thing that if i could man if i could get them to do anything different it would be like autumn had a great idea to think of like you can buy which time you go like if you want to get in the very beginning your ticket would be like 100 bucks more and then if you want to get it because let's face it you're not getting in for like an hour you know the dallas arboretum does that oh really yeah like when you when you like an hour and a half two hours or whatever to walk through the arboretum and that's how they like keep their flow down i think this i think the zoo might be doing that too like why not yeah they could come up with something to do that's like they have that whole open area outside they should totally add programming outside yes if you have to do it do it outside do it outside yeah we just solved the anime line problem matty your genius it depends on the weather though when is anime expo usually july july 4th weekend could be pretty pretty warm maybe maybe especially with cosplay with cosplay in the city yeah it's gonna all that freaking concrete but maybe we could do misters misters outside that's like a california light they could bring in some mr station have you ever been at an outdoor restaurant with misters or like like six flags like they could just like summer just like a little mister in front of a fan just yeah they just move anime expo to november yo just move it yes what's happening in november i mean aside from thanksgiving thanksgiving nobody goes to that that's like not anymore not anymore uh rhode island comic-con is the only thing i can think of off the top of my head for sure that's that's november i would love i thought you were gonna say that is thanksgiving weekend and i was like what no i don't i don't there is there's there's one or two shows that are thanksgiving weekend but that just seems like a scary that's a scary ask to me like to ask show up that like i would be so scared that nobody would go to that there's a there's a convention in austin that is new years well that's totally yeah which is cool i went once sac anime is um new year's that's a great so yeah a new year's a new year's convention would be yeah would be a rad convention i can't imagine can you imagine can you imagine freaking going to a convention on christmas weekend they're like for christmas i think there's there's one i think there's one um i bet there is yeah oh man oh messy thank you do it again oh my god i'm trying to drink my this is um i i love ginger beer i'm trying to like uh ginger is very good for you so i'm trying to get um my my craft soda with a bite this is what the what the label in the jar so um and then i have uh i i do an entire blender thing for my smoothie and then i'll drink i don't know what is that 60 100 ounces i don't know it's a pretty big smoothie that's so much you're taking such good care of yourself like i have like i have one topo chico that i've had for three hours now oh it's so good so good i told rachel i would i would give her a husband with abs like seven years ago and i'm i'm still where hibiki is man yeah did you say when yeah yeah thank heavens i didn't i didn't i didn't have a date it's so hard there's uh there's so much sugar in fruit yeah when you put it in your smoothie you you have to be careful like that's where the taste is gonna come from but it's also where all of the sugar is gonna come from you know yeah yeah yeah that's what that's what that was that was just sure it's just sure it's just it's just pure sugar let's be honest i put protein in my smoothie it's pure sugar it's delicious do you you have a powder that you use uh yeah my dad's got some giant tub of protein powder i don't know it's almost it's almost empty i don't even know what it is i i mentioned something about it on on twitter once and uh uh jeff becentes he's an an engineer out in la um uh he was like he like dm'd me and he was like what brand do you use he's like let's talk i have a favorite i'll send you a coupon that's awesome i love i love him he rocks and is another human being who could in fact break me in half uh yes dude i have i've had the the opportunity to work out with him and let me tell you that guy can move some weight i'm like oh no i can't do that i'll they'll kill me you post these videos sometimes and i'm like a human person be able to do that like yeah are you getting are you getting your superpower from our yellow sun like what is happening so they're so you stephen do you have one that you use as far as the protein goes nope i my diet is very bad very very bad i don't i uh i don't like i just eat what tastes good to me never i've never done like protein powders or anything like that because i i don't know i definitely don't i just don't eat enough protein so i like the i like having the powder around just like i just drink a glass put this of milk it uh this is one that i uh rachel was kind of like you maddie it's like whatever was in the kitchen she would just be like oh protein powder bread that'll work for bread he'll deal with it um so then i finally was like all right that's it i'm running out i'm gonna actually intentionally choose i've really been happy with this super greens um i like the chocolate um i i've tried some like unflavored ones or some vanilla ones but this is a really good one i don't know how i'm texting this to myself screencraft yeah yeah there you go okay i can text i'll just take a picture of the screen and text then you'll have it hell yeah it does taste good um i really like it and if it has everything that it claims to have in it you know the wheatgrass the spirulina then it has amazing things in it i there was so i used to work my my day job used to be at uh a local theater um like a live theater and uh i spent about a year and a half with them um half of it was like stage management stuff half it was like building sets but all of it was very intense hyper focused like most of the time and you know if you're doing if you're doing live theater and you're around people and you're up and moving that much and around people you can't get sick um and there was a uh there's a smoothie shop right around the corner that i would frequent um and they did wheat grass shots yep um and at one point we had like we had a big opening night party and normally like if you had to work the opening night party like you were off the next day and i don't or maybe or maybe it was just a we went out on saturday night and had to be back for the sunday matinee i don't know i got drunk one night and then had to be back in the morning oh that's the conceit of this story and i was fine you know but i was like i can do my job today like i'm good i just don't want to and my my boss at the time was like come with me and you'll be and so we like walked around to the smoothie place um and i was like yeah i could use a smoothie and he goes you're gonna drink a wheatgrass shot and i went do i have to and he said yes and i said okay it tasted like lawn clippings yeah grass like i don't yeah like i don't know what else i expected i'm like i could have just like pulled up a handful of grass from the median and just chewed on it and it would have had the same effect um but it like that became that became my thing i was like it's gross but i would go get like a very like citrusy like you know immune boost like extra supplements whatever and also give me a wheatgrass shot yeah because that was citrus and i don't know i mean there's there's i'm sure there's a component of that like i don't know if it did as much as i think it did so immediately i think there's a placebo component to that but i it was worth it was worth paying for i was just like this is going to change my whole day and then it did and i'm like great that's awesome man i yeah i i have the hippie thing where i just love eating things like just the taste of food the just the experience of eating food it's just i just love it so much that like that's why i don't do like protein shakes because like i'd rather eat like put something in my chew on and eat it yeah yeah it's bad it's terrible it's there it's milk's control like eating food takes so much time it does it does yeah yeah yeah and when you do it healthy man you could easily be in the kitchen for an hour per meal if you're trying to be healthy yeah yeah yeah it's i mean it's a real time commitment and i think that was the hardest my my smoothie got man it's it's got to be 30 minutes to put in all of the ingredients it's like ginger i'm i'm i'm squeezing a lot i have a citrus press i'm like squeezing a hole wow every single day there's avocado there's flaxseed chia seed peanut butter flaxseed in my smoothie why didn't i do that i have some in it uh peanut butter yogurt see my probiotics apple cider vinegar lemon honey ginger yeah local honey is good for the immune system it is it is it is yeah okay what i do like this i normally we don't take questions but i love what's what's your favorite pandemic meal cinnamon toast crunch is it really that's hilarious did you eat it before oh okay it's the most common pandemic meal i'll put it that way is it really okay uh i love cereal i can't like that's gonna be the hardest thing like when my body starts to deteriorate and my doctor says you have to change your diet or you'll die the hardest thing that i'm going to do is stop eating cereal i would like i can't do it um yeah cereal is hard ah let's see for me boy uh god what happened i make a lot of chocolates tacos are i was gonna say like spaghetti because it's just so easy to do like spaghetti and baked you bake it with some cheese on top and it's like delicious that's yeah that's right that's all it takes man and you just eat some broccoli i'll put some broccoli some broccoli and put it on the side okay maddie i'm gonna i'm gonna make a cereal suggest don't you give me your health some yeah wait for you cereals i want sugar coating i want my fruit loops my marshmallows but this cereal is has become the favorite in my family um my dad and i unbeknownst to each other this is our favorite cereal my if i if you don't watch my dad he you will find him all day long sneaking into and just digging his hand into the box and wow guys it tastes so good it's weird there's these like like quaker oats like cinnamon square cereal that's like a very similar thing and that's like there are days where i'll just like go by and just grab a handful of those and be like this is better for me than some things something in my pantry is worse than this i'm okay yeah i could be making a worse choice today and i'm not well if you get a chance to now the key to this cereal is uh because it tastes so good and is also healthy it's hard to find my mom called kashi and was like why can't i get my husband this freaking cereal i'm sorry man there's distribution issues with this cereal so when i when i drive across the country i will raid stores and buy ten full boxes and then we stockpile there's been a great nut shortage is there really there's a grape nuts shortage right now we have trouble getting grape nuts okay what yeah okay i'm not sure why i don't like i don't know if it's like a like the world war the war effort in the 1940s needed the elastics so we couldn't buy nylons for all women you know i don't know if it's like the pandemic needs wheat we tweets and grape nuts for a man on the front line i want to see you do a fallout commercial now like you need to be in any hallow games maddie holy nailed that man that's a voice i don't get to use not an anime not an enemy oh but it could be like is there any modern war i almost feel like the latest season of attack on titan i feel like they really jumped times the thing the thing about that accent though is that it doesn't exist naturally it's a fake accent that was created for film right and so like it's such a time capsule yeah like there's a very limited like time frame that that is appropriate um man i want to say it's a perfect fallout like that's the time period that's the i can see it all right my laptop's gonna die one sec oh you're good i can fix this we have the technology so you can get these your go-to pandemic huh your spaghetti is your go-to pandemic i you know honestly i think it's been so varied uh but one of my favorite and easiest things to eat is uh a grilled cheese with soup like a tomato soup i like put mayo on the outside of the gr of this of the bread and then i toast it and then i slower shredded cheese and like another melts and then i just flip it over with some more mayonnaise and then i sprinkle some garlic salt over it and it's just it's perfect yeah when you bite into it's like crunchy it's so happy it's it's the worst thing probably you could eat but it's so delicious and you dip it in that soup some pickle you can eat some pickles with it it's great for add tomato to your grilled cheese really yeah i made a best grilled cheese i ever made had had fresh basil and and tomato yeah that's great if you ever want to mix it up stephen just one side of the inside do pesto on the inside yeah if you want to get real nasty and drop a fried egg in it oh yeah that sounds amazing stephen when i when you were still in texas did you ever go to the dallas grilled cheese company i had what what is this place it is a grilled cheese only restaurant um and they've got it's so good uh they also have they also have like fancy cocktails and stuff so like i anytime i anytime i had a friend in town i was like we're going here it's like this is this is for you but it's secretly for me um but there was a then they would do like a rotating like special like sandwich and there was one that was like a balsamic vinaigrette like it was like mozzarella and and basil and balsamic vinegar it was the best sandwich i've ever had in my entire life oh my god it was so amazing even i got you this is the melt out of the air oh they have a place to go i have your back i didn't want you to feel like you missed the boat so whoa oh my gosh i will have to visit this place here what else pin it on my maps [Laughter] maybe i'll be going here after this i don't know word workout health health panel we've had right i'm sorry about this to derailing you no it's completely derailed a half of half of dumbbells is about food it is yeah it's true it's true or better or worse yeah yeah yeah oh it's so good um okay favorite thing to drink during the pandemic just water i only have water at home so i

Snack Smarter\nWhen the afternoon slump hits, it can be tempting to reach for the candy jar or swing by the\nvending machine, but junk food\u2019s quick sugar rush will disappear in minutes, leaving you\ngroggier than ever. Instead, it\u2019s time to feed your 3 p.m. munchies\nmore wisely. \u201cSnacking is often mindless, autopilot eating,\u201d\nwarns Gregory L. Jantz, PhD, an eating disorder specialist in Edmonds, Washington. \u201cOften, snacks aren\u2019t eaten because you\u2019re\nhungry, but because you are bored or are simply used to munching while you engage in certain\nactivities.\u201d A better way to snack, says Jantz, is to optimize\nthe timing of healthy snacks between your meals. \u201cSmaller meals and intentional small snacks\nhelp you regulate your blood sugar throughout the day, avoiding large \u2018feast or famine\u2019\nswings,\u201d he says. These 20 options with fewer than 100 calories\nwill help you do exactly that, guilt- and weight-gain free. 2. A Cup of Blueberries\nFew snacking choices pack the antioxidant and nutrition punch of blueberries, and with\nonly 83 calories per 1-cup serving, they are about as diet friendly as you can get. \u201cKeep them a little frozen and you\u2019ve\ngot a crunchy, sweet treat,\u201d says Jantz. 3. A Hard-Boiled Egg\nBoil up a batch of eggs, put them in the fridge, and you\u2019ve got an instant snack that packs\n6 grams of protein into just 78 calories. Jantz recommends a high-protein snack such\nas eggs for a midmorning or afternoon nosh \u2014 the protein will keep you full and may\nhelp prevent overeating later. 4. An Orange\nSometimes, the simpler the snack, the better. Oranges, which have about 60 calories each,\nare one of the best fruits to snack on because they\u2019re high in vitamins and fiber, and\nlow in natural sugar. Plus, the fact that you have to take time\nto peel and section oranges will help you savor your snack slowly. 5. A Cup of Strawberries\nWith just 46 calories per 1-cup serving, you can enjoy 2 cups of strawberries and still\nhave calories to spare. \u201cThey\u2019re a great, juicy snack whenever\nin season,\u201d Jantz says. \u201cAnd frozen strawberries can be just as\nhealthy the rest of the year.\u201d 6. A Piece of String Cheese\nOne stick of part-skim string cheese has 80 calories and a whopping 8 grams of protein,\nplus a dose of calcium without the high saturated fat content of other cheese varieties. String cheese is a convenient, portable snack\nwhen you\u2019re on the go, and it\u2019s perfectly portion-controlled, taking the guesswork out\nof snack time! 7. 1/2 Cup of Oatmeal\nWhen the afternoon slump rolls around, toss some oats into the microwave. A 1/2-cup serving of oatmeal cooked in water\ncontains just 83 calories. Finish with a sprinkle of cinnamon, which\nhelps keep blood-sugar levels stable. With a dose of fiber and protein, the warm\nsnack is sure to satisfy and hold you over until dinnertime. 8. A Handful of Almonds\nNuts are chock-full of protein and healthy monounsaturated fats, making them a smart\nsnack choice. Plus, a recent January 2015 study in the Journal\nof the American Heart Association found that consuming almonds in place of carbs (like\nbread or muffins) reduced cholesterol and belly fat, boosting heart health. So instead of reaching for that bag of pretzels\nfor an energy boost, grab a small handful of almonds (10-15 nuts) to power you through\nthe afternoon. 9. 1/4 Cup of Dried Cranberries\nDried fruit \u2014 with its high amounts of added sugar \u2014 can be a diet disaster. But if you keep your portion to a waistline-friendly\nquarter cup, this tangy treat can be a smart way to quiet a sweet tooth. A quarter cup of dried cranberries contains\njust 93 calories, and you can look for unsweetened varieties to keep sugar levels under control. 10. 8 Baby Carrots With 1 Tablespoon of Dip\nEight raw baby carrots have just 40 calories, leaving you room for a tablespoon of your\nfavorite dip like hummus, tzatziki, or salsa. The crunchy texture can help battle chip cravings,\nwhile the dose of fiber satisfies hunger \u2014 plus the high levels of carotenoids and other forms\nof vitamin A in carrots can boost your eyesight. 11. 1 Slice of Raisin Bread\nFor a healthy morning snack that tastes like a decadent breakfast treat, try a piece of\nEzekiel sprouted cinnamon raisin bread. At 80 calories a slice, you can go ahead and\ntop this with a tiny dab of light butter spread, says Chrissy Barth, RDN, a dietitian in Scottsdale,\nArizona. 12. 1 Cup of Cheerios\nThis classic children\u2019s snack can work for adults, too, Jantz says. In fact, you can enjoy an entire cup of crunchy\nCheerios for a healthy snack that\u2019s just 100 calories. To make the whole-grain goodness last, take\na cue from kids, and eat them one by one. 13. Berry Smoothie\nDrinking a smoothies is a great way to quell hunger cravings, satisfy a sweet tooth, and\npack in produce. Load up on low-calorie berries and add a touch\nof honey for sweetness like we do in this Berry-Banana Smoothie recipe. Use just half of a banana to keep the calorie\ncount under 100 without losing the creamy texture. 14. 1 Cup of Fresh Melon\nMixing different types of melons gives your taste buds a flavor burst filled with nutrition,\nwhile making your snack feel more substantial. \u201cIt\u2019s colorful, and when served cold,\nit satisfies any sweet tooth,\u201d says Janet Colson, PhD, RD, a professor of nutrition\nat Middle Tennessee State University. Melons typically have between 45-and 60 calories\nper cup; go for a mix of watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew, and enjoy 2 cups for a satisfying\nsnack. 15. 20 Pistachios\nYou can eat 20 pistachios and still clock in at just 80 calories. \u201cPistachios are a good source of unsaturated\nfat and antioxidants,\u201d says Jessica Levinson, RD, a dietitian in private practice in New\nYork. \u201cThey\u2019re also what I call a \u2018slow food,\u2019\nbecause they take time to open up and eat, which means you can\u2019t eat too quickly!\u201d 16. 3 Cups of Air-Popped Popcorn\nAt just 30 calories per cup, air-popped popcorn is the perfect food to reach for when the\nurge to head to the vending machine hits. By using an air popper, you get the fiber\nboost without excess fats and other additives. Enjoy 3 cups for under 100 calories and \u201ceat\nit one kernel at a time to make it last longer,\u201d Colson suggests. 17. Cut Vegetables and 2 Tablespoons of Low-Fat\nRanch Dressing Chopped broccoli (31 calories per cup), celery\n(10 calories per large stalk), and sliced bell peppers (30 calories per cup), are simple-yet-crunchy\nsnacks you can enjoy in abundance while adding minimal calories to your daily total.

Alan Dershowitz will be joining us to talk about the nuclear agreement with Iran and what it means to the United States Israel and greater instability in the Middle East but before mr. Dershowitz joins us as is my custom each week let me tell you a little about his background Alan Morton Dershowitz was born in williamsburg brooklyn and is a graduate of brooklyn college and yale law school after being admitted to the bar he clerked for US Court of Appeals judge for the district of columbia david Bazelon and Supreme Court Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg in 1964 Dershowitz joined the faculty of Harvard Law School and in three short years he became the youngest full professor in the school's history while Dershowitz may be known for his high-profile criminal cases such as waging the defenses for Claus von Bulow patricia hearst mike tyson jim baker leona helmsley oj simpson and michael milken he is also in arguably one of our country's most knowledgeable scholars when it comes to constitutional law and foreign policy in addition to being a prolific author mr. Dershowitz has been the recipient of numerous awards including the William O Douglas First Amendment award the Soviet Jewry freedom award the monacan beggin award of honor the Guggenheim Fellowship Award and countless others Dershowitz his achievements would take up much of today's program so at the risk of doing a legal legend a great injustice let me just welcome back to the cost of report miss alan dershowitz thank you for joining us mr. Dershowitz Thank You injustice my god you certainly gave me a lot of praise and background I didn't even recognize myself as a kid from Brooklyn who almost flunked out of high school but once I got to college in law school I did well well i would say dead well is the understatement of the year first let me congratulate you on your new book the case against the Iran deal now in this book you walk us through the administration's negotiations with Iran which you feel have led to a choice between I think I believe you use the words bad and worse so I thought maybe we could just start there is it the negotiations which have led to this tough choice or the fact that in spite of economic sanctions Iran has persisted in its enrichment programs now I think it's the negotiations I think in the beginning of his presidency President Obama kept the military option on the table he essentially said to around look you're never going to develop nuclear weapons we won't let you we will stop you from doing it if you try we have red lines and if you cross them there will be consequences but then after he was reelected and particularly after the midterms when the negotiations really got underway president took the military option off the table and according to Tom Friedman who actually supports the deal the president allowed the Iranians to negotiate with us as equals and we ended up playing checkers with the people who invented chess the Persians and I'm afraid that their ayatollahs checkmated our president and produced the situation where the option was accepting a bad deal which allows Iran to develop nuclear weapons after about 10 years and allows us cheat and hide their cheating for 24 days so either accept that be a deal or as the president said rejected and maybe things would be even worse because the sanction regime would be over the military options off the table and Iran might move even more quickly to develop nuclear weapons that's not the kind of choice that a great leader would present his people well recently President Obama has gone so far as to say it's the agreement or war well I don't think so it may be you know that they said that too Winston Churchill back in 1938 when Chamberlain went and negotiated he said it's either diplomacy giving up Czechoslovakia or war and Churchill responded by saying you've lost our honor to prevent us from going to war and now you will have both the loss of honor and the war and he was right and I think this deal actually makes it more likely that there will be a war because you cannot expect Israel which has been threatened repeatedly with complete destruction by Iran to sit back and allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons remember that the former president of iran roughs and johnny was supposed to be a moderate once said that if Iran develops a nuclear weapon and drops it on television Israelis an end Israel because Israel is one bomb State one bomb will end it then Israel will retaliate and will kill 15 to 20 million Muslims in Tehran but he said the trade-off would be worth it when you have an apocalyptic leader like that threatening the destruction of the Jewish people once again Prime Minister Netanyahu's or his successors are not going to stand idly by and allow that to happen so I think this deal actually makes war more likely rather than less likely now many opponents of the current agreement say that the fact that the Iranians came to the negotiating table proves that these economic sanctions were working do you agree with that i do i think the economic sanctions coupled with the threat of military action really led them to conclude as follows look we're never going to get nuclear weapons the Americans are not going to let us do it the Israelis are not going to let us do it so why should we have to suffer under these crippling sanctions let's come to the negotiating table then they get to the negotiating table they're essentially told there's nothing you have to worry about there's no military option so now you have a chance to get a better deal and they required President Obama across several of his own red lines the president said that he would never accept the deal unless there were 24 7 immediate inspection we now learn that there's 24 days before we get to inspect certain places and that the Iranians themselves will participate in these inspections and we don't even know what other side deals that maybe with the atomic energy people who are doing the inspections so that's one red line that was crossed the other one was the president said we will never ever allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons and now he says well maybe it's 10 years or 12 years but after the deal is over there's nothing in the deal that stops Iran from developing nuclear weapons so you know I think it was a bad negotiation resulting in a bad deal but in my book the case against the Iran deal I propose a third alternative and the president says over and over again there are no alternatives it's either this deal of war well I have a third alternative and I present that in the conclusion to my book and that is the Iran deal has in its preface not in the binding part of the deal but in the preface to the deal it says Iran reaffirms that Iran will never under any circumstances seek to develop or obtain nuclear weapons why don't we hold them to that why don't we have Congress if it's going to accept the deal have a statute that says we take you at your word Iran that is part of the deal we regard that as binding and if you break that deal we authorize the President to do whatever is necessary to make you keep your part of the bargain to make you assure us that you will never under any circumstances seek to obtain nuclear weapons I think that's an agreement we could live with the current agreement is not one I think we can live with which brings me to I think a larger issue you know I'm have trouble with all the secrecy yeah yeah we're buying a pig in a poke and we don't even know what we don't know just in the last two days we heard first a report that the deal allows Iran to do self inspection nobody would ever allow an athlete to decide when to produce his brothers your honor a spit or something like that you always monitor that if he's being tested for drugs so we hear that the Iranians will participate in their own inspection then we hear today no it's a joint operation there will be some people from the Atomic Energy Commission maybe some people from Iran we don't know because it's a side deal the president has said he hasn't seen that the go the Secretary of State says he hasn't seen the deal and yet Congress is being asked to affirm this deal without itself seeing it and the the law that was passed giving Congress the power to do that specifically said that Congress must be given access to every part of the deal secret parts classified parts every other part and we're not getting that right and every day we learn more which is even disturbing me i I just disturbed at how the revelations are coming out day after day and we have to take our first break but stay right where you are will be back in just a moment

to the coaster report I'm Rebecca costs and my guest today is Alan Dershowitz who has a riveting new e-book out called the case against the Iran deal anyone who is interested in getting to the bottom of how we reach this point on this deal where it's either the dealer war according to the president has got to pick this book up I I made the mistake of picking it up late at night don't do that you won't be able to put it down so don't start reading at nine o'clock at night I want to warn all our listeners now you were proposing that one alternative is to make the preamble to the current agreement I'll make that law but what if the president vetoed that would this in any way I have to ask you this legal question with this nullified the agreement since it's in the preamble well I've actually spoken to a number of Democratic senators some of whom were going to vote for the agreement but they agree with my proposal and they would not vote to allow I mean they would vote to override a presidential veto if he would have you I don't think the president would veto this because it's in the agreement itself and he himself has said that he wants to keep some military option on the table so all we're doing is giving the president what he has already publicly said he agrees to so I think this would really put him in a spot if he vetoed it and if he vetoed it i think his veto would be overridden whereas there's real question about whether his veto of the actual laws it's now written will be overridden that's a much harder question so you keep hearing this argument of we don't have anything to lose by going into an agreement because if it doesn't work well then we go back to the sanctions again and potential military force and there's nothing in the agreement that says if you don't break if you break the agreement we're going to go back to that well there's no way of going back to the sanction regime at this point if anybody thinks that China and Russia and France are going to snap back their sanctions they were ready all over Tehran trying to do business deals the Russians are agreeing at this point to send them ground-to-air missiles which would make it much harder to attack they're going to get 150 billion dollars or more and they'll use that to strengthen their nuclear program at the hardened the facilities make them much more difficult to attack over the years and so I think there for them it's a win-win they have gotten their sanctions relief they've gotten the military option taken off the table and all they've done is that most postponed when they can get nuclear weapons a few years and maybe not even that because remember too that we're going to have a hard time inspecting any new facilities that were not aware of and every few years we learn of new nuclear facilities buried underground that we haven't found yet we find them as the result of dissident groups in Iran itself the Emmy k for example as a dissident group that helped us find one facility that they were trying desperately to hide and for all we know they're hiding other facilities and if we do find a new facility they have 24 hours to move everything 24 days I'm sorry 24 days to move everything around you know I'm a criminal defense lawyer and I'm used to defending people some of them are guilty some of whom are innocent I have an innocent client and police come to his house and say we want to search you for drugs I say if he's innocent do it right now don't even wait a minute I want I don't want anybody to suspect that maybe he's hiding something but if you have somebody who's guilty you know you really want time you want delay we'd like 24 days oh boy the Iranians why was a if you're guilty 24 days is an eternity to to take care of business of course and the other argument we hear over and over again well the sanctions it's really their money we're just giving it back to them no I mean you know if you seize an enormous amount of drugs and some cash from a drug dealer you don't give him back the drugs you don't give him back the cash because you know that that was money that was used for improper purposes and we know that this many many billions of dollars they'll be getting will be used to export terrorism to arm Hezbollah which is ready killed hundreds of Americans and Iran through its surrogates have killed approximately a thousand Americans which is going to give them more money to kill Americans we're also going to give them more money to engage in there Jenna Seidel plans against Israel and signatories to an anti genocide treaty that says we can't encourage or help genocide we also have a statute on our books that says that any material aid to terrorist groups is a crime and now the United States is giving material aid to what we already have acknowledged is the greatest exporter of terrorism in the world namely Iran that makes us complicit in their terrorism if they would carry out a terrorist act killing a dozen Americans that they would otherwise not have had the resources to carry out because we're giving them the money to do it imagine how that would make us all feel well speaking of exporting terrorism there was a very disturbing report last week that one of the top terrorists in Iran Soleimani defied his United Nations ban on traveling outside of Iran and flew to Russia to meet with the Russian Minister of Defense and Putin now we're right in the middle of this nuclear agreement when Soleimani meets with Putin so what do you make of that well you know we just don't know again we don't know also today's report that an Iranian weapons we use by the Syrians we know that the Iranians are supporting the Syrians who send rockets into Israel while the negotiations are going on there thumbing their nose at us they're making statements that again America is the Great Satan and don't expect American relations to improve we're still going to destroy Israel we're still going to take over Lebanon we're still going to take over Yemen we're going to take over Syria this is a country that simply has the most aggressive motives and intentions and we're just helping them do it and look what happens now the Palestinian Authority which was opposed to Iran has now decided to go to Tehran and try to make cozy with the Iranians because in the Middle East its power that's respected and this deal gives the Iranians power and it shows that the United States is a paper tiger and that's the way it's being perceived in the Middle East that's why we're seeing the Emirates we're seeing the Palestinian Authority we will soon i think see the Jordanians and others cozy up to the Iranian cuz they we're the center of power is and they don't believe it's any longer in the United States well we seem to be broadcasting it isn't any longer the United States through our actions on the other hand if Iran complies with agreement and closes the enrichment facilities that were aware of as you point out they can you know we they're probably many that we haven't identified to date and the sanctions will be lifted so they could effectively buy arms from the nuclear capability from Russia and North Korea whose economies have been devastated by economic sanctions and they need customers they need money and Iran will have money yes we already know that North Korea sold a nuclear reactor to make moms to Syria Israel took care that in one hour this would be much more complicated obviously but we know that they're capable of buying the material from North Korea I don't think Russia would today cell nuclear weapons to Iran because I think they'd be worried they have their own Iranian they have their own I'm sorry Muslim problem with the Chechens and the last thing they would want I think is to see an Iranian nuclear bomb hand it over to Russia's enemies of course that could happen to us as well it could be handed over you know it doesn't have to be a bomb you dropped from a plane it could be a dirty bomb that you could put in a suitcase they can be dropped off in any United States seaport so the idea that Iran would have the capability of manufacturing nuclear weapons is just a game changer to quote the president president obama called it a game changer and now he's allowing the game to be changed in 10 years yes well we have to take another short break when we return we'll talk about some of the other solutions mr.

Dershowitz so apparently we no longer consider Iran a terrorist threat and this change in relationship with Iran seems to go much deeper than the the nuclear agreement well I think that's right and anybody who thinks that he runs not a terrorist threat is blinking reality it's absurd we know that they provide weapons and ammunition to terrorist groups Israel found a boat loaded with weapons headed for terrorist groups and boarded the boat and there were markings on the boat the boat came from Iran and there's no doubt about that it had their fingerprints all over the place the irony is the United States has taken you run off the terrorist list well for years they kept a group that was a dissident within Iran on the terrorist group so you know our our determination of who's a terrorist and who's not often has much more to do with our foreign policy than actual facts relating to what group is terroristic a Nicole Americans have to understand that Iran is the greatest exporter of terrorism in the world by the way the President of the United States has said that the current president so the idea that they're not going to be regarded as a terrorist group is absurd so let me ask you what I think is the million-dollar question do we really have the ability to stop Iran or any other country for that matter from getting nuclear weapons I mean we didn't stop North Korea or Pakistan I mean what makes us think that we have the capability to stop any nation that's determined to go that route mm-hmm well Iraq was determined to go that route and they was stopped Assyria was determined to go that route and they were stopped Libya was determined to go that route and they were stopped South Africa gave up its nuclear program when things change so yes I think we can prevent countries from developing nuclear weapons the reason that the North Koreans got nuclear weapons because we made the same kind of deal with them that we're now making with Iran in fact in my book I juxtaposed in a chart what President Clinton said when he announced the deal with North Korea with what President Obama said when he announced the deal with Iran and they're identical statements it was frightening I have to tell you when I got to that passage I was frightened they almost it was just paraphrasing yeah yeah and look how bad it turned out with North Korea and everybody that I know believes that it will turn out as badly with Iran the big difference is how long it will take will they have eight years will they have 10 12 15 before they can spend the centrifuges again and become a threshold nuclear nation and when will they actually have the bombs now while this deals going on they have the ability to develop the rockets that can reach the shores of the United States they have the ability to develop nuclear triggers which don't necessarily use nuclear material so they're getting ready they're gearing up as soon as the centrifuges can spin again and help them develop enough material to develop nuclear weapons they'll be allowed to do it and that's why this deal so dangerous because we don't know what its end goal is I wish the president united states would tell us once and for all is this a 10-year postponement or is it a deal that is designed to prevent Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons if it was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons I would support it and if it had teeth in it that could actually bring about that result but if it's a 10-year postponement and in exchange for that we're giving up our sanctions or military option and our other ways of stopping them from doing it for example we were effective and using sabotage and espionage and this deal now in an annex says that the p5 plus 1 will cooperate with Iran and helping them protect their nuclear program from sabotage and espionage are we hurting our ability to stop their nuclear program as we have in the past so I think we can stop it and I think we're giving up that option but in many the cases that you suggest where we have been successful we have not taken the military option off the table or we've used it that's right we used it clearly against Libya and that turned them around Israel used it against Syria that turned them around Israel used it against Iraq that's or never can you imagine if Israel hadn't bombed Assad nuclear reactor several years ago Assad this butcher who is now dropping barrels of chlorine and other illegal weapons on citizens kids children in his own country would now have a nuclear weapon that he could be dropping on his citizens in order to try to keep himself in power imagine what would have happened if you rock I hadn't had their nuclear reactor destroyed by Israel when the United States went in to stop Iraq from going into Kuwait we would never have been able to do that if they had a nuclear weapon so you know military action to stop countries from developing nuclear weapons has proved to be quite successful I'm not opting at this point for a military attack on Iran that's the next of the last resort I say next to the last resort because the last thing is allowing Iran to develop nuclear weapons the next worst thing would be a military attack but it wouldn't be as bad as allowing you are on to develop nuclear weapons well let's talk about sanctions for just a second here we all know that sanctions affect the general population they suffer from shortages and food medical supplies in North Korea they had record numbers of citizens starving children civilian families and we can't I think in this country we treat economic sanctions almost antiseptic alee as though you know it's it's a really good a diplomatic tool to use but we don't realize that we may not be bombing people you know with chemical weapons but we're certainly responsible through economic sanctions of great distress to the person on the street and I sometimes feel we're a little bit callous to that I agree I think it is a form of collective punishment and we do use it the reason North Koreans are starving by the way is not alone because of the sanctions because of the way their government allocates their resources they build more and more and more and more military even though nobody is threatening them nobody is trying to attack them and they deprive their people of the resources necessary the same thing Hamas is now subject to sanctions but when they were given material what did they do they didn't build schools with them they built terror tunnels with them yeah and they used it to develop rockets so it's the priorities and the same thing is true with Iran today Iran could survive with the sanctions and could allow its people to have decent lives if they didn't spend so much money supporting Hezbollah so much money supporting Hamas so much money exporting terrorism so it's their decision that's starving their people the sanctions obviously relate to it but whenever you have warfare the people suffer inevitably look at what happened during the Second World War when people starved and there were bombings of cities that's what's so terrible about war but what would be even worse would be Iran developing nuclear weapons and using it in the way they've already threatened to use it to destroy the Great Satan America and the small Satan Israel and to try to drop a bomb on tel aviv they've described israel as a one bomb state one bomb would end the existence of Israel which was why Benjamin Netanyahu who I've known now for 42 years i met him in 1970 he's not going to sit back and allow Iran to keep its promise of destroying Israel he's not going to allow a second Holocaust to kill six million the six million Jews who now live in Israel and you know you wonder why the Palestinians are being supportive of Iran a nuclear bomb that hits Israel is going to kill Palestinians and Jews alike it's not going to distinguish based on religion or ethnicity Jerusalem is a mixed City a television air Jaffa which is an Arab so there's no such thing as a smart atomic bomb atomic bombs are as dumb as they get you drop them to kill everybody and that's why palestinians and israelis android aeneans and egyptians should be united in an effort to try to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons well you're absolutely right they should be united there's no discrimination here when a bomb goes off and maybe they'll be thinking about that as time marches forward and Iran gets closer to that capability we have to take our final break but

something is important potent and possibly dangerous in an ancient language that is not only arcane and incomprehensible but hasn't even spoken commonly in two thousand years a prescription is a critical component of the therapeutic process as well as the physician-patient relationship and its potential to help or harm makes it one of the most significant of all written communications at the end of the day each step of the medical process is supposed to benefit the patient pharmaceuticals are powerful chemicals and they're correct use is of the utmost importance because most physicians aren't going to be writing scripts and clear concise English anytime soon your best bet when you get one from your doctor is to ask them to go over the drug dosage and directions with you making sure the handwriting is legible and when you pick up your medication from your pharmacy look carefully at the bottle to confirm that the information on the label matches up with what you were prescribed open the bottle and check your meds for accuracy and always make sure you understand the directions and possible side of that pharmacist been here urging you to go to ks co health com to order beyond

co health com make sure you check out the cool videos too at KSC Oh health com that's KS Co health com welcome back to the pasta report I'm Rebecca Kosta and today my guest is one of our country's greatest legal scholars Alan Dershowitz whose new book the case against the Iran deal is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the nuclear agreement which is currently under consideration now the latest reports from The Associated Press indicate that the nuclear agreement with Iran is likely to survive Capitol Hill so let's assume that's the case for just a moment from a legal standpoint is it possible to challenge the agreement in Supreme Court from the perspective that it was really a treaty and not a gris menteur resolution and it should have been subject to the laws governing the approval of a treaty is there some legal recourse well yes who is but I think it would be unlikely to succeed I think Senator Tom cotton would have standing to bring suit he voted against the the law because he said that this is a treaty and that Congress can't abrogate its responsibilities under the Constitution look if you had Alexander Hamilton and James Madison here they would tell you this was a treaty a treaty was defined at the time the constitution was enacted as an agreement of long duration with multiple parties that is not just a one-shot affair and originally in the Articles of Confederation only the Senate could sign a treaty and then Hamilton said in the Federalist Papers number 69 no it should require agreement by both the legislative and the executive branch and it shouldn't be easy to do you should need two-thirds of the Senate and whence when former Senator John Kerry now Secretary of State testified he was asked why is it not a treaty and his basic answer was because if we submitted it as a treaty it wouldn't get past well you know that's what the Constitution is all about wasn't designed to make things easy here you have a situation where the vast majority of Americans are opposed to this deal the vast majority of the Senate is opposed to it the vast majority of the house as opposed to it and yet it will probably get through because all the president needs is one-third plus one of one of the two houses of Congress that's not the way democracy is supposed to operate but I'm afraid that the Supreme Court would say it's a political question it should be decided between the executive and legislative branches and the judiciary should stay out of it I don't agree with that I think this is a perfect case for the judiciary to get involved in because we have a truth a government of three branches three co-equal branches and when the legislature and the executive disagree as to whether or not something is a treaty it should be decided by the Supreme Court of the United States I agree with you one hundred percent and i'd like to see you argue that I better who better than you one of our premier constitutional scholars in the United States to take this because if someone doesn't deal with the real issue then doesn't this open the door for every president from here on to call any agreement a resolution or an agreement and why would anybody in their right mind ever call anything a treaty again right or even call it a legislative executive agreement there's a third concept there are many things that are not treaties but they have to be approved by a majority of legislature at the very least this should be that but generally when we make strategic arms limitation agreements we do them by treaty and I think this should have been done by treaty and the president should have had to work very hard to get two-thirds of the Senate and if he couldn't get two-thirds of the Senate it's because in the last midterm election the mandate went to the Republicans not the Democrats now the good thing about this not being a treaty is it has no binding effect it is not the law of the United States any president can rescind it without giving any reasons whatsoever without a vote of Congress because if it's a presidential agreement what one president can give the other can take away one can take away the other can give that's why we generally like to have treaties because treaties a binding their law everybody is bound by a treaty it has the force of law the disagreement has no force beyond the signature of the president yes I understand that you know another president could decide that this was not a good idea and and rescind it but on the other hand I worried about opening up the door to redefine things for the purpose of expediency and convenience I really think that this sets the wrong message to future presidents that when you want to get something through you know call it something other than a treaty because the bar is set lower right and especially to have a agreement with a foreign country that has a majority of the Senate opposed to it a majority the house opposed to it and a vast majority of Americans opposed to it that's a very very odd use of democratic principles I mean Democratic with a small D and this should not be a partisan issue and I've been urging all the Senators I've spoken to and I've spoken to a number of them in Congress people saying please don't vote your party on this one vote your principles and you know the New York Times had a terrible terrible editorial irresponsible editorial saying that no member of Congress should listen to a foreign leader rather than his commander-in-chief well first of all let's be clear the president is not your commander-in-chief he's not my commander-in-chief he's not the commander-in-chief of Congress or the house of representatives of the Senate he is the commander-in-chief only of the Armed Forces of the United States Congress has an obligation not to be commanded by the president the president can't command the Senate what to vote for and as far as foreign leaders are concern we listen to Churchill and that was a smart thing we listened to the people who many of us listen to the people who are opposed to the Vietnam War into the war in Iraq and would have been better if we had listened to them and the president knows how to use foreign leaders he sent David Cameron the prime minister of his of England into the house and the Senate to have them have him make calls urging them to support the deal so you can't have it both ways you can't say that it's okay for the president to use foreign leaders to get one result but it's not okay to listen to foreign leaders on the other side and this idea that somehow would being disloyal to our commander-in-chief if we disagree with him by that standard President Obama was disloyal he voted against the war in Iraq when the President of the United States the quote commander-in-chief was in favor of it and he did the right thing by voting against the war in Iraq as did I in coming out against the war in Iraq and I think I'm doing the right thing by standing up strong as a loyal American as a Democrat as a supporter of Barack Obama in opposing this one deal this is not a good deal for America it's not a good deal for peace it's not a good deal for the Prevention of Terrorism it's not a good deal for anti-nuclear proliferation it's just not a good deal and we ought to strongly oppose it and get a better deal well on that note we are just about out of time where can listeners go today to get more information on the case against the Iran deal well the best thing is probably the easiest thing is probably to go on kindle or Amazon you can buy a press of the button order the book the kindle edition is very inexpensive and it's a very quick read and the paperback is inexpensive too and it's a fast read it's only a couple hundred pages and it has in it the deal itself with annotations so you can read it and see for yourself and make your own judgment I wonder how many senators and congressmen have actually read the deal from beginning to end well I know a lot of them listen to this program so I hope they will they will take that suggestion unfortunately that is all the time we have but before we say goodbye I want to

back to the second hour of Acosta report I'm Rebecca Costin during the first hour we had the honor of speaking with acclaimed lawyer and author of the case against the Iran deal Alan Dershowitz and before my colleagues join me for our roundtable discussion in a few minutes I want to take a moment to talk about this idea that we must approve the nuclear agreement with Iran or face the prospect of war I think it's fair to say that when we're dealing with any regime which believes the ends justifies the means and condones terrorism we face the prospect of war no matter what we do the possibility that were being misled or deceived always exists just as the possibility that the agreement was made in earnest we should bear in mind that no country is eager to wage war even those led by fanatical leaders like the one in North Korea if they were eager to get into war they'd simply start marching their troops into another country and that would pretty much grant them their wish but we don't see North Korea doing that when we polarize our choices to the point of implying that not approving the current agreement means necessarily going to war with Iran in my opinion we are doing the country a great disservice the agreement with Iran needs to stand on its own merit in other words we should be able to make the case for the agreement without threatening people with the possibility of war because that possibility exists with or without this agreement and it will exist even if the agreement is approved now I've been asked by many listeners whether I'm in favor or against the nuclear agreement with Iran and and I want to make it clear my opinion does not carry any more weight than anyone else on the street I'm happy to oblige them but just because you hear my voice over the radio don't don't don't take this as fact it's simply my opinion but my answer is that I do not feel it makes any difference one way or another so all this bickering is for nothing and I do not come by this opinion because I'm a cynic I come by it because I believe Iran has made a simple make or buy decision the kind of decision businesses make all day every day there comes a point where it is simply cheaper and easier to purchase from a third party then make your own I believe that our use of economic sanctions has produced the perfect conditions for Iran to make a more cost-effective deal with North Korea and Russia whose economies are so desperate they need customers these these two countries North Korea and Russia they need customers and once the economic sanctions are lifted against Iran Iran will have the ability to purchase those arms think about it it's a win-win-win for Russia and North Korea and Iran Iran shuts down their own expensive programs they save a lot of money in doing so they appease the West because we send in inspectors who then report back that Iran has complied and then we pat ourselves on the back that the agreement worked the sanctions are lifted Iran has money to make their purchases and Russia North Korea who need the money well they get that also and everyone is happy but the question that we have to ask ourselves today is whether that agreement makes the world safer and my answer to that is no because if this is simply a decision to buy instead of make it means Iran's nuclear ambitions have not been curbed they've not been discouraged and more importantly we've set three countries up to forge a closer alliance based on economic necessity that is what economic sanctions have done for us they are not without a cost now I know no one in the news media's bothered to connect all these dots but hopefully enough of our listeners today will send the link to this program to their friends and and together we can get the attention of members of Congress and the State Department and television media powerhouses last week one of the top terrorists in Iran defied the UN ban which forbid him from traveling outside of Iran soleimani Soleimani flew to Russia to meet with the defense minister of Russia and Putin simultaneously in the news last week the Monterey Institute of International Studies reported that North Korea has begun increasing their mining and refinement of uranium we can tell this by satellite photographs and they're doing it by significant amounts in order to build up their stockpile of nuclear arms who builds up their stockpile if you don't have customers these are both facts that you can check on the Internet there is no need for you to ever take my word or anybody else's word for it look at the activity in Russia look at the activity in North Korea and then look at who in Iran is speaking to them right as we're about ready to consider this agreement so if Iran strategy is to buy instead of build their own nuclear weapons then any agreement we strike is going to appear successful on the surface particularly as we do inspections and we see no enrichment activity but it's likely to do very little to diminish the growing threat of nuclear war the fact is economic sanctions have elevated that threat and we would be wise to think before we corner other economies by going this route on that note we're going to take a quick break and when we come back Charles Friedman and Bill graph will be joining me for our weekly round table which is if you've been listening this program this is when all hell heck breaks out I can't say I can't say that other word heck breaks loose here in the studio so stay tuned you're listening to the cost of report you", "-PaEGleBEIk": "[Music] uh [Music]

holy [ __ ] what's going on guys zac pony here and today's video is basically not the top four but therefore my most favorite cutting meals that are very high volume and low in calories so these are by no means like your healthiest um best options for cutting but a few people have been asking for kind of like these high volume meals will keep you full doesn't really feel like you're dieting um and aren't very calorie dense so i thought these are the ones that i've used a lot in the past because sometimes when you're just in that phase of dieting you just need to kind of push through it and these have been very helpful so first one we're going to do is we're going to do a uh egg white sandwich basically toasted sandwich have that sounds so shitty an eggless sandwich go [ __ ] yourself that's what you're thinking um but it's actually it's good bear with me so it's like a toasted sandwich with egg whites and cheese it is good um next one we're doing chicken two ways one is my famous japanese inspired salad that we're doing soon and another one is a chicken with potatoes and it's just a it's very filling it's probably the most filling meal i will eat all day and then the last one is a dessert nice and sweet and it's super filling and we're making zucchini ice cream so you'll have to wait to the end of the video to see that so the job gives me so much [ __ ] for the zucchini i can't wait to when we get to that bit so first one let's get started on the egg white omelet sandwich thing we'll come up with a name later so i have some diced up capsicum here i'm gonna make basically an egg white omelette with onion capsicum we'll put the ham on later but it's up to you any any vegetables you want in this you can just throw them in there so whatever veg you're feeling spinach or whatever but to be honest this is kind of just simple so i'm just gonna go with that and add more eggs for sure i'm just doing this the leanest possible way because i can't be bothered but obviously for for health the yolks are great don't leave them out just because i did because usually i'll probably put a couple yolks in but i want to see how low color we can get so i butter up my pan like an absolute weirdo how good is this this is a wooly's diced up onion because i don't want to cry not in front of you guys at least literally all for convenience when they dice [ __ ] up for me i'm like way too overly happy now once that's cooked add in your egg whites using about 300 mils or grams here because that's 30 grams of protein so 300 it's about 10 protein it's a very decent guesstimation here but that's pretty much it so if you want like i said crack a couple eggs on top whatever your calories allow you to do do that i'm just like i said this is most basic and then cook this until the bottom is cooked and then we're just gonna put it under the grill to finish the top almost forgot bit of shell yeah go back a bit yeah they go their hands in focus now you won't be able to hear too much because it's coming from my mic you see i'll put yourself a bit of pepsi right this is [ __ ] [ __ ] off the heat [Music] back on the heap here it goes out with the mic so one thing you want to be careful with you don't want to burn the bottom of this thing so once it's pretty much getting cooked yeah [ __ ] cook [ __ ] mr egg white [ __ ] uh you're gonna chuck it on the grill joel come on check this if you guys are making protein pancakes or omelets easiest thing ever full whack slide it in all right you leave it there forget about it just just leave it in there until it's cooked and that's the easiest thing ever because it cooks the top while the bottom is already cooked you won't see me flipping any of that stuff ever so we're using sandwich thins here for these i think there's about 100 calories a pop sounds funny um but you could use english muffins anyway because they're about like a little bit more but at that point doesn't really matter uh this i just thought would be cute because the cheese like will fit perfect so i'm gonna toast these not too close too close too close so look at that fully cooked now the cheese i'm using craft singles here low fat craft singles it doesn't matter if you get 25 low fat or like no fat it really it doesn't matter the end of the day there's like nothing in it um like i said this is this is where it feels like this is not real food but if you're on like no calories this will be a lifesaver i mean it's not even healthy to eat super low calories anyway so plop them on there and then full whack straight back in here just to melt the cheese so that's done we've got our little sandwich thins here and i'm just gonna cut around this white this is where it starts to look pretty messy i'm not gonna lie full whack plop him on now here whatever sauces you want i like a bit of tomato but there's also this good barbecue callow fit smokey barbecue what's got online then hamstrings little bit so i see people like tracking the calories and stuff if you guys have to track the calories on a slice of ham figure out what else you're doing with your life because like it's really you can get carried away with this [ __ ] that's why you won't see me tracking calories on a slice of this a bit of that a sauce here because you literally go mental you're completely insane so the good thing about this is well it's the bad thing about this i can probably count on my hand the amount of nutrients that are in this thing like it's literally it's very minimal but uh the good thing is it is so filling and you get a bit of variety because you just put whatever's left of the omelette on the plate and then you have two sandwiches and an egg white omelet so actually pretty decent and the macros are i mean they're very low calorie the macros are great micro is probably lacking but that's a concern for another day meal one done okay that's right so i'm doing chicken two ways now so i'm just gonna cook it all up um here together get your chicken to eat first of all make sure it's dead the last thing you want is a zombie chicken running around with his [ __ ] breasts there like that he's got to make sure no heartbeat he's dead it's all good it's all good everyone chicky is dead uh anyway back to reality so dicing up the chicken and i go for a couple of different uh seasonings on here because we're gonna air fry this today if you don't have an air fryer get one because they're just they're so good but we're going to use a couple different things first one can you see that cannellini beans no i'm joking it's actually red lentils no it's this is um pork rind literally i'll put in the description i found this when i was doing carnivore and it was just so good it's literally just pork rind basically dried and it is so nice it has a kfc chicken so um one is gonna be like that if you want to get fancy dip the chicken in egg first and then this will stick a bit better it'll make a bit more of like a proper uh batter like a little coating but that's pretty much it for that chuck it in this will take about 13 minutes in the airfryer so we'll get it ready and for the next one now we have chicken thighs here because we ran out of breath so we're gonna have to use the chicken quads now before i forget there are two schools of thought when it comes to basically dieting and low calorie meals one is if you're going with low fat like the chicken like the the breakfast it's gonna be a lot of food because there's more uh volume less calorie dense but whether or not that's going to keep you full or not is an entirely different story and it depends on the person so if for example you have chicken breasts and you're not very full and even though it was a lot of food but you're still not full because of satiety cues then maybe you'd be better off having chicken thighs more fats in the meal fats are very good on their satiety like the carnivore diet is really good for that so it just kind of depends on the person i would i would usually advise try and go with a higher fat because you don't want to cut on low fat if you're cutting on really low fat it's not going to be good for you you're going to be your hormones will suffer everything you'll feel [ __ ] um but these the way it turns out to be is low fat is an easy way it's basically used to hack to make um these kind of meals so there is a trade-off there i'm not recommending just this but these are like little things you can use uh anyway this is the panko on um the thighs pretty simple this is just for the salad um and we will put a bit of uh shell on on both as well the sheer amount of airfryers we've got going on in here so to go with our chicken one of the chicken meals we're gonna have vegetables and potatoes so these spud light or you can get christmas potatoes i honestly still think america doesn't have low-carb potatoes yet or uk i think it literally is just an australian thing [ __ ] low carbs bugs mate um but if you don't have these pumpkin is just fine it'll basically be the same um and what you'll do is juggle them just do this one two three holy [ __ ] this is the best if i don't hold up oh my god they're good yeah it basically was if you were like um but these have uh eight they're eight percent carbs basically so eight grams of carbs per 100 grams potatoes i would never really recommend them in terms of like a health food they're just literally this is just to keep you full it's pretty much that's pretty much it bitter carbs um but when people air fried potatoes they always um just throw them straight in and then it leaves them all dry and it just goes gross so the trick is you actually want to boil them a little bit par boil them so you just dice them up and then boil them for like five ten minutes just just so they're nearly cooked and then you put them in the air right here so otherwise they turn into wrinkly knit sacks yeah wrinkly nut sacks and they're just they're just gross and burnt it's disgusting so let's pretend like these got diced up and then cooked and you'll be left with something like this remember those um that heart attack show oh yeah get the bed sheets and put them all in a circle yeah and then after 10 hours it looks something like this and it's so impressive but now we're dealing with potatoes so it's a bit sad anyway these are cooked and all i do with these ones is get my second airfryer full wax pop them in bit of regular cell joel what other one my [ __ ] cheeky shell tastes so good and then chicken salt in on now you want to cover the potatoes in your extra virgin olive oil we don't want any [ __ ] olive oils around here bang a little bit and then that is going to kick for basically the same time as the chicken so about 13 15 minutes now the next thing easiest thing of all time these woolies have these that you just microwave them straight in the bag so you do have to stab it two minutes in the microwave cooked and then we're gonna stir-fry this at the end so while that's all cooking we'll start on the salad so one ingredient you're gonna need a bit lettuce probably didn't know that and this is literally about the size bowl that i use when i have salads because i always have such enormous ones when we were super leaned all like at least probably two months ago this was a nightly dinner wasn't it yeah every single night we had this because it's it's so filling you sit in the couch like a hot after all this salad it actually does feel good it does but i'm going to keep it at that if you want more lettuce go for it go go go go go gopher next right now i have a little bit of slaw mix here basically just i think carrot and beetroot adds a little bit of crunch cucumber peeled and sliced in toy it's always nice to stand near you when you're cooking because he drops food and i can eat it people actually think that porn mental if you're new to my channel like this is the first video you've seen holy [ __ ] i swear i'm not this weird well i am but you get used to it and you guys have become this weird imagine like the first seeing the first video this is the first time what the hell is wrong with these guys why don't they speak english [Music] [Applause] this is like a million references sprinkle throughout this that's that's it for the salad because we are doing a japanese inspired salad best thing these fried dried shallots so good sprinkle them on i used to put a little bit but now i'll put chili out oh you have a little now after a lot i may be a chef but i know where i come from he really likes it don't be fooled i got two dressings that we are using here both by cupi this is a cupid wasabi dressing and is it wasabi yeah wasabi dressing i don't know where you guys can find this i think we just picked this up at the asian store because it is so good but any even the kupi sesame soy amazing you can get that at your local supermarket uh and then obviously keeping mayo little bit we'll dress it first or if you don't have any of these and you're thinking what even is that how do i find it google uh wafu dressing w-a-f-u fu it's really good another one that's super easy to make it's like four ingredients drizzle this so these green beans are cooked but i do like to stir fry them just for just to get the flavor in there so either butter or coconut oil i think it tastes the best throw them in and i would say when it comes to like green veggies and stuff like that have as many as you want like if you're hungry just add more when when i'm like really low low calorie dieting the green veggies is there's a lot like i used to have a pack of these and like the chicken and that was kind of like my meal so funny the amount of people that have been saying that now exactly like that when you do it yeah because again it doesn't get stuck in your head it gets stuck in my head and this is literally a secret ingredient because when i was in the states at whole foods they sell this thing called miso mayo you had it did your job i cooked it for you first day we went to america it is so good right so if you're in america go to trader joe's get umami seasoning put that on the chicken and then you'll use miso mayo but i couldn't find any so i actually emailed uh the miso mayo company last week and said look i'm sick of not having this i'm willing to pay this exorbitant shipping to get it here and they're like i'm so sorry it's probably not gonna last in the whatever it'll take weeks so i was like damn it and the lady i think she's owner told me how to make it absolute jet so i've gone ahead and made it this stir fried in on i'm just gonna mix that up it's so nice but if you don't have that and you can't have access to it um perinase is always the go aussie and the pate is we'll add one thing to them so it's pretty crispy so a little bit of low-fat cheese [Applause] [Music] don't bouillon this in a swimming pool don't do this in a swimming pool why is this smoking like that okay don't smoke in a swimming pool okay back in just a little bit oh it's cooking the bottom they cooked the bottom that's why what was burning was yeah the clips on the bottom i keep on burning kicking goes on that is crispy chicken so much put in it's actually a mound so this is what we mean by high volume lower calorie foods bang right there stop that i'm so cool chicken on and to finish one last little cheeky and then a little bit a little bit of a sweet sauce is what i like to put on so any this is economy source fantastic for the economy last quarter was amazing in this one or you can get unagi sauce which is also really really good both just sweet so use them sparingly you have to go in the opposite direction of the mayo otherwise it doesn't count it's half a ton two meals done so these are the main meals like if you're gonna have a lunch or a dinner or something they're gonna keep you the fullest okay now this is the final meal dessert this is what i used to have a lot of time for dessert still do 200 grams of frozen berries one scoop of oxy way vanilla i think works the best banana was also really good but i think it's discontinued so vanilla is the go amazing use zach10 at ehplabs.com as well get a nice discount then coconut water or almond milk or any of those kind of milk so around 40 to 50 mil is what we're doing here because you want to be very thick still and one zucchini peeled we'll get to this but first literally put it all into a food processor or futuristic blender like we have here now this dessert is so good by the way we used to put uh nut spread with it so we used to put just peanut butter whatever you want in it um and we ended up just shorthand calling it knit spread so this is just this became knit spread um and this was so good that joel decided to get his only tattoo his personal tattoo to describe a dessert that we all love so much always going to scrape down the sides and then give it one more one more go see that it's basically like a sorbet pretty much this is where it gets a bit weird that already is a fair bit like that's a whole bowl fair bit of volume but if you're really hungry you want to make it weird this is when we add the zucchini if it's peeled i have no problems with it i've got no qualms with a peeled zucchini because you can't taste anything it adds a little bit of like chewiness to it i like it so grate this i don't know what possessed me to try this the first time you put it back in and just put on like a mixed setting so we're not going to blend it you just want to mix it if yours doesn't have it just mix it with your hands but we can put this on [Laughter] reverse you can't taste a zucchini at all it's like a grated apple that's exactly what you could tell someone's great apple they go oh good [Music] and so guys that is it i'm sorry we actually polished off the first one it looks like it's just a mess now so you have to just remember what that looked like or in fact here's a nice b-roll overlay of what that first one looked like in case you forgot but here we have these top four high volume cutting fat loss meals so like i said and i can't emphasize this enough when you're dealing with these meals they're not the let's say like quote unquote healthiest they're not the most nutrient dense meals because if they were it'd have egg yolks in there we would have more fats in the meals less kind of like fake cheese and [ __ ] like that but if these meals are going to be what is going to make you adherent to your plan and not throw yourself off and not eat [ __ ] and then you know fall off the wagon then this is amazing you know what i mean so like that's why it's a bit of a trade-off sometimes if people uh if you give them something like this i mean look there's not too many nutrients in here but that said if that's going to keep you adherent to your diet you're going to get your results because there's not many colors in here so that's why there is a trade-off between like the nutrient density and the calories of the meal um but that said these have been kind of the go-to ones that i've used in the past when i'm really hungry and i just want to break the diet and eat something and then actually enjoy the fruits this all tastes amazing so but i can give you guys a whole bunch of more recipes and like talk about this [ __ ] for days because there's so many little factors but i figured try these meals let me know how you go and i really think you'll enjoy them but anyway that is it for me guys i did hope you enjoyed this video and learned a few things let me know how these turn out and plus let me know how the zucchini ice cream goes because if you're like me i think it's great and it is such a lifesaver if you're in like a prep or dieting or whatever but like i said they've got nothing left for you and you definitely definitely know what to do [Music] when you see just what i'm saying", "FyMWRcVTGAI": "these guys should have gone in cahoots with Ben and Jerry and then you guys could have made like a look at the corner makes flavor that's a good idea yeah I'm full of them royalties that sound also activated Siri hey everyone I'm Claire we're the v8s kitchen and today I'm making gourmet Ben and Jerry's when I was a kid Ben and Jerry's was the premium ice-cream option at the grocery store interesting flavors and mix-ins and kind of like a maximalist approach to ice cream so this one is chunky monkey banana ice cream with fudge chunks and walnuts really really sweet but so good the walnuts especially toasted are savory and it provides a good balance in addition to texture half baked which is chocolate and vanilla ice creams mixed with gobs of chocolate chip cookie dough and fudge brownies I don't like it it's not pleasant oh I remember fish food chocolate ice cream with gooey marshmallow swirls caramel swirls and fudge fish hmm it's a little too much for me the whole thing just to me goes a little saccharine okay this is pistachio pistachio pistachio ice cream with lightly roasted pistachios I love pistachio ice cream it is truly one of my favorite flavors I like that that pistachio is in it our whole but I wish it was a little less of that almond extract flavor and more kind of roasted pistachio oh I love I love coffee ice cream coffee ice cream might be the best ice cream flavor right wait forever pistachio what [ __ ] clear all right I'm in mint or Wonderland dark chocolate mint ice cream not really what Chris is talking about this is brewed to matter coffee ice cream with fudge chunks and a brownie batter squirrel the brownie swirl have a little bit of an awesome flavor like a little bitterness and the coffee ice cream itself I think it's good but it could be more intense and it could be less sweet this was always one of my favorites Cherry Garcia the cherry ice cream with cherries and fudge please I actually think the chocolate is good because it adds some bitterness that balances out the sweet cherry I love chunky monkey what do you guys know it's walnut and banana I'd say that not actually now my weight it's it's so big in a walnut the flavor is where the mix-ins themselves are not sweet are the best ones okay here's what I'm thinking I think you chunky monkey try Garcia pistachio I mean and the coffee one because these are just all my favorite flavors in general okay I don't need like double fudge chunk snicker bars everywhere I kind of hate it I end up spitting it out I'm with you like I reject these flavors in favor of these slightly simpler waters cuz it'll make your job you see you have to come up with a name though that's their whole thing is like a clever pun what was the coffee one called rude [Music] Brewed Leone okay Thanksgiving was last week what if it's an even Andy all right okay so now all we have to do is name pistachio what's what what do we do about pistachio do you think that I have to make a core no right does it anyone even eat those rat ball rolls in this is like you deprive a person of rap oh this is my impression of rap oh okay me and then he like do this do that I'm you I'm right and then he's got some core flavors you know we need band so Claire get the pencil we need a cross section ome nice yeah guess that would work bad cells are cool core my ass we've been lied to feels like a lie there is no core what what are you talking about oh my god yeah they're flipping nails just like the photo wait did you know we named the coffee one brewed Leone rude like brute a cup of brewed coffee three dozen I'm afraid it's gonna rhyme you tell what I'm gonna do the core in yours in the year I love that one [ __ ] the fudge no I'm gonna do a talk a hot fudge core that's a good idea okay well it's not gonna be hot anymore it's just gonna be fudge we're gonna weld it back on are you gonna weld it oh yeah now it's time for my favorite part reading the ingredients I'm gonna start with chunky monkey and then I'll kind of compare flavor to flavor what is different cream skim milk liquid sugar parentheses sugar water close parentheses water sugar bananas walnuts coconut oil egg yolks cocoa parentheses process with alkali close parentheses cocoa powder lemon juice concentrate guar gum natural flavors milk fat carrageenan soy lecithin vanilla extract okay so to me this is indicating a custard base and then there's the carrageenan and soy lecithin which are emulsifiers that's to help keep it very smooth but like overall it's not a super long ingredient list which is a good sign middle Kat Bruce matter alright so this one is a little bit different because it has a brownie batter swirls and then you get all those ingredients but in terms of the actual ice cream it's very similar pistachio alright and even shorter less than all the others nothing surprising points me in a certain direction in terms of style of base and I'm gonna make and now I think we're going to go over to the computer and do a bit of research chunky maroc yeah a batch of ice cream mix starts with heavy cream condensed skim milk interesting and liquid cane sugar resulting in either a white sweet cream mix or a chocolate mix so that make sense so all the Ben & Jerry's flavors fall into one of two categories the sweet cream mix or the chocolate mix maybe you've heard of it Cherry Garcia mi got nice Ben & Jerry's what a berry plant I mean I kind of already know I kind of already know this we're making the core Adam we're making the pork I mean I'm making the core but you know what we cut into some of the core flavors there's no core there's no cords look you would say Steve evidence oh wow right no course yes right what we were lied to have bread what's a what Brad wants to start a class-action lawsuit and it is like every time I see it I got a nuclear reactor running down the middle what is core I'm gonna make it better okay okay oh my god okay I'm all my ingredients out and ready to go so for Christopher Chris a CEO Marashi oh I'm going to be making a pistachio base with seshu paste and toasted salted whole pistachios right here then and even Andy which is our answer to chunky monkey then the next one half sour cherry which is our Cherry Garcia so then for brewed Leone which is brewed to matter I'm going to try a cold steep espresso base then chocolate stracciatella and a hot fudge core today actually given the time I'm gonna focus on prepping some of those individual components and some of the flavors and I'm going to be adding to the bases first I'm gonna get some things in the oven I'm gonna start roasting the bananas I like to roasted bananas whole in their skins poke a couple holes you take off the stickers these will go maybe a half an hour ago this will be for the pistachio these aren't spelled so I'm gonna roast the raw ones pulling out any halves now let me put the whole walnuts out as well and I'll let them toast and then hit them with a bit of salt when they come out of the oven thanks with your coffee why not I'm going to try a cold steep espresso base just given the timing I probably won't make an espresso base today anyway so I'm gonna let it cold steep in the milk overnight to this I'm going to add 500 grams high-quality whole milk all right I'm gonna set this off to the side I mean let me move on actually to the hot fudge this is BA the best hot fudge brown sugar some agave butter oh and a tape-recorder cup of water this has to go to 220 Fahrenheit oh my god now it says error did we have another thermapen it's probably hitting 320 as we speak oh my god thank you yeah 219 it's close enough now I'm going to stir in the chocolate I'm going to stir in cocoa powder vanilla and salt lots of salt I'm going to whisk in a little bit of water and that just reforms the emulsion and it should completely smooth out but I want to do a test where I freeze some of it solid I think it's time to pull the bananas let's take a look they haven't let off a lot of liquid but I think that that's mostly because they weren't that ripe to begin with so I'm going to let these cool I want to do two cherry preparations one is just kind of a soaked from a very lightly candied cherry for my simple syrup equal parts water and sugar spiked with the Luxardo maraschino liqueur pinch of salt and then I'm gonna add the thing stirrer bitters now I'm gonna add my cherries about a very gentle simmer just a dash of vanilla and get too high any bit of almond extract it smells really good these are gonna chill just let them go overnight I was going to the fridge the second one is a really concentrated cherry compote that I'm going to use to flavor ice cream base [Music] I just keep trying to pull my hand automatically tries to pull the trash out I'm just trying to decide the best method for concentrating this mixture it's probably gonna be boiling it on the stove the other option is that I could really gently dehydrate it overnight I'll set it for 18 hours so tomorrow the plan is to come in and start I think first thing making a less sweet creme anglaise for the pistachio a double batch of plain creme anglaise that I'll split into two for the fruit flavors so half gets banana half gets cherry and then the third will be a steeped coffee milk base I'm gonna strain it first then get rid of a lot of the grinds so then there'll be less to obstruct the filtration and see if that's at the concentration that we want it oh yeah that tastes like coffee I'm confident but it's also like not delusional confidence it's just like it's not that hard to make ice cream so it's not so much a testament to my skill or knowledge it's just a testament to it not being that hard to make ice cream so today I'm making all the bases which I'll cook on the stove and then the only other equipment I think I'll need is our ice cream machines we like weirdly have a lot of these so I could probably spin them all at the same time oh my god it's so heavy on that game is down I'm hoping that by the end of today I have all the ice creams frozen assembled in the freezer I strained the coffee last night so I'm gonna check on that oh yeah yeah this prophet didn't uh finish draining and I'm gonna grab the hot fudge I froze this test because I want to see if I can scoop into it it's very smooth and fudgy I want to also look at the cherry make sure that we D hydrated oh yeah oh I think it's a good consistency if I were to have cooked this on the stove I think I would have scorched it ah this is what happened I just pulled it right off yeah we have the drill and we have things in charge no yeah it's fixable let's not make it oh my god man I'm not saying it's your job right but maybe you want to like help us out we'll get it we'll fix it we'll fix it here we go you know go if anyone's watching who's in the tool industry we need new tools look at this thing it's things older than clay play this battery they make this thing oh are you sure yeah I don't know I tell you what thanks Brad you can get back to making ice cream I think everything that I set up yesterday is right where I want it to be and I feel really good I think sir almost turned out better than I expected hot fudge is great the cherry base is great I think the coffee milk is at an appropriate strength I'm ready to move on to the next step which is cooking the basis for each batch from doing a liter total so 510 ELLs of milk and cream each in one batch it's 200 grams of sugar I'm gonna do the one that's 150 now the next one I'll do is 400 generous pinch of kosher I want to do eight yolks her back it's faster to just crack all them into the bowl and lift out the yolks one by one I do these one at a time the three batches of creme anglaise I'm gonna start with a single batch and this will be for the pistachio the method for caramel glaze is really simple I heat up the dairy I'm gonna add a teaspoon of this vanilla paste I will just I called blanching which is just mixing the with sugar yeah it was like creme anglaise day and so you do multiple things with the creme on glass and one of the things was just poured in the ice cream machine and make vanilla ice cream in it you can see that this is hailed I'm going to keep eating it because I want it to form a ribbon screaming in a little bit of the liquids and this just prevents the cold eggs are completely scrambling 1/72 right on the edge 178 that's pretty much where you want to be I'm gonna go ahead and finish this base adding maca statio paste and the almond extract so for the almond extract I don't want it to be overpowering I think I'll start with a half teaspoon for this volume okay and now the pistachio paste see what 200 grams looks like blend this into the creme anglaise I think it should put more in I mean it's it could take a little bit it could take more I agree with you ooh okay Wow I am stirring the pistachio base over an ice bath to cool it down and then I'll do the other two versions of creme anglaise this is the coffee milk that I was straining overnight and I'm just going to decant what's left in the filter so that gets me up to 364 I'm going to add more milk until I get to 500 and now 500 of heavy cream [Music] oh yeah it's good right yeah like that's the coffee flavor why okay cool I'm gonna strain it and chill it and then we'll move on so take my huge vat of half-and-half over to the stove but double the volume it's gonna require more heat and take longer we're good oh [Music] it's fine now I think while it's still warm I'm gonna incorporate the fruit purees because I think while it will just blend easier when it's warm I'll start with cherry so now I'm gonna blend this leave that in there well I'm do the banana version oh so good I like a lot of banana we could make it we could make it good thank you okay he's not wrong okay fine so I've leftover base that's just plain creme on glass Chris wants me to make mint chip which i think is actually a good idea okay fine so I'm just gonna add some peppermint extract to this if we named Lynch it after you what would it be called after me I'm gonna think about it I'm gonna think about it I got a I can't thinking I would be so honored okay so here's what's happening only have five flavors like what if we combined coffee and banana I made it into a Molly flavor for my flavor for your flavor how do you feel about coffee banana banana banana coffee a bug Vanna I think about the old rook yeah that's cute I like that one now can we do the same thing for a Gaby flavor what's your favorite flavor get come over on this side right now I guess be statue on you have you stretching can we mix something into the pistachios to make it like what would you like yeah that sounds good I did see a jar delicious okay so what are we gonna call yours million dollar gap soon coming soon so we have these three wonderful ice cream making machines it only takes about 20 minutes for me to churn and at that point when ice cream is done I will fold in the toppings that I'm adding and then pack them into the pints so I'm gonna grab the three coldest spaces that would be the first ones I made so this looks like coffee so let's hit start there's a blade inside that's spinning let's start with this one this is my coffee I don't think that I'm gonna be able to get all of the coffee in I think I only want to fill it halfway otherwise it'll overflow this is our Leone Christy she oh yeah what's your cherry in here why is the voices slow I mean this is looking this is looking more done hey Andy have you ever done stracciatella ice cream do I want to add it in now yeah that's not ready yet okay you're right [Music] alright it occurred to me after I added everything to the machines that I have to be ready as soon as the ice cream is done to add all the mix ins and pack them into the pints so I am melting quite a bit of dark chocolate because multiple flavors get the chocolate chips and the chips form by streaming melted chocolate into the cold churning ice cream oh it looks really good do you think it's done it's done yeah alright I'm gonna stop it alright I'm folding in the strained cherries alright now I'm ready to transfer to the pints into the freezer out of my way okay so the pistachio is ready I have a couple bowls because I can mix multiple flavors for pistachio I'm gonna do a pint of Gabby's so this is just extra luscious I'm gonna do Gabby's flavour I'm gonna turn a ribbon this dulce de leche through the pistachio and then two of Cris a substantial think I'll have enough and throw in I think that's a good amount stash iou's I think that the coffee is also ready which means I want to add my chocolate when you stream they'll - chuckle it into the churning frozen face it turns into these little flat shreds and that's a great texture so then for Bru Leone the goal here is just to pack it around this core so that they're hollow and then hot fudge goes in I should give them the ice cream business because there's just so many versions you can make of things once you have a few flavors cause like it scales well I'm sure Ben and cherry have already figured that out okay oh there you go option oh my god that's my favorite one if it makes you want to have a tiny house I'm gonna now blend my banana and coffee together Coffee bananas then and even Andy which is banana base this one is now pre cooled I'm gonna pour in my mint base Somali actually had some candied walnuts from earlier that she wasn't using so that's gonna go in coffee Bosnia's and ebin Andy is also about done but his is getting chocolate so I'm gonna go ahead and stream in the chocolate for the stracciatella Molly's is done I'm gonna mix in the candied walnuts to hers all right Andy's done so I have to mix in the regular walnuts to this one and then I'm gonna split the mint chip 1/4 rodas 1/4 SOLAS so I'm gonna add a fudge core to one guy we don't even have room for the instant we've made so many pints of ice cream maybe Totino's pizza rolls for being a nice face we've made probably I think 15 14 or 15 pints of ice cream so I feel great about that I feel good about all the flavors I'm like my only concern is that they've been somehow I wasn't letting them go long enough in the machines but it seemed long enough to me so we'll see how they freeze overnight and then we noticed I saw someone reiterate we're not getting paid by penetrates through this episode I want to check on the flavor see how they froze and then the last bit of work presuming that everything went well is to add the fudge cores and get those back into the freezer just to free solid that's the next step I have to fill the core I froze them with a tube so that they're hollow and now I'm boiling water to pour into the tube to get it out and then hot fudge goes in the ones I'm adding a core to our breads flavor which is brewed Leone which is a coffee chip and then SOLAS which we need we didn't really make our own fun yesterday we named it fudge off and leave me solo don't tell Chris I'm using his extremely fancy kettle all right I'm just pouring water into the cavity all right now these should slide right out there we go so now I'm gonna snip a little opening in the bag and start piping making sure the fudge reaches all the way to the bottom and that there's no air pockets so this is brute Leone I'm gonna slap the lid on here and put it back in the freezer so uh are you in the middle of something oh my god do you want to taste ice cream as a reward more a she Oh maybe maybe the spelling okay in case the name didn't indicate this is mint chip ice cream with a fudge core look how good the core look working out so great so good player it's just bright enough it wouldn't have upset me if it were green oh man Rota yours is madman fury rota I'm really excited about Chris's flavor Chris a co Marashi oh I have to say I think this is the best flavor it just slowly melts in your because it has a ton of extra fat from the pistachio paste a little bit how about we do archery I feel like this will be my favorite chocolate and cherries cherries throughout that are kind of like a maraschino cherry crystals could be finer so it could be smoother overall I wish was smoother but I'm happy with how charts lowered it is because I feel like with Cherry Garcia it's like a ballad cherries on chocolate yeah Andy banana D which is our take on chunky monkey so there's toasted walnuts and stracciatella oh it's actually very chunky monkey yeah but more banana like Andy you take the whole pint home like this is the closest to the original but just a more refined version this is Brut Leone with the core with the core yeah can you just communicate your rap oh that this was very successful rap Oh successful I mean like when you go upstairs that's the perfect amount of coffee where's the Molly we got here Molly to try her flavor so I mixed the coffee and banana bases together and this has the candied walnuts that you gave me the walnuts have not lost any of their fresh I know this is gonna be incredible I think this is pistachio base with dulce de leches swirl no like that's super crazy that's pretty good but that's not an actual fan and dairy flavor is it no should be you pointed out that the real cores aren't really a core now the ones we got and this one is like a bull's eye yeah better than the original got hard so I started out with the Ben & Jerry's challenge with the intent to make for the flavors and then ended up making eight flavors I think my favorite ice cream is Chris nachio Marashi oh I think that's the flavor that has the best flavor balance and texture hands down but I really like a lot of the flavors I think that Andy is and even Andy turned out great I just love the proportions of nuts - chocolate - banana all in all super fun I had a great time who doesn't love ice cream here's how you make gourmet Ben and Jerry's to make the creme anglaise base combine a half liter of heavy cream 1/2 liter of whole milk a pinch of kosher salt and 1 teaspoon vanilla paste in a large saucepan bring to a bare simmer over medium in a large bowl vigorously whisk a large egg yolks and 200 grams of sugar until very pale and thick and a ribbon forms whisking constantly stream several large ladles of the hot milk mixture into the eggs then pour the entire mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium stirring constantly in a figure-eight motion with a wooden spoon until the mixture reaches 180 degrees Fahrenheit on an instant-read thermometer and the custard coats the back of a spoon remove from the heat blend and desired flavor then stir over ice until cold process in an ice cream machine until it's the consistency of soft serve stir and desired additions and then pack into pints and freeze to make Chris - ium ratio decrease the sugar and the base by 50 grams and blend 300 grams of sweetness Sicilian pistachio paste and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract into the still hot creme anglaise fold toasted salted whole skin pistachios into the churned ice cream before freezing to make dulce de Gabriela a fold in a dulce de leche ribbon and free solid to make and even Andy blend the flesh of four whole roasted bananas bake at 425 until burst and lightly caramelized into the still hot base 3

the cold plain base then stream melted chocolate into the ice cream while still in the machine free solid to make fudge off and leave me Sola insert a fudge core into the center of a pint packed with mad mint fury road [Music] Oh it's Cheerios hang low yeah that song", "AvsyhlLMuv8": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today i will show you my weekly meal planning many ideas preparations and heaps of recipes so that you can stay organized throughout the week and be able to make healthy meals for your family in no time there are two ways to meal plan first you make your menu for the week based on which you shop groceries and do pre-preparations over the weekend and follow your menu rest of the week second do grocery shop first then based on what you have on hand you plan your meals around those ingredients not like traditional menu planning where you plan and buy groceries accordingly i prefer to follow second method as i am an intuitional eater i like to cook what i feel like eating and many times we have leftover food so if i have a preset menu i cannot follow it throughout the week as we have to finish leftover food first also some days if you don't feel like cooking you can cheat with an easy meal like kitchery also doing preparations over the weekend is very important step to meal plan so that cooking never becomes hectic during the week and you have all the ingredients available on hand as and when you need also through meal plan you can include variety and balanced diet in your life meal prepping will not take you 40 minutes or even an hour as a lot of people claim it to be it will certainly take you a couple of hours over the weekend but if you keep all four gases occupied make green chutney or ginger garlic paste simultaneously that is use your grinder blender and multitask then you can certainly aim at finishing all prep in few hours but it will give you a lot of peace during the week also if you meal plan you can have a look at your weekly menu and analyze if you have proper amount of protein dairy green leafy vegetables etc in your diet and if you need to make any changes you can certainly do it next week so let me first show you my this week's menu as you can see we have four meals a day breakfast lunch evening snacks and dinner if we are hungry in between we look for fruits or milk evening snacks are very quick and easy and i bet you will find many ideas for quick and healthy evening snacks so keep watching now let's first look at what kind of preparations i do during the weekend to make my coming week smooth first helping ingredients ingredients like coriander green chilies ginger and curry leaves are the ingredients that we use in most indian dishes so having a spice box like this makes cooking hassle free i line this four compartment box with a paper towel and store all ingredients whenever i am cooking i will simply take out this box use what i require and put it back in the fridge easy and convenient second storing vegetables when it comes to storing vegetables in the fridge i like to cut off the ends of green vegetables like spinach and coriander and store them in a box with a paper lining at the top and at the bottom paper towel absorbs all moisture from vegetables preventing them from rotting and keeping them fresh for at least 2 weeks i buy a big bunch of coriander and store most in this box and little in my spice box i will also separate methi and mint leaves and store them in a similar way hindi or okra i will wash and pat dry and leave it on the counter top for an hour to dry then i will store bhindi in a mash bag like this and it stays crisp and fresh for whole week third green chutney i make a batch of green chutney to make green chutney i take 3s to 1 ratio of coriander and mint add black salt lemon chaat masala and roasted jeera blend it with little water and green chutney is ready it takes around 15 minutes to make green chutney during the week i will be using this chutney for cheese chutney sandwich pani puri vegetable sandwich it can be used in paneer tikka or catty rolls etc i have a bunch of recipe videos on my channel and i will link them in description box below as it is not possible to show each and every recipe in one single video 4. tomato paste many times if time permits me i prefer to make tomato paste this not only saves me space in the fridge but it makes making sabzi 50 quicker than using fresh tomatoes to make tomato paste i will take around 3 kgs of tomato and blend them now i will take a deep vessel add half cup oil then add tomato puree and cook it until oil separates this will take around 30 minutes 1 kg tomato will fill one mason jar [Music] fifth is pizza sauce if i have pizza in my menu i will prepare pizza sauce you can either use the tomato paste that we just made or use to bought tomato cans my little kids love to eat margarita pizza so i make pizza sauce with hidden vegetables in it i will boil capsicum beetroot and carrots in a pressure cooker i will add very little waters a few tablespoons only once boiled i will blend them all i will also add one tomato can around around 200 grams of tomato paste and mix them all now add salt black pepper oregano and italian herb mix and pizza sauce is ready this will last at least three to four days in the fridge sixth is soaking lentils and pulses i will take out a combination of three pulses or lentils for every week and soak them overnight next day i will boil one and refrigerate other two i will put soaked pulses in a box without any water and keep it in the fridge i will boil the night before i knead them boiling things like rajma and chickpea take a long time and slight delays can really throw you out of the game when you are in a hurry so get these stars out of the way beforehand i will leave moong at room temperature to sprout which should take around 2 days if you have not soaked any dal the night before yellow moong dal is a very good option i wash around half cup dal and add around 2 glasses of water and cook it on low flame i will only add salt turmeric green chili and fresh coriander no masalas i will temper it with jeera in the end and serve this dal with paratha you can eat this dal as it is if you feel like eating lentil soup friday nights i prefer not to make any rotis as i do not have to pack my husband's next day lunch so i prefer dal chawal kadhi chawal or rajma chawal etc break from making rotis i love pani puri and because i make it so often my kids now love it too so to make instant pani puri i will take green chutney that i prepared over the weekend add water lemon juice chaat masala pani puri masala and paneer is ready potato and kala chana is already boiled and we always have puri in our pantry so we can enjoy pani puri whenever we feel like it with boiled kala chana you can also make kala chana chaat or salad to make chaat add oil jeera boiled chana all dry masalas chaat masala and lemon juice to make salad cut veggies of your choice add kala chana black salt lemon juice and fresh coriander so you can take one ingredient and you can make multiple recipes or multiple items from it and you can enjoy over the week also chickpea or chana chaat is another great snack i would saute boiled chanas with jeera and our basic masala like coriander and jeera powder turmeric and salt or black salt add lemon juice chaat masala fresh coriander and chana chaat is ready seventh is moong sprouts if i have soaked moong i will generally sprout them as i can use it in number of ways i can saute them by adding spices and make masala sprouts or i can make healthy and fulfilling salad using moong sprouts or we can simply munch on them eighth is boiled potatoes boiled potatoes are always a savior whether you want to make instant pani puri aloo paratha aloo rolls for breakfast or quick aloo ki sabzi boiled potatoes are must if you are planning your weekly meal i will keep two to three potatoes aside and mash the rest mashed potatoes i can use for pani puri aloo paratha or aloo rolls to make potato rolls i will prepare stuffing wherein i am adding salt red chili fresh coriander and temper with mustard seeds i will now fill this in moist bread and make rolls and later deep fry serve it with green chutney or ketchup and fruits on the side and breakfast is ready with other potatoes i can make aloo ki sabzi or slice them and use in vegetable sandwich which we generally like to eat on saturday evenings for dinner as it is my husband's turn to make dinner and he prefers to make different styles of sandwiches ninth is milk powder i make dry fruits milk powder for my kids at home to make dry fruits powder i will roast dry fruits of my choice in a pan then let them cool down then in a blender i will add dry fruits cardamom seeds saffron and little nutmeg and blend i save it for smooth texture if i have to make milk using this powder i will boil milk by adding 2 tbsp milk powder and keep boiling for 5 to 10 minutes once it's lukewarm i will serve to my kids i will also thinly slice some almonds cashews pistas and store in a jar to make saffron milk which my kids absolutely love it is a good idea to include lots of nuts and seeds in the diet because they are easy to eat and full of every possible nutrient i have a full video on milk recipe for kids link for which you will find in the description box below tenth is paneer i make paneer at home for paneer bhurji but i also buy paneer from stove for paneer tikka or paneer sabsi wherein i need cubes of paneer one really great option with paneer is to make tandoori paneer roll link of tandoori paneer roll is in the description box below as it is not in my menu this week so i do not have the recipe eleventh is dosa batter i usually keep two liter dosa batter in my fridge we buy it from indian grocery shop as it is convenient making idli sambar masala idli dosa uttapam becomes so easy and quick if you have batter right in your fridge 12th is roasted semolina or suji if i want to make upma or suji kashira the most time consuming part is roasting the suji itself so once a fortnight i will roast a batch of suji to be used in upma dhokla or sheera you can prepare dhokla batter night before take half cup semolina add yogurt salt fresh coriander curry leaves i like to microwave curry leaves and once it is dry i crush it in the batter also add few crushed cashews and lastly add water and make batter put it in the fridge and take it out first thing in the morning before making dhokla add a quarter teaspoon eno and make dhoklas as usual lastly temper with mustard and sesame seeds and fluffy dhoklas are ready also you don't have to do everything on one single day you can do the night before or you can plan two days ahead which is what i personally like to do but having a menu a weekly menu on hand is crucial as you do not want to think what shall i cook tomorrow as it wastes your time now so that all the prep is done so let's go back at the menu and see how many items have we covered and done pre-prep for so for breakfast we have aloo rolls for which we have boiled potatoes cheese chutney sandwich we have green chutney ready uttapam we have already veggies and batter in the fridge kala chana chaat we have boiled kala chana and have cut broccolis and stored in mesh bags avocado toast does not need any prep and it usually takes five to seven minutes to make chana chaat for which i have soaked chanas i will boil them the night before moong sprouts which are in the process of sprouting and hence it's later in the week in the menu upma for which we have roasted the soji likewise you can go through the rest of the menu and see if you have covered all menu items and have done the required bit over the weekend or the night before now let's see what options we have for evening snacks my kids are usually very hungry after their afternoon nab and i need a quick snack for them when they wake up i make yummy kaju cookies at home all it takes is half cup butter half cup sugar 1 cup maida and 1 cup crushed cashews mix all ingredients and make a cookie dough you might need few tablespoons of milk to bind the cookie dough make small disc and bake at 180 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes and kaju cookies are ready i would serve these cookies with milk to my kids and they will feel full after few cookies another great snack item is khakra and laughing cows cheese which is soft creamy cheese corn chaat is another healthy and yummy option for evening snacks edamame beans is great source of protein and i usually boil it in the microwave by adding water and salt for around 20 minutes and it makes a great time for snack for kids they sit on the swing and are occupied eating edamame for next hour it's fun for them to open the pods eat it and they are literally chatting on the swing and having fun my kids love urad dal vada and green chutney combination and see if i had not menu plant and neither had vara patter or green chutney for this snack for kids i sometimes surprise my kids with chocolate fruits like chocolate strawberry you can also use other fruits like mango peaches or even bananas kids love variation and instead of just eating plain chocolate i prefer to give them with fruits and chocolate strawberries are their absolute favorite my son loves berries so i would mix some berries and give it to him i try and give fruits to them with breakfast and in between meals when they feel hungry nuts and seeds are another thing that we munch on have you ever tried honey cashews simply drizzle some honey on cashews if you are having any sweet cravings mint makhanas are another snack that we absolutely love i will link a video in the description box if you are interested to know how i make mint makhanas so guys this concludes my meal plan and prep video i hope you got some ideas inspiration and motivation to me plan your week life is getting busier and busier and it is very convenient to order a takeaway or look for a packet of chips from your pantry but it has its own long-term consequences so let's take our health into our hands and start meal planning as it is hundred times better than having a takeaway hope you like the meal ideas and recipes i shared i will link few recipe videos in the description box below if you'd like to explore and i shall see you in my next video bye for now you", "p_UVbQd4_ns": "what i i don't understand you're breaking up with me what have i done wrong what with who [Applause] it was just a nightmare joe what is the time 10 a.m i really need to get some breakfast in i've got a bulk but at the same time i can't really be bothered i just want to stay in bed and watch youtube so are you ever in this position maybe not the part about having a nightmare over pesto but i mean skipping breakfast have you ever considered it or done it if this is the first time you've seen my face hi i'm joe i am a very skinny guy naturally i have a very fast metabolism and over the course of the last nine months i've been trying to bulk up my body due to my fast metabolism and desire to gain weight i need to make sure that i'm consuming a lot of calories throughout the day and that includes breakfast now me personally used to always skip breakfast due to not really having an appetite when i wake up and also i used to not really enjoy what i made myself for breakfast i used to think that this was just a meat problem and i was the only one who suffered this however after getting in contact and seeing a lot of comments from other skinny guys like me i basically found out that it was a universal thing for us to not really enjoy eating breakfast so that's why in today's video i'm giving four breakfast options which are high in calories they're relatively easy to consume and of course they're tasty which motivates you to go and eat them let's do it [Music] okay so for breakfast option number one we've got protein french toast [Music] this stuff tastes absolutely amazing trust me each just a slice has 200 calories in and they usually have about four slices in total so that's an 800 calorie breakfast just like that so the ingredients you'll need to make this are four slices of bread two eggs blue milk sugar cinnamon powder vanilla extract and then finally some vanilla protein powder this is off my protein if you want to get anything on the my protein website including any of this protein powder if you just type in my code joe you get 30 off your entire order just click the first link in my description it will also help me out first crack two eggs into a bowl whisk it a little to break the yolks pour 60 milliliters or one quart cup of blue milk add one teaspoon of sugar then an eighth of a teaspoon of cinnamon powder a pinch of salt and then a drop of vanilla extract whisk it up a lot and then add a scoop of protein powder and continue whisking until it's as little bits as possible next set the pan to medium high dip both sides of the bread into the mixture and then put it onto the pan it should have patches of golden brown that's when you know that each side's done finally to make it taste even better and add some more calories add stuff like golden syrup nutella honey whatever you want onto it voila super easy to make extremely high calorie wow proper tasty french toast made now do remember that this has 800 calories in i could get this down in a good 5-10 minutes the fact that it also tastes proper good makes you a lot more motivated when you're in bed and you're like do i make breakfast if it's tasty you're more likely to make it i'm gonna get on to devouring all of these now so for breakfast option number two something which i don't want to go over for too long because i mentioned it in previous videos however if it's your first time in the channel you really need to know about this it is the phaser shake this relatively not too large quantity of liquid contains 920 calories it tastes really good which a lot of you guys can vouch for me after all the story posts i've seen again i have mentioned this in previous videos so for regular viewers i don't want to drag on this too much 250 milliliters of blue milk 2.5 scoops of vanilla ice cream a handful of raspberries or just mixed berry fruits 2 tablespoons of greek yogurt 1.5 scoops of strawberry whey protein 1 banana 30 grams of oats and some ice obviously these are liquid calories so they're the easiest calories to consume smash one of these down you and it's nearly a thousand calories just like [Music] that okay so breakfast option number three we have got egg and bacon wrap now this is just the base some stuff which can be added to this are hash browns make them say it tastes so much better adds way more calories if you like mayonnaise add that as well even more calories ketchup honestly anything you think which will make this nicer add it because there's no harm in doing so because it will inevitably add more calories having them in wraps just makes them so easy to eat they're all condensed into this one small thing make two maybe three of these every morning they taste amazing got that many calories in to make it i have two slices of bacon and one egg inside just a white wrap you can add more bacon you can add more eggs it's up to you this one but it's a very very good breakfast i'm gonna eat them up then get a workout in and then we'll go on to the fourth idea for a breakfast finally back in the home gym after being off for a week yeah we're back to doing weights [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] right then so for breakfast option number four we've got one that i have basically every morning it may seem pretty simple but it's just one of those go-to simple breakfasts which you personally can get creative with of what you have on it let me show you now with the eggs you can have it as scrambled eggs you can have it as an omelette i mean or you could do it like i did where you try and make an omelette but you're so bad at flipping that it eventually turns into this they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine but you just can't get into it because they would never understand but just however you want to make your eggs now quantity wise i have four eggs in this and i have about 100 grams of dry oats in total there's that many calories and i'm gonna admit this isn't the most calorie dense meal that i've used for it's not even the tastiest but if you go on to any of my full days of eating or any of my day in the life videos you'll always see me eating this every morning and the main reason is eggs and oats are the most such basic necessities you can get it from basically any store and just the convenience of how quick it is to make this and how easy it is to make this i mean it's definitely the easiest to make out of all four breakfasts it's just good because like in the morning when you can't really be bothered to do anything something like this is super easy to make and although it's not the most exciting meal in the world i've been eating the same meal for like a year i'm not bored of it yeah also this meal add toppings of your choice it's not like you're limited to anything because the more toppings you add the more calories and that's essentially what you want for example on my oatmeal i add raisins raisins are extremely calorie dense and they just make it taste sweeter and a lot nicer if i'm being completely honest all i do is just change up the breakfast every day maybe if you find one out of the four which you like so much and just keep to that because that's great but just the important thing is sticking to a routine making sure that you don't get bored of the meals so you don't stay in bed in the morning instead of eating breakfast yo what's up guys hope you're having a great day uh as you can see not that many people who watch your videos are actually subscribe to the channel i'd really appreciate it if you could just hit the subscribe button yeah cheers guys", "S-5u-yxQebk": "Phil's here to reveal the results of our Battle of the deserts quite excited about this who has one right is the question everywhere over 9,000 folks and 52% [Music] okay well that's fine that's what I do like an apple crumble with the ice cream or something where's the sticky toffee pudding on that with in that picture I think draw it away I've got one here crumble first you're toast okay it would taste like you looking you toss analysis right formulates it goes very simple but basically to get right John the facing were to get wrong as you know yeah no yeah yeah yeah right in this pan here I have brown the apples now you can get various types of cooking apples this is a Bramley apple as you can see here you can't get halgate wonder or various other varieties which when they cook down they marmalade and I just need to show you this bit here they said what they call marmalade so the apple juice starts to break down oh I see yeah potato yes it's just tossed a break though you don't miss a trick do you look at you right egg this pan so I'm just gonna cook these down very slightly so you'll see just there it's not a sugar though not the moment okay don't add juice of one lemon zest of one lemon sugar no you run about 200 grams but it depends on the sweetness of the Apple music dessert apples fits those shoes Haas about sugar but they don't break down as much do you do you prefer a little more bitter apple than a sweet Apple I do because I think a you get a nicer texture I would come on to that in a bit in a second and also you get that a more pronounced apple flavor if that's putting it are you you cook a lot of hope well Scott does cooking but he cooks sorry Scott he cooks a little blandly simple steak and chips and or steak and potatoes and rice right but I like to put a little sauce on it so this is much more at my speed but my thing is getting the crumble right because I the crumble right you pay attention so I have touch of water to this will help it all this way and if you don't add a liquid that don't tend to marmalade over here I imagine they'd be cooked for a roundabout this is very good can I just say people big mistake huge you should have gone for the apple crumble right I really appreciate it in this bowl what I've done here is I put this in it just to demonstrate how much liquid you get out there now because we've did this ahead of time you do get a bit of more moisture coming out there so what you do is you strain the apple otherwise it'll end up going soggy correct the only half like only half you know if you like but that gives that lovely syrup flavor underneath your crumble crumble it no but bit correct also again how do you know when the apples have cooked enough you don't because as I've just said to you when they break down slightly lish you're gonna cook it again in the oven thank you for 40 minutes silence okay so you it's a two-stage cooking process crumble code you for goodness sake I can't help it right in this bowl here it's chopping bow I have plain flour yes I have to watch that I'm gonna add butter this is colder the busts of the better what okay because if it's warm and you look and you chew it up in a bit so the best of the bunch it's going to section a woman up and you'll melt the butter right so what you need to do is wizards up until it just incorporates okay and it doesn't get warm it's warm it goes into a paste all right that's where you becomes very heavy that's ready now okay that's a good look at that I'll be very lazy then what you do is you put that into a bowl yeah and even if you have small amounts of butter in there it makes no difference because you want to get a lovely crumble hang on then you add the sugar at this point and what it gives a bit of crunch yes but if you put it in this stage if you over beat it becomes like a pastry don't want to over beat it no you don't John I think if not worse to say there I couldn't think of eating quicker laughing anyway and what you do shoes then fold in the crumble with us just doing that face because I've just series you're over there I was like it's like it's like over Union so you mix it with a spoon and that way get a love you like crumble Oh looks like frost golden rule here one-third fruit 2/3 crumble no yes you've already complicated it for me just pour it on but there's more crumble than you realize get out get out of it and what you do not sure just move it up don't pack it down just make it nice and light Wow well I wouldn't have made it like that no I would have done much less into the I would have made it more chunky I would have to I'd have done chunky crumble and less 190-200 round about 20 to 25 minutes I'm intrigued thank you now when it comes out John you leave it pay attention now about 20 mr. half an hour okay otherwise it's too hot and if it's too hot you can't taste them it burns your mouth now we couldn't have that John could be no no you can serve it when are you sir you said it's all got the accompaniments right what do you accompany it with because this is gonna be my thing we have here we have touch of cream now if Phil was here he'd be all over that no that's it baby gone with me and we also have ice cream ice cream because I'm not a custard I'm gonna go ice cream and I'm not a cream latte 13 and custard you can tell the president's been in the jungle on - yeah this is what we did you're not oh he did that makes me feel ill I knew as a mistake cookie we use anyway that's an honor of Harry Harry red now I know you love your custard mayors and that was some of your jungle friends are watching this morning aren't they because the you I just threw you on the water yeah they were saying with the fat sack whatsapp group that we have they were saying you know well done so yeah guys Cheers so there you guys what do you think to sweets it's so light and the hot Nicole is really nice Emily did you say you put lemon in that juice and zest I've got I've got lemon trees in my garden trouble me no tell you what where's that sense of pain let him know Palm Springs Palm Springs when I go back home I'm gonna do an apple crumble like you just did I'm gonna show using the fruit from our garden and I'm gonna make one and I'll take a picture and show you picture I want to see the crumble though I like thick crumble and that crumbles a game-changer really good choice I take it back this is lovely thanks Bill okay thanks but all the recipe and details look at this morning app you", "Tba8bbjuPdQ": "[Music] oh my arteries right now looking at me night what is up you guys today i am back with a new video and i am so excited because we are back with a tick tock video these are my favorite videos to film i'm obsessed with tick tock aren't we all i've seen so many starbucks drinks on tick tocks where you guys you know you ask for a specialty drink or completely make up a new drink and i am here for it i have tried quite a few that i've seen on tick tock and i have always been impressed so today i thought it would be fun to make my own tik tok starbucks drinks at home i found 10 drinks on starbucks that looked really yummy as you can imagine the research was a little bit uh it was something girl because you know not only are you adding those like special ingredients and stuff but like you have to figure out how to make the original drink i'm not a barista so and we are recreating the drinks with things that we found in stores so there was some stuff we had to improvise listen we're gonna give it our all i'm excited i'm nervous and i'm ready okay the first one that i found on tick tock is called the pink starburst drink i'm not 100 sure if it's already like on the menu at least i haven't heard of it this tick tock is showing us how to make the pink starburst drink which i'm excited about because not all the tick tocks show you how to make girl okay in order to make our pink starburst frappuccino we need the blender three pumps of raspberry syrup we couldn't find raspberry syrup so we got raspberry drops and this is for a sodastream this stuff is so strong like i don't even know how much we need i feel like as long as you give it that raspberry taste next up we need three scoops of vanilla bean powder again we did not find vanilla bean powder but we're using something that i feel like would taste similar this is actually vanilla flavored creamer i'm assuming the vanilla bean powder like makes it also thicker we got this which is also basically a protein powder one two three next up strawberry puree so she pours the strawberry puree up to about there i noticed with these tik tok videos like starbucks they measure a lot of things in the cup that stuff is good also this is not strawberry puree like from the store this is uh one that we made here oh my god what am i doing oh gosh this is so bad so this is how much lemonade we add then she adds extra powder so we're just gonna we're just gonna do it okay so far it looks promising next up she adds four pumps of cream base now cream base is something we couldn't find but there is simple syrup and i feel like this is pretty similar it's basically just a syrup four pumps to me equals four tablespoons four she also does a venti scoop of ice uh so i just took a ventica fill it up with ice and okay let's just go ahead and blend it and see what happens [Music] okay i feel like that might be it right i'm gonna pour it into my cup that i was measuring my strawberry puree because i think it would be bomb [Music] all right here's the taste test you guys first of all let's just take a little moment and really appreciate how good this looks i'm all proud of myself it probably takes so it's supposed to taste like a starburst drink okay let's see girl i feel like oh wait the aftertaste is starburst holy crap i'm like no wait i'm sorry literally like three seconds later like i feel like i just ate a starburst like what i have the starburst tasting i know what you mean yeah for it to be the tester like i'm really impressed this is really good and i definitely taste the starburst i'm literally pouring it up for everybody else out here so it's not going to waste there's about five of us in here waiting to drink some starbucks girl let it sit for a couple seconds the aftertaste dude this is good though like i feel like something i would get at starbucks flabbergasted flabbergasted so this next drink it doesn't really have a name it's kind of like a starbucks hack she took four shots of espresso then she added some kind of like protein to it it's double shot so i'm assuming it's two each i don't know she also did show the cup and it looked about halfway full so we're going to eyeball it smells so good [Music] i think that's all we need you guys and she just used a protein shake we have a keto friendly hey girl this is vanilla and we're just gonna add it in whoa okay and that's that's the hack i think this is gonna be a lot for me honestly oh sh oh this is really good i might be off my rocker in a couple hours girl but i feel like as the taste wise it tastes pretty good it's a little strong a little bit it tastes like like a chocolate milk to me chocolate milk girl this is like this is gonna wake you up as somebody who doesn't like love like strong strong coffee it's bomb that's a really cool little hack that's probably the easiest one in this whole video let's get into another little complicated one but let's feel like a barista again [Music] okay you know what we did the frap we did the coffee let's do a refresher so this is how to make your own mango dragon fruit refresher at home okay so she starts off with one cup of watermelon tea we couldn't find watermelon tea but we're gonna improvise with some watermelon syrup the same one that we use like the raspberry but this is a watermelon one it won't be a tea but it will have that watermelon taste and then we're gonna mix in a cup of pink lemonade she pours in her rehydrated dragon fruit we found something similar it says peach and dragon fruit chia seeds it's the closest that we can get i think it should still taste good oh my gosh lastly we're gonna add one tablespoon of the syrup we're gonna give it a little mix and pour it into your cup of ice get some of those chunks in there mango dragon fruit refresher diy girl um watermelon this is the first one that might not taste exactly like it but i don't know what it tastes like because i haven't tasted it but i think it's good and i can see somebody ordering this at starbucks it's sweet like a refresher it's really fruity they're not bad for a diy homemade little moment like it might not taste exactly like the drink this one but it's a bomb drink and if my friend is for me girl it looks like you got it from starbucks like next up we're doing a bubblegum frappuccino with strawberry puree and we're gonna go to the bottom as well so we're going up to right there that seems like a popular measurement with strawberry puree and then whole milk to the first black line this looks good okay now we pour it in the blender that looks real good girl and then you add two pumps of raspberry syrup again you know with the first one i feel like i added quite a bit so i'm just gonna add a dash of it you just wanted to give it that flavoring some ice four pumps of cream base oh boom i'm feeling like a barista like actually this is kind of crazy starbucks hire me they put more puree at the bottom oh look at so that we're just gonna go off the sides girl make it look nice and fancy now you pour it in lastly they top it off with some whipped cream all right here's the taste test what is it i'm like mind blown because i thought that starbucks had these crazy secret ingredients and we just made this the bubblegum taste oh my god it's so weird but i think the milk mixed with the raspberry and the strawberry is what gives you the bubble gum taste mind blown this is so weird i actually really like this one [Music] if i could finish one of these it would be this one i like it that's good that's really good okay honestly if you guys like strawberries and cream 10 out of 10 recommend uh you do get a little bit after taste of bubblegum really like it's like way in the background she's not front and center but love her this one's really good i want to drink it all [Music] s'mores frappuccino this one is a recipe on tik tok that i found i mean these are all tik tok recipes curry now they're all tit talk recipes got a blender okay so two shots of espresso ooh girl i'm gonna be wired today one cup of milk that looks so good already some chocolate sauce doesn't say how much she just kind of goes off so i think that's enough ice then she heats up some marshmallows and pours them in there but i'm actually just gonna go in with some marshmallow fluff about two spoons oh my god i'm bending the spoon i'm just gonna have to go in with a nail oh oh oh oh oh oh no okay now we're just gonna whip it up okay and then before we pour that into our cup we're gonna add some more of that chocolate sauce oh ew how do they do it how cute i'm confused maybe like this whipped cream oh she's a thick one some graham cracker crumbs mmm put this on top oh this is caramel girl but it still look i'm still gonna do it i'm doing it oh my goodness oh my gosh this looks legit let's give it a taste test wow i'm shocked it's not as sweet as i thought it was gonna be unless i have so much sugar i can't taste sugar no more it tastes like dark chocolate right it tastes just like coffee i feel like i get a chocolate mocha which is really good i just don't taste this marshmallow as much as i thought i would but whoa i am so impressed by these drinks regardless they taste like they're straight out of starbucks it's crazy i think i could have used more marshmallow fluff oh my god i just got some of that chocolate oh my god it's so good it's pretty bomb this is crazy tick-tock i need to like chill with these drinks because i keep like and i literally have gone to the restroom twice already i'm starting to get really hyper and we're only five drinks in so i should really calm down [Music] next up we're gonna need one cup of milk okay and then two pumps of raspberry again like i said this raspberry stuff is very strong i'm gonna add a tad bit that's it three vanilla bean scoops next up we need a scoop of strawberries scoop of ice four pumps of cream base one two three four close it right up and a blend whipped cream okay this i am shook about really cotton candy frappuccino cotton candy cotton candy and it doesn't taste like the bell that one it doesn't it tastes a little different oh my god the aftertaste is like cotton candy the house this recipe was really similar to the bubble gum one which is weird because they taste so different i didn't understand how the heck that tasted like bubble gum and i'm even more confused now because it's almost the same ingredients but this tastes like cotton candy what the what and it's not just like me thinking it like it does taste different than the bubble gum this is the most accurate like to the tea taste that i've tasted with a drink if you want to make any of these and like truly be shocked at what you just made make the cotton candy one so this is the blended strawberry lemonade that we have had a lot myra actually hyped this drink up so much uh like last year and i got so addicted to it it's so bomb it's basically lemonade with strawberry puree some ice and it's just blended i've had this a lot so if i could compare a drink to something i've tried it would be this one get our blender oh this comes out right myra is gonna be on a stretcher so we need one cup of lemonade ice strawberry puree i'm gonna measure it with a cup to that little line down there pour it in and when we used to ask for this drink we always ask for extra strawberries so i'm just gonna just you know a little more of that three scoops of strawberries we're gonna go in with dried strawberries one two three okay guys let's see if this is it okay let's give it a taste does it taste like the one we used to drink very similar but it needs more lemonade that thing used to be sour remember it's pretty similar it's just a little bit more sour the one that we used to get it's pretty similar enough it's pretty bomb the one we used to go was more sour that's pretty spot on though that's like pretty sweet that's so weird that's pretty spot-on doesn't it taste kind of like the one we used to get starbucks is shaking girl do you want my i made a cotton candy one a few moments later next up we're going to be making an oreo chocolate chip frappuccino but they substituted white mocha so let's just get straight into this one this one looks really good i love oreo so the tik tok recipe calls for one cup of espresso and three pumps of white mocha we couldn't find just like white mocha but we did find white chocolate mocha espresso so it's like a two in one so instead of doing that we're just gonna go ahead and use one cup of this because it already has the espresso in it it smells amazing by the way i'm so excited for all the beverages i'm gonna be making in the next four weeks one cup of this two scoops of mini chocolate chips one two some ice also if you want to know measurement for ice i'm literally just filling up the venti cup with eyes so it's just really as big as your drink is and two scoops of vanilla bean powder in this case the protein vanilla powder for us it's been working just great bam bam and blend okay all right now we're gonna drizzle our cup it says to go in with chocolate but i'm going in with chocolate and caramel okay whipped cream caramel on chocolate you know i'm gonna do it girl you know i'ma do it you're kidding is it good it's good i mean i have not tasted a bad one honestly i do feel like this is the first one though where like i taste a powder like i the texture she's pretty good right she see you could see i know which powder i know what you mean but is she a bob loki you're gonna be up all night [Music] it's okay there's only two more drinks only two more [Music] this is called the ariana grande frappuccino now why is it called the ariana grande frappuccino i don't know is it her favorite drink did they just name it after her does it give you ari vibes i don't know what it is but we're gonna try it out because it's viral on tick tock and it looks pretty bomb you're gonna need one cup of milk veggie scoop of ice okay so next up is two pumps of mocha syrup which is technically like chocolate don't quote me we just see online that it's kind of like you know like a chocolate flavored thing so we're going to improvise and use um some chocolate sauce and just do two squirts of that two to three pumps of raspberry again adding a tad bit of this and then java chips which is coffee flavored chocolate it's a chocolate that is you know coffee based it looks like it has a filling or something but you know what i don't think this could go wrong i'm so confident in these drinks they've all tasted really similar to the actual thing so i'm just gonna toss this in there and it's gonna blend it right up that looks about enough four pounds of cream base oh blend it up this is a really chocolatey drink it looks like but also there's raspberry syrup oh my arteries right now like looking at me like pour it up pour it up smells good whipped cream caramel [Music] oh yo this is like actually the best one hand down thank you this table is really messy right now you might not even be able to see much but you know we've been keeping up with it but 10 starbucks screens later girl and i am sticky you're also super hyper i could tell oh my god we eat by now i feel like i'm like let's go 10 more but is it bomb [Music] stupid flies i know exactly why they call it ariana grande's sweetener it's so skinny oh it's so good that one's like 10 out of 10. yo this is really good but like really sugary somebody take the drink away from me now i'm hyper enough the raspberry with the chocolate yes i forgot about the raspberry that's what gives it that touch last but definitely not least is basically a tick tock hack where you order a pink drink but you replace the coconut milk with heavy cream in this case of course i'm just gonna make it this one calls for a passion tea concentrate so we're gonna add about a cup of this so we searched up how to make a pink drink and we looked at different recipes they're all different so we're just kind of going based on those that we saw we're taking a cup of the passion tea concentrate now this is not gonna be a frappuccino but i am gonna blend the mixture because we are gonna use that protein powder we're gonna add some strawberry puree the recipes don't really mention uh measurements so we're just kind of eyeballing it we need a packet of instant very very hibiscus and you can find these in stores a pack of that and three scoops of vanilla bean powder three of these before we add the other stuff we're actually gonna go ahead and blend this up all we needed was for the powder to blend in i think we should be good i'm excited to try this one because this is another drink that i've actually tried from starbucks it was so so good it reminded me of a strawberries and cream drink we're gonna add some dried strawberries mix in there and now we pour it in [Music] and we are not done we're actually going to go in with the heavy whipping cream let's mix it up you're kidding oh my gosh this tastes like the one we had what the heck i haven't just i'm honestly just really shocked because i feel like we're improvising a lot and hoping that they work and they are working out just fine as long as you have the ingredients that are as similar as possible it works it could use a little bit of a tiny bit more let me see what i'm adding more of that puree because i feel like the other one has more strawberry this has more whipping cream that's the one i cannot believe i just made 10 starbucks drinks because of tick-tock in my house just looked up some tick tocks went to target and now we have 10 starbucks drinks that taste really darn close if anything some of them were like to the t of the starbucks drinks tick tock girl you have really outdone yourself i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you guys try any of these drinks out make sure to tag me on instagram right here i can't wait to see what you guys make trust me when i say this

hey everybody welcome to i don't even know what number this is sarah dawn of dining with the divas my name is gina this is the lovely dawn and this is the lovely sarah here tonight and sarah what are we doing with the divas we are making appetizers tonight all cheesy appetizers all super easy um we were just talking kind of like about the equipment we're getting ready nothing's on the stove today everything's going to be in the oven which is kind of cool you don't have to get turn your stove into a mess when you're trying to entertain people so this will be really fun we're going to make spinach artichoke dip stuffed mushrooms and then like a bruschetta caprese mashup sort of thing yeah me that sounds good to me so uh for those of you who are new to this welcome if you have a youtube account you can ask questions via the youtube chat function if you're not we're going to try to answer questions that everybody else has and hopefully we'll answer your question uh so that's kind of it in a nutshell where do we begin we've done a toast but what are we drinking we should probably begin there because it is friday night what are everybody's doing what are we drinking yeah we're drinking a delicious blend it's hidden assets from lucas and luellen it's a 2017 and it's um from their choice lots they call choice lots of melvac merlot syrah patient cabernet franc so it's a really good little spicy wine it has hints of pomegranate and raspberry but it's really velvety so it's not like a super tanaki wine yeah and this is a santa barbara wine oh it's going to s really really delicious and what was the blend again it is melbeck merlot syrah petit syrah and cabernet i almost was going to say a meritage but it's not because there's one more wine added so meritage is only three meritage is five it's five right oh see learn something meritage is five and this is six six uh grapes so um oh okay so it could not be a meritage okay but it smells i mean when you smell it it smells so good it's like really nice big nice big big berries berry flav uh smell on here yeah and then it has that little hint of spice to it so good and santa barbara right nice place so all good all around unless aged it's aged for 16 months in french oak also so um that's um yeah it's yummy we should do a difference between french oak and american oak do you think you would notice the difference a lot of places will age in both okay they'll do french i don't know what the difference is right right yeah be kind of a steady an interesting study taste the french this american oak was grown down in georgia oh yeah it's so funny i have some really big oak tree across the street from my house it's huge it's huge and my neighbor says it's like 300 years old it's gigantic that's so massive that's so california like but it's growing right in there it grows out of these boulders like these we have these giant granite boulders and this there's this massive tree just growing out of it but it's it's very impressive so that's awesome so don't chop it down and put wine in it nope you're not chomping it down as fun as that sounds awesome all right it is so yummy i i will be drinking we will mm-hmm and hope you will enjoy it all as well i know we will actually won't be cooking with this one it's just drinking wine today so um you don't have to lose any of your dishes but let's unpack the bag i've already separated everything that i have by each recipe so on the left here is going to be everything you need for the spinach artichoke dip the one thing i did keep in the fridge for right now is the puff pastry it's going to be easier to handle the colder it is so if yours has been out of the fridge for a little while i pop it even into the freezer because by the time we get to it it'll be perfect temperature to work with can we touch base on that too so like most of the time you keep it frozen until you're ready right uh you keep it frozen until i would say you if you know you need it the next day keep it in the fridge overnight okay perfect yeah always chilled it handles better interesting as cold as possible because okay what puff pastry is so i made it when i was in culinary you said you kind and you said don't do it don't do it nobody does it nobody makes puff pastry you buy it everyone buys it because it is just the longest process to make so you start with your dough right um your bread dough and then you make this pad of butter so imagine this this cutting board we shape butter into this like using a sheet pan so this is like your block of butter how thick is it like this like imagine this whole thing that whole thing is a stick of a slab of butter and you take the dough and you put the butter in it and you fold the dough over you chill it and then you roll it back out fold it over chill it and then roll it out like so every time you fold you're layering dough and butter and dough and butter and that's why they say there's like a million layers in puff pastry because you just keep folding folding creating layers and layers so what you don't want to happen is that butter to melt so it gets because i did notice yeah it gets so um slippery yes that's the butter coming out the butter okay so you want it as cold as possible so that like the butter just like puffs up and that's what gets it really nice and airy when you're baking when you're baking and can you do puffy could i use that sushi to do a croissant oh definitely definitely that's exactly totally what is the base yeah which i've never tried some cool salt a croissant [Laughter] that we made in culinary school oh my first day yeah so with the puff pastry in the fridge um then we have our mayo sour cream a tub of whipped cream cheese you could use regular cream cheese if you wanted to but i think the whipped cream cheese really keeps its texture when you're trying to bake something and not get it all oozy spinach i have two types of cheese if you um i wrote on a little note that we included in your sheet to go ahead and shred the cheese if you haven't done that you can start on it now shred the holy cow and the parmesan for the spinach or cooked dip and then we also have our container of artichokes and you have a little egg we'll use as an egg wash um we also have some garlic here i included extra garlic for everyone just to use as much as you'd like as little as you'd like i think each of the three appetizers has garlic so use to your discretion here you have some mushrooms and then with the stuffed mushrooms we have a little thing of panko and some parsley and then i did already shred my pecorino for that one too um i have olive oil and the balsamic glaze that i make i put my olive oil in a little squeeze bottle just so i don't make a mess dribbling all over the place on this video but if you're just pouring it out of the uh tub that's totally fine too um and then for the bruschetta match-up thing we have some basil cherry tomatoes and some burrata where do we start because i want them all now right now um one question so we have lots of regulars on online we will say cheers to christine um once a diva always a diva christine cheers yes we have roger online so we better not you know say anything about the changing the temperature on the ac or anything is that we're not going to mention not going to mention a word and then carol one of our favorite uh virtual class takers carol thank you so much again for attending quick question before we dive on we're talking about the pup pastry the difference between puff and phyllo dough um because are they they're not the same i know so i think to be honest i don't know exactly what pillow dough is i've worked with it but i don't know how it's created i've never made it phyllo dough is so paper thin like thinner than paper paper and when you work with filo dough you have to create layers so you're almost kind of doing the same thing you're doing with puff pastry you'll do a sheet of pillow dough then brush it with butter another peel of the brush with butter and your layer of phyllo dough that's in whatever pastry that you're making is maybe going to be like six layers of filament yeah yeah so we did it once when our in our spanish pop-up dinner we stuffed it with goat cheese and figs so you did like your little rolls of filo dough and kind of made yeah that's such a different texture of the filo when you eat it and stuff that crunchiness yeah so the butter is dry it's very dry yeah you have to put honey butter and stuff in it or the puff already has so much butter that when you have to add that yeah the the puff pastry is like a dough that expands as it bakes and the phyllo is just something that i feel like just gets crispier flaky yeah okay you definitely could not make a croissant out of the field though so we're on tv yes right perfect um to start first thing i have my oven set to 400. is one of those days we're going to be really manipulating the oven and paying attention to prioritizing what goes in the oven at different times i learned now working here and i was oven spoiled as a kid so many ways to use ovens and people are always like stressed about thanksgiving dinner and i'm like what are you talking about just use your other oven like i didn't understand until about my own and now working in a place where all i have is a toaster oven but we love that toaster oven this is how we're gonna make it work first thing we're gonna do is toast our bread so i have some slices of baguette here um everyone should have gotten a baguette i sliced mine ahead of time or darn sliced it for me and done why do we slice on a bias like this we've used it these days yes i sliced on a bias today because we're going to fit more yumminess on those little pieces of baguette more food oh that's the idea i thought it was for aesthetics but you're saying well we usually usually just slice the bag out and i was like you know what i'm going to slice it on a bias today because i want to have sarah put more stuff on it because we're hungry yes okay i'm also going to season my baguette i feel like that's a lot of things people don't think of salt and pepper you know again that seasoning i watch the chefs i just want a little salt a handful yeah every time so don't underestimate the power oh yeah season as you go season the layers so you're not doing a ton of salt all at once at once okay so i'm going to pop this in the oven 450 degrees because that's what kind of works in my toaster oven if you have the broil setting that also works and that's super fast though right that you have to like be careful and this one will have to watch too but okay um is once i get drinking wine i have to tell my little siri to remind me to take it out yeah i'm notorious for burning stuff in my toaster oven my sister's always yelling at me because i'll be like i'll put something in and then i'll go and i'll start talking to her and then all of a sudden i'm like my sandwich just sitting there and it's like in flames at that point talk you talk i don't talk at all never i'm not a talker awesome so get the bread going soon so you're ready to top it with whatever yes red and going in first next we're going to do the filling for the mushrooms because every part of our dinner tonight has an aspect that needs to go in the oven so the mushroom filling let's see we're going to start with the bread crumbs this is going to be a super simple filling like i said i don't really want to use the stove what you could do is saute the take the stems out of the mushrooms saute those put them in but we're just stuffing up cheese and bread crumbs tonight it's going to be like simple that's the thing yeah we don't sometimes we over complicate recipes right right and you can make it taste just good keeping it simple yeah keeping it simple so i threw the bread crumbs in a little cup i'm gonna chop up the parsley and then if you need to grate your pecorino now's a good time to do so because that's going to go in as well as well talk about parsley because i always use italian parsley but does anybody use not italian parsley just what is it american person what is the other pearly parsley curly parsley same flavor no i don't care it's the same flavor i don't know i feel like yeah we used curly parsley and as a culinary school is cheaper and then if you're wanting to get a really fine it's almost crisper too so if you want to get a really fine chop on it it works a little bit better um i'm really big on using a ton of parsley i do really like the flavor i do particularly i do too so i want to taste them you can use salads and things like that to get more flavor i'm also going to do a little bit of garlic probably just one clove of garlic for this recipe i have my zester that i love to use for garlic if you don't have one of these you'll just chop it super fine but this makes it super easy i don't have to get my hands while sticky chopping it and it makes it super fine almost melts into the recipe yeah you don't even see the chunks of garlic i call it micro cleaner micro okay i love garlic oh me too this smell the next day the bread there's something about sauteing garlic that just really sets your taste buds uh alive yes is that why italian food is always so good they're always it must be frying the garlic the other thing is basil i mean whenever i smell basil i'm immediately hungry i'm just like oh god i have to have a nice italian sandwich obviously oh yeah sarah calls it my 45 minute sandwich but that's how long it takes me to make it but it's so worth it i think i've seen that production actually yeah the thought is one of our co-workers rachel i come in one day she's saying uh hey dawn we have some fresh mozzarella today oh let me start my sandwich i said would you like a sandwich today for lunch because she's italian so she loves it and it's really funny though oh that's so good it is all right for parsley our diva christine says she grows the curly parsley and loves it with the mozzarella tomatoes oh yeah so instead of basil you could do curly parsley is that too is that that mozzarella tomato that you're eating right now christie oh perhaps so i added some olive oil to my mixture here i also added a little bit of salt and i added a little bit of balsamic which is kind of just my own personal flair you don't have to add it here but i love balsamic with mushrooms i feel like they're just a mac made in heaven and the balsamic really caramelizes nice on the mushrooms and this balsamic glaze is delicious by the way it's one of my staples on every sandwich so good uh i agree that's serious creation of this balsamic glaze and it's so good but i mean how um yum and you put it on everything or ice cream it's so good oh this is definitely a little bit sweet it's aged like a year that's true because yeah it's a reserve it is a reserve because it's over a year yeah it's great but we love it here at the shop it's one of our favorites i took the stems out of the mushrooms mine are pretty clean if you need to get any dirt off i would recommend not rinsing mushrooms mushrooms are very porous and they'll suck up water like this so that's why you just don't want that yeah yeah so you take a damp towel and just brush it off well that's something you knew i learned about my stuffed mushroom mix yeah just brush just fresh so these are the brown are they creme brulee creminis i never say that right um but you could use the white button mushroom if you wanted to definitely yeah or even you could um do like a portobello like a really big mushroom your baking time is going to be different but you could certainly do olive oil on everything is what you're saying deliciousness this is not a low fat recipe i mean don't talk about that because it just doesn't matter what does that mean what does it mean yeah do we care we should what i've never ever cared about no what i eat i want to enjoy every bite except when i did like a 30-day challenge where i ended up being a three-month challenge but all right don we have questions specifically for you from stephanie hi stephanie hi stephanie what is in your 45 minute sandwich she needs to know oh stephanie so do town well it's really not at 45 minutes it just takes you it just takes it's just time consuming because i have to i have to do a panini style i usually will do like a beak probably a prosciutto and then i'll do fresh mozzarella i'll do the basil if we have it i do our sun-dried tomatoes that we have in the olive oil which is great sometimes you'll find really nice pieces of garlic in there and whatever else is the balsamic glaze on it i do the balsamic glaze and then artichokes are they like um in oil too right oh yeah everything's in oil but it's a real and then i'll put it on a baguette and then i toast it and it's just one of those things that you really have to savor when you eat it because i know you gave me but we're not putting it on our menu don't ask for the don can't we can't we're oh yeah well there we go it's a good idea everybody's favorite sandwich but um yeah no it's one of my favorites sometimes i'll bring in like grilled chicken i'll get oh you know chicken at home and i'll bring in like my leftover and those were your key ingredients those are my questions my key ingredients is the mozzarella um the tomato mozzarella the mozzarella yeah well that's how i grew up saying mozzarella the tomatoes artichokes and if i have the basil i'll use it uh-huh it's only if we have it yep and then any kind of meat did you not sprinkle truffle salt on it once with me i swear i didn't make some truffle on there i may have i do think so i experiment with different different things but that's my staple sandwich and it's just my go-to and it's so yummy we're putting it on the board please allow 45 minutes can you come back in 45 minutes 45 minutes yeah all the other all the other employees will will hate me for that okay oh look i'm going to hold it up how did we miss this these are tackles closer today but look at how pretty these are everybody if your mushrooms are looking so pretty you are lucky so what's really nice about this mixture number one the pecorino is a little bit moist we use peppery notches we haven't talked about that um so pecorino is always sheep's milk it's an italian cheese aged really nice and salty sometimes a little bit nutty this wheel in particular is rubbed in olive oil as it ages so it's just even more decadent it's our go-to pepperino for all italian dishes like this toast smells delicious but the pecorino's a little bit moist putting a little bit of olive oil in the mixture really helps to get it to be sticky i don't know if you can see if gina kind of showed the close-up i was able to pack like a nice amount of the filling on like in the crevice of the mushroom but also piled on top because of how sticky it is so i mean you can touch it it's not going to fall over nothing's going to fall out it's a nice moist mixture that's really just going to allow you to pack even more flavor into the mushroom into the mushroom so you did that moisture from between the olive oil and the pecorino itself yes it created the moisture so you don't want to dry stuffing correct no yeah because you're not you can't really pile on the dry stuff so yeah good point i think i've done that before and it kind of falls off i'm like why is it falling off it was too dry yeah for sure yeah you have a nice moist stuffing with mushrooms yeah yeah right that's what i learned since i was a child with my mother that's what i learned okay i'm gonna do two things my bread is almost done um i'm gonna take the bread out throw the mushrooms in and i'm going to show you what i'm going to do with the bread so we'll switch right over here a little switcheroomie so stephanie's dying to try with the artichoke element to the sandwich artichoke is key but you can make sure you get the artichokes that don't have any of the hard leaves on like sometimes yeah you'll get an artichoke and they'll still have that hard that hard outer i don't know what they're called what are they called on the artichoke yeah perfect that's good with that just i'll answer a question in a second but while this is still hot i cut a clove of garlic in half i'm going to rub it on the bread so while hot while it's hot why just because that gets more glittery flavor yeah without having to put garlic on the bread it's just going to give it a little bit of essence just that essence that sounds awesome there she goes rubbing the garlic um we have someone on i hope it pronounced the name right rookmini um wants to know welcome rapini um can you quickly recap what you stuffed in the mushrooms it was really juicy so the mushrooms is the breadcrumbs it has the pecorino toscano which we shredded and it also has some a clove of garlic that i grated has a little bit of salt a little bit of olive oil i also did chop some of the parsley and put it in oh and i did put a little drizzle of balsamic that did help with the moisture so the balsamic also the balsamic will also use with the bruschetta but i just want to add a little bit to the mushrooms okay he is that moisture yeah without rinsing mm-hmm don't rinse not the mushrooms themselves yes much chick and um carol was talking about water-based artichokes because those you know are already boiled and then just super tender and soft that's what you're talking about soft artichokes yeah yeah not the crunchy yeah no no no no artichoke fibers no no you want something that's already been like cotton peeled wait can i tell you you talk about hearts and i think i told you about this yeah anyway we're super fans of specialty produce everybody if you've not been go it's a kind of uh near old town um down in san diego right off the five and uh they have every type of produce you could ever dream of and want always in season don you gotta go edible flowers uh frozen um purees like fruit purees and stuff they have everything anyway they've got these frozen artichoke hearts that you're talking about boiling in water and they're just ready to go don you need a bag of those for your dawn sandwiches i may just have to order them just get a bag and then we have to throw them onto yours today yeah in one of our recipes tonight that are wonderful on that sandwich i made it yesterday yeah i taste tested the artichokes to make sure they were good enough for the class and they were they were delicious they were delicious okay somebody stephanie hello stephanie thinks that those might be called petals on an art joke oh petals yeah this makes sense thanksgiving flowers i can smell that garlic that you must have rubbed the one that you rubbed on the on the bread there we go television somebody and invent smell-o-vision yeah that's what i'm saying about garlic gets everything going like a dog [Laughter] clean up oh she's got the artichokes [Music] oh so here we go speaking of artichokes and the petals wait these are in oil though the ones are in the the water ones these are water ones okay i didn't want the spinach artichoke to be too oily because it has a ton of cheese in it so yeah you could use the oil ones see now i would sit there i could just like take a fork and just have a little bowl and have artichokes right just eat them they're a funky little thing but i'm with you hearts of palm is another thing it's a phone yeah they're they're they seem similar to me mm-hmm we're playing these artichokes out of the water we included a little bit of the water in the container with your artichokes just so they didn't go bad but we don't need that um so you can just toss that i'm pulling my artichokes out of the container and i'm just going to give them a rough chop so i want to get them nice and fine for the dip because you don't want to try to dip a huge piece yeah i mean it doesn't have to be perfect you can see i'm just chopping a whole pile of artichokes here um if you haven't already don't steal my original no no i'm looking to say i'm like i just want to eat one i squeezed all the water out of the spinach so i just put it in a kitchen towel and squeezed all the water out it was frozen you know everyone i think the best thing to use is frozen spinach but it comes super waterlogged so yeah squeeze all that out because you don't want watery spinach plus the water in the artichokes too yes exactly so that that's too much moisture yeah okay okay so oh yeah the smells are just it is it smells so good in here right now that's it nothing too crazy you can still have some big chunks but not the size of the half artichokes the artichoke the spine is delightful it's just wow it really is good for all of you enjoying the wine everyone got wine that's part of the kit we would love to hear your feedback on this wine yes if anyone out there has any comments on the wine because we are loving it and i can't just decide i'm not sure which ones i've not loved this year the chardonnay i even learned to love that chardonnay you picked a good one sarah let's just put it that way that's just what i like about this you know because i opened the bottle probably a half hour yeah 45 minutes before to kind of let it breathe a little but it's just um opened up so much since i opened it oh yeah it is amazing how air it's really kind of velvety right now yeah that's what i'm getting good so so a couple things um is uh stephanie did confirm that they are part of the thistle family the artichoke but she claims if you leave them and don't pick them before in time they will blossom and be beautiful yes have you ever seen a flower an artichoke flower i've never seen the purple if i'm not well the thistle is but the artichoke itself so interesting stephanie now i want to see an artichoke that has not been picked in time john will look it up while we do that yes perfect okay sorry not a choke flower keep telling us yes i turned my oven up to 425 just because i wanted things to move a little bit faster so my art my um artichokes my mushrooms are almost done yours may not be if you didn't turn your oven up so i'm just going to let them sit for another minute we're going to keep an eye on them and can you smell like when when you is it the i've heard when you smell things they're close to done yeah i don't know how much that's true but i've always kind of followed it like cookies in the oven you smell your smell you're like oh my gosh my cookies yeah there you go show that dawn put it way up close so this is stephanie thank you today blooming artichoke i guess uh blooming art outside there are purple that's probably why i love them so much because that's my color carol loves the wine she wishes she had another bottle well you know where you can get one because we love it so much yeah exactly um so we'll start on our spinach artichoke tip artichokes are in spinach is going in i didn't chop it or anything just kept it how it came packaged um the sour cream filling in everything is pre-measured for you so don't worry about measuring anything make it easy yes the mayo is going in we're little little busy divas over here in del mar yes you are are these kids for you well it wasn't only me and christina we yes yeah all the divas this whole tub you are not doing the whole thing we're taking some of this home with us tonight gina i can't wait give her a piece of bread no i'm just going to do this oh my god i love cream cheese my daughter used to eat butter like that better i'll drink better milk i love and sour cream crema she would go like this if the butter was like that sorry she would take her finger and like scrape it across the top and eat it i'm like delicious all right farm everyone's trying we're using holy cow it's our other cheese oh okay baby swiss from central post creamery northern california this is just the perfect melting cheese if you want a good base melter not that it doesn't have a ton of flavor but it has a flavor that melds well with other flavors so parmesan it's not going to create a luscious dip you know so you need something i don't want to say more fatty but something just like a little bit more more texture to it more anxiousness to it combine it together yeah yeah so holy cow yeah remember that name people holy cow for any of your melting pots and it's really really good right now really yummy yeah from paso i think um i think christina posted um on instagram the holes in the holy cow the holes in the holy cow yeah so the name really refers to the holes in holy cow but uh such a melter you're exactly right all the mushrooms go yeah as close as you can because i can't move that paper today yeah mushrooms are ready when they look brown and delicious golden i know you're lagging can you see i think so oh yay yay let's see what else okay do you want to put some garlic in your spinach dip i say we put some garlic so this all just comes down to how much garlic you want we like who doesn't like garlic yeah that's weird vampires somebody right it's true if you're wearing a necklace of garlic yeah doesn't that ward off any evil things i guess so i don't know i don't know i've seen it on tv okay garlic look at that mix okay mix this up artichoke dips how easy it is to take cheese and then add anything you want to you got spinach what if you wanted red peppers could you do red peppers you could do red peppers i don't see why not yeah no the chef secrets we want to know and you shredded them you shredded everything semi-fine or does it have to be super fun it's actually a pretty big shredder okay with because i read that fresh spinach you guys i saw this on chopped so maybe this is true you don't get the nutritional value until you saute it really yes so raw spinach salad not as valuable as having sauteed lovely spinach yeah me too love sauteed garlic but apparently butterfly saute just saying yes perfect i've finished forever yeah i liked it but when i was growing up my mother never cleaned the spinach right like we would always we would always get it fresh yeah um so there was always like sand in it yeah you know because they grow springs and sand you turned out pretty good i know okay but i hated spinach because of the sand because of the sand grits until i yeah until i was an adult and worked in a really fine italian restaurant and they would do sauteed spinach perfection and it was like the best thing ever we're all very hungry it's gonna get even better so i'm doing a double batch because we're very hungry so you'll yours will be everyone got one piece of puff pastry what you're going to do right now is cut it in half on the long end to cut it in half this way but i'm going to use two sheets because like i said we're hungry we want to take stuff home with us all right while you're prepping that don we have a question for you again yes popular tonight christine again christine i love you if we were going to have white wine with this concoction and all these apps tonight which one would you pick and why well i would what this this meal you really could go either way we were kind of trying to decide where we wanted to go i would probably do like a nice white burgundy you love the white green i love the white burgundy what maybe the grape is the white burger yo like what is a white burgundy is the burgundy a grape like is a white burgundy um it's just not left with the skins aren't the skins yeah um christina i'd probably go with our favorite a sanseir you can't go wrong with on sarah right you can't but burgundy love a white burger bee because it's just some really good rounded rounded wine and it would just go with everything so okay that's my okay i really like a sound block [Music] yeah so you could see that that would work perfect all right it's on there white burgundy check check check thanks christy keeping me on my toes put it in your little pants here's our top pastry like i said i have a double one so this is our first sheet our second sheet what we're gonna be doing is almost like creating a bowl or a boat of some sort to put the spinach artichoke dipped in so if you don't have a two sheets are they going to do it in a bowl no no no no i'm doing two portions seven they're doing one portion okay so they're going to cut it in half and that those two sheets will be their two sheets so my two shoes are just bigger this is three of us starving i starved myself today too i'm going to create like a one-inch border on this sheet and i'm going to cut the center out of it so essentially what i want to do is create a border for this sheet because that border since it's two layers thick instead of one layer thick like the middle it will puff up around the center of the dip oh this is a good plan so you're layering your puff pastry yeah i see what you're doing okay so i cut the center out and i have like this little a board a frame a little picture frame of puff pastry and everyone have an egg to make an egg wash right i was so scared we're gonna smash the eggs so you want to use egg to connect your puff pastry to the other piece and then you also want to use egg to create that brownness um while it's baking so that's going to give that golden color or something to the puff pastry okay so if you have a pastry brush i would use that i did not bring my pastry brush so we're going to go what is what are our options i'm going to use um a flavor top paper towel well there you go if you don't have a pastry brush i've had to do it before and i know it works so you take the paper towel crumple it up and then you just dip it into the egg and use it like a brush that's so perfect it actually works if you don't have to improvise yeah and so i'm just brushing on the border of the big sheet here because that's where we're going to stick to the other piece of puff pastry this is like being a kid in school for craft class but yeah and exactly it's good with the delicious food but you're just creating the glue and you're making your frame so you're putting it on now you didn't put your stuffing in there how much puff up serum it so the one sheet will probably pop up like half an inch and then probably like a whole inch for the the second one yeah i learned something every time just around your food it kind of keeps it in like a cookie i like it that's so crazy egg wash the border now as well okay so she egg washed yeah she wanted the frame to stick to the base and now she wants the outside to be golden so um brushing the top of the frame to make it golden so the combination of the two don't be shy with the egg wash no it's what she's saying this piece here don't throw this away what you could do is put it on a pan egg wash it bake it and it's just like pieces that you can dip into the spinach artichoke dip but like i said i only have one rack on my oven so i need to prioritize what i'm making yes so this is all right if you want to cut this into pieces and bake it you can or save it in the freezer i mean you can make a croissant yeah in the morning if you wanted to make a croissant i would cut it diagonally yes right and then from there you have two croissants you just roll it up okay make a croissant while you're at it just for fun like who knows look at this her angle she's out of the movie and you just oh we have to see how this happens you just roll it not too tight just roll it nicely and then if you want the classic like oh gosh okay remember the poppy fresh ghost little croissant okay we have to see what happens we'll make some for you and will you egg wash that too yes yes she says oh yes to the egg wash do you know how to make those pretty croissants you'd put like a layer of chocolate and then roll it up oh stop yeah that looks so gorgeous let me get the chocolate yeah [Music] that looks okay amazing like right now you would go no that wouldn't work but okay the way we're doing it is like a shared version if you wanted to make really small individual versions you could do that too like you could cut this into quarters or even eights and you have like this you can still do that order style this perfect little frame so that can be like individual yeah like individual size for valentine's day i always think my husband needs heart-shaped pineapple pastries i do puff pastry and do you know the border with the heart-shaped cookie cutters and then like pineapple in the middle but for my son this year i'd say too much time on our heads wait listen for this year i did mickey mouse shake because my son was making mickey mouse they were these perfect little pastries of like and then the sides puffed up around the pineapples and it's just perfect yeah you can do it anything sweet or savory it sounds like i have a i follow some people in there they have like three to five kids and they're like oh my kids are dressed in the same outfits and like i did this and i'm like who has to hide who has time for that i could barely get one out the door every morning look at how high she don she is piling that up there yeah so you want to keep the fillings inside this border okay i think there's a little extra filling but that's something you could also bake on the side in a ramekin and just eat or refill the little mmm i could have rolled those croissants with that too yeah oh yeah that's a good idea but look at how tall your okay so you stacked it i would be so worried that this is just gonna all melt well so that's what the i really think the whipped cream cheese adds a lot of body it really does a lot of stiffness regular cream cheese i feel like it would work too but i couldn't fit the aeratedness that's the word yeah of the fluffiness fluffiness there we go of the whipped cream cheese really gives it nice body you can see wow it's ready to bake so we're gonna pop it in the oven this is gonna take a little bit to cook the mushrooms are coming we're going to eat some mushrooms because when you're eating one thing you have to be cooking the next right right this is good planning you're distracting me maybe you forget more cheese ah oh we are we took our cheese here i didn't grate the whole piece of parmesan i just have a little bit left after you grate to the bottom don't get rid of it keep it but i'm just going to put some extra over the top because why not because it's parmesan if you grated the whole thing already don't worry about it i just saw that there was some left yeah so she's like why not yeah exactly yeah because i i always leave a little extra focus for this purpose right oh golly here we go now and lorenzo loves grated cheese lorenzo started with he's like more and more more cheese more yes he loves cheese that's yay [Laughter] you've seen the videos of him with the with the with the cheese telling her more only parmesan no yeah exactly you kind of you're in trouble now all right who's ready for a mushroom these are cool still warm okay could you talk about cooling like what you want all food at room temperature no i mean you just you don't want to burn the roof of your mouth you know oh this smells so good if we would have eaten these sooner and they were still hot grease burn your mouth temperature great i think they're delicious both of these great i just didn't want you to be like on exactly i can't eat this oh but look at the gold color and then you can feel the mushrooms nice and tender yeah it cooked itself enough through right but a portobello just because of the size of it obviously you would just cook it longer to cook the mushroom through yeah okay very tasty bring our food i didn't eat finger foods all day wow the top got really nice and crunchy i get lots of garlic i like it i do too immediately i got garlic but i get parsley too we talked about the parsley yeah i do love that cheese bread crumbs everything yeah i can taste them all that's a perfect sized mushroom because that is like a button bite you could take one bite if you want you could yeah just pop this in and be good so i think that if somebody cut that in half i'd question them i'm suspicious of you why are you cutting that enough mm-hmm i did my first one tv bite oh you did good you did good you did good you want to lower the latch down the top you like this line i do i do we couldn't set up a cop in the back for you could you i might have to all right okay well the spinach artichoke tip is baking we're going to work on these during quarantine when rob and i were here all the time i said rob i have an air bed i could just bring it in yeah sleep here be fine i'll be fine i turned my oven up a little bit just because it's a toaster oven regular ovens work better and so i feel like you just need higher temperature in a toaster 400 is probably still fine for your puff pastry mushrooms it gets higher if you can't do too much no actually yeah i could eat like five more of those muscles i know yeah i could make more leaves they were so good wow they were good use one okay all right bruschetta mix we're gonna do um cherry tomatoes i like using cherry tomatoes because i think it tastes better personally i think they're way cuter they're just like a deeper red a nice more like jewel look rather than a regular tomato yeah yeah and i find sometimes the regular tomatoes are so moisture filled yeah right too many seeds too much yet so i'm gonna quarter these i'm going to cut them long ways so you have this tall one and then i'm going to cut a second time horizontally so you'll get like these perfect little jewels of tomatoes and i'll probably do this whole container so it'll take me a minute oh my goodness well i got a message from christine suggesting that we hold up the cheeses we're featuring every night or cheeses yeah cause i guess we don't i don't have i grated everything oh to see what the meal looks the only thing i've been grade everything up was parmesan okay give me a second i will find the meal grab the holy cow uh-huh we gotta show those down on the bottom right there tina i'm going to find a holy piece yes thanks christine these are baby holes i know but the great cow is one of those cheeses where the holes are not always the same no sometimes they're really big and sometimes and sometimes we're very small that's an abundance of small holes in them yeah because that's really holy it's holy so holy h-o-l-e-y cow see if everybody can kind of see that i'll get a little close with this so you can see that it's um to me it's almost like the texture if anyone's a fan of havarti if you were a kid and you just had a party slices holy cow is a lot like that to me it's just creamy and dreamy and delicious and that's direct crazy when they come in and that's for havarti yeah and i don't think that's a bad thing it's just that creamy deliciousness so each wheel right now yeah this is about a quarter of a wheel it's about uh the wheels are about 10 pounds to give you an idea what holy cow looks like so next i'm going to go find the pecorino over here behind me i will go find the paper now uh front right front right all the way over the second one from the left work we are yes we're gonna keep up my skills they're slacking okay so sarah mentioned everybody the pecorino toscano so this is awesome uh from tuscany and you guys this is a got a beautiful natural rind on it because they've brushed that rind with olive oil and then they let it sit and age and then they get this crusty crusty rind which i love try to eat that rind i i'll eat that do you eat that i don't know i've not tried it i'm not trying it i love it it's usually one for a little challenge i'll try some rinds sometimes yeah but not that one i have not tried that one yet no what about putting that in a sauce like parmesan oh of course you could yeah and just extract the flavor yeah yeah yeah and the creaminess and stuff of it yeah but as sarah said on the what's really important you guys seriously super important to take away from parmigiano you've got a great police piece right here it says parmigiano oh it's perfect so the way to know did you do something so the way you tell true parmigiano-reggiano is it is stamped on the outside parmigiano um reggiano so this one from karma italy um you're gonna get to this crusty crusty edge at some point right do not throw that away throw it in as a stock uh soup stew uh anything you want just add it bolognese for extra flavor but what italian kids do and i've tried this you guys and it's super fun because we have a gas stove if everybody has a gas stove i'll take my tongs and just hold it over the flames no way to char it like you do to a tortilla that sounds yummy and italian kids i understand they will just sit there and chew then on this this charred rind and it's delicious i'm going to tell you it's delicious because this is all natural it's just dried up and hard but that's cheese as well it's the same thing here that is here but this is all dried right i keep them in a bag in my freezer cheese that's right i just made a um um i did a crock pot soup one day because i i was going out and gonna be gone all day long and i was just like i don't want to cook when i get home so i had parmesan so i threw it in with everything and it was like everything but the kitchen sink just throw it in and so when i got home it was like this hearty chicken soup you had it so good yes but i got the piece of parmesan and i'm like oh my god it's like super soft and when you eat it really it was like just delicious and i was like oh this is the parmesan this is so good uh sarah quick question from you from donna hi donna um uh on the amount of cream cheese for the recipe that they have how much did cream cheese did you use the whole whatever the whole everything that what you gave them oh yeah i had stuffed more into my tubs okay yeah use the whole thing uh gotcha so donna if you use all of the filling that uh sarah gave you in the kit you still might have extra filling because we gave a bunch yeah a little bit yeah but we could you could use that right the next day we were saying um bacon and a ramekin on the side or you could save it stuff it into a chicken breast tomorrow um like donald's saying roll it up in the puff pastry to make like a savory croissant or yeah even like throw it into some scrambled eggs like for breakfast the next day really that filling is already ready to go it doesn't really have anything that's going to go bad in a day or two so you could use it it's like that chicken dish we did you used to yeah in the chicken that was so delicious scrumptious okay so i chopped my tomatoes i tossed them with a little bit of olive oil and plenty of salt tomatoes can take a lot of salt so we want to really does the salt cut the acid in the tomato a little or no yeah so those are a couple things that kind of balance each other salt and acid like if you ever find that something's too salty like you've over salted and there's nothing you can do to fix it add a little bit of acid it kind of balances out i feel like yeah salt you want to enhance the flavor not necessarily salty i feel like it makes the flavor of the tomatoes love tomatoes and salt oh so good right and a good tomato i love it with a tomato off a bush there's nothing like that and you just sprinkle a little salt on it yes if you're gonna grow one veggie it's the tomato if you can do it right because that's when you truly taste what it should be right but you're but i'm with sarah the smaller the cherry ones are the closest you can get anywhere going to ralph's going to anywhere to get that tomato flavor right versus a so i stacked my basil leaves all together how perfect they are from big to small oh i got to see this and i'm going to chiffonade i love that word very french so what we're going to do is take the basil stack all of the leaves and we're going to roll it up like a little basil cigar a basil cigar size i love clothes why don't you smoke babel i don't know why you can't i smoke sage yes agents of clothes so i don't smoke it but i saved my house so when we cut this we don't want to damage the basil we don't want to turn it brown and i've heard this yes you don't want to chop you want to do like um a continuous motion like slicing instead of like chopping down like this you're removing your knife only your face will you do this or with other things but maybe your face that slicing process you can use for a lot of things but you don't you saw how i chopped the parsley earlier just like this you don't want to do that with basil it's just going to damage it and turn it around that's so crazy and i've seen that happen though because i've done that and you're right it turns brown yeah i mean this is what they call a chiffonade you're making these long strands of basil that's what stacking the leaves helps with because i'm cutting you know i had the leaf sitting flat so i'm cutting the whole length of the leaf by doing it this way you can see it's ridiculous these nice little ribbons of basil you generally find basil in a ribbon like this or smell-o-vision exactly instead of like finely chopped like parsley yeah oh it smells so good so we're gonna add this to the tomatoes that reminds me it's only nine months till christmas red and green i'm just saying okay i'm sorry red and green those two colors together for food for holidays for anything is delicious and here she goes with the glaze just a little bit of glaze we'll put a little bit over the top when we're finished and you could just use if you have any balsamic in your fridge or your yeah right yeah what's nice about the balsamic glaze is that i add a little bit of sugar so it's not totally acidic sometimes i find just adding balsamic to the tomatoes tomatoes acid balsamic acid it's too much sugar or like some agaves here if i really like adding because you don't have to worry about dissolving the sugar so this is good that's good that's a good tip because i think i sometimes do too much acid on acid and that's i think what's good in like vietnamese cooking or some of the other i think they add the sugar element yeah so that's salty and i've talked to a lot of people about reading because we sell a couple of different tomato sauces and they're like oh but there's sugar item like no sugar is not for added sugar i know people are not looking for sugar but sugar is to balance the acid in the tomato you don't want to taste sweetness yeah you don't want you just don't want to taste too much acid even just like a pinch like if this was feeling too acidic it would be just like a pinch of sugar just like how i did the salt just to balance the flavor that's a super tip yeah for anything acidic you could kind of do that right or a pinch of sugar yeah okay so we're gonna mix this up and we're gonna build our bruschetta i'm gonna okay so a good tip is adding a pinch of sugar to anything acidic to cut that acidity my mother used to use carrots oh for the uh for the sweetener i've been putting carrots in my tomato instead of using the sugar you use carrots because it's a natural sweetener yes i want any sauce yes when you make boolean easy and all that mirepoix isn't it yeah the base of the onion celery carrot yeah to give the sweetness okay so that's my little cooking tidbit for today dawn i did just start doing that thanks mom oh you see mom knows best always it goes faster italian golly here we go oh no not another bottle we're going to build okay tomato the shipping knotted bottle baseline you guys um everybody knows mozzarella the stretched the pasta the stretch cheese mozzarella well typically you know mozzarella comes in a bowl it's just that stretchy cheese what the italians decided for some reason to do is they had leftover cream left over like ends of mozzarella we're going to blend those two together and then we're going to stretch what we have left of the mozzarella curd and we're going to fill that little sheet of curd with this cream and mozzarella which is strachatella mixture and we're going to wrap it inside in a little pocket and that is burrata and that's what we have from our very good friend mimo up in pomona at destefano creamery this is the most local kind of cheese we have that probably the closest commercial cheese maker here in san diego yeah is destefano in pomona um and uh hello mimo and the game for making this beautiful paratha yeah so we're doing like a little bit of a like i said a mashup of prius a bruschetta sort of thing i wanted to include some cheese in this dish a little bit so we have our little burrata i'm just going to take a paring knife and kind of cut it open you'll see that there's like the oozy layer of goodness on the inside yes can i share my favorite tip and i've learned actually gert my mom was a she was a um cook in a kitchen she was like the kitchen manager she was like oh they always used to portray them so bad on cartoons and stuff she was the you know the cooking lady in school you know cafeteria lady the lunch lady girlfriend lady girl was the lunch lady and she was so nice because she would give the kids anything they wanted they wanted that piece of pizza whatever she got but her trick for pizza or for cutting things was just some scissors so i totally use scissors like to cut that too sir you did the knife which works good yeah but scissors work too many jars scissors yeah i'm gonna use that now so i'm just gonna take a little spoonful of the burrata super small put it on the toast the reason why i cut those that way i'm going to like i said we want more space i'm going to do half of my toast because i want to save some of my toast for dipping in the spinach artichoke tip i do have some bread that we haven't toasted so we'll kind of see what we like better yes for watching you could use your ex could you use cream cheese you could use cream cheese yeah it's not as good as burrata but you could you could you could use goat cheese a chef delicious i think an herb chef would go great chef would be delicious so there's many options you want to use burrata but you want to use but if you don't have barrage you can't get barata for some silly reason we always have brown yes always um any of those creamy dreamies would be good and i'm just putting a little bit of cheese this is not like the whole store i'm not piling on a ton of cheese it's just kind of like a little accident so this is salad on a toast so could this count as my salad yeah i'm trying to eat more salad green it is greasy i'm trying but this i can eat more if i can eat it like this if i can call this a salad and it also helps and we talked about glue a bunch of times but it also helps the tomatoes to stick to the bread when i grew up we had salad every day yeah you right every part of your meal was part of our meal i was just talking about that today it's a good thing to have i need to do more every night granted it was just iceberg lettuce but we still had salad that's something you had something but it had everything else in it you had onions and tomatoes and cucumbers oh cucumber i love cucumbers me too cucumber is very good for your skin oh okay i love the cucumber it might be my favorite veggie but look at that these just look like i said the jewels of the tomato just looks so much nicer they do yeah go with the little cherry tomatoes for sarah's recommendation oh drizzle she would not drizzle over the top stanley tucci eat your heart out have you been watching me i have and i love him but this yeah oh i missed the mortadella it's like no no no i'm just paper think i i checked that we're not for kids on the youtube channel check out sorry everybody but it looks so good i can't take it so you don't have to go to italy to have this delicious stuff oh cheers to that i love it we're gonna we're gonna bring italy here for everybody i can't wait to see on cnn i don't know yes but i love it but this is amazing close up if everyone can sort of see um it's too funny no i'm gonna pass what's gonna say okay i'm totally dizzy so see if you can taste the garlic on the bread oh yeah so that was and i see that a lot that cereal that was a great tip so cut the garlic in half rub it on the warm bread yes hot bread hot bread just to get infused that and you could do that with anything right any bread or any mm-hmm be just super good just to get that hint because i think sometimes you can put too much garlic on right if you did you know and then it's too raw or too hot bread almost cooks it so it's not rough right so it's not wrong so just getting the almost garlic oil out of the rubbing it on there yeah is a good thing christine thinks stanley tucci is a god yeah yeah i know it's it's all good we are goddesses christine so he might be a god but i feel good i'm trying to make this chef have a chance to eat a battle over here i got i got the garlic you got the garlic and the tomato of course how about the base the basil good and everything and the barata everything the broccoli binds it all together it's just like the holy cow bun yeah it's too good why don't you these should be made every time dawn sandwiches and these specials on the weekend what do you smoke brunch the brunch oh we'll talk about it we'll talk about french yeah yes we'll just hire our prep guy somebody just just make this yeah too good you guys oh so i need yeah yeah she's just gonna keep reading oh my god oh my gosh so so simple again virata tomatoes basil a little garlic and balsamic yeah everybody's got these in there olive oil good to go and again wait did you salt the bread too a little you did season that you did this is the key again seasoning salting salted bread the bread salted tomatoes salt your layers the layers and i can see that puff pastry i'm sorry i keep looking i know i keep i can smell it and i can see it you love that right i'm gonna go in a minute but this is too pretty i think mine is ready the puff pastry puff pastry okay i turned it around halfway through you may not have to do that in a real oven but i'm gonna give it like another 30 seconds so good we're in the spring now and these late nights that are still light which is awesome this is dinner mm-hmm oh yeah dinner we'll cook dinner i mean all you did was toast bread which you don't even have to do yeah and here you can use a stale old day old bread right oh definitely use your old baguette for this use your old yum mm-hmm toast points for the big reveal yes so good i would eat a dozen of those yeah too eat like five or six of them oh look it seems like it popped up like a frame yeah puffed up around it almost created a bowl and once you get it once you get towards like you started eating some dip just tear off the sides of the puff pastry and start dipping it in just like a bread bowl just like a breakfast but better like that is perfect you guys i love that frame technique sarah i've not seen that i like it never did it you know puff pastry because i love chopped do either of you watch chocolate corks i like freaking chocolate they always get killed on puff pastry don't cook puff pastry on top don't do it on chopsticks but do it at home to self this is very i'm gonna put any of you guys down here i'm just driving in diving in i'm just diving in but yeah the layers how it fluffed up is crazy that's so cool because this is yeah that it puffed and yes oh i can see it smoking it makes your little bowl for you yummy i love it that's where this wine just got better on the second bottle and the gold no could i dip i could dip like um a vegetable in there like a spear of a pepper again yeah a celery stick could you you could use anything you wanted to you have to give it a second it's definitely still piping mm-hmm it's my i i spread mine out carol says kudo to the del mardinos no thank you thanks carol our biggest fan i'm just eating they're the divas yeah very fun and i'm not going to be scared put those sorry i don't know i just saw that because i was like oh a fake tree i don't want to be scared of cup pastry because i've had epic fails with puppies where it's yeah um it doesn't cook just put it through longer and you cannot stack it okay so this is interesting you stacked your puff pastry we did a brion crew which is when you wrap puff pastry around debris but we had a couple layers of cup pastry and the center because there was a couple layers of the pastry didn't cook through the outside was brown but the inside wasn't cooked through just like on chopped you see this all the time what temperature did you use uh it wasn't maybe hot enough it was maybe 350. maybe we needed to go to four oh yeah 400. so 400 for puff pastry is what we're maybe hearing favorite i will ask but donna christine and carol all love the recipes kudos to the divas did you take some of the bowl i did i took the edge of the bowl all right see how thick it stayed but i got it it didn't ooze because when things melt in and ooze away that's terrible and i bet the puff pastry at the bottom is probably out of this world delicious yes we'll get down to that they'll soak up all the oils in them it's probably now could you put this you could put this stuffing though in a traditional say um sourdough bowl that's yeah we just wanted to do something a little bit different but you could definitely put it in a in a bread bowl yeah yeah yeah i'm going to go with this first but then i'm going to dive in like dawn did you or if you don't want to deal with the bread part just put it in a ramekin or even a crock pot like on the on the counter it's ready to go hot at all times it's so different with the puff pastry is it just with the back end okay it's like just delicious everyone is just so smooth yeah sarah teaching about puff pastry is good because carol i'm with you i've never puff pastry can be tricky wow but these were some good tips about what to do with the puff pastry it's lighter and here it is yeah how light it is i love it i think you know what i like about it it's softer i love the crunchiness of the bread yeah but i love the softness of top pastry yeah the bread will chew up your mouth yes the pep pastry is a little more gentle gentle on your mind oh and buttery you do taste the better oh my gosh just delicious everything is truly delicious puff pastry you guys uh it came up in the comments of where to find it um and typically in the freezer section if you know where your frozen pie crusts your cereal turnovers popovers are you'll find the puff pastry there um keep it in your freezer until you're ready to use it like sarah said yeah to bring it to a kind of a refrigerator temperature this is so delicious john's just eating don't eat the bottom see in the bottom yeah the bottom here that's the bottom i'm using my fork and knife at this point yeah because um yeah it's too good it's so delicious and then this extra filling like we said the pastry use it for a croissant we have that leftover piece they're baking now use that cupcake raisin croissant since there are so many rolls that will take a little bit more it'll take time yeah but um neopolitan is that when you layer the pastry sheets with like cream and stuff you probably have oh my god isn't the important oh good i know what you try yeah but you can just bake the puff pastry sheets on their own and make these beautiful little crisp layers and layer that with whipped cream ice cream whatever cream face i mean it'd be delicious you could do a layered thing with layers of cupcake tree and the tomato tomatoes might be delicious right so anyway that's not what it's called it's not that good what is that what is it called that it when it's that somebody if anybody knows because we've had wine and she inhaled cup pastry dust but but toasting just sheets of puff pastry and making layers is a not neopolitan somebody help us yeah carol loves thank you carol just hanging out with us and eating and cooking and drinking and drinking more and i'm having a good little time do we know yet we weren't discussing not to put it on the spot do we have a next divas yet we have a okay we have a couple fun things you guys coming up if you're a wine fan our next wine or wednesday is all about merlot if

invited me to stay for dinner so i'm very excited uh so what a treat what a treat robinson vineyard chardonnay such a beautiful wine for a sunny autumn day and i think um you know we drank this uh fairly recently in december but we were comparing it and contrasting it with the duck as well so i just thought it would be nice to give it a night of its own on my feet i shall my finger's fine look i've taken the band-aid off there's the bruise there's the cut you can see it's right on the it's right on the knuckle um so it'll take it'll take a while to heal but i'm fine thank you for asking content crackers delicious hi henry that sounds beautiful it's fine it doesn't hardly hurts at all anymore particularly when i have a glass of chardonnay in my hand um so cheers everyone hmm ah that's good that's so yummy um okay chicken sandwiches but chicken wings good on you craig uh i knew look the food the food suggestions you guys are all masters in this now so it's all just awesome to hear what you're what you're appearing to um to the wine but you know we've got we've got a whole year's worth of um of references to great food and wine matches but what i wanted to talk about today is why i think this kind of chardonnay is so great with with seafood and with fried food so before we do that let's just have a little review of the aromas and flavors i think it's so robinson vineyard as you all i'm sure remember he's just down the road from us it's about four kilometers to the south of here and hugh robinson humanism robinson's vineyard grows us some beautiful chardonnay and some delicious pinot noir and i think that over the years we've been making um a single vineyard chardonnay from this one uh since 2008 eight and nine were sort of experimental allison are you gonna save it save it for save it for ron that's all right glass of rose works as well works just as well on a beautiful sunny day and you'll enjoy this uh when you're ready to open it um so yes so beautiful chardonnay beautiful pinot noir from the robinson vineyard and both the chardonnay and the pinot noir to my mum always has a finesse and an elegance and a length and line to it that we don't get from our chardonnay or pinot noir from any of our other vineyards so that's the reason that we think the robinson vineyard special and it's why we make single vineyard wine from the best of the chateau and the pinot noir from this vineyard um 2008 2009 we made it experimentally and we picked it a little bit too late and we found out that if you pick the chardonnay in the robinson vineyard too late it tastes like pineapple juice which is not what we're looking for we're looking for one that has beautiful natural acid line and a lemony limey maybe grapefruity citrus flavor profile and then maybe a little bit of white nectarine white peach but really it's that citrus line and those florals that we get in this wine year in year out that we really love and we get very excited about so and when we talk about lemon and lime and even grapefruit that those sort of citrus flavors uh merge very nicely with the heart with the high acid in the wine it has a creaminess in the mid palate um and it has some it has this lovely lovely long tail to it so you taste it for ages after you've swallowed it so you don't need to drink it fast you can drink it slowly and just revel in those delicious flavors and the reason that we like to match it with quite delicate seafoods and and then fried food which we don't always think of as being delicate but it can be if you think of tempura if you think of really good chips potato cakes from a really good fish and chip shop they have a delicacy to them and they have a um a subtlety to them which is which is really lovely and one of the first things i remember from being a kid and getting fish and chips is either squeezing lemon or putting a little bit of cider vinegar on the chips and on the on the um fish and that's exactly what this wine does you don't need your lemon juice or your cider vinegar because we've got acidity in spades here but we've also got that lovely lemony flavor as well which works really well with the with both the fattiness of the batter and it shouldn't be too fatty because they should fry it in a high enough temperature so that so it's not fatty it's just kind of crispy and it's got a slight um a slight oiliness to it but lovely crunch and then that beautiful um soft delicate flesh of the fish or the beautiful soft fluffiness of potato when you make it into chips or potato cakes the other reason that it goes really well with cheese is exactly the same thing the cheeses that it goes with are quite delicate cheeses not stinky cheeses not hard bitey cheeses um oh yeah emily that sounds perfect um it's it it it it asks it's a delicate wine so it asks for quite delicate flavors and and robin deb there is that kind of oily creaminess um to the wine which is is a good it's a good slightly fatty character you've heard me talk about a little bit of a little bit of fattiness on our chardonnays and i think that gives them a bit of extra body a little bit of extra weight and and jeremy kind of looks at me as i'm mad whenever i say that but it's okay because he's at his daughter's um harmony day tonight so he's not joining us sadly uh he's he uh he rang me on the way out saying have you done all the winemaking before you go to drinks and so i had to um i had to uh make sure that he knew that it was all sorted out um i agree i i think i think craig it's a really good point as far as the profile is concerned and of course chablis is made from chardonnay as well it's grown in a very different part of the world and chablis in france is almost as far north as um as the southern part of champaign so it's quite marginal for making um table wine from grapes and pineapple and in fact chablis can't they can't get pinot noir ripe enough in chablis so they really only make uh chardonnay there and if you compare this to a if you compared this one to a shabbly you'll find that we do get quite we get those lovely high acidity but this one has a bit more richness and a bit more brightness of fruit to it so it's got that mornington peninsula generosity but compared to all of the other uh chardonnays that we make here at miranda state it does have a finesse and an elegance and a fineness chablis will tend to have sl fruit but it will be still lemony fruit maybe a little bit of green apple um and some honey and i get a little bit of honey here but the chablis honey is more like sort of wildflower honey whereas this is a little bit tamer um a little bit more unctuous than uh than a chablis hello jeff good to see you i saw you sneaking out earlier on you didn't even say goodbye you must have been in a rush to get home to get into your chardonnay you got some fish and chips the other thing i love about this wine is that it's got a finish that's really quite um surprising because it's got all this lovely kind of lemon fruit and uh and florals and a little bit of honey in the mid palette and then on the finish it's got this flinty cold like um um like river pebble kind of a or very cold um mountain stream kind of water it's like a minerally cold freshness to it and uh and then a little tiny bit of saltiness a little bit of salinity right on the finish which just makes it a little bit more um makes it makes you want a bit more a little bit more thirsty for a bit more and the little bit of saltiness there again works really well with your fried food with your um oysters somebody sending you pictures ah angela yay g'day spaghetti bungalay excellent i hope that somebody would do spaghetti fungally with this chardonnay i think it's a beautiful match um the other great match for this if anyone's got some freshly shucked oysters we will have come out of the um summer season so they shouldn't be they shouldn't be creamy anymore they should be lovely and oystery and fishy and again i you know i like to when i'm eating oysters squeeze a little bit of lemon juice on them or if i'm having a chardonnay like this you don't even need to squeeze the squeeze of lemon juice on it you just eat the oyster have a sip of the wine mix it all up in your mouth together and it's wonderful it's such a delicious such a delicious experience and if you don't feel like doing that then you can always pour a little bit of the wine into the oyster shell before you eat the oyster it's just like putting a little vinaigrette or something like that but with chardonnay flavor which is even better than vinaigrette so how's everyone's week been we've had a crazy week here at muradak um well it's vintage so we expect it to be crazy uh and it's getting when we're moving along thanks molly it is good fun give it a go um every day has felt like friday is that good or bad shell like like you're exhausted at the end of the week even before you've got to friday or like it's nearly the weekend oysters are a great pairing to this one rob i highly recommend it um so yeah it's felt a bit like that here as well i think everyone's not good to your shell well i hope that this is um helping to make things feel a little bit less exhausting everyone i've spoken to is a bit exhausted at the moment and i think um i think we should all be kind to ourselves because i do think that now that we've kind of burst out the other side of lockdown and and all of the stress about not being able to do anything um we're trying to like make up for lost time and we're exhausting ourselves by rushing around trying to do everything all at once so that's why it's very important to stop on a thursday night and have a glass of wine with me and have a little snack of something delicious um even if it's just a toasted cheese sandwich or a cheesy might scroll i haven't heard anyone's decided to go that way so i'll catch you i agree but it but good mozelle um works pretty well with fish and chips as well so oh i'm getting lots of messages oh have fun um yeah so i i i had a couple of um a couple of strange moments in the last week i went to we finished up on time on on sunday so i could go to the french film festival with my sister and my mum um and we went to see the godmother which if you are into if you like films and you don't mind reading subtitles or you can speak french then the godmother is it's really hilarious it's a really fun film um we loved it and we got to go to the cinema in brighton and we didn't have to wear masks which was amazing i got to sit there watching me eating my chocolate it was very very cool and sort of brought home to me how far ahead of the rest of the world we are in uh in our ability to move around and uh and get on with things so even though things are not quite normal yet um there's a lot more there's lots little freedoms opening up which is which is really really lovely um craig the shady grapes are all picked and processed and in barrel and they're fermenting away beautifully in the winery so we've got some of the chardonnay ferments have finished and we've um so basically when we're making chardonnay it's really really simple we we pick the grapes we put the whole bunches into the press and the press cycle goes for about four or five hours it's a really long slow press cycle to get us get as much good quality juice out without bruising the fruit too much and without it getting stuck in between the skins and things so long slow press and the juice comes out and we pump it to a tank we've got if you've been to muradak you'll see that we do have a few big tanks around and we talk a lot about our barrels and not very much about our tanks but we we use the tanks twice in a wine's life usually when we first press it out and the juice goes to tank and we give it a big mix up and then all of the solids so when you when you press grapes you get juice like when you squeeze an orange and you get orange juice and you've got bits in it so you've got solids some of the solids are bits of um grape flesh and some of the solids are little bits of yeast and little things that you want to have in there and so um we don't want to get rid of those if you let it just all settle down as with freshly squeezed orange juice and if you've never done this then give it a go you squeeze orange juice and you put it in the glass if you leave it for a little while all the bits drop to the bottom and you get this kind of serum which is a much paler version of the orange juice in the top and then all the all of all the lumpy bits in the bottom so with our chardonnay juice we don't want them to separate out we want all of the lumpy bits to be evenly distributed throughout the juice so we give it a big stir and that's what i was doing when i chopped my finger but we won't talk about that anymore um give it a big stir and then it gets pumped from the tank into barrels and with our chardonnay we use about sort of 10 to 15 maybe 20 new oak and the rest of the oak will be older oak so we pump it to barrel and what you have to do because remember it's still juice at that stage you have to leave a headspace because when wine when grape juice ferments to turn into wine as well as changing sugar into alcohol it produces carbon dioxide which makes bubbles and also heat so the heat makes it expand and the carbon dioxide bubbles makes it all bubble up like a milkshake and if your barrel is full of wine when you start then it bubbles out the top of the hole so we leave so we only fill the barrel about four fifths full we've got lots of headspace so that hopefully when it ferments it all stays inside the barrel ferments away happily get that all done that usually takes somewhere between 7 and 14 days depending on what the weather's like it's been sort of cool up until the last few days so ferments have been going ticking along slowly not too fast once the ferment's finished and all the sugar has been converted to alcohol and the wine is no longer producing carbon dioxide it can't protect itself from oxygen so we need to help it by transferring the wine from the half the partly full barrels and consolidating it so we so we pump out of one barrel and top up all the other barrels and get it all the way up to the top we pop a bung in it and we pop it away and it's pretty safe then we check it maybe once a month at this at that stage um and it's and it's wine then already but it's not the one that you're drinking today because it needs about eight months in barrel to sort of soften and gentle out and also for it to go through a male lactic conversion which we've talked about before but that's very simply changing those green apple malic acids that occur naturally in grape juice particularly grape juice from cool climates that gets converted to lactic acid which is the acid that you find in milk and cream so it's a softer creamier more textural acid it softens the the acid um the total acidity of the wine but it also makes the wine more textural and rounder on the palette we find from our vineyards and particularly from the robinson vineyard that we get quite low levels of natural malic acid in the wine so even if we let it go through 100 melolactic conversion we don't get a big change we just get a little bit of softness a little bit of creaminess and we really like that line and you can see that there that's that fatty character that we were talking about before and it just gives the wine more complexity than just a lemony appley kind of zinginess which we like that lemony apple is enos but we like a little bit of creaminess too it's all about balance and complexity so at the moment we've got barrels of chardonnay fermenting we've got barrels of chardonnay that have finished their ferment and because it's actually good on you um no it's okay so angela's asking um if it's okay to make spaghetti bungalay with a different wine from the one that you're gonna drink and presumably the wine that you used for your spaghetti mongolia was out of condition maybe not as good as it as as as it had been when you first drank it and that's absolutely fine because when you cook wine out as well as losing all the alcohol then the flavor changes and it's really just it's it you can use wine you can use vinegar you can use versus which is unripe grape juice you can use lemon juice all of those things are used to acidify a dish you'll get different flavors as well but it's absolutely not sacrilege to make your food with one wine not the one that you're going to drink it with if you want to be really tossy about it and sometimes we like to be tossy because it makes us feel special and and makes us feel feel gorgeous um if you want to cook with the same wine that you're drinking it makes you feel nice but i don't think very many people in the world can taste how it makes it taste oh good on you michael hey we'll be we're looking forward to getting our vaccines as well um so yes angela i think you did absolutely the right thing um then yes you make it with your riesling that gives you a nice crispness good good freshness nice acidity and then open the special wine to drink with it also it depends how many other ingredients you have in the wine in italy they have this very famous dish called brazato albarolo and it's basically a piece of rump steak i think it's rampant anyway it's a bit of meat that needs a long slow cook beef and it's cooked in a bottle of barolo and that's essentially all they cook it in they don't put onion or anything in there at the very purest end of this recipe so for that you you're relying so much on the flavor of the broth and and barolo made from nibiolo has incredibly high acidity as well as um as well as lots of tannin and which will break down the toughness of the meat so so there's sort of a there's a chemistry reason behind doing that and then you want to drink a nice glass of barolo afterwards but i've had it made using just a lange nebula which is a lot cheaper than a barolo or a really cheap barolo and then drinking it with a very expensive broiler and it works just the same so yes absolutely craig an expensive steak but bloody delicious if you get a chance to order it in a restaurant in piedmont do it because it's delicious and it works then and then you order a really special bottle of um whether you know 10 15 20 years age on it and you'll be in heaven so very very super um yeah yeah i thought i'd mentioned it before okay um i'm missing i think i'm missing questions no i thought i'd mentioned it before okay um i'm i'm missing i think i'm missing questions no rob oh yes um the pinot gris juice uh it could have been on skins but also the pinot gris juice just is a little bit pink so if it was very pink it could have been the pinot ground skins but it was probably just peanut green juice that he'd done a sample from because there's quite a lot of color that drops out of it when you ferment it if you don't leave it on skins but when it's just juice it has a pinkness to it and it is delicious um craig we haven't picked on abiola yet we haven't picked our shiraz yet either so there are two great varieties here at muradak that we're just loving this sunshine this beautiful mild weather that we're supposed to have for at least another week please don't anyone tell me when it's supposed to rain because i don't want to know um this gorgeous sunny long days beautiful warmth a little bit of crispness in the morning is perfect for getting that shiraz and the nebula ripe i would imagine that we've probably got another i don't know two or three weeks still for them to be on the vine so we're just hoping that the uh that the weather is going to be kind to us we're trying with the nebiolo it's tricky because we've only got the eight vines we've hardly got any fruit at all and so every time we sample the berries then we're reducing our crop um so so richard's been this is this is very this is very richard richards being doing um little samples of the nebula juice but instead of like trying to squash it through a sieve or whatever he's just doing he's doing like um four to eight berries of nebiolo that he picks off the like one berry from each vine basically and then he puts it in a garlic crusher to squash the juice out i hope i think he's washed the garlic crusher out quite well because the juice doesn't taste garlicky but um he squashes it with the garlic crusher and then he's got this little tiny puddle of juice that we can test the um test the sugars and check the acid and taste and the flavors are developing quite nicely thank you craig i think that would be lovely i think you could actually we could actually be picking around the 28th 27th 28th of march so that could be a good thing for you to come and help us with all weight fines um but yeah and certainly it'll certainly be very close to being on the cards by then so that'll be that'll be a fun thing to uh to be able to to show you if we've if we've picked it or even if we haven't um uh craig rob on monday yes monday peanut ground skins i think the pinot gris on skins um might have already started fermenting before this week well i'm not sure i'll have to check with richard and he's out walking with the dogs at the moment um coty the wheat the wheat has been harvested uh and um richard got a bag of grain and i think i told you guys last year that he has a little a little um flour mill in his laboratory so he's been milling the wheat and making some bread from uh partly merida wheat and partly wheat that we get from flour that we get from elsewhere and the reason that i'll rain on monday thanks rob always always there with the weather for me anyway so coty yes the wheat he did an experiment um when we first got the wheat of making a whole like a loaf of bread just with the muruduk wheat and we think it's probably more it's it the gluten is not awesome in it it's quite it made quite a cakey life of bread so it might be good for making cakes except that because we're milling it ourselves we don't really have the capacity to um sift all of the bran out effectively so maybe bran muffins but he's having quite a lot of success just making a little making a couple of wholemeal loaves for the family that's half murdoch wheat and half wheat from elsewhere so i'm going to suggest to him though that he holds on to some so that when we have our muradak lunches then he can make the bread with some muridak wheat so that those of you who come along to the lunches can get a taste of it so i think that would be quite fun um but he'll i i don't i'm not sure what we're doing next with that paddock but um but the cabernet the cabernet's out i think that's a great idea angela simon thank you what a micro bag of richard's grain mill it yourselves and make one scone each to taste has everyone got a flower meal so that you can do that i'm not sure i i think it's a great idea simon but not everyone's quite as geeky oh yeah good fair enough craig i'll talk to richard see what i can organize um yeah and i was just thinking that that that the wheat paddock is now um lying fallow to uh other grasses and grains and things that got planted after we harvested the wheat and it's just got the i don't know the stalks left so i'm not sure what the next plan is i will talk to richard and jeremy and report back to you about that but it it did also bring something else home today we had some friends who were helping to make some wine this year um and i was hoping we might be able to uh include their cabernet in one of our tasting boxes but they tell me they've hardly got any left so um i have to go back to the drawing board with that one um but then one is fleet wine i think i talked to you about it last week maybe um anyway they're based in gippsland and if you ever get down um get down there then uh they make some lovely wine and uh and they were here today and we were talking about cabernet and dad opened a mystery bottle and hey presto and don't even think about it because i think it was maybe the second last bottle that he's got in existence but we got to taste dad's first wine that he ever made the 1986 cabernet and that was incredible um it's incredible because the wine is actually still drinking well um it looks old but it looks like cabernet and all of the guys i kind of recognized it because he's opened it a couple of times in the not too distant past and it's it 1986 was our first crop it was we picked on his birthday which was um which is the 28th of march so any of you coming to the lunch don't forget to say happy birthday to richard uh it's 28th of march and we picked it a little bit early because um he wanted to have a pick for his 40th birthday and so it's only it's only 11 alcohol and it has aged amazingly so anyway that was very special i'm sorry i can't share that with all of you but um jeff got to try it um and it was really delish cotty i agree there rose is beautiful they also make a pinot ground skins which is um which is pretty yum too uh yes rob i'm sure we will be putting a good green manure crop on and the plan is i think to do uh uh to to do um a series of crop green manure crops um to build up the quality of the soil over the next two or three years before we replant that um it's a long term plan for for that paddock it's about a hectare of the property so it means that we're a little bit short of um pinot noir for a few years but hopefully if we can get that soil really absolutely schmick um we'll be able to get some very good results from that and in the meantime we can decide whether we think it's worth planting more nebiolo or maybe some flower frankish or another one i tasted um just today is a zavigalt also from austria i think we'll be planting some gold we like black frankish better but but there's regal tonight today was very interesting very interesting indeed anyway uh i think that i actually think that today is an absolute killer of a chardonnay day so while it was very special to taste old cabernet lunch time i'm so happy drinking this uh i have some news it's not very exciting news but jeff and i have finally um finalized we think the next tasting pack so we're just um putting together the getting the information together and making sure we've got all the wines here um and we'll be putting a button um for the next six pack up on the shop very soon grin of elena would be fun too craig i really like gruner um i'm not sure how it would go here on the mornington peninsula and that's a very precious hectare of land i have a feeling we'll probably plant more pinot noir but you never know there could be there could be some experimental things happening as well so next week is the last week for this pack that we've got so you've got one bottle left and i can't remember what it's supposed to be i think it's uh what is that what have you got left is it the hmm pinot gris is a pen agree uh anyway um let me just look it up quickly while i'm talking i can look things up and talk at the same time uh and the following week we're going to have a cocktail break and i'll tell you about that next week because i haven't decided what cocktail to do so if anyone's got any requests of course you can drink whatever you want to but i thought we could have a play around with another another nice long drink like a gin and tonic shell good good spot that's richard's guitar richard got that guitar that was given to him for his 21st birthday by jill and some friends from university and he leaves it lying around uh and uh devil bean creek peanut thanks everyone yep that's what we're drinking next week um which will be delicious uh and yes no the guitar is richard's it's old and precious and he leaves it lying around on the sofa and one day it will fall off and break and he'll be heartbroken but that's just the way things roll around here um there will be pinot noir next week and then a cocktail the following week so uh any requests for cocktails suggestions whatever i was thinking maybe a daiquiri or possibly a margarita if people are into if anyone is interested in tequila we could do another gin cocktail or we could just you know just bring whatever you feel like cup of tea or something or a beer and we can have a chat next week about about cocktails and mojito we could absolutely do a mojito craig um as long as do you know what the only the only spirit that i am not prepared to play around with is vodka because i drank too much of it at a party when i was 19 and i can't go back i think emily margarita would be high up on my list of um of of things to do so we'll have it we'll have a bit of a but if anyone wants to email me um or text me about their their cocktail um preferences my plan is to do a little cocktail break in between each of the six wine tastings so and we can also michael have a look at some um other wines from other places and things that make good apperatives and uh digestivity as we say in italian or digestives um and rather glenn musket would certainly uh hit the spot there i will do some planning and some organizing and we will um we will reconvene next week and and get this all nutted out in the meantime enjoy the sunshine enjoy your snacks don't forget to try this wine with oysters if you like oysters one day soon because they will bring you it will bring you great joy and happiness in the meantime enjoy your enjoy your cheesy might scrolls enjoy your enjoy your fish and chips enjoy your calamari enjoy your spaghetti vongole everybody and stay happy enjoy yourselves and and i'll see you all again next week cheers everyone", "UfykUnsoRh0": "[Laughter] [Music] hi as Beverly when natives test natural and so I'm here to make a video and hopefully I'll get the opportunity to do this over a 10-day period and once you ought to come along with me on a ten day detox I'm doing using herbs that I got from a gentleman on Facebook loser herbalist and his name is Douglas September and that's not spelt like the month is s EPT IMV you are I think it is September and so he's an herbalist who makes a detox and you can buy them in you know different days or increments so my husband and I decided we would do a 10 day detox now let me just give you a heads up we actually started detoxing nine days ago not with this product but we just pre pre started where we started eliminating sugar other than the natural sugars and fruit we haven't been doing any sugar no rice no pasta we stopped eating processed food a long time ago so no processed food and so we started that way and we already saw a difference with just eliminating those items and then drinking more water and eating lots of fruits and vegetables and lean meat not a lot of lean meat just small amounts of lean meat you know four to six ounces once or twice a day and then but throughout the day just loading up on fruits and vegetables fresh fruits and fresh vegetables okay so I'm gonna just take you along with me here I'm gonna just zoom in on this paper and as you can see it's the Douglas I mean Doug's amazing detox and so on here with this detox is like do not eat any beef pork eggs cheese milk rice potatoes no creamy sauces pasta bread creamy dressing soda alcohol or sweets chips and candy bars and do not you coconut or almond milk so for breakfast you can have oatmeal with the fruit or just or just fruit and then do the drink to d2 half the detox and then for lunch salad with turkey fish of chickens injuring the other half of detox or he gives you the option at either the breakfast of the lunch you can drink the detox in full and my husband I decided we would do it that way you know just drink it all down at once and so it's lunchtime for me now and so I'm going to take my detoxing in you know fix myself a quick salad or so and so the snacks you can have healthy snacks but nothing that contains peanuts now I don't eat peanuts anyway but what I decided to have around for my healthy snacks are you know either you know nibble on carrots or celery or raw nuts being the cashews almonds pecans or we can't use almonds pecans or walnuts or anything what's the last one all right so you must drink at least 64 ounces of water each day being spring or alkaline and then get down because you have to flush out the toxins you have to get down minimum for 16-ounce bottles of water so here we're going to start with the detox instructions is using a new nutribullet ninja or assembler so I have a nutribullet and then we're going to combine that with 20 ounces of spring water or 100% percent organic juice what my husband I decided we would do is use half-and-half 10 ounces of water or a mix with 10 ounces of 100% organic juice and then you add back 1 bag of the detox makes one green apple along with any other fruit you want to add and then lastly add 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and then blend and then mix it into you know pour it into like a mason jar 24 ounce mason jar alright so here I've already prepped some of the items the detox we bought the 10-day and so this is mine my husband has his own detox bag labeled for him with the 10 pounds or so so this is my first one of the day I'm doing the afternoon one so here's how it looks our pre-bagged so that's in bags in there so it's prepackaged so you don't have to do any measuring or anything like that and here we only use in our house the real deal but apple cider vinegar has got to be the raw unfiltered Bragg's apple cider vinegar that's the only one we use in our house and for the juice we have with this one we have different juices but for this particular one I'm going to use the organic cranberry pomegranate okay no sugar addict that's important no sugar edit because we're eliminating sugar out of my diet and then we're deciding that this is just how we're gonna be for you know pretty much try to live like not taking in all this sugar okay and so we're doing the alkaline water the essential water is our water of choice because you said to juice spring or alkaline and here is my one green apple already cut up and then I will be tossing in a few berries into it so I'm just gonna put this down because I want it since I don't have another set of hands now put everything together there now come back when it's all mixed it smells very earthy smells very earthy so here's my first up this is my first day so you'll get the first impression it's actually good I hope I blend it in enough though I'm chewing stuff did you show stuff when you had it okay my husband said nobody here Apple the Apple peeling it's pretty good thumb I definitely taste the Apple a smoother apple cider taste the Apple and it's another taste is almost minty then you taste that too honey when you're drinking something's minty in there mmm I know one man could fill at the back of my throat right I mean Douglas said when I he messaged me about it you know he said it's very potent I could see that I could see why he would say that it is not a strong taste like I said it tastes earthy a little bit but I definitely taste the Apple and I smell the vinegar it smells tastes a little minty there's another taste I know that taste but I can't I can't I can't pinpoint it is another face right I know what it is but I can't pinpoint it but it has a little kick to it so it seemed I got some cayenne in here it's like it's like some kick to it yeah have a look at but I swear it feels like it feels like my throat is opening up which is a good thing because I was having an issue what um the way the back of my throat feeling I felt like it's just opening up mmm okay so I'm gonna go off my own and get this all down yeah I forgot you know when I read it the paperwork the other day when it came in the package came in but I forgot um it contains Moringa bladderwrack Irasema turmeric Hum Tum berry and many other powerful herbs as using this product to detox the body they aid in cleansing the liver kidneys heart blood and intestines okay and then it's just their testimony this product is not an insecure about to detox the body of toxins mucus and parasites from the various foods we eat following the instructions and have an amazing toxin removing detox experience okay so yeah so would whoops so with reading reading reading that in what I said in many other powerful herbs I guess I can taste some cayenne or something in here while I was making my nose right okay so this is a good thing so I'm gonna keep you guys posted on what happened stay with me okay it's um wrapping up the end of day one with the detox and earlier about an hour after I drank the detox mixture I had to go home oh my word I had to go not like diarrhea or anything but it's just like well I have a healthy bowel movement anyway I can go pretty much any time I eat after any time I eat but when did the detox you know drinking a detox formula I mean herbs it it caused me to like really really clean out I'm like oh my gosh and you know so I can feel things changing like you know I could Philip breaking up mucus and I just you know for the most part I eat a pretty good diet I had kind of gotten away from my being a hundred percent paleo you know going to parties and eating cake and stuff like that and kind of drifted off and then found myself having a hard time getting back to 100% paleo and I was doing more like an 80/20 and I could feel the difference so that's why I really needed the felt the need for the detox and so with the with having completed day one I can I can say I can feel things um I know that I'm not that full of taxes like the first time I ever did a detox which was you know back in 2005 was first time I ever did it do talks and I pretty much like to do one every year but I was actually a little late this year almost when two years about one and so I felt the need for it in but I can say that you know like I said I can feel things kind of breaking up and I got the sniffles when I was drinking it earlier you know drinking the detox earlier and and I know it's like for cleaning up mucus or things like that and I'm really hoping that it will clear up a problem I'm having with my ears I'm really hoping that I hope with that you know so I'm excited to see where the full 10 days will take me and I know it's gonna be a difference before starting this detox like I said I kind of prepped forward ahead of time by you know not eating sugar and processed foods and no rice no potato I mean I did have a couple of french fries the other day but no rice and no pasta no bread hadn't touched bread in like nine days nine nine or ten days now my bram getting brain fog because it makes me sleepy it's 10:30 and I'm kind of sleepy so I'm not thinking straight but I just wanted to like come in and tell you guys how day one wind and we'll see um I know it's gonna be good if I can feel like this on day one and I know it's just greatness ahead of me alright thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe [Laughter] [Music] you [Music]", "6oVVSPvzO0o": "[Music] hey guys I'm summing panda welcome to my channel so it occurred to me that I haven't done a Nutrition video for a very long time and you guys have been messaging me and asking and saying ah you know where's the nutrition what more nutrition bits I love the feedback I've got on my other vids by the way my breakfast video my snack video and my world's best lasagna video and that I put out so today I'm gonna give you something that I eat frequently you know this is a meal that I have a number of times a week and it's from the tower you're thinking how interesting can this be meal B because it is a salad what is so interesting what is so tasty about a salad well let me tell you something I used to think the same I used to think that salads were boring and anytime there was salad on the menu it would be the last female order however that changed I don't know when it changed but it changed when I started to order you know some salads from some restaurants and they came packed with protein and packed with fruits apples raspberries berries and all sorts of other ingredients that really bring a salad to life and make it taste amazing so because of that salad is now a staple in my diet I love a salad a good salad - salad so that's what I'm gonna show you guys today it's gonna be a high-protein salad with chicken and have egg in it a lot of the time I do add shrimp as well you know it's just a combination of amazing flavors and textures the textures are important in a salad so along with the high protein we're gonna have other things in there to give it the texture so you're gonna have a card oh you're gonna have nuts to give it a crunch so many different little things can make a salad tastes amazing the berries to get a little sweetness you know but um yeah I'm gonna take you through that today I'm excited to show you guys and let's get cooking okay so in this bowl I have the chicken breast that we're going to cook and you know when you buy a salad and the chicken comes and it's dry and that is one of the reasons why love us avoid ordering a salad if you ordered a chicken salad you know the chickens gonna be unseasoned it's gonna be dry and tasteless and probably not gonna come with much else but some lettuce and some dry stale bread if you ordered in a Caesar salad days so but what we're gonna do is we're gonna make sure that our chicken is succulent we're gonna make sure that it's well-seasoned and tasty you know because that's a real important factor of whether you're going to enjoy this salad or the potent got it taste nice so we have our chicken breast here then we're gonna season it first before we put it in the oven now guys set your oven to 450 or about 205 degrees Celsius and get that warmed up because we're gonna need that hot and firing ready to go when we've seasoned our chicken so before we get going with the seasonings we're gonna start with some olive oil I always use olive oil now how much you add depends on how much chicken you've got for me I think that's substantial enough okay now what you season that with is very important I have an abundance of seasonings what I'm actually going to do in this video is I'm gonna show you my seasoning draw and show you everything that I have in there now what I choose depends on the day how I'm feeling and what I'm going for with my meal you know but I really do sometimes just pick and choose I like a bit of it this today I'm gonna have some sage I'm gonna have some thyme some rosemary but then it depends on the date today we are going with we're gonna go with some paprika yeah we're gonna go with some crushed chilies and black pepper always always black pepper you go have that pepper and then what else are we going to have lets us engage I'm gonna have some Cajun seasoning so these are choices today yeah okay so how much you add again is uh depends on them just how seasoned you want it you know and and how much chicken breast you've got so I do want a nice coating over the over the chicken breasts I want enough [Music] and guys this is a really quick milk I mean the longest part is actually waiting for the chicken to cook but once that's done trust me the rest is very easy and very quick [Music] now I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty I know a lot of you might not want to get stuck in you could probably use a spoon or wooden spoon if you need to do it like that bar I'm not raising my hands day so I'm gonna make sure that I massage all of the seasoning in and make sure that each chicken breast is covered don't if I can show you guys that can you see that just making sure everything gets covered and the olive oil helps the seasoning bind to the chicken oh and some of you are gonna ask where was the soul I don't I don't really cook of salt at all for me there's probably some salt in some of these seasons like occasions probably looks salt in it a very small amount so yeah I don't add salt to my food I don't feel that I need to be honest a lot of food and I already had enough sodium and yeah I just don't add salt to my food I've done a whole video on why I don't add salt it's not a big deal to be honest it's just that especially living out here in the u.s. food is high in sodium very high so I don't feel the need to add extra salt to my food [Music] so what you're going to do is you're going to cover your baking tray in foil as I said I'll show you guys how my chicken looks that you can see it's completely covered in seasoning and olive oil and it should taste amazing once it's cooked we're gonna lay that out on the baking tray I don't get my hands dirty again so we can use a knife and fork to lay it out by the way guys if you're wondering why I'm wearing these colorful shorts I just thought I'd brighten up your day simple as that but why not wear something nice and rare to put everyone in a good mood because obviously we're all dealing with what we're dealing with right now so nice purse women shorts puts me in a good mood still waiting for the oven to finish preheating but as soon as this beeps and gives me the all-clear I'm gonna shove it in and we're gonna leave it for about 20 to 25 minutes we do the main thing is we don't want dry chicken we want our chicken to be juicy tender succulent so that's what we're going for but we're gonna aim for like 20 to 25 minutes we'll test it and see how it is after that time and then I want to show you the rest of the ingredients that were gonna have in our cellar back in a sec [Music] okay guys so the chicken is cooked I've tasted one I'm checked that it's cooked throughout and it is and it tastes amazing nice and spicy succulent and that's what we're gonna do we're gonna cut it up and have it ready for the salad and put it in our perspective and that we're going to keep and we can use that throughout four different meals we can have it with some whole burning rice and some vegetables and we can have it obviously in our salads but what we're going to do is we're going to cut it up so that it's ready just to go straight on to a meal [Music] now you can put as much or as little chicken as you like I like it to be protein heavy so I want a much chicken in there as possible as you can see how soft that is that's one soft juicy chicken in my salad I probably use one and a half of the chicken breast which is quite a bit but that's how much I want in mind so that is ready for my salad I'm gonna put these other chicken breasts in this dish [Music] okay so our chickens ready and the next thing we're going to do is actually make the base of the salad and we are going to take some organic spring mix triple washed as much or as little as you'd like now we're also going to add some baby arugula and the arugula has a peppery taste which is awesome it's like that so you're not gonna need much of it you're not gonna add the same amount only a handful and you're just gonna mix that up for my British people arugula is bucket same thing so I'm gonna add some more point into the meal we have some chopped pecans add some of that we have some sliced diced almonds add some of that a little bit more there you go that's gonna add the crunch so all different textures is gonna create an amazing salad with just different textures we're also gonna add some dried cranberries now with cranberries cranberries are awesome and great antioxidants but they're high in sugar so I've actually opted for a variety that is 50% less sugar and then we're gonna add a few of those just make sure they break up there you go and last but not least what we actually got a few more little things to add but last but not least with the arms I have on the table is raspberries again it's all about texture is all about flavor so these are gonna have a sweet texture to the salad now what I'm gonna add to that is a drizzle of olive oil just a drizzle there you go now one of the most important things is the balsamic now this makes or breaks the salad for me personally I used to have a bottle of balsamic that we got from Italy that's Italy not Italy and it was an expensive bottle and it was very it had a high viscosity was very thick and gloopy and it tastes amazing for me the the thick of the balsamic so far correlates with the better the flavor for me this is a new bottle that I haven't opened yet not gonna open it today I'm gonna stick with one that I have been using here and I'm gonna put a drizzle of it over this is really important this really kicks the flavor there you go there another thing that adds texture texture is very important guys keep going on about it because it's so important when you're eating and this is gonna add a creamy texture and it is the avocado this is a small EPPICard off there you go gonna add our chicken now there is one more thing that I add to my salad it's all probably packed already I'm gonna add even more I'm gonna add an egg white omelet [Music] and we are done check now how amazing is that look so we got a succulent chicken in there we got egg white in there we've got avocados we have raspberries we have almonds we have pecans what else did before we know we have cranberries this is going to taste amazing now guys I have been eating salad similar to this everyday different ones now sometimes I use chicken sometimes I use shrimp sometimes I use chicken and shrimp it's this so much right and sometimes I use apples sometimes I use grapes you can choose between what you want in there but it is full of life Gary's so much nutrients antioxidants protein everything's covered everything's covered now as for carbs most of the mills that I have a low car however sometimes if I want to add carbs to this hour at quinoa you know so that's another variety that you can add but yeah this is a meal that I've been neatly frequently guys I know that a lot of you take what I say and think that you know you have to follow it to the letter you don't so this is just one of my meals I don't eat this all day long you know I eat about five times a day so there are several different meals and this may be this may be two of them but then there's other meals you know what I had for breakfast already [Music] there's other meals but I have rice and Matt cool a lot I love my pool I eat a lot of salmon so I will show you some other meals but I just don't want you to think that this is all I this is one of my staples I love this meal and I'm going to tuck into it right now so I'm gonna have to love you and leave you guys I appreciate you following I'm gonna do some more nutrition videos tell me specifically what you would like to see and I will record it peace out love you guys easy [Music] [Music] you", "RcNUGJT4JaQ": "hi friends welcome back to my channel and welcome if you're new here it is Monday so that means it is meal prep day I have three absolutely delicious recipes coming your way we have kind of a sweet breakfast a lunch and a sweet treat for a snack or dessert all our clean eating all are phenomenal so definitely stay tuned for three outstanding w-w recipes [Music] for breakfast this week I'm making strawberry shortcake Chavez we're revisiting Chavez but we're making them sweet this time I'm going to pair these with some eggs and maybe some additional fruit I do not have any strawberry extract which this recipe called for I couldn't find it so I omitted that but that is part of the recipe this recipe of course will be on my website so let me show you what you're going to need for some strawberry shortcake Charles first Jill needs your cute little mini - waffle maker I will link this down below about this on Amazon I love it you're also going to need some eggs baking powder cream cheese I'm just using this whipped cream cheese because I love it for one and it mixes really well for chocolate you'll need some fresh strawberries and some mozzarella cheese so let's get started on breakfast so the first thing we need to do is chop up some strawberries I want I don't know two to three strawberries perch awful so I'm actually going to cut these fairly small because I want to mix the strawberries in with the rest of the chocolate and the mozzarella and that way we have little bits of strawberries throughout our chavo so let me get these cut up and then we're ready to mix together the actual chavo ingredients [Music] so let's make the first chocolate I have my waffle iron plugged in warming up in my bowl the first thing I'm going to do is crack my egg the egg is always the base of the chocolate chocolate basically egg and cheese mozzarella is such a mild flavor that you can really use it in any type of chafa whether it's sweet or savory so it's a really good choice so I have one egg to that I'm going to add 28 grams of mozzarella which is basically a quarter of a cup I weighed that out on my food scale also I weighed out two tablespoons of that Trader Joe's whipped light cream cheese and then we're going to add in just some of our chopped up strawberries and then we're gonna give this a stir so take your fork make sure you get that cream cheese mixed in really well with the egg in the mozzarella and then as soon as our waffle iron is warmed up we're ready to start our truffle so our iron is warm I'm gonna go ahead and open it up spray it with some nonstick cooking spray so that your child isn't stick this amount of mix is most likely going to make two truffles so I'm gonna put in about half of it you don't want to overfill this little thing otherwise it just goes all over the side so yeah we're definitely gonna get to Charles at of this so I'm gonna go ahead and put my mixture in close up your little mini waffle maker give it a little bit of a push when the light turns off your chop was done all right guys hey oh I think that the wetness of the chunks of strawberries makes it impossible to make this into a chapel it will not come out of the little waffle maker because the strawberries are so wet it's so soft so we're going to go to plan B and we're going to make like a chalk and cake in a pan and I think that's going to work so much better so let me show you what I'm gonna do round two so I'm gonna make the chocolate just like I made it before but I realize we also forgot to add baking powder which wouldn't change the fact that it wouldn't come out of the waffle maker but I am going to pop in my mozzarella I'm going to pop in my cream cheese and again I just made weight everything out on my food scale I'm going to put in just a tiny bit of baking powder and some fresh strawberries and our egg will get this mixed together and let's make it a pancake shuffle so I've added the chafa mixture to a nonstick skillet that I sprayed with this ghee spray from Drive and we're gonna let this cook just as we would a pancake we'll flip it let's see if it stays together but this may be the solution to our CH awful problem all righty so much better so the pancake works a lot better you do have to cook it low and slow so turn the temperature really far down on your stovetop let it really cook almost completely through before you flip it otherwise it just falls apart but there you go we made it work in pancake form so my last one is on the oven but let me give you the point so I'll be having this I'll probably pair this with another fruit I'm guessing and that'll be a really good well-balanced breakfast because it does have a lot of protein between the egg and the cheese and of course the cream cheese has protein as well so this choco Spain cake is for smart points on both blue and purple and six smart points on the green plan because you do have to count the egg so I just have it here on a paper plate I'm gonna let it cool completely wrap it in some cellophane and throw it in the fridge and then when I want to eat it for breakfast I'll just warm it up you could even add a teaspoon of maple syrup for one point if you want to kind of make it a little moist and add a little bit of sweetness so I may do that as well but there you go the fail turned into a win for lunch this week I'm going to be making salmon burgers and we're going to pop those on to an Ezekiel English muffin and make basically a burger with an English muffin so let me show you what's in our lunch first you're going to need some minced garlic I have two cans of salmon nonfat Greek yogurt these are the English muffins that I'll be using they're be Ezekiel from food for life they are found in the freezer section usually by the health food so we'll be using that as the bun of our salmon burger for seasoning I'm using the DAX original red eye you guys love this seasoning now that I've transitioned to a clean approach to WW I'm always looking for clean seasonings you'd be surprised how what is in a lot of these seasoning packets that we tend to use like the taco fajita that type of thing so that's is no salt all natural ingredients no msg love them they're full packed full of flavor so I like the original red it has a little bit of a kick so I'm going to add just a small amount to my salmon burgers but it'll really bring out those flavors now if you're interested in DAX I do have 10% off the code here on the screen will give you the 10% off and it's always free shipping that they have over 20 seasonings highly recommend so check them out and then of course we'll be doing just some salt and some pepper some fresh dill arugula which is going to add a really good kind of spicy flavor to our burgers a red pepper a small onion and a fresh lemon and of course an egg so let's get started on our salmon burger I forgot to include oat flour you are going to need some oat flour I pick mine up from the thrive market I do have a link down below for thrive it gets you $20 worth of free groceries with a year membership free shipping on the thrive market over $49 they literally ship within a day I have mine within two days you guys know I'm obsessed with thrive so oat flour came directly from the thrive market I went ahead and got chopped everything ready to go for these salmon burgers so I chopped up my red pepper that very very small onion the recipe actually calls for a red onion I just didn't have one so this is one of those really good sweet onions from Trader Joe's lots and lots Dyl and I went ahead acted the lemon here and squeeze the juice out of that really big lemon and now we're ready to actually start the salmon burgers oh and I also did the salmon so I drained the cans and kind of chopped it up here with my fork so let's start making the sauce for our burgers so first we're gonna go ahead and make the dill sauce for our salmon burgers so I'm gonna put in a big scoop of my immense of garlic and then to that I'm adding 1/2 of a cup of the font a 0% nonfat Greek yogurt like I mentioned I don't mind using nonfat Greek in recipes and cooking in things to save on the points but if I'm going to just eat yogurt I always choose a full fat option and then I have two tablespoons of the dill that I chopped up as well as two tablespoons of that fresh zested lemon juice lemon we're also gonna do a pinch of pepper and a pinch of salt and we're gonna stir this up and this is going to be the creamy dill sauce that's part of our burgers next up are the burgers so next up let's make the salmon burger so I have my two cans of salmon here to that I'm going to add three egg whites we're also going to add the zest of our lemon lemon and salmon is such a fantastic combination speaking of lemon we're gonna add the remainder of the lemon juice 1/3 cup of oat flour that's going to really help bind these together with the eggs we're also gonna drop in some pepper and a little bit of salt and then last we're going to put in all of our good veggies here so our dill our onion our red pepper we're gonna add all of that to the salmon mixture and then we're gonna stir it all together oh wait I forgot the DAX oh my goodness I definitely want to add that so let's get these veggies in here and then we'll go ahead and add in the little bit of DAX seasoning so now we're ready to form our burger so I'm gonna go ahead and spray my pan here with quite a bit of nonstick cooking spray I'm using of course the chosen foods avocado oil and then I'm going to take my mixture here and I'm going to form it into five patties my recipe here makes five salmon burgers so I'm gonna grab quite a large ball of it and kind of flatten it out the best that I can we want these to fit on the English muffin and they will shrink up a little bit during the cooking process so I want to make sure that I make them just the right size for it the English muffin and then we're going to place those here in our skillet and we're gonna repeat that until we have five salmon burgers so I was able to get four burgers into my pan here and I'll just cook the fifth one separately these actually look really good so I have them here in a skillet on medium-high heat we're gonna cook these until they are cooked completely through while our burgers are cooking I'm gonna go ahead and bag up my arugula because we are going to top our salmon burgers with just a little bit of arugula so I'm gonna put just a small handful in one of my little mini or snack sized Ziploc baggies and I'm gonna do that for all five days of the salmon burger and then that way we've got that nice little bit of arugula and we'll also wrap up at the English muffin so I went ahead and wrapped the English muffins and then I grab my little to-go containers with the plastic lids I bought these at HomeGoods I'm gonna go ahead and divide my little dill sauce here into four I decided to only do four patties I'm gonna go ahead and freeze the rest of the salmon because that way I have one day a week to have a different lunch I otherwise I get tired of the same thing every day so I'm gonna go ahead and just divide this into four servings instead of five servings and I'll calculate my point accordingly so I'm gonna go ahead and fill these up and then as soon as these burgers are done we'll put together our meal prep so the salmon burgers are done if they actually turned out really really good so I put those in the large side of my meal prep container so in the small side my meal prep container that's where I'm gonna go ahead and pop in that little bag of arugula and then here is about the dill dressing that I got per burger this is a good amount put that in there with the lid just right alongside of the arugula fill those compartments and then I'll go ahead and set the English muffin separately just set it aside and you'll just want to pack that with you if you're taking this to work with you make sure you pack your English muffin as well and then the rest is here in the meal prep container and when you go to warm up the salmon burger just pop these two out and then you can toast up your English muffin and we have a salmon burger so with four servings and that's changing the serving size from five to four it does not affect the points of the blue and purple plant it is still too smart points just for the salmon burger and the sauce and then my English muffins are four points so depending on the English muffin you choose your points will vary so this is six smart points for me now on the green plan it is six smart points just for the salmon burger and then four points for the English muffins so this would be 10 points depending on your English muffin on the green plan but I'm excited for this it's a heart healthy protein really excited to give these salmon burgers a try and I think the arugula spiciness and that fresh dill and creaminess of the yogurt is going to be an excellent combo for snack this week I'm going to be making coconut lime bars I'm so excited about this clean recipe good smart points it's such a summer vibe I cannot wait let me show you what's in our bar first you're going to need some rolled oats nut butter of your choice unsweetened coconut flakes honey apple sauce and a couple of fresh limes so super easy six ingredients let's get started so the first thing we're gonna do is go ahead and grab out a sheet pan and your two cups of oats we're just gonna put those here on our sheet pan and essentially we're going to roast these in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes at 350 degrees no added oil just literally the oats on a sheet pan so I'm gonna toss these into the oven alright I just pulled the toasted oats out of the oven now we're gonna combine all the rest of our ingredients so I have the juice of one of those two limes I also have the zest of both limes so you're gonna zest both juice one I always like to save the lime to put in my water because I really do like lime in my water so I did that with the other line that I didn't juice one cup of unsweetened coconut flakes 1/2 of a cup of honey so it's a lot of honey in the air but that's what's going to bind it and that is also what's going to give our bars their sweetness because we don't have anything else in these bars that has any sweetness so basically there's no sugar or anything like that in these bars only the honey so that's our sweetener oven it's just about ready for the bars and then I have 1 cup of mixed and nut butter again you can use whatever nut butter you want I just have the big huge jar from Costco so whenever I bake that's generally what I'll use cuz otherwise I'm using almost the full jar of a regular sized jar of peanut butter and I do like the mix and nut butter with the addition of the Chia and things in there as well I think it adds a little extra bit of nutrition and then last but not least I have 1/2 of a cup of fun applesauce let's stir this together all right so we're ready to take that mixture put it into a nonstick sprayed baking dish nine by 13 we're gonna go ahead and add the mixture now the recipe says that this mixture is a little temperamental so it's a bit hard to spread out but you want to take the time to spread it out as evenly as possible in the bottom of your baking dish I don't think it's too terrible so that you get a nice even layer so that your bars are therefore nice and even so I'm gonna get this spread out in the bottom of my baking dish and then this is going to actually go in a 350 degree oven so the same temperature as our oats so don't be like me and turn your oven off like I did that's why it had to kind of read preheat so make sure you leave your oven on after you remove your oats from toasting and we're gonna cook this at 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes or until our bars are done so I am getting this into the oven and I'll be back in a flash to show you our completed coconut lime bars our bars are out of the oven don't these look absolutely delicious I'm going to let them cool for just a few minutes and then we're gonna cut these into 24 squares using a pizza cutter and then we want to allow them to fully cool before we eat them but I'll be back to show you guys the size of the bars and we'll go over the smart points so I've went ahead and cut our bars into 24 so you can see this is about the size of the bar which I would say is probably like a 1 and 1/2 inch by one and 1/2 inch bar maybe it's you buy to you so not a bad size at all let me go ahead and pull one out of here so you can see the actual bar so here is the completed bar these looks so good so one twenty-fourth or one bar is five smart points on both the blue and the green plan and four smart points on the purple plan these are outstanding you guys you get the zest of the lime but they're sweet and crunchy from those toasted oats so delicious highly highly this recipe so there you have it for our coconut lime oat bars there are couple snack options for the week I just got another refill of the little mini packs or six snack packs of the simple Mill's farmhouse cheddar I really like these I like that they're portion controlled they're similar to a cheese it I like to eat them by themselves you can pair them with cottage cheese laughing cow cheese there are four smart points for the pack and again they're individually serving their individual servings so overeating is doesn't happen because their individual little bags I buy these off of the thrive market there is a link down below for thrive so definitely check that out and then I always like to have a built barb as an option as well I do eat these a few times a week the coconut almond is really good this is reminiscent of an almond joy it is three smart points it's delicious and then the peanut butter built bar all of the nut based bars with the exception of this one the almond joy are for smart points because they have added nuts but I like them because they usually have an punch of protein this one has 20 grams seven fiber and seven fat so I find for me for the extra point I stay a lot more satiated for a lot longer so I tend to gravitate towards the nut based bars but if I want to save a point I'll go for the og bell bars or the coconut almond this one is truly absolutely amazing I'll go for these guys cuz you're still getting a good amount of protein fiber and fat so three to four smart points for a protein bar that literally tastes like a candy bar is awesome so if you're interested in the built bar my code here on the screen gives you 10% off and free shipping if you are new to built bar there's a special link down in the description box just

I'm Catherine crouch BBC gardener of the decade and here we are at the beautiful Somerset gardens of Eastland Brook Manor and I'm going to be showing you how to plant a tub of beautiful flowers that will keep going all the way through the summer in a really lovely hot theme of reds and purples I've got this really lovely terracotta popped from the garden center lovely glaze of Browns and reds to complement our theme you can see it's got a good hole in the bottom which neat we need for drainage now a good pot is a good investment this was 20 pounds on special offer first of all we need to make sure that we can drain all the water through when we're watering so I'm going to use pieces of broken pots any gardener will end up with a collection of these whether they like it or not so put one a good size piece upside down on the hole and then I'm going to add some more pieces so I've got a good airspace at the bottom so when we're watering all the water will drain through nicely if you haven't got any crock pieces then one stone across the hole and a layer of gravel in the bottom of the pot will be fine so here we are without sliding them to one side can you see the crocs in the bottom there now I've got a really lovely selection of plants and it's not rocket science to plant a tub you just shove in some compost and shove in some plants easy peasy but today I'm going to show you some tips that will really make your pots that extra bit special now I went to a plant demonstration and I heard this wonderful American woman say honey when you're doing a mix turb what you want is a thriller a filler and a Spiller makes perfect sense now our thriller is the main event in the pot that gives us some height and this is a beautiful cordyline Torbay red which you can see is a really good color to go with our pot then I'm going to have as our filler which is our Center main color event three beautiful Ostia sperm and two of them in a lovely flame red and just for fun a really rich velvety purple now first of all I need to fill up the tub half way with compost and the aim of the game is to end up with the tops of the root balls about an inch in a bit below the top of the rim so as when we're water we can just fill up all that top space with water let it drain down through we don't want them too deep we don't want to see if they're sticking out either so let's start off and bang some soil in use a nice big scoop pop it in over the top of our crocks there we are that's about right to start with now you can see that our main thriller plant appears to be taking up nearly all of the pot already so we're going to have to do some clever cutting in order to make sure we've got room for all the other things now if we put the Ostia Spearman's in with this cordyline can you see how it's going straight over the top of the Ostia sperma so what I want to do is give this a bit of a trim so using just an audrey pair of scissors I can just quietly cut off right next to the stem the very lowest of the shoots we won't see these when the pots completed just take the label off now the great thing about using these is these plants if we're giving a mild winter maybe a little protection the core designs are Hardy and you'd be able to use this plant year after year there we are that should do it so we've got some cuts there they won't show a little bit more oblique so knock it out of its pot now we are lovely rootball teased out some of these long roots just so as it encourages the plant to send out new growth into the compost instead of going round and round in circles so we're going to pop this in the pot like so now we're really going to have to plant these fairly tight so I'm going to just tease off the root ball either side to make this slightly flattened oval instead of a round shape the plant won't mind if we break a root it can grow another one take all these old tacks are out and then going to put this it's hard to the back of the pot as I can't now then for our Ostia sperm and these were bought a couple of days ago and already one or two the first flowers have gone over so just for the look of the things I know I've heard it and cut it off but when you deadhead something cut down to something definite like a joint don't just cut the flower head off otherwise you'll end up with a sort of forest of ugly spikes but can you see how these lovely buds are going to give us a continuous succession of flowers all the way through the summer absolutely yummy now there's a very well grown root ball almost too well grown we can lose some of this years ago now this was planted just a little bit of in a smaller pot so I'm going to bring up the level of the compost so we end up with all the tops of our plants at the same level let's put our lovely purple Ostia sperm in the middle we've lost one flower in action there we go okay same again tease out all these roots so we're nearly full but you'd be surprised there's still room for more plants the more we can stuff in the more spectacular the days go the display is going to be a bit of a tap don't worry if we only feel please it'll be fine so to contrast with our rich brooding hot colors I'm going to put some lovely lime-green helichrysum and these are our Spillers they will spill over the front of the container and these can grow 2 or 3 feet in the season and sea of compost underneath they'll go like nobody's business this is a heavy price on gold you can also get these plants in variegated and silver forms for other color schemes that's one of my favorites for a big pot swing over the top now what else have we got we can still pack in a few plants this is a lysimachia Midnight Sun so the lovely dark bronze is matching the dark colors of the pot and a quarter line I'll see if I've got space for that this will have beautiful yellow flowers in later summer once the plant is established lovely contrast there but dark foliage and the light love that really yummy I've also got I don't will get away with this this is a little climber climbs to 2 or 3 feet for if it's really well fed and this is Sundberg your orange beauty otherwise known as black-eyed Susan if I find a little space for it I wonder if she's going to climb her way up through cordyline in the summer it's always worth a try see what you can do little stake let's lose the label I never got a space back here yeah I've got my rummage down through I got a space behind one of the Ostia sermons so I'm just going to pop that in there take the top off that hope we won't have alright out trail that up through now it doesn't look like anything at all at the moment but I'm hoping that will come how are we doing I think I might take one or two more of these leaves of the Coeur de Lion not because we're still not seeing posture determines the best effect so let's do a little bit more of a trim it won't mind these plants grow like toothpaste coming out to the cube it will produce more shoots out of the top of the plant but I think we look better if it's coming up as a bit of a fountain rather than spreading out completely take some off this side as well try not to cut all the flower heads off the mouse just Berman's there we go we've still got a nice bit of vertical effect but now we can see the Ostia sperms a lot better now we just need to pack in more compost in around the gaps literally in the plants and using a dipper is a really good idea to make sure that we haven't got any gaps you can see how wobbly our quarter line is so that needs a good packing around to keep it stable more compost and this will take a little while so don't rush it feel down with your hands to see we haven't left any yawning gaps now even when you push as much compost in between the plants you might find that after you've watered it all in watering is not just to moisten and already moist pop that it's to settle the compost firmly around the roots of the plants you might find if you've got a bit of a hole then the compost sinks down so water it and then have another look to see if you need to add any more compost don't worry about getting compost all over the leaves because that will wash off when water there we go that's pretty good now looks like we're complete but there's still something we can do to give this some extra varoom here's a pack of insertion now this is a climbing variety from certain seeds called tropical mix now climbers don't have to climb in nature they often sprawl so what I want to do is to just take some of these seeds and these are nice and easy too so they're really quite big seeds very happy to grow in competition and I'm just going to poke a few of them just down to my finger joint in around the edge of the pot I'm hoping that these will germinate where they can see the light and spill out over the pot lovely orange and yellow and scarlet flowers and the could trail up to 3 feet away so it's going to look quite spectacular let's give it a go when you go now the sturm seeds aren't too expensive to buy and the great thing about growing things from seed if you don't tell anyone and they don't grow nobody's any the wiser so your reputation as a successful gardener will remain intact now we're still not done still a few holes here and to ensure that this display will keep going right the way through the summer we need to add some extra feed now when it came to compost years ago I was far too poor and mean to buy decent compost I have found that if you use a specialist tub and container compost success will be assured because you're paying for extra fertilizer and water retaining granules which if your pot should dry out completely it will absorb water much more readily now we are now don't worry if your container at this stage looks a little bit tatty because all our plants are facing in funny directions that will improve once it grows on a little bit so to ensure that this keeps going all the way through the year we want to give it some extra feed a couple of ways you can do it you can either water with a liquid fertilizer every time you water plant or every week or so I always end up forgetting so what I use now are these Osmocote slow release fertilizer capsules once you've got these in this should feed the whole pot for six months all you have to do is water and by the end of the season your pot will be twice as big as your neighbors for a pot this size I would probably use six or seven and just push them down into any gaps with your finger or thumb until they're sort of the length of half your finger down into the compost and every time you water these capsules will release a small amount of fertilizer and the plants will take it up and grow beautifully healthfully all summer long so only remains to meter find the odd extra gap if you don't want to use chemical fertilizer and would prefer an organic solution one thing you can use is pelleted chicken manure this is quite nice to handle just don't chew your fingernails afterwards wash your hands and sprinkle a little bit of this around here but I would probably be putting a handful of this on this pot in amongst the plants once a month right the way through the summer to make sure the nutrients carry on through so all we have to do now is clear up a little bit you know a little tweak and give it a water and there we have one hot tub for summer I planted this with my thriller to the back of the pot my fillers in the middle and my spill is at the front so I can view it from one side this would be great for planting and putting on my front doorstep for example if you want to plant this so as you can view it from all the way around put your thriller in and your fillers in a triangle around and then your Spillers all the way around the pop for more gardening and videos and lovely projects to do do visit silverlinetools.com [Music]", "Zrqjezrgbu8": "hey everybody so my name is Shane for those who may be new to watching my videos and following my account today I'm gonna be doing a what I eat in a day except it's not gonna be probably what most of you were expecting because I think that everybody's different everybody's bodies work differently everyone needs something specific to them so just making a video of what I eat and then doing it doesn't really seem super beneficial it doesn't seem to capture the meaning of fitness and a healthy lifestyle to me so follow along it's gonna be a little different but I hope that you can take the time to listen to this video and learn something about yourself what you need and how nutrition it's gonna step up your lifestyle so let's get started just ignore my little tattoo this is from my summer solstice yoga festival but anyway focus so we're gonna start with breakfast and so disclaimer this summer I'm living in San Francisco California and I'm staying in an apartment with the tiny little kitchen so I'm definitely not cooking as much as I do when I'm back in North Carolina so bear with me so yeah for breakfast I like to recently I've been working out before I eat breakfast because I have to get up so so early that I really wouldn't be able to eat that early that is something that you need to figure out for yourself so that's the first thing is when or is the best time for you to eat your meals for me it's best for workout and to eat breakfast while I'm getting ready to start my day so some things that I've always always included my breakfasts are black coffee I don't put anything else in it I drink it black I hire a prevent black coffee because it is the best form of coffee for you if you need coffee to get through your days or if you need something to caffeine or caffeinated to get through your day then black coffee is what I recommend so yeah definitely give that a try I don't know I got used to the taste pretty quickly I will change it up sometimes I'll take a spresso shot sometimes I'll drink tons and tons of coffee all day but aside from my coffee I make sure I'm drinking at least half a gallon of water like by mid-morning and or like afternoon so like noon to 2:00 so I recently got my hydro drug and it's gonna make it a lot easier because I'm just gonna fill it up when I wake up and I'm gonna try and finish it by at like noon to two or around lunchtime so I've got my coffee I've got my water and then you usually have a smoothie so recently like I said I haven't been I don't have a blender here like I'm not making my smoothies so I'm working with what I have I've been drinking naked and so I'll either try and consume greens in the morning or fruits in the morning and whichever when I pick I consider that when I'm eating my meals later in the day so first thing I do is pour myself a cup of my naked I currently have the strawberry banana there's 130 calories per serving I probably have sometimes a little less than the serving but around a serving a serving size is 8 fluid ounces ingredients uh let's see strawberries apple juice bananas orange juice natural flavors so again it's probably not the best thing for me it's not like I'm just chopping up my own fresh fruits blending them up and then drinking them but there's not a super-close smoothie shop to me there's not a super closest to me shelter where I work so this is what I've been drinking in the mornings this combines my coffee my water is all I do for breakfast but when I'm leaving I make sure to bring snacks so that I can snack until I get to lunch so next we're gonna move into some mid-morning snacks but the takeaway here is when is breakfast good for you is breakfast even good for you or you more like a brunch big lunch big dinner snacks in the morning type of person you have to do trial and error and you have to figure that out for yourself you can't just say this is a chain does so it's gonna work for me because that's not a guarantee so yeah some people who really like to have big breakfast like all their carbs in the morning and they burn burn burn them all throughout the day and they finished with a small meal I can't eat that much in the morning so that's what my body that's what I've learned about my body and you have to find what's right for your body so growing up I used to have huge breakfast I used to eat a bunch of carbs in the morning because I used to have like two and a half hour serve axes in the morning and if I didn't have energy I wouldn't get through them so really think about what you're doing until lunchtime and what you're getting to be a little fuel yourself until then and how you want to do that make sure you're thinking about your fruits and your veggies and your colors as well but let's move into mid-morning snack throughout the morning I have plenty of options I love snacking almost more than I really like meals so and that's something I'm working on to change my snacks into one healthier snacks and then to condense the alot of snacking I do but something I can always take a let's go on the go or my kind bars I know there's a lot of speculation with all these types of bars whether or not they're actually good for you and all that stuff it really just takes reading the ingredients kind bark can make like I have had some tongue bars that are like ninety eighty percent chocolate and like two percent nuts or two percent nutrients or whatever they're saying that they're giving you but I love these because they have dark chocolate which is preferable over milk chocolate they have peanuts and they're not they're not like so small so those are really small and eat them in one bite but I think these are pretty filling there's 150 calories in one of these bars so I think this is a great snack too that's not too many calories but also is yummy and keeps you going in the morning when your metabolism still going for me I've done a workout in the morning I've had my smoothie and now it's mid-morning going into the afternoon and I'm like I'm really hungry and can't we for lunch so this is a great in-between snack I'm not gonna read all the ingredients but there's oats there there's cane sugar so better than like the difference between like a coke and Mexican Coke so having like the healthier types of sugar semi-sweet chocolate brown rice I don't know if you really read the ingredients there are way better bars for you they probably don't taste as good this is not the end game I'm not eating like 13 and 12 or five of these a day I'm having one maybe two if I'm super hungry and my lunch is later than expected another good option for snacking at any point in the day or yogurts so I've currently been eating my Activia yogurts but yeah I love yogurt I love probiotics they're so good for your stomach they're yummy snack I currently have the flavors mixed berry blackberry I really like the mixed berry and like strawberry bananas I think I had like a peach one last week and that was really great but yeah these come in packs of 12 they come in giant boxes so yogurt is a great way to bring with you on the go if you're struggling with keeping foods cold these are so small that like there's really like get a small cooler you know what I mean like you can have a tiny little one that's really cute thief in your purse in your bag pack a couple of yogurts package ogre packet kind bar you can pack a fruit so I really love fruit I have cantaloupe and watermelon these are pretty small again like I haven't been buying melons and cutting them up and like storing them and all my bins because I don't have stuff here with me this summer so I'm buying smaller quantities more often and I'm trying bunch of different things so like when this runs out I'll be doing it different fruit I'm not gonna just keep buying cantaloupe type of thing so yeah fruits yogurts granola bars kind bars gesichert I even just have granola this is a really great thing to keep you munching and to curb any temptations to like eat a bunch of cookies or having two lunches or have lunch before you want it to so again I'm not saying go buy these snacks these are snacks you should eat you need to find what snacks that you like what fruits you like what veggies you like maybe your love celery impact celery and ranch and pretzels there's no wrong or right answer it really comes down to the amount you're taking and and if it's making you feel good if you're eating six cheeseburgers today yeah I might be the same amount of calories that I'm eating but like I know when I'm eating like that I feel like  so you got to fuel yourself with me what with what makes your body you feel good when it comes to serving size like again a lot of these things are prepackaged so I don't really get to pick I will eat my whole bar I'm not getting half the bar maybe I'll eat half an hour half an an hour eating slow is huge slow the down we all are in a rush to scarf all of our food down just slow down if you're alone do something to help yourself slow down if you're with people be with your company I'm always apologizing because I eat so slow and everyone is so like is done in five minutes and I'd like just started but it's fine like force people to slow down let your belly let your stomach digest and listen to your body cues and stop eating when you're full take it home box it up whatever fruits I probably have like a handful literally like a handful fruits and then yogurt I mean it is what it is you eat the yogurt I don't think I ever mmm like don't finish it okay oh yeah I've another four cups so yeah find your fruits find your veggie is fine like pretzel sticks granola granola bars some form of like snack that's not a bag of cookies a bag of Oreos even goldfish can be fine but you should watch how much salt you're taking in and just take a minute to read the ingredients see if that's okay with you if something in a package if something in this time bar shouts to you like I don't want that in my body then don't eat it and we want to find something else I'm not telling you what they need to eat time bars or any sort of bar but you should snack between meals especially if you're like me and you've really barely had a breakfast you have smoothies and you've had coffee but you're really depending on lunch and dinner for the bulk of your calories snack until lunch so yeah we're gonna move into lunchtime cool it's lunchtime I had my fruits for breakfast I have my kind bar to go and now I'm going to make my sandwich so normally I'd probably put like cheese turkey like meats toppings but really just not in the mood for lunch I would consider a sandwich again think about like planning ahead there's really what it comes down to when you're trying to consistently eat the right thing so if you plan ahead and say I'm having fruits for breakfast I'm getting greens at dinner and proteins and carbs or whatever at dinner and pasta and veggies then you're gonna want to get proteins and at lunch so you would think about your favorite meat your favorite cheese is that you like to put on your sandwich I'm doing literally PB&J today cuz that's what I'm feeling right now and it's super quick but this really isn't about me and what I like to eat at lunch it's really about what you like to eat at lunch so I'm gonna make a side salad as well so a salads great putting a bunch of if you put like cheeses and meats in us all in a salad maybe with like a side of toast it's pretty much the same thing just in a different form so literally just fine what works for you maybe find a couple different ways and then switch them up so you don't get bored but when I'm at home home in Philly I really like to go to salad works for lunch and I get that's what I do I got my some pasta chicken carrots onions just like veggies fruits cucumbers with a side of bread and that's like my big lunch and it just like makes a lot easier when you combine things into one meal so breaking out my salad figure out your favorite dressing like these are the little things that you don't have to take out of your life that make you miserable like still my favorite dressing is a Thousand Island like does not really any like that's not the best dressing for you but that's what makes me excited to eat salad and eat my greens each day so you have to find a balance you have to compromise I literally don't track my calories that I eat I track my calories that I burn and if I find that I'm gaining weight with what I'm doing which I normally don't want I'm being mindful then you adjust so it's a lot easier to just get to know yourself and to listen to your hunger cues because no matter what you should eat when you're hungry and you should stop eating when you're full unless you are an athlete and you're trying to do a cut I'm really not about that I'm just trying to develop a healthy relationship with food and a healthy lifestyle so yeah I have my PB&J my greens my dressing I'm gonna have more fruit and that's gonna be my lunch it's quick it's simple it's easy since I'm working from 3 to 9 I'm gonna have some help with dinner and I'm still gonna make a video later explaining it all I'm probably just not gonna have a video actively cooking it so don't hate me you're still gonna get all the details or something out see what I'm putting in but um I'm also I always bring a snack to work in case I get hungry like I just worked out this should be enough but if I get hungry and I don't have food I don't have dinner in front of me I went to a snack so I'm probably gonna grab another kind bar and take that on the road with me other things I have are like like I said before granola fruits like celery sticks sometimes I have Twizzlers cuz they do have a sweet tooth but I'm trying to learn how to curb and it's a process so I don't completely strip myself candies and sweets so if I want to bring a couple Twizzlers I'm gonna do that as well but we're gonna talk about desserts later on in the video after we talk about dinner so yep this is my lunch I gotta get moving because I work in 45 minutes so yeah takeaways listen to your body be mindful you know for me two sandwiches would be a lot but for you maybe it's not I don't know where you're at your journey but um eat slowly that way you know when you're full and you're not stuffing yourself drink lots of water I'm almost done my first my half gallon because I'd say I'd say it's pretty good because I got up late today I started late so I'm gonna finish this up with my lunch and then fill it back up and finish it during work which gives me plenty of hours to drink a bunch of water so yeah we're drinking water we're eating our greens we're eating our fruits we have protein we have carbs so look for the balance and everything look for the nutrient-rich foods like the extra step would be I have fruits like are they organic like XY and z but it's really about your priorities if you're trying to eat a lot put on weight so you can build muscle then maybe two sandwiches is your go-to but that's not really what I'm trying to do I'm trying to maintain trying to live a balanced sustainable lifestyle so really really take a moment to reflect upon what your goals are when it comes to your meals meal prepping you don't even have to prep the meal but prepping by writing down what you plan on eating motivates you if motivates us when we have it written down it's not it's not just a thought in our head anymore it is written it is written by you so when you see that you say I told myself that I'm gonna do this it gives you that drives to stick with it that's what I've found anyway when I'm struggling to eat a balanced diet I start writing down like what I want to eat I don't track calories again I think that's only necessary if you're an athlete and if you're trying to really compete with yourself I don't know I don't really do it so if that's your thing good for you do it but if you're watching this video then it probably I do anyway so yeah let's go alright hey everyone we're back for dinner I think I said I was working during dinner so I had dinner brought to me but it was still dinner from my friends in the freezer so the plate is not going to be made but I'm just gonna pull everything now show you what I usually for dinner so let's get started okay so I've gone through my breakfast my lunch I've been snacking on my good snacks all day I have gotten some fruits and some veggies some protein whatever so for a dinner I always try to cook chicken I don't super eat red meat so chickens my go-to so I generally buy chicken then sliced trimmed and ready but yeah it's just boneless skinless chicken breast i defrost them and Italian dressing so and sometimes I switch it up sometimes to get light Italian whatever but um I let them sit while they defrost and they marinate in Italian dressing then I grilled them seven minutes or so on each side so I have my chicken with that I usually pick a carb last night it was pasta so this was the pasta I used last night for bed I was eating gluten-free because I thought that was messing with my stomach I don't really have that issue anymore unless I'm eating like bread and carbs like really late at night well not and I'm eating them for really how and when I should be I'm good to go so I cooked my pasta I cooked my chicken and then I want to add some veggies so sometimes I'll make a side salad like you saw during lunch the same thing like - I love broccoli so I have broccoli cuts I actually don't prefer the cuts I like when they have the I guess the head I don't know what it's called but I always cook broccoli corn sometimes carrots but again it's not about me and what I like it's about you and what you like so sometimes instead of pasta rice sometimes I have mashed potatoes sometimes I perogies those are the way you can you can mix things up but again I'm not gonna sit here and tell you what to eat because you are not me and what you eat be on your terms so I usually just do about a handful of each veggie and then I cook those on my stovetop and I really just cook them with water and oil I try not to like butter them or they put put anything bad on them I'll put pepper on it to add flavor and I do add Parmesan cheese to my pasta sometimes I'll add a meat sauce that yeah that's pretty much it and when it comes to serving size for the pasta it's like the same thing again like a handful like I take a handful of everything one piece of chicken and buy one piece it's pretty heavy ok pull one out I'm probably being creepy but one piece right I'm really hungry I also like toast garlic bread to eat as a side but yeah it doesn't really vary too much from day to day like I said sometimes I'll switch up the type of carb maybe the baked potato maybe pasta maybe rice who knows but um I try and be light with the toppings I put on so like not an excessive amount of cheese but um and then if hungry for dessert and it's not too late at night my stomach's feeling good I'll have ice cream I love little of ice cream I don't recommend taking away things that you love like if you really love cookies but find yourself eating a whole sleeve of cookies you know maybe we're like three cookies instead of like 20 cookies so it's really about finding your balance being mindful still letting yourself eat like they say that 80/20 so 20% processed foods sweets candies whatever makes your heart happy 80% nutrient nutritious foods nutrient-dense foods so yeah so that's what I get in a day it's pretty simple pretty basic I'm not doing anything crazy and nor do you just find what makes sense for you what's convenient start pre-planning what you want to eat write it down don't just let it be a thought write it down make it known right now my my wallpaper on my home screen is always my goals and I look at them every single day and I manifest them so I guess again takeaways are figure out how many mails you want to eat in the day some people like to eat five I like to eat three meals with small snacks in between each sometimes after dinner if I want dessert if you're like if you love seafood then dinner could be seafood for you like it's really not about I really don't want to send out the message that you should start eating what I'm eating to have my body or to look a certain way because it's not about me it's about you and I really hope that you hear that me out when I say like you have to listen to your body and you have to listen to your hunger cues if you're hungry you should eat and you should eat slowly and then you should stop eating when you feel full it sounds so simple I know it's not I know it's really really hard I still work on it every single day but it helps to write it down it helps to tell people that you're eating with sometimes I feel like a bummer because I want to get a salad at a burger shop like voice that to your friends like hey eat as many burgers as you want right now I'm trying to eat salad for lunch so like it is what it is set your boundaries set your goals and stick to them let yourself still have sweets and treats just be mindful if you wake up the next day and you feel guilty about what you ate the day before because it goes these you know you're not sticking with your goals and you know that's okay sometimes I go full day of just eating like burgers and Burger King and ice cream and I wake up the next day and I'm like that that wasn't when I had planned that was my goal and I move on and I try better the next day I'm not encouraging you to feel guilty like I ate a burger and I didn't run it off right after consuming all consuming guilt it's different and the way to avoid stuff like that is letting yourself have a balance it is not restricting yourself to the point where you binge because you've been craving something you absolutely love so when you finally get it you want as much as you can get that's gonna mess up your stomach even more so just take it day by day if one day you feel like I ate way more than I wanted to not the end of the world you just do better next day it's fine so long as you're moving each day you're trying your best you're writing your goals down you're trying to achieve them that's really all you can ask of yourself so yeah if you have any questions let me know you can follow me on Instagram subscribe to my youtube channel I'm gonna be coming up with a lot more videos when I have more free time on my hands I'm busy busy bee but I graduate in December and that's when things are spinach starts to get really really awesome on here so if you have any questions again let me know I hope you liked it I hope you got a better sense of what you should start doing to find what works for you I don't take any supplements I literally try to avoid putting anything in my body that's not just like food so I don't need to take supplements you don't need to do anything I crazy literally just eat just let yourself eat take your time stop eating when you're full that's it thanks for listening bye", "687AH93O3YE": "you have to be able to figure out okay I\nhave 20 minutes to make breakfast how could I make breakfast in 20 minutes what's up guys this is IFBB Pro Santi\nAragon and I'm here with muscle and strength and what I'm gonna show you is my\ntypical offseason breakfast you don't have an excuse to not be able to come up\nwith a healthy breakfast that's fast and convenient and that gets your day going\nin the offseason I try to incorporate a lot of things that I don't usually eat\njust not only to get the calories a little bit higher you got to enjoy\nyourself with some of the food that you're gonna be eating so I'm gonna go\nahead and start this off I'm gonna spray this with some Pam also depending on the\nphase of my diet I may not even use Pam I may actually use something like coconut\noil or even olive oil depending on how much fat content my meal actually needs\nso here we go very simply done we're gonna throw this\nis 14 ounces of egg whites in the meantime we're gonna set up our\noats over here so I like to put just a little bit\nI don't measure again this is the offseason I don't really measure too\nmany things this is not one of them I just put a little bit of almond milk I\ndump my 1 cup of berries in there it's gonna be some raspberries blueberries\nand blackberries I just put a little bit in there and I'm gonna pop this in the\nmicrowave for two minutes so pre-contest I will change the almond milk for\nregular water it sounds extremely boring but hey\n30 calories builds up over time so at this point right now I'm just gonna\nagain I'm not gonna measure anything I'm just gonna eyeball a little bit of the\nfat-free cheese in there the mozzarella and the cheddar are my\nfavorite today we're gonna be using some mozzarella I turn off the pan and what\nI'll do is I'll just flip everything just one time just so that the cheese\ncan melt and if you notice I have not yet seasoned any of this I haven't put\nany salt I haven't put any pepper on it when you make eggs you actually don't\nwant to put salt on it too early cuz it'll change not only the texture it'll\ndry out the eggs but it'll make them kind of like a brownish color and I've\nseen this over time you know making eggs so often that you want to season it\nafter it's on your plate and as you can see I do not that I do not go light on\nthe salt I do believe in high salt intake it keeps my muscles nice and full\nall the time so I don't have this like flat look you see a lot a lot of\ntrainers they preach about sodium and it's completely true so when you're on a\nlow carbohydrate diet you want to keep your salt intake as high as possible and\nyour fluid intake and what that'll do is that'll at least help you keep your\nmuscles as plump as possible when you're supposed to be flat all right let's get\nthe oats seems like everything is done so I'll put in a little bit of Smuckers\nin there just to keep it uh keep it a little bit more moisten than it was so\nif this is too sweet for you another secret that I do is I bring out more\nsalt and I actually salt my oats and this in my opinion enhances the flavor a\nlot especially if it's overly sweet you could tone down the sweetness with a\nlittle bit of salt I work a lot alright and you have to make sure that not only\nare you getting a breakfast that has everything that you need I got my fruits\nfor antioxidants I got my oats for for my carbohydrates I got my eggs for\nprotein I got my little bit of cheese just so that I can feel like a normal\nhuman and I got my coffee and we probably knock this breakfast out and I\nwould say eight minutes so there everybody has eight minutes in their\nlives there you don't have an excuse to not be able to come up with a healthy\nbreakfast that's fast and convenient and that gets your day going", "CpDqOH3uyAI": "hey guys I have some very special guests here with me today you guys know Avery and this is Draper who owned both of these girls love sleepovers and what are their favorite things to do with their friends is experiment in the kitchen as a mom as much as I like to taste what you guys make it is hard for me because I can't always be in the kitchen just supervise you so today we're making three easy sleepover snacks that don't require your mom to watch you [Music] all right so we got rid of my mom and the first thing we're gonna be making is drumroll please an Ice Cream Sandwich cake thank you so first we're going to make some homemade whipped cream I'm going to pour my heavy whipping cream into the mixer next we're going to put our vanilla extract in and I'm just gonna eyeball it there's probably good okay now I'm going to turn it on being careful not to splash smells so good we want to make it a little sweeter so we're going to add our powdered sugar so now I'm going to turn it on low and then move it to hot 2 3 4 I whipped cream is done so now it's time for the fun part decorating we're gonna start by taking one ice cream sandwich these look really good don't want one yeah me too firstly I think we're using our entire stalk okay so then we're gonna lay them out they have to be touching we're gonna do three layers of four sandwiches now we're gonna put the whipped cream on top it's a lot of it you kind of want it to show the ice-cream sandwiches to show because then it looks really cool I think this is the best part by far we are going to put our decorations on top so I'm gonna let drape Bert sprinkle on some M&Ms I love in the nose you sound like me I love chocolate now I think we're gonna put some fudge and you want to work really quickly so your sandwiches don't know that'd be a disaster this is getting really stable it's like a house yeah you stealing a minute maybe I deserve one okay okay last layer spreadable tragedy I think we over made some whipped cream you sure I think I could add some more Oh Oh No if you just got a little bite of this your mouth will be full with only that part let's put a few on the front okay now we're gonna put it in the freezer for after dinner this looks amazing it looks really good and everyone's gonna want to have a sleepover now next up we're making semi-homemade cannolis and we're gonna make it a little easier by using a hack with using sugar cones instead of a dip so first up we're gonna whisk little cotta this makes softer Jaber you add the powdered sugar like smelt yeah let's have the cinnamon and next okay wanna turn sure I like your whisking technique thank you should we add the whipped cream in that's yes I'm going to get a little bit just to make it fluffy you can fold it it and usually bad at folding but I guess this is just easier looks a lot better than I would do do you make a lot yes I love baking so I have a gun bag and we're just gonna scoop it in there that's a really big piping tip that were using that'll make it easier to fill our cones I'll hold it and you can pipe it okay means a swirling tip that kinda looks like an ice cream cone I'll just sprinkle a few on top course more chopped that's better should we make one for my mom sure thank you girl yeah we're mostly doing this so we can have your leftovers the cone is nice and crispy that's beautiful you could even mix up the toppings last but not least we're gonna make some frozen raspberry with a little healthier but still totally delicious first we've got our Greek yogurt and we're gonna add a little bit of honey to that it doesn't matter how much but yogurt it's still unsweetened now we're gonna mix that that looks really good okay so then we're gonna add some lime I love this one so much I ate my mom's entire taste testing one all right can't dump the frozen raspberries in here okay I think that's good and you want to really chop them up because it's good time to chunks in and then like to juice inside it just like Cisco and it looks red oh we're already getting some of that what's really pretty I'm just gonna help myself to something you're not gonna have any room to try any of these whatever all right Jennifer what does this mean chocolate chips obviously not a dessert without chocolate yeah now we're gonna put this into the freezer for 30 minutes after 30 minutes you're gonna want to stir it and then put it back in the freezer for another 15 minutes this mousse has such a fluffy texture this looks so good I'm so proud of myself oh my gosh you guys have been so busy this looks amazing yeah we even cleaned up they look so delicious I can't wait to dig in which one are you guys gonna try first cake oh that looks super cool that's a really big laughing and tastes super good so mm-hmm I think me outdid ourselves I went to sleepaway camp we did not have food like this alright thank you guys for watching thank you to Avery and Draper for showing us how it's done we will see you next time bye guys bye quiet on set Sound speed camera rolling action last but not least we're gonna make some frozen berry frozen raspberry we're gonna make some froze bit we're making a chocolate factory okay thank you wait deserve a break", "0N-uCeYsdj8": "let's make some ice cream cake right I mean that's a combination right there ice cream and K exactly and less mess so everything's all in one so to start off with the cake you've got butter and sugar in here and that's creamed already it's done right went on no we're not right so to that I'm gonna add eggs and this is a really basic kind of all but in Madeira so really buttery like they're yummy and Roy's one egg in that time get that in and then they'll whisk that up get those eggs in and then as soon as that stop ii open and then i'm going to add my flour yeah so 250 grams of self-raising flour in there and then a teaspoon of baking powder and this is such a basic cake and that is it is that it literally if you wanted to you didn't you don't even have to do it in stages you could just walk it all in and then leave it all up yeah be fine so work well well well well well there are using it from the other direction right so with that really but nothing like it son yeah come together music make butter so we're doing the kitchen it's weird to do it this way around so and then I've got a do you want to oh yeah do you want to do it I will come on do it so I've got my butter and then I will just scrape up and then these are so heavy goodness me go and do it do it do it it's this the best this is why I'm so at home here because it's like having kids no just like this job having the kids rather so get all that in there and then it's just one sponge you're only making one half you don't thinking like too hard oh I'm bit so just flatten that out yeah and then get that straight in the other 15 minutes 160 5505 0 so it's a long slow bake ok get that in there we've got one already over there and the other the last this is the fun bit right so so we'll use this as a template and you can do this bit for me but enrich we're going to just kind of cut around you going all the way to the boss No so I'm gonna just go just enough so I've got about that much so just kind of feel for it because what you don't want is for it to defrost and anything to fall out pop that off okay I'm just gonna just make it easier for you I kind of said Oh pressure not to completely miss you want your daughter I've got one backup in case uh okay Kurtz that makes me mother what you will I'm just scooping it out goop out the inside Oh actually that's not right what's going on yeah you need to know you can eat that just in case we've got one here and then oh this is like the easy ice cream bit this is the best bit so you don't have to you don't need a churn you don't need to churn it you don't need to do anything to it got some double cream whipped up so making your own ice cream is kind of its kind of ice cream but kind of not but it can it can it can pass this ice cream right so I've got some whipped up double cream and then some golden syrup and this is like this is a bit of a trick trick if you want to make ice cream really quickly add golden syrup because what it does it stops those crystals forming so you get a lovely smooth ice cream all right that's very clever just cloned and syrup and then I'm gonna add some icing sugar and that will just sweeten it yeah and then I'm gonna just whip out that out and then although you don't want Chuck any of that away oh you want to check any where you keep it blitz it up and then add it to your ice cream oh wow and then just gonna mix that up good job she had asbestos I think she's just eaten that bit when I've got ice cream and then freeze dried raspberries yeah while using fresh you want to use the freeze dried straw because once that moisture hits the freeze dried raspberries it kind of bleeds a little bit so you don't even this lovely pink is really flavorsome you can get them from the supermarket like in little tubes like this yeah any normal super possible no no no it's not can't see everyone does it now it's good isn't it in turn house yeah yeah great on your porridge really good on porridge yeah and no sugar in that he said because it's just no it's just freeze Brian let's have a bit of residual sugar in there do you think there's a notion that all the sugar in it nothing else that's it it's great isn't it nice so you just mix that up so I essentially that's it you've got your easy ice cream yeah fine you're enjoying yourself Carrie all right and then you fill it up right this and then this this is so good but if you're having a barbecue say you've got friends coming over yeah and you kind of want to when having a barbecue you want ice cream you want a better cake you want something sweet but this is perfect because you kind of have everything you want plate all in one go those scoops no messing around it's all kind of sliced you've got it all in one flatten it out fill up you know like get into those corners fill it up feeling excited yeah yeah good you can't wait to eat it good right and then fresh raspberries all on top all on top just what a loaded them on top now you thought you were about to put them all in a very neat row then and then oh just get a pilot out highly up because I love soft fruit like this frozen straight out of the freezer it's delicious because when I don't want I kids to being lots of ice cream you're gonna freeze all this this is all even with the raspbian you think with the raspberries I was wondering I was thinking when it's you're gonna stick that in the freezer now you like pretend two hours later frozen did a little italy a

y'all later all right who's it who's it who's going to be with me 100 to experience a whole bunch of joy let's go guys i'm in all right i am definitely in rob says good good good good that's what i want to see y'all ready to get started now we can get started all right we're going to start with the sweet potato fries now john had asked me to talk a little bit about cycling and fueling our ride for cycling many people think that they need to eat a lot of carbohydrates the next the night before i'm not against carbohydrates like i said i'm a cyclist i like carbohydrates right lj we like carbohydrates but we need clean harbor carbohydrates and what i mean by clean the less processed that foods are the better they are for us so much better and what is this is the way mother nature created a potato other than the fact that lj sliced a couple pieces off the side now that we don't want those anyway but the closer that you eat your food to the way that mother nature prepared it for us the better off you are so what's better for you a sweet potato or instant mashed potatoes in a box type in the chat what's better for you i already gave you the answer but let me see it in the chat what's better for you the sweet potato or instant potatoes in the box what's better for you come on let me see this is how i get the energy because i can't see everybody right normally i'm in front of our real audience uh a live audience but i can't see you so in the chat this is where i'm gonna get that feedback and i know that you are with me and you're alive and yes it's the sweet potato so i really appreciate the chatting thank you um okay so what we're going to do is we're going to take my brand new pampered chef pan because we had a lot of things to do today and i'm going to put it on top of my tail for now and normally this looks a little more brownish but that's okay that's okay because it's brand brand spanking new and we're going to take our sweet potato and look guys you can bake this sweet potato if you're going to bake it i want you to take your knife and pierce it a couple of times and throw it in the oven and bake it you can even throw it in a toaster oven do not put it in your microwave why not the microwave does anybody want to know why you do not want to put this on the microwave why does anybody want to know yes or no yes or no yes or no put in the chat come on let me see let me see why don't we want to put this in the microwave because the microwave depletes the at the enzymes and the vitamins in your food okay put it in the oven save your life put it in the oven okay now let's chop a sweet potato into some fries super simple guys keep the skin on lots of vitamins lots of nutrients in that skin so keep it on scrub it lj did that for me today thank you you're welcome all right so now when you're going to cut it you're going to make round things flat so that you don't chop your little pur pretty little fingers okay before i even make my round thing flat i want to show you how to hold a knife most people hold the knife over here but you see how that can slip out of your hand i want you to hold the knife middle finger backed up against the blade index finger on one side thumb on the other you see how it's not going to slip out any longer now round things we're going to make flat i'm going to make a grip with my fingers so that i don't chop my little pretty little fingers off and then i'm going to use my entire knife and make my round thing flat see now it does not roll around any longer okay and from there now remember i call myself a lazy inspirational chef so i'm going to take shortcuts here and i'll show you some of my shortcuts in a minute a lot of times people will say oh then you put them in a big bowl and then you cover them up with olive oil and salt and pepper and then from the bowl you put them into the tray and i go oh my gosh why do you want to wash one more bowl heck no i'm gonna put all that olive oil and salt and pepper right in the pan right in the pan and i'll show you that you see how easy that is i love fries who loves fries but fries in the chat if you love fries you love fries put fries in the chat let me see it nobody likes fries i'm not going to make these these are not going in the oven if anybody if nobody likes fries i love them yeah lj is she lj's in she likes fries so we're going to have to do this in a couple of batches because lj cut up a whole bunch because we're hungry only that another time okay so you don't want to do two layers in one pan and because we're cooking so many things we're only going to do one pan at a time today okay if i was just doing sweet potatoes i'd have all my pans out okay so yup yeah fries i only have four people who like fries the rest of you are already drowning me out so here we go now i gotta put some salt and pepper on here here is i use sea salt does anybody here use sea salt anybody here use sea salt get the salt between your fingers and run it through okay a little bit all over okay why sea salt sea salt is full of minerals 78 plus minerals that your body needs that is devoid in that sodium chloride that is highly processed causes a lot of high blood pressure we don't want high blood pressure because we want to ride our bikes and exercise and be and stay healthy nothing in the world better than fresh cracked pepper so much better than the powdered stuff get yourself some fresh black pepper and a nice pepper grinder worth it worth it okay you can take the close-up off okay so you got that now remember something salt it enhances flavor where pepper changes flavor okay salt enhances flavor pepper changes flavor so remember that remember i said i'm going to do it right in the pan i have a very loose hand when it comes to olive oil pour it on lj you ready oven's at 400 degrees that's fine i put it in anyway put it in anyway as soon as it beeps then we can actually time it so tuck shelf is fine and we're going to time that for about 15 minutes and we're going to check them out in about 15 minutes okay so can you do a timer up there um up here right there and then just a 15 0-0 and then timer all right next we are going to get the salmon and the sauteed greens started okay who here loves salmon put salmon in the chat if you love salmon put sam oh eldie's got her hand up she's over there though all right so let's take that spotlight off the sec the close-up one um john if you can take that out do you want them both up no no we want that off okay technical difficulties but we'll get there we'll get there you don't want to turn the camera off you don't want the camera off oops sorry you have to turn it back on that's okay i got it i'm gonna have martial do this she's used to doing this with me but that's okay she was sleeping tonight okay so we're going to do all right john let me see if i can help you out here there we go all right so next we're going to make the sauteed greens and i love to use onions who here loves onions i love onions now here's the real question here's the real question who here cries when they chop an onion who here cries when they chop an onion if you cry somebody's not on you please go ahead and mute yourself if you cry when you chop an onion put cry in the chat put cry in the chat if you cry but cry in the chat now as i'm chopping my onion i turned my pan on so i'm going to teach you something now i'm not going to promise you it's not going to make you cry but i'm going to teach it to you anyway you see this is the part that goes into the ground the hair the hair part you think it's kind of hair hair up that's the piece that we want to cut out and so they say it'll prevent the crying it's actually the root okay so what you're going to do is you're going to take your knife and you're going to insert it diagonally and go around and pull that piece out okay they say that this is what makes you cry i'm not gonna promise you i'm not gonna promise you okay so then you're going to take the outer layers off and i'll warn you i'll warn you on this one is that if there's mold make sure you get all the mold off every once in a while you get an onion that's got a little mold maybe it's satin and the cover too long maybe you bought it that way you never know propensity of getting mold so you've got to be careful by the way a dull knife is a dangerous knife a dull knife is a dangerous knife never ever scrape your blade against the cutting board i was so proud of lj she got the back of the cutting board to scrape things off never use your blade to scrape okay never point your blade at other people either like i just did oops okay so now i'm going to cut my round thing flat and i'm going to grip my fingers and i'm going to do my slices here we go grip your fingers and here's your slices and then i'm going to do a crossways and if the piece gets slippery move the other fingers out of the way because i don't know about you but i love my fingers who loves their fingers put fingers in the chat tell them you have fingers in the chat if you love your fingers and you don't want to chop them off my husband knows when i've hurt myself because there's a certain tone in my voice and yeah i'm not doing that again i have learned how to hold the knife properly and you see also how i'm cutting with the entire knife the blade all the way through and use the entire knife and use the back of the knife to pick it up okay so it's going to take a little bit for my cast iron skillet to get hot so i'm waiting on that and i already had oil in the pan so i'm going to put a little because i seasoned it earlier so i'm just going to put a little bit more olive oil extra virgin olive oil do not buy light olive oil because that means lightened flavor not necessarily in calories don't worry about calories for cyclists guys use the olive oil good fat it's very good for your heart okay very very good for your heart so use that fat now in the oil is where i'm going to put some red pepper why because i like red pepper it pops the flavor it literally pops the flavor now if you don't like to get the little red pepper flakes in your teeth you can put it in a coffee grinder and grind it all up and then have powder my dad does that for me every single year he grows the hot peppers dries them and then just make sure that that's on and then put some in a special special coffee grinder for me and makes it a powder i'm not going to put these in my pan because they make me cough when i'm talking on camera so here i'm also going to put a little bit of salt okay so feel the salt with your fingers get used to that i've been uh going through a master class with tom keller he's a french trained chef has many restaurants out in california and and and he talks about the salt like i just did and i'm like oh my gosh i've been touching feeling salt doing with my fingers my entire life so must be a european thing because i'm italian as john found out today very very italian even though i'm a mcdermott but whatever so we're going to wait for those green those onions to saute a little bit we want to get them translucent and while that's happening i want to talk a little bit about who knows what this is somebody put in the chat what is this who knows what this is put in the chat who knows what this is yeah somebody knows what it is good this is fresh beautiful lovely gorgeous kale powerhouse of nutrition you want to go faster on your bike just 15 minutes from here so it says eight nil you want to go faster on your bike you want new high density nutrition and you're going to get that from kale much more than you're going to get it from spinach now you can buy the adult kale like i am here like i did here and what i do is i strip these stems some people throw the stems away some people throw the stems away don't throw the stems away they are actually sweet believe it or not so you're going to strip the stems you see how i'm just stripping the leaves right off the stems just take your take it there you go and run it through and i'm making the leaves flat because there's a reason for that there's a reason for that i think i'm just going to cook up the kale it's a big kale today and i use these for my smoothies because again it's a powerhouse of nutrition do not throw those away i would actually just munch on them like celery sometimes i munch on them as i'm cooking but i'm not going to do that because i'm busy talking oh look at that we've got a bunny over here lj she wants a stem because she you know the value of them they're wonderful i i you that she loves her greens and that is nutrition and this is nutrition at its best kale now if you do if you're new to kale if you're new to kale what i want you to do is i want you to try the baby kale or the baby mixed greens okay because all of the nutrition that's in this huge big kale leaf is the same nutrition in that baby leaf okay it's a little more tender it's a little more it's milder it's wonderful so try that okay now the stems since i already have greens for my smoothie i'm going to chop those up and i'm going to put them in with my onions because they're a little harder you want them to get chopped up before you put the leaves in okay so i'm putting those stems right in with my onions throwing them right in with my onions and i'm gonna put the green tops in there in a little bit but not just yet not just yet i decided that i wanted some garlic in my greens okay i like garlic i love garlic actually who uses garlic in the jar who here uses don't be embarrassed it's okay who uses powdered garlic or garlic in the jar put it in the chat powder or jar or fresh powder jar jar or fresh put it in the chat put in the chat let me see you what are you guilty of rob are you guilty of powdered or in the jar jar and fresh okay you'll take it anyway all right we want to boost our immune system right we want a very strong immune system garlic is one of those wonderful powerhouses from mother nature that is going to boost your nutrition and you want it raw you want to buy it raw and you want to cook it you can cook it you can eat it right i don't eat it wrong um i just cook it up chop it and cook it up but i always buy it fresh we've been trying that for me every once in a while thank you um so now i love having a sous chef i'm so happy um we've been using garlic raw garlic since we were kids and you never want to go by the kitchen while mom is cooking because then she'll make you do the work of cutting up the garlic so now i don't mind i cut up garlic all day long i love garlic so this is how you the garlic in the jar has been pasteurized that means very very high heat the enzymes have been cooked out the immune boosting properties have been cooked out use the jarred garlic but also you if you want if you have to but go to fresh it's cheap and it is a powerhouse of immune boosting properties right lj absolutely anything else you want to say about garlic my dear um yeah so i probably put about three cloves of garlic put as many as you want in there put as many as you want my onions are starting to turn translucent and that means that it's time to put the kale in it's time to put the kale in so what are we going to do with this mess how are we going to chop this this is a mess right so watch you see how i put one leaf on top of the other i'm going to roll that big pile i'm going to make a big roll with all my kale leaves looks a bit of a mess but don't worry we're gonna get there okay so i'm gonna get my properly held knife properly held knife and i'm going to cut slivers okay [Music] okay get your fingers out of the way so i'm going to cut it lengthwise too just a little bit more all right that bad boy got away from me so here we go we're going to put this right in the pan if you want to do a close-up john of the translucent onions and kale stems you can see how they're translucent now and i'm just going to grab a hold of all of my kale put it right in where is that lid i know that lid is somewhere oh there it is it's behind you on the basket and you are going to mix it in yeah you don't even have to mix it in but i'm going to put some water in there i'm going to put some water in there and i didn't get water so let me get water real quick probably just like a quarter cup of water not even put the lid on and let it cook the primer is on right now for nine minutes we'll check it in about nine minutes typically is about 10 minutes if i was doing the baby greens three minutes if you were doing just spinach one minute all it needs it wilts really quick so we're just going to let that sit and while that is sitting let's talk just a smidgen about salmon but not yet always take your fish or meat out of the refrigerator at least 30 minutes prior to cooking it will cook better because otherwise it's too cold and the the muscle seizes okay so you always want it to sit out so this has been sitting out for maybe 20 minutes now i put some salt and pepper and i just set it in a dish and sitting sit i'm setting that aside now while we're because we're going to cook it in the same pan that we cook the greens in now while that is cooking another escaped piece of kale we're going to talk about some broccoli waffles who loves broccoli i love broccoli we eat broccoli probably two times a week if not three times a week love broccoli put broccoli in the chat if you love broccoli put broccoli in the chat if you love broccoli i like sprinkled powder on steak on the grill what's sprinkled powder garlic powder is that where you are you know there's nothing wrong with using garlic powder just know that you're not going to get the immune boosting properties from it so try the garlic powder and some real garlic too okay not as much as brussels sprouts i love brussels sprouts brussels sprouts and bacon need to like marry each other and i think that lj would disagree but uh all right so broccoli super easy you can already buy it cut up i kind of don't recommend that but because the more that it's been processed the more the enzymes are going to be depleted from your foods so i always buy them in heads like so and then just cut it up really quick i just pull the those stems out like so super easy guys gets get yourself some broccoli and eat your broccoli this is where you're going to get what vitamins are in broccoli do you know vitamin c i know vitamin c is in here there's tons of vitamins though tons i just who oh duck doc you would know right what vitamins are in broccoli i just can't name them right now eat the stems some people just eat the little florets do you know that the stem of broccoli is super sweet it's super sweet and you think i'm crazy because i think broccoli is sweet i'm not crazy i promise you broccoli has some sweetness to it the stems are sweet i taught my dad that and now he when i'm making broccoli around him he comes by and steals the stems from me because he understands now that broccoli steps are wonderful okay oh i'm so sorry here my dear thank you my little rabbit over here needs a broccoli stem to be eating you want another one before i put olive oil's hot pepper all over it all right now my husband literally loves them steamed we just get a double steam pot steam it from cold water to boiling to steamed 10 minutes put it on cold in 10 minutes it's done it's steamed and i put olive oil salt and pepper on it um i love it roast it who loves it steamed versus roasted put it in the chat steamed versus roasted who loves steamed versus roasted i got roasted over here from lj yep when it comes out i'm going to put some lemon juice on it for sure i'm going to put some lemon juice on it for sure steamed trunk yeah um so yeah eat it roasted but much prefers these steamed i don't know why maybe he just doesn't like to use his teeth i like to use my teeth and chew i'm just making that up look how easy guys salt pepper just um no no no no no yeah you don't even need to stir the the kale just let it sit it's fine um if anything turn the heat down just a little bit so once again guys here it is just pour the olive oil on it make little like triangles circles whatever you need to do get some olive oil on there i don't even mix it put it right in the oven just like this lj you ready put that right in the oven bottom shelf and we'll have to switch it later because we've got more things in the oven the more things you have in the oven the longer they take to cook most many people know that but not everybody and so and that's okay we're gonna have lots of food okay now let's see what is next what is next you guys having fun put fun in the chat if you guys are having a good time you guys have a good time put fun in the chat yes i go through a lot of olive oil i just opened up a huge tin and decanted it today my mom supplies me with it believe it or not all right you guys are having fun a blast all right rob are you being sarcastic here all right so our kale is almost done almost done it's starting to get a little on the wilty side and because it's an older um it's not the baby kale it's a bigger leaf it's a little harder it takes just a few more minutes takes a few more minutes okay so we're going to let that cook for about three more minutes and then we're going to cook our salmon and lj and i are going to have a really nice dinner tonight yes we are and okay so any questions so far about what we've cooked what we've got the potato sweet potato fries in the oven we've got the kale that's cooking we have the broccoli that's in the oven that i'm gonna serve with pepitas toasted pepitas uh because pitas are really good for uh brain health by the way the pitas who knows what pupitos are who knows what pepito how long to bake the fries about 15 20 minutes we're gonna check them in 15 minutes and then probably put them in a little bit longer my ovens have been acting a little funny it's been cracking a lot of jokes recently i don't know why but uh so i don't know so i'm gonna check it in 15 minutes and maybe up to 25 so we'll see depends on how big or how small you cut your potatoes and lj cut them really nice for us tonight so she cut them in real fry size small size so they'll probably cook in about 20. who knows we'll see it depends on how funny my oven wants to be tonight okay how long to bake the fries sunflower seeds yes pepitas are the sunflower seeds fantastic for your brain did we ever get an answer on the broccoli the vitamins and broccoli i know it's vitamin c but i can't remember the rest of the vitamins all right lj is going to go and google it while we're doing that all right we've got two more things to do three we got the salmon and i also promised to make you some homemade mayonnaise i love mayonnaise i think it is just just love mayonnaise i can eat mayonnaise every single day and i'm the tradition like the french side i like my sweet my french fries with mayonnaise versus the mustard or the ketchups or whatever okay so who here has ever made their own mayonnaise put mayonnaise or mayo in the chat if you have homemade your mayonnaise because we're gonna mix them right here right now has anyone made homemade mayonnaise anybody mayo it was good good all right we got three more minutes here okay okay we're gonna oh we got an answer on broccoli google says calcium iron pistachio and zinc calcium iron potassium and zinc and then the other ones are phosphorus thymine phosphate and niacin niacin riboflavin phosphorus vitamins thiamine and there might be more of it and there might be more i like it i like it a lot it makes me go strong thanks i.t welcome paul garza paul you just got here if you're late it's okay we love you anyway so yes i make my mayonnaise with a raw egg get yourself some organic cage free eggs don't be afraid to spend the extra money don't be afraid because there's my saying happy chickens lay happy eggs so you're going to get a beautiful bright orange yolk when you have an organic egg looks like we got to go and check those potatoes let's go check those potatoes and they are not done yet ten more minutes if you want they're not done yet i like them really crispy so you know ten more minutes we'll see what happens in 10 minutes okay back to the mayo we've got egg the next thing we're gonna put in there is oops i have to wash it because it touched my raw salmon i'll be right back yeah but i did it i i touched the fat i touched it yeah no i don't want any raw salmon in my uh raw egg we're all egg is fine her leg is fine we don't want we're all salmon we rolled into it all right so if you want more juice from a lemon do you know how to get more juice from a lemon how do you get more juice from a lemon sounds like a joke doesn't it roll it on your counter this one was already rolled and i've got this very very very ancient lemon squeezy peasy thing and you can use whatever lemon squeezy peasy thing you want and you can even use your fingers to get the seat so the seeds don't go in there i like my mayonnaise very lemony not everybody does um but i'm just gonna do a half a lemon for today normally i'll do a whole lemon and i don't want to do a whole lemon but i don't want to don't know what lj likes so we're not going to do that i'm going to put about a half a teaspoon not probably a quarter teaspoon of salt i'm going to put some dijon mustard now remember i said i'm a lazy chef i normally don't measure it's about a tablespoon okay squeeze it in it's not going to kill you and we're gonna put some pepper in there okay my mom taught me how to cook from a very very young age she used to go to work and on her way home i was always hungry even as a kid i was skinny as a rail and i just needed to eat all the time so she knew she could rely on me so she'd call me before she left for work and would tell me what to do to get dinner ready and she taught me how to measure by the eye by eye so i continue to hold that tradition to uh measure freaks my sister out freaks her out but that's okay because she's the scientist and everything has to be exact measurements and everything else no time no time this is a vitamix by the way i'm going to use a vitamix over here and so you get your ingredients in your blender i don't care what blender you're using it really doesn't matter okay you can even use an immersion blender but you got to go real slow with an immersion blender and we're going to this is going to take a little bit it's going to take a few minutes don't get bored because did you know the attention span of a human being is only eight seconds and that of a goldfish is nine seconds holy cow but stay with me because i'm gonna turn this on and then i'm gonna drizzle about a cup of olive oil in there you can use avocado oil grapeseed oil i don't touch canola oil or soy oil but the grapeseed oil and the avocado oil are more benign the excuse me the olive oil might give you a little more of a flavor boost so not everybody likes their mayonnaise with olive oil if it's their first time making it i would say grape seed oil or avocado oil okay pardon me i need to clear my throat i think i have pepper in it okay so here we go gonna make a little noise stay with me you guys ready here we go drizzling in really slow what's that tell us why you want it you want your mayonnaise to emulsify and if you don't drizzle it in it won't it must it won't emulsify it that's the they're administered another explanation think come together come together really nicely and i have not separated together does that make sense i hope so does that make sense yes all right what did tina say about nine seconds ago you're funny you're funny who was that who said that i can't even read who said that jake gp why do you put paul now you got to answer this question paul while we're taking our time making mayonnaise over here why are you gp when you're paul garza it's backwards what's up with that seriously i want an answer it sounds like the adults and peanut cartoons i sound like the adults in the peanut country the blender sound [Music] lj does once you once you start your mayonnaise and you can see that it's coming together and it's not separated after about a half a cup remember i don't measure but i also have a cup measure here on my um on my blender and i've done this so many times if this is your first time i would definitely say measure out a cup of olive oil or grapeseed oil uh but if you're me do what you want right but if you're dying do what you want um so you can start pouring in a little faster now if you want this to be garlic flavored by all means throw some garlic in there you can have a garlic mayonnaise if you wanted to be a spicy chipotle mayonnaise throw some chipotle in there chipotle seasoning if you want it to be a spicy mayonnaise throw some chili powder or i wouldn't do the solid flakes i would definitely do a chili powder of sorts and we're almost there we're almost there i'm starting to go faster i'm so excited to sweet potato fries with mayonnaise now there's another way that i make sweet potatoes and i just do salt and cinnamon no olive oil just salt and cinnamon you can do a little bit of olive oil yeah i do do a little olive oil and then cook it like that and it's this sweet treat wonderful absolutely wonderful you're probably like tina she's not even looking anymore yeah i've made i've made mayonnaise so many times now what i like to do to give my mayonnaise extra umph and extra nutrition is i literally put a fresh avocado in my mayonnaise you okay with that can i put a fresh avocado on our mayonnaise yeah so how to peel an avocado i scored it twist it and watch this hopefully this works cross your fingers lj i'm gonna slam the uh seed with my knife and twist it yes it worked look and it pops right out and i'm gonna put that right in my compost pile and give it back to the earth and then i'm going to score my avocado i was actually so excited to find a ripe avocado yesterday no it was this morning actually because they're not always right so i'm going to score my avocado and then i'm going to get a spoon and then take it out there we go there we go and i'm going to put that right in my blender right in the blender and throw the peel right back to the earth there we go my nieces when they know that i'm making coleslaw they know i make it with homemade mayonnaise they will drive however long they need to drive because now they moved and they're a little further for me to come and get my coleslaw with my homemade mayonnaise because they know how amazingly delicious it is okay so i'm gonna turn it up a little i'll be right back okay this is probably done yep just completely watch the handle's hot and plate it put it right on here our kale is done and lj is going to plate it and then we're going to cook our salmon okay i'll be right back [Music] there it is guys there is our mayonnaise nice and thick and creamy and mayonnaisey eat this within five to six days eat this within five or six days and if you want to put more salt in it more pepper in it like i said chipotle hot peppers garlic what do you like in your mayonnaise that's what you're going to use okay let's taste it [Music] i think it needs a little bit more salt you want to taste it yeah okay got my taste there too i like it needs a little more salt you can have salt okay so we're gonna add a little bit more sauce to this a little lemon do you think it needs more lemon we're gonna do a little more lemon in there why because we like it what was that timer for audrey i don't know let's find out nope you're gonna say more five more you want to check the broccoli i see it from here it's not done yet okay [Music] my oven's actually funny it's not hot my oven's playing jokes on me sweet potatoes are gonna need a little bit more time all right what are we doing next i'm gonna put i put more lemon juice and i put a little bit more salt and let's get this running here's a thing guys you can always add more salt but you can't take it away so air on caution when it comes to salt also believe it or not sea salt is less salty than regular salt sea salt is less salty than regular salt i have a lot of demitas spoons in my house that's good perfect i put a quarter teaspoon of salt in there and another half 11. and it's perfect look at that why don't we do this okay why don't you put mayonnaise into containers one for being one for you and okay you ready to cook up some salmon you ready to cook up some salmon who here loves salmon this is my favorite favorite favorite protein lj loves salmon okay summarize again everything in the mail sure egg dijon mustard lemon juice salt pepper olive oil in that order in that order okay so let's see i've got so now i'm going to put the salmon on my by the way i like to use a cast iron skillet if you have a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet the flavor of the food comes out absolutely amazing i love it better than any other pan in the world okay there we go so i want you to notice i put it skin side up first put it skin side up first and i'm going to do that for about four minutes get more in there so skin side up we're going to do four or five let me do five minutes because everybody's acting funny on me today sorry about that okay so salmon it's a cooking doesn't take long so that's typically the last thing that i cook is my salmon get everything else ready oh look she already plated our greens for us how pretty then we're going to put the salmon right on top of that and then squeeze some lemon on top of that i will also if i'm just eating greens the sauteed greens by themselves without any kind of animal protein walnuts i'll get walnuts toasted and i'll crunch them up and eat that with the greens holy cow you get the protein and the fat from the the walnuts and you get all the other vitamins and the minerals and of course the fat from the olive oil from the greens amazing very very good and a complete meal for our vegetarians out there right lj yeah nuts are amazing for you so what do we have next we did our mayonnaise we've got our salmon cooking and we need some dessert who doesn't need dessert who loves dessert oh my gosh i love dessert i have a sweet tooth of course who doesn't have a food too if you're a cyclist you're hungry you are very hungry and you need it no i don't think so i don't think so i love fresh fruit so what i did is i got some oranges and i sliced the oranges using a mandolin do you see a mandolin hanging around anywhere here it is okay thank you good try feet down what's up this is a mandolin a slicer i love my mandolin slicer and i sliced my oranges with a mandolin because you want to get your slices really thin and yes you eat the peel so what i did is i sliced let me show you let me let me slice up an orange for you with the mandolin it's very difficult to get an orange sliced with a knife to a quarter inch i didn't wash this one yet hold on so i love my mandolin and i also love my fingers so what my sister bought me because she knows me well enough she bought me one of these gloves to use with my mandolin and what you do is you just get your orange and you slice it through using the mandolin how much easier is this than if i did it with a knife and look you get these beautiful beautiful orange slices so you'll put them on a piece of parchment paper like i did here [Music] and freeze them now that it's frozen you're going to get chocolate chips now i use lilies chocolate chips they're sweetened with stevia so because i am a little sugar sensitive and i don't want too much sugar but i didn't have a ton of them so i have the other dark chocolate chocolate chips that i melted now for those of us who don't want to melt chocolate chips you don't have them in the house then this is what you do you're going to get coconut oil and you're going to put it in a double boiler like lj has over there at the stove top and you're going to get some cocoa powder like hershey's cocoa powder and this is another cocoa powder that i got at my organic market you're going to put about three tablespoons of coconut oil to three tablespoons of cocoa powder however you like it melts it all together with a pinch of salt and you have your chocolate now you want to up your game on your chocolate actually when from there then you put it in the freezer okay that's a freezer chocolate i put peanut butter in my freezer chocolate so i'll double i'll do the coconut oil cocoa powder salt peanut butter melt it all up pour it on a piece of parchment paper and extra sea salt on the top and then freeze it and i'll always have freezer chocolate okay so now what we did are we done over there we have the um it's melted we're going to have to work quickly lj so bring that top piece over and put it right here on this for me before you do that hold on we have to check the salmon okay hold on i have to check the salmon that's the bell for the salmon beautiful beautiful five more minutes we're gonna do five more minutes on that salmon please thank you and now go ahead and bring gotta multitask when you're cooking but not when you're watching the show okay okay you ready lj we gotta work super fast because we're gonna dip the frozen make sure they're frozen don't do these fresh put it right here and we're going to work really quickly get your add-ons ready i have goji berries i have slivered almonds by the way keep these in the freezer when you're not if you're not going to eat them right away okay and i have sea salt all ready to go so do you want to do the toppings as i did or you want to dip and i'll do the toppings okay so you dip and i did some of them for us already what's that different now yeah let dip and then lay it down and then i'll do the toppings ready you got to do it really quick go ahead keep going i'm going to do a couple of those a couple of gojis and there you go okay you're fine you got to go real quick because remember the orange is frozen and it's going to solidify super fast so you've got to be faster than the chocolate to get those on there not all of them are going to have nuts not all of them are going to have gojis and that's okay goji berries are a phenomenal snack yeah they're very yummy and when they are anything that's red has something in them called pro anthrocyanidines which are very good for your heart they're they're very good for oh that whole whole one get one in there free radical busters basically okay so very good for free radical busting all right also good for there we go so our dark orange slices these are so good because after a meal we want to change our palette and we want to have something sweet why not some fresh fruit dipped in the most luxurious amazing thing on earth and that's chocolate and there we go so we're going to put those right back in the freezer slip those right back in the freezer for now and double boiler you need a double boiler okay so where are we in a scope of life right now okay so salmon we've got two minutes on the salmon we have oh that's what i wanted to talk about who here wants to talk a little bit about snacking while riding the right kind of snacks to eat while riding oh uh-huh pull it out and then i'll give you a place to put it here right on here all right we have an awesome kitchen going on here yay this is fantastic i wanted to talk about snacks while riding okay snacks while riding i have a tray over here for that can you turn the fan on in that room it's just closer to the door okay no it's the full cord yeah got a little smoky in here now i've been riding for longer than 30 years i've been riding something like that and i notice people have a lot of processed foods when they're riding and they're always floored when i pull out of my pocket an apple and some nuts or a banana or something that i've homemade um i've had lyme disease so lyme disease really affected my life and processed foods affect my brain they affect my gut they affect so many different things so i tend to eat the way that mother nature taught us and eat fresh foods and you're going to get so much more nutrition out of eating foods that are fresh such as this is a little this is hold on a second hold just hold the handle nope this needs one more minute i can see it one more minute and then we're done okay just one minute timer we're almost done guys um so this is what i do i'll cut up an apple put it in a baggie with some nuts these are some walnuts that i toasted and i put them in a jar if i'm going to eat them right away they're fine sitting on the counter if i'm not going to eat them right away freeze them you want to freeze your nuts okay this is a jar of some almonds with some dried fruit dry fruit is amazing for you we've got so much sugar that you need while you're riding there's a little baggie from nuts.com of some dried cranberries what about dates i know khalil you probably love dates i love dates and these are some pecans also some coconut chips coconut is so good for you not only does it have really good fat in it for you but it is antiviral antimicrobial anti bacterial okay fantastic eat some coconut chips along with your nuts along with your orange or your your banana or your your apples eat them up they are amazing for you okay so this is what i do i get real food put it in baggies and take it with me to heck with all those processed foods there is an rx bar though i will say that i really like but it only has four ingredients i make the rx bars don't think i love the rx bars yep i spawned up my kitchen i smoked up my kitchen but that's okay it's all for good right lj because we're going to have the yummiest we're going to have yummy yummy yummy salmon so here we go we're going to plate everything for it oh how do you know that the salmon is done how do you know that the salmon is done if you don't want to if you're the kind of person that takes your sound apart to see if it's pink inside don't do that get yourself an instant read thermometer and fish should be done at 145 and my instant re-thermometer is reading 48 and it broke a little bit ago so yeah i'm pretty sure that i need to throw that away now but i can tell that it's done because it's not jiggly and wiggly and i cook salmon so often but if you are unsure then definitely put your scent and get an instant read thermometer so look how beautiful that is guys there we go we have our salmon on our bed of greens before i serve it before we eat it individual my husband doesn't like lemons and i can put lemon on the whole thing but

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "jiEtvOFiuoE": "froot loops were one of my favorite things to eat when i was a kid i thought this was the perfect breakfast and if you asked me back then i'd probably tell you it's also the perfect lunch and dinner i'm pretty sure i'm not alone on that one but guys i have bad news we've all been living a lie not only do all froot loops in the back taste exactly the same yes that's right there is no difference between the colors but here is the kicker if we head over to the official kellogg's website we find fruit loops and then we hit nutrition facts now let's head over to ingredients and we're going to get corn flour sugar flour flour starch oil yeah well guess what fruit loops contain exactly zero percent fruit although to be fair the formula is a bit different over here in europe so if you check out this german box of fruit loops you will find that they do indeed contain trace amounts of fruit extracts mostly for coloring wow kellogg's big deal big deal you know what i find that unacceptable so for this video i asked myself is it possible to use actual fruits to make fruit loops at home and even though the process is everything but easy involving quite a few steps to get close to what we are familiar with in terms of color texture and flavor i managed to come up with these fruit loops that are indeed almost 50 fruit and definitely 100 natural ingredients i'm going to show you exactly how i achieved these but the thing is that yes of course i took a few nibbles here and there while testing and shooting but i have never actually tried this final batch with milk and definitely not side by side with the commercial original version i guess i'm very excited to try those towards the end of the video but first let me ask you one thing how did cereal which is supposed to be this healthy wholesome breakfast turn into this literal wall of sugar you find at your local supermarket and you know the drill guys on this channel you come for the recipe but you stay for the story and this one sex greed deception this one has it all let me explain to understand the history of breakfast cereal and to understand how it became what it is today we need to go back all the way to industrial revolution era usa back then there was one specific social movement that was gaining more traction by the day and it was called the temperance movement its main goal was clear and simple to oppose the consumption of all alcoholic beverages you gotta understand drinking all day every day was definitely a big thing back then i mean people were having a glass of booze as medicine when they had a cold and stuff like that including children by the way but guess what tons of people were also getting sick from and addicted to drinking alcohol now add to that the fact that all of a sudden there were these big new factories popping up everywhere with huge furnaces fire heavy machinery probably not a great idea to be drunk there but people definitely were so yeah that's how you get yourselves a big serious wave of anti-drinking activism and the church back then was playing a huge role in this movement sort of spreading the word but also accepting people's sobriety pledges in front of god and so one notable person who was part of the so-called temperance movement was a church preacher named sylvester graham he had a pretty complicated life growing up you know at some point he was working in a tavern to make some money and it was there where he was witnessing people get shit-faced drunk and fight sometimes until they're dead every single day and sylvester graham was like that's got to stop but for graham abstinence from alcohol is definitely not where he stopped he went much much further than that in his belief humans were constantly surrounded by evil temptations literally anything that was pleasurable or stimulating in any way was bad and that included of course alcohol but also many more things like for example a hard bed or a warm bath and in terms of food he was convinced that humans should only eat plants okay that's not too bad maybe even ahead of his time oh no oh no you see any kind of spice or flavoring you would add no bueno your food young friend must be pure wholesome and taste like nothing so you live a long and pleasureless life but here's the kicker according to sylvester graham if you followed all of his extremely soft core advice you will chill the hell down stop having impure thoughts and thus i'm not joking i'm not making this up you will finally stop masturbating that was literally sylvester graham's ultimate goal and his arch enemy he wrote entire books about that was white bread to him white bread was the devil himself coming to you in the shape of a delicious bun but he didn't actually hate all bread it was just white bread that he hated in fact he thought that the main staple of your diet should be a very very simple whole grain bread made from a very coarsely milled flower that would later on actually after his death become known as graham flower because yes even though sylvester graham was harboring a lot of beliefs that today we would simply just call crazy back then he actually had quite a lot of followers they might have been a little bit less extreme than him but they definitely carried his ideas well into the late 19th and even into the 20th century those are the people who brought us foods like the graham cracker for example which is like quite popular to this day and still made with something similar to graham's gram flour but wait how does all of that relate to breakfast cereal well good question back to the mid-1800s sylvester graham had now passed away but his ideas as we mentioned are alive and well a very fine 19th century dude named james caleb jackson for example he was running a spa kind of thing they called it sanatorium back then basically a place where you could go relax hang out do some water healing whatever that was and also live jackson's vision of a completely stimulation free life inspired of course by sylvester graham and don't think he was some kind of like niche freak he was actually running one of the world's like biggest spas back in the day jackson was a pretty devoted follower of graham's food philosophy and it was at his spa that we find the very first recorded mention of something called granula not granola granula this was sort of jackson's take on graham's simple whole wheat bread except this one was double baked so it would get really really hard then they would break it into nuggets and then because they were so hard you had to soak them in milk overnight and then you could have them for breakfast the day after and this simple but somewhat like wholesome and novel food it really became a thing jackson started selling it big time and only a few decades later you'd find diy recipes for granula in all sorts of cookbooks one of the people who was clearly quite fond of this idea was another fine 19th century dude and his name might actually ring a bell it's john harvey kellogg let me just say john harvey kellogg was not a simple man according to wikipedia he was an american medical doctor nutritionist inventor health activist eugenicist and businessman and if you read up on kellogg's actual views and what he believed and tried to carry into the world it's insane john harvey kellogg was a ridiculous anti-sex crusader and a racist but on the other hand he did invent corn flakes so although it's not actually that easy i mean the corn flakes part everything else clear as day you see at kellogg's spot you would actually get a slightly improved granular kellogg was actually using a blend of different grains but most importantly he kind of like tweaked the process to tenderize him and apparently the patients at his spa like that stuff so much that they were literally begging kellogg to sell them some witch yes that is what launched his career as a food inventor and producer he teamed up with a few of his siblings and other members of his family and together they developed an even better technique to make something they would call flaked cereals which is what eventually would get them the game-changing patent in 1896. even though it's john harvey kellogg's name on the patent certificate many people argue that it was actually his younger brother william keith kellogg who was the mastermind of the company it was will kellogg's idea for example to start making corn only flakes and that was quite revolutionary because corn was mostly used to feed animals back then and therefore was a hell of a lot cheaper and i'm gonna argue that it was exactly this sort of capitalist instinct of will kellogg that eventually led to the big kellogg's fallout i hope you remember that thus far all of the cereal we've talked about was specifically designed to taste so bland that you will experience zero stimulation while eating it so you will finally stop touching yourself which by the way if you checked that old cookbook from before people were totally just adding sugar and fruits into it and william kellogg was a smart businessman he just like knew that stuff and so he had a suggestion how about we add some sugar into our cereal but that was a big no-no for john harvey too much flavor too much pleasure the thing is that william kellogg was a lot less interested in promoting weird dogmatic purist lifestyles and much more interested in how should we say it cold heart cash so a huge family fight erupts and eventually will kellogg founds his own company which does add sugar to cornflakes and guess which one of the two companies grows into the one big company that we know today as kellogg's that produces these that's right easy question it was of course will kellogg's kellogg's i think it's safe to say that in terms of breakfast the 20th century in america and quite a few other countries around the world becomes all about cereal and think about it before the rich would eat eggs and meat for breakfast and the poor would eat some form of porridge but all of a sudden you get this tasty and healthy stuff that comes right out of a box all you got to do is to add milk and most people can afford it almost everybody likes it so of course cereal became a game changer innovations and new brands start appearing everywhere grape nuts puffed rice wheaties of course the legendary cheerios they all take america by storm kellogg's does become a household name but it is far from being the only name on the market in fact it has some serious competition so after world war ii which was a little bit of a break life in america kind of starts getting back to normal except now we have a whole generation of baby boomer babies about to become the new population and all the cereal companies can think of at this point is if we get those kids early they're gonna become lifelong customers and so the cereal race is on and what does the kellogg's company do to boost sales well the one thing that has worked for them once before adding sugar but this time this time they got tv to tell everyone about it faster than kellogg's exciting new cereal sugar frosted flakes big crunchy flakes of corn with sparkling sugar on every flake and always ready to eat all you need is milk or cream or eat them right out of the box i'm just gonna argue that by introducing sugar frosted flakes they drop the word sugar from the name later on kellogg's turned the cereal race into a sugar race their competition of course followed introducing more and more brands like frosty o's sugar jets crisp monster cereal cocoa pebbles you name it but the crazy thing is even though these products became highly processed and loaded to the brim with sugar they were still marketed as the healthy breakfast option and unfortunately it took government agencies quite a long time to finally start setting some rules on how cereal companies can describe market and call their products and when they finally did that ship had sailed a long time ago all people wanted especially kit were brightly colored and absurdly sweet cereals which is extremely ironic if you consider what the original intentions of graham jackson and kellogg were it was only in this 21st century that mainstream consumers started like slowly considering more healthy cereal options for breakfast like for example there's the comeback of like mildly sweetened actual granola or the rise of muesli which is of course the slightly healthier european cousin of american breakfast cereal but i was a serial eating kid in the early 90s so i definitely remember craving the brightly colored and sweet stuff and one of the brands i remember liking the most are of course froot loops turns out they've been around since the 1960s with originally only three colors that's yellow orange and red with purple blue and green being added later on now funnily enough these are modern day german or european fruit loops with only three colors because apparently europeans are less willing to accept neon colored cereals i guess but as we've learned it doesn't even matter because they all taste the same anyway now with all of that history in mind i know that was a big one i told you i did some research to see if we could like come up with a version of homemade fruit loops that a are 100 natural and b where each color will correspond to a different flavor the goal was not to make them taste like the original or super amazing or whatever the goal was to see what a wholesome homemade fruit loop could actually taste like and for that let's begin with the cereal part we're mostly going to be using oats but we'll also add some all-purpose flour which contains gluten and will help the structure as well as finely milled corn flour which i think has the signature mildly sweet note that you get with most cereals the oats of course are way too coarse so we're first gonna put them in a blender and turn them into a fine oat flour after combining all the grains together we do wanna add a little bit of sugar just a tad i mean come on we want this to taste like something we balance those out with a bit of salt and i also added baking powder which will work as a leavener to help us get an airier texture whisk until homogeneous and that is our fruit loop cereal base mix the next part will be actual fruits i want to go for four different colors so here are four different flavors for red i'm gonna go with cherries all i could find were frozen cherries because they're kind of out of season now then apple and kiwi will be our green flavor blueberry will make uh well a blue fruit loop i hope and then for the yellow one i went with orange and mango the first step will be to turn them into a puree for that i'm adding them to a blender with a drop of vegetable oil my thinking with the oil here is that as we blend everything together it's gonna emulsify into the puree and carry more of the fruit aroma that's because fat is actually much better at absorbing and storing fragrances than water you can also add extra color for a brighter punch and a great natural yellow coloring is turmeric but uh i highly recommend not to use turmeric in plastic or wooden cookware because it's gonna stain everything yellow like brightly yellow and you will never ever fully get it out so we're gonna blend everything into a sort of smoothie you see how it's getting kind of pale well once we add tumeric in a glass bowl by the way not anymore we'll do the same to apple and kiwi and as a green food coloring i'm gonna be using chlorella which is a seaweed extract you could also use a bit of pureed spinach as a coloring i suppose but what you're seeing here is a deep ass green you're never gonna get with those the cherries actually turned out to be the easiest they don't even need any extra color they already look tarantino red as they come but now the blueberries they're a highly interesting case because as you blend them you'll notice that their juice is indeed not blue at all and that posed a highly interesting challenge because what natural food coloring is there that is actually bright blue blue is a color you almost never find in edible things like naturally except there's this one ingredient and only one that i know of that can actually do the job enter the mysterious butterfly pea flowers these are a variety of blossoms from the clitoria plant which gets its name from its particular shape now these are found in parts of asia and when you add hot water you can get a tea with an incredibly unique color and a very boring taste but that's not what we're here for i mean check that out if you think that looks fake wait until you see what happens if you add a drop of anything acidic in there exactly but i did not just show you that trick simply because it looks cool i mean i kinda did but here's the thing most fruits and that of course includes berries are actually slightly acidic or a lot acidic and that's gonna mess with our results that's on top of the fact that we already have the purple color of the blueberries to work against so in addition to adding a bit of super strong butterfly pt i'm also gonna add a little bit of baking soda which of course is alkaline to counteract the acidity i know this still looks very purple but don't worry it's gonna mellow out as we move along so with our four different flavors and color purees all set it's time to turn them into a sort of dough simply add an equal amount of cereal base mix by weight and combine into a homogeneous mass the colors will all change a little bit at this point especially check out the blueberry it literally goes from purple to blue in front of your eyes as you lower the overall acidity by mixing it with the grains the doughs are obviously way too sticky at this point to do any kind of meaningful work with them so what we're gonna do is we're gonna shape them into sheets and pre-cook those so they firm up for that you want to get a couple of small trays and grease them i used coconut oil then use a wet offset spatula to spread a thin layer of froot loop dough on each of the trays keep it nice and flat and even somewhere around two to three millimeters now to cook them we need to basically drop them in a hot water bath which requires a bit of creativity i used a deep casserole pan and put that straight on my stove which is a bit more adventurous than what i'm comfortable with but hey it worked now drop your sheets in one by one and let them cook through roughly seven minutes each half of our mixture is starch which gelatinizes around 80 degrees celsius so that's all we're looking for at this stage you could technically try doing this in the oven but the boiling water actually provides a very consistent and even heat transfer with a maximum temperature of 100 degrees which is perfect you're gonna need to rest the pre-cooked sheets of froot loop dough in the fridge for like 30 minutes or so to let them fully settle and firm up after which we're gonna get to what is undoubtedly the most laborious part of this process the shaping you will need two ring-shaped objects to use as stencils i picked the lid of a chapstick for the big loop and then a metal straw for the small one and then you get to work [Music] the loops you're gonna get are still very soft and will also taste pretty flowery and not very great so your very last step is gonna be to toast these in the oven super low temperature somewhere around 125 celsius because we want pretty much zero browning on these to keep the nice and bright colors it took me around 45 minutes to get these nice dry and toasty without burning them and if they're still a little bit soft on the inside then turn your oven to an even lower temperature like 60 degrees maybe and just like let them dry up and firm up for like another half hour or if you want to be extra safe you can put those in a dehydrator but the oven should work just fine now let's actually get to the final resolution of my froot loops journey which is of course tasting my homemade froot loops with milk well since i had to make each one of those by hand i don't have that many and that's the reason why i'm gonna go over to the other camera now and pour some milk over them to show you guys because i don't have enough to make a separate close-up so here they are and now i'm gonna pour some milk over them look at those those are homemade froot loops okay here i am back with my demo cereal and then here we of course have the opponent which is the commercial froot loops kellogg's fruit loops i think the first thing we all notice immediately is the difference in color the commercial ones are like neon colored and bright while the homemade ones are i mean you can clearly tell the different colors but they're much more mellow i'm gonna establish a baseline by testing the commercial product first so cheers yeah fruit loops classic that's the flavor i remember it's like this very non-descript general fruit flavor which i'm just gonna call generic citrus or something quite sweet but not too bad actually but now the big question is of course how does the homemade cereal stack up and i have not tried this with milk like for real first of all it tastes like actual cereals like porridge or something and it also tastes like fruit so that one i think we achieved i'm getting some actual cherry flavor why am i so surprised the more i eat the better they taste for sure so i'm gonna say that the biggest difference between these two is actually not so much in flavor i mean they obviously taste quite differently but i would say like the homemade ones are still recognizable as froot loops when you eat them but the biggest difference is in texture the commercial ones are just extremely light and puffy you know almost like puffed rice and they do indeed undergo that kind of processing during manufacturing the problem is that this involves some pretty complex machinery with like high pressure and yada yada which i don't i didn't want to go there for this video i tried to get around that one but obviously even with baking soda we would have needed more puffiness in the homemade fruit loops but other than that i mean they're froot loops they're all natural they get soggy in milk anyway so what's the difference i think i'm starting to get the difference you need to chew a lot longer but hey the upshot is they actually taste like fruit yes not all the fruits are equally prominent mango comes through pretty well and definitely cherry not getting a lot of apple and also not getting a lot of blueberry unfortunately but i'm getting a lot of wholesome oat flavor final verdict would i recommend doing this at home i'm not sure maybe not i mean it's a lot of work and you don't get a lot of froot loops doing that and then when you do they don't even i mean they taste good but it's like it's not the same craveable experience so yeah maybe if you want healthy fruit loops just buy some healthy granola and add some fruits like some actual fresh fruit and you're gonna be just fine thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next one", "ID9qRv1bO-4": "hey guys today I want to share some snack ideas for on the go and these are snacks that I like to just grab and take with me while I'm out or if I'm on vacation things that I can pack with me or take when I'm sightseeing or just my daily activities when I'm running errands or things like that if I know that I'm not going to be at home for a while just stuff that I just grabbed with me in the mornings and take so i'll have it throughout my day so i just want to share that with you guys um the first things that i like to carry with me are that's its cars and i have these in every flavor you can find these at most markets um even starbucks i know some of the starbucks carry these and literally all that's in here is just fruit so they're really tasty and it's just a good snack to kind of hold you over if you're out about but they have a variety of flavors and I love that it's just fruit so I have the doubts it's far as with me all the time and then another a little snack treat that I like to have our the larabars so if you're out and about or you kind of feel like you're getting hungry lara bars are always a good option they're really clean they don't have too many ingredients in them so i like to carry these right now I have the cashew cookie and cherry pie but I really like all of them so you really can't go wrong with the larabars and then if you're ever like out and about and you're you know didn't pack anything and you see like a grocery store market you can always stop in and pick up snacks to cooking is always like nuts like raw almonds or pistachios peanuts and try to find Rahl not too many like seasonings or salts on them but I get these at fresh and easy these are just like raw almonds and then pistachios so I like to have just met on hand especially if I'm getting hungry and I like to get the smaller bags if I do it ahead of time I will just take some of my raw almonds or peanuts or cashews or whatever I have on hand and I'll just portion out my portions and little baggies because I don't really like to have the whole bag because I just sometimes won't stop I love nuts so I just like to eat them so sometimes it's easier to have like portioned out baggies of nuts and stuff and then another good one for on-the-go is almond butter cashew butter peanut butter just little packets so you have them on go and these are always great these are just the Justin's this is an almond butter and this one's a hazelnut butter and then I recently found these at costco these are the peanut butter & Co and it's a three pack it comes with the bees knees and dark chocolate dreams both wonderful options if you're doing like breakfast in the morning add these to like your quinoa bowl oatmeal overnight oats when you're on the go use it on a banana you know just take like a little knife or something with you and just spoon it onto your banana or just squeeze it directly out of the package and banana is a great option to take with you if you're out and about but you can always put peanut butter on that and these are always just a great snack to have I also like peanut butter on these excuse pink fins these are another thing but all packaged up and take with me when I'm out about I found these at fresh and easy and you're the Susie's think then this one's the whole grain this one is all-natural puffed crackers spelt and flax seeds they're both really good and this one is the lightly salted and it's just corn the only ingredients are corn and sea salt so these are really nice if you kind of want that like crunchy chip texture these are really good options and the nutrition autumn are not bad for three cakes it's 38 calories eight cards and 1.5 grams of protein so not too bad for a snack and you can always slot some peanut butter on that or just eat it by itself um either way they're really good so my other thing was fruits I love to take fruit with me when I'm out and about oranges I always chop up apples and put apples in like a little baggie or container and take up with me peanut butter is always good on apples too and then little halos I find these at costco I go through the bag like crazy just seem as like little cuties just little mandarin oranges but these are always good to have when you're out and about and we're really refreshing if you have them like chilled they're so good just hold and then on this one I just picked up to think thin crunch and this one is coconut chocolate with mixed nuts I haven't tried this one yet so we'll see how it case but I picked this one up and another bar just to have on hand and then I love the bear fruits these are great these are just crunchy apples that's all paid or that's the only greeting here is granny smith apples these are nice if you're out or just an afternoon snap when you're not at home to eat something these are nice because it looks like a hint of sweetness and it's just an apple so if you kind of have that like craving for something crunchy good option is the bear fruit and I know they have a I think it's the red apple it's like cinnamon it's an apple cinnamon I think but I like the green apples so this is the one that I chose but I like to have those on hand and then I found the way better snacks and these are just black bean corn tortilla chips and these I like to just throw in my little lunch bag when an out if I have like my southwestern quinoa I'll just pair it with these and just eat that on the go so this is something that I found that I like and then another option when you're out and about is dried fruit I like to pick up the bags of dried fruit at trader joe's these are the mingoes and you can get it's just just mangos they have chili mango they have I think the sweet mangoes but if you get just mangos it's just dried mangos and they're really good to have as a snack so you can pick up some dried fruit and eat your portion when you're out about dried fruit is always a good option when you're want to go the other thing is chickpeas these are great crunchy snack so if you're you know again craving something salty or something crunchy these are really good these are just the sea salt chickpeas and I pick these up at crush and easy I'm sure you can find them at any market but these ones are really really good so if you're craving like that crunch or you just want something kind of salty this is a good snack so I like these and then for a drink when I'm out and about I like to get these Bragg's this is the organic apple cider vinegar Concord grape acai one of my favorites I love this drink it's refreshing so I'm out and about i'll stop at our little natural market up the road and just get one of these and sometimes just drinking this will kind of like pulled me over until I can get home and eat my lunch if I haven't packed it and brought it with me so it's just nice to have kind of like a little treat drink and nutritional needs is not bad its twenty calories and this is for the whole bottle five carbs and zero protein and only five grams of sugar so not bad at all but they're really good for you I love the braggs drinks so I like to have these just as a snack when I'm out and about so I hope I gave you guys some ideas as far as snacks of what you can take with you whether you're traveling or your college student on campus or you want something after school or after work or just a snack so I hope you guys enjoyed

playing Courtin everything sparkling I think we're think all matted Eric nicely you're all nice and professional don't go down that really guys I like it as a reason I love the channel Rosie's know loads of use loads of subs I think we had over 40 50 subs the last four weeks which is absolutely brilliant okay do that every month we're gonna hit that thousand at the end of the year so let's get this bloody channel rockin guys anyway Stephen stop waffling on this so if I'm looking down at no sir all the time guys because the samisen survives to come in and I don't to put so much on here to start with Monica we buy seat we want to keep it simple and that's the way we're going to go so first of all as with every Wednesday night we're going to try the juices that we did last week I did to last we didn't over the lemon line one and the berry mix one now during the way I've actually just adjusted them slightly added a bit of sweetener into them you know I've put it all on the notes and everything because your boys sweetness as well as sign notes to sweeten things up whether it's a cotton candy you'll learn that as we go along or Donna going to too much but just on those two under the berry mix that we did last week and remember mimicked in that live last week it was 10 percent my cup of the berry mix just to one mix flavor and with her three nicotine strengths or my liquids in this unit strength and I 80/20 very joy ratio on this one we did attempt since I think when I tried it because we did it last Wednesday I tried it the weekend and berries weren't quite popping those so I've it I've added an extra 2% of berries in there and I've also added 2% of ethyl maltol which is a sweetener or you can buy sweeteners or whatever sweetness tend to public cause of its there's loads of sweeteners out there I think it was shiny suggest dude I can't inside the bloody we were brought in tried before I didn't quite like the ties to that one shine I think it was a arias tuck any three top sweetly that's a little bit of enough to taste then it's quite strong as well quite strong sweetener I didn't quite like one I do like a camel toe I think it's abyss but anyway added to percents of ethyl maltol to that as well so let's give this a shake let's see how it's doing another four days later this is a way cult juice now it's only a fruit juice so it shouldn't need a lot of steeping or your bakeries you could stirs your caramels all those will need longer steeping they're not shaken by juices that type of juice but your fruit juice ones or fruits generally will evoke straighter I so give this a tough go do tell me how old glass RDI I've got a single card or D in that one for you and it's the fishbone one that one there guys you can see that nice picture of a bone fish on there I think it was Paul from ESCO vibes it's Steve you got the around Bolivia tease now with you go go on with the carp on there yeah we're getting that big now I've got me able to do vibe line we can logo on there yeah I do wish but anyway we've got a single-car build on there I'll go start on the smoke do proof again it's 80 watts and we'll try it this first one from last week which was a berry mix just put a bit of that juiciness on there so give it a good shake give everything to shake we're doing juice abuse cause I got so much information on this in my head you know I can't put it so just get confusing guys you'll come along as a way to go boy it's like any questions any help from anyone who's a mixologist any mixes out there put the info in guys any tips ideas whatever as I say I'm no bloody mixologist I'll mix my own juice I have been for six months and I love it I love the whole concept and the excitements and the passion that you know just the thrill of making something that you are creating which is absolutely beautiful mouseland cirno's you get some ones that are pretty shy but you find amid seminal so you're not wasting anything wisely like 20p and probably check your pound one pound fifty is worth of juices 10 ml bottles till you get to the final the final juice that your buddy love but it's just trial and error guys like any you know anybody any chemist you like a chemist in a way it's just trial and error you go do a trial of that one trial then top it up with something to a trial it's just lovely doing it course it really is love when you come over the name product that you can vape or die I've got some lovely or died vibes here you know hundred mil of that one bit of that down at 100 middle of that lemon custard 100 mil of that cheese cut you can most of those I'm tried I got out 100 flavors there don't expect us get I want you start with just get 5 or 10 put them in you staff go for press what can I make out of this just go from there to start with anyway stop gabbing on there's some what bloody Viper seviche look she got with you I hope you all had a great comment lies lies halfway through the way you can fly close to the weekend I'm gonna go fishing I think oh yeah get on the beach tomorrow it's warmed up slightly he's been frozen out the last four days start to warm up a little bit now so I'm gonna get my backside out these bloody ice and get on that beach and do a bit of fishing probably bit of bloody white Zin on the beach build a tempura batter bitter lemon bit of water or fall rise let's give this a berry mix which we did last week guys on the channel this gives us to some soothe this and I've improved this anyway by topping up that concentrate by 2% and out of you a bit of Swing there which is the ethyl maltol here we go my beautiful daughter on there with my gorgeous beautiful girl all those noise that is me when I try this on the weekend four days after mixing it from last week it was just a bit just a bit harsh a bit sharp putting that sweetener in has just carved everything down because sweeteners tend to do that's whatever it's when you use well it's a smooth whether it's a cotton candy whether these ethyl maltol which is whether it's sweetness or whether it's an ice cream it just calms things down a little bit and that's still treating that one that extra fiber in there as well that's left or lingering basket of fruits on my tongue those nice oh that's Mickey mean lick my lips absolu pack out that is nice no just one fruit flavor is what you see you know that they're not these complex nice rounded beautiful vibes you can make those you really can but that's future down the line guys but that is a lovely fruit vibe that's all it is it's a fruit to Vitamix fruit vibe I've got a bit of sweetness leaves are lovely I mean high on it it's got a sweetness of the little bit of depth in it that's nice and our lovely fruitiness can we improve that one of course I can improve that one cotton candy I think it's not too bad actually that's not so bad I might leave that for another week I might not touch that next week till next week I'll have real quick roundabouts sir next weekend see what it's doing but Sir that won't be alright and that's good I'll put that back on my black cupboard right the other one we did last week was the lemon align again with this one I tried it three or four days after we mixed it last week and this one just needed again lift it again because a lot of the flavors sometimes only 10% of that flavor to populate sometimes it will need 15% and sometimes it might need 2% it depends on the depth of the actual concentrates and all concentrates from all the manufacturers they're all different they've all got their density of strength there they've got their own complex because these are actual mixes these are concentrates their mix is in themselves so they're all different from different manufacturers anyway Steve stop rapping on Java ashell yeah we're off put something back on there for you guys to watch a few vices on there they've got muscle a Steve a few vibrant faces there take that bloody advert off there as you know so got adverts on the channel no guys just let them run if you can sometimes piss all incomes I'm going to give all the income away from my advert revenue we'll see how that person will give it right to this Children's Hospital right let's try snus I've just dropped the adjustable bike bang which is all explained on this video talk about loving your own bloody face back on there it'll put someone juice on there no I didn't see that we destroy thanks somewhere that's give that another toot try this once a lie they've all bloody confused their guys here I go again lucky dip you can't like of course it is yeah whatever do we just wanna have a look at this during the week and this one just needed sprucing up a little bit I'll put an extra 1% of flavor in there and I'll put 1% of cotton candy in there just to try and smooth things off a little bit because just made your branding off a little bit anyway give this [ __ ] off surely I to us here we go with our lemon and lime which will mix with last Wednesday nice tank a nice fresh vibe that cotton candy is just smoothing things off a bit it's a ditz added a little bit of sweetness to it as well that one think that laser even a bit more of the fly around there what did we start off last week I think it was 12% was there I'll put 1% in on the weekend so it's got 13% in there peep notes as well when you adjust your recipes keep notes lose Tommy do it just add that onto a recipe joins the rest way otherwise you're gonna you're not gonna remember what you did guys so keep your notes that needs a bit more lemon and lime and I think or perhaps just a bit of lemon on its own just - I'll do I'll probably just pop the concentrate on that one boys right savage juice this lemon custard yeah we're doing Little Mix Oh drop your band again we do a live mix now guys what are your suggestions thanks Ross adjustments guys got the lads come through Adam happy very percent one through four coconut butterscotch that'd be interesting one I've got the constant rise to that so I won't do that one there next week for you Adam lemon sherbet from piping the live diddle I de lavit are from Simon 18 Simon I think Sonia for Lemon looks from the demon vapor which will go it's all of those but the one I'm going to do tonight is for vaping live which was the lemon sherbet one that'll be interesting mistress pro-business whoops-a-daisy it's the lemon custard solo company video be past two videos no moaning you know as I said before I kept saying I'm a bit raw so just the way it is it's just why I do things I think people like it that wise to be honest okay to give this a chuff about this one now it's been working for about six weeks I believe and it's New Year to perfection lemon custard nice nice top notes lemon smoothie nussle custard on the inside oh it's nice nice sweetness coming in there that's full got double cream in there we've got juicy lemon got vanilla custard and we've got Sicilian lemon in there that you've noise oh that's coming on the truth that might be better in another week to our new tried it anything to that I'll make the version one that I dealer that was good that's why I've done it so no hundred mill bought off that's the version two and that's just just a bit more brighter that's lovely okay we'll do a mix now guys up to one side have a quick over write a quick slurp as a cyber juice with the concentrates you know we're not doing my juice review guys I don't do all this tasting smelling stuff I want to bloody vibe the bloody juice i don't--it iced tea or somalis in the bottle thanks regard to do that a lot of people do that and that's the way they get their senses working I don't do that I'm certainly no tasty because on the shelf Juicy's they've got Nick in an awkward but Nick on my bloody Tom Tom or dive in it but I'm not going to bleep piss on Tom that's one of the reasons are down to it quit sir you know people do it that way and that's up to them you know ads action that's all why they want it do we but with concentrates you don't need to taste and smell them to see what strength they've got in what body they've gotten what intense five they have in order for you to know what to put in the mixture whether to put you know 4 mils in or whether it's put forth sensing or whether to put five or even ten or even twenty percent team you get that from tasting it and that gives you some idea of what the potential of that actual juice is say let's just pick a fruit one any fruit one a trunk flavor art but on the right give it a shot always give them a shiny keep everything look good shake as I say if you want to add books because there's nicotine involved its diluted because today if you're poor dick then I have a little I need for a few days you've got a problem diluted nicotine I doubt by the way enclosed with damp do is I'd bloody side noise if you want we're Bushmen please I advise you to weight loss chug up to you but while I mix he says I said on the other videos there's a to me there's no need to but if one away it goes you want to be safe balmains wear gloves get yourself and like a box of gloves I start the ones before disposable plastic gloves make sure they're not the ones with a pair of in size that will contaminate what you're doing always when you're mixing do it clean spotless hands sterilized and sterilize bottles sterilized a whisker make sure everything's nice and clean guys because it's going down near the end of the day and I wanted to paper said I've got you know I looked at my two videos from last two videos I made a couple of mistakes that's why I'm guys you know I do bugger up now the game boy I'm doing I'm going to stick the menu up now so it's nice and precise and you can see exactly what I'm mixing I mean grab and that's your growing they have a tweet within a great conversation right guy and it's give me a few tips as well you know I'm not a big salad dish guys I'm just mixing juice Claud mixing juice and I love the juices that I mix and I want to just to show you and bloody easiest tease if you want all the technical advice about all the complexity of bloody DIY there's loads of

want to get this channel interactive especially the DIY party anyway going on to tasting and smelling this is a banana ripe it's an ass smell I wouldn't do this with actual juice mixes you know off-the-shelf juice pipes david concentrates because there's no explaining we're now working banana bloody alley or what and that is it says banana ripe and that is a squeezy squad you perhaps a little blackness on the that is it ten sisters advertised alone I mean I never taste quite like they are when the diluted because DC's consulate right so it's going to be a bit of a he's bit harsh sometimes bit tingly on the tongue but I love life that is a that is a true ripe banana man you don't need much of that solution in to get your banana fiber let's say about five maybe three five percent on the one vape juice that would make a what a single vibe noises single vibe that would so just try a juice ease put that back in deflates I'll give you a flash on my table I'll put it up there that's good guys just a quick view from my side of the my side of camera looking at it you guys just a quick view my desk my slice yeah well get set up ready my DIY desk was such plus well do

watch and cheap I was on the sixth grade that is only sixth grade the wish that was about the wish that was about eight quid so cheapest chips that massive bottle of VG PG is about knowing quid I think me he could say there's about twelve quits there you go and I've got lousy juices on I expect you to get all those juices like this guy that's got about a hundred juices there of all different types or combos Orfila juices softeners sweeteners by curries cakes fruits all sorts of stuff going on there guys so delicately skip that many there be one or two yeah they were all though she's no days so hopefully it could make up anything that you guys want me to make on our Wednesday specials guys and I'll do whether you recognize that there that I've been wrong for a bloody long a long time that's my whoopee-doo D 5 out of 5 juice review Bell I run that for me but I saw the wrong it lets you be honest don't know what really six months ago anyway that's why we juices are all overcome all on racks they're all I bought life that's where all the samples are kept that's where all my new that's stuff there was only based on the video the cupcake world right I'm going to give those a choice you know those workouts those all mix is already done ones ready for steeping and all the flavors you see there guys they're all labeled up I've got fruits and hot drinks and all the chocolates there guys fruit working down the line got the cookies down acai screens we lose question of sweeteners coal all the various sweetness can get as well there ethyl maltol you know colada the artificial sweeteners as well I've got graham crackers soft drinks everything as well that's my voice for building that's quite a few there guys don't spit you scam I know you only need five six baby 10 flavors as long as you got your very JPJ your nicotine your scales and your whisk and you know why ego and if you want to wear books that's Tagliapietra guys let's look at my desk there there's me I'll skin your knees and that look at all that will be underneath God Almighty okay guys and we'll catch you later I'll do shoe min on my lovely girl and she's Christine sadly mr. guys okay I'm with a video okay that's just a flashing my timer works up there's no tools no babies there's no washing up there's no needles now bloody syringes nothing that's or if you wanna wear gloves like way close anyway cracking on yeah also you get the constant rise but you can also get one shot combos as well when it's got the shelf bought a juices just in concentrate for use that the nicotine some of those about like 10 quid will be expensive a lot cheaper than the at reduce my drop and put that explains if doing it this way doing your own combos your own why much more cheaper to three paying 400 mil so tried be a bit more precise in the videos specifically with the measurements and with the NIC measurements as well you know you've got to be spot-on what I'm doing if we smell not that critical but because people are watching what I'm doing I need to be a bit more precise I'm going to try and be a bit more precise in the future guys yeah shine was one about mentioned to me message me of those sweeteners they want cord every R it up every through talk I think it's cool sweet I've tried that in the past church right yeah thanks for putting tip through want to purple like it but I thought just a little bit of an ass stuff aftertaste the Simon's we've you know sweeteners they item a of the aftertaste ever have a sweetener type of thing whereas ethyl maltol doesn't come cotton candy doesn't or a bitter Bavarian crave doesn't you know but it is whatever whatever pleasure reflects what suggestion anyway shine and thus I will crack on with a which one did we start we're going to do one of my reviewers requests which was from my P live which was the lemon service on ask a Thomas green here on my applet from my liquid recipe sighs just bear with me a second guys I'm introducing Viper ice

concentrates I mean the ones I buy and custody around about 1 pound 82 2.54 10 15 ml 30 mils cost about 3 pay and I see four pair I've found a new company now which I'm going to have a look at which is a cupcake world and they do actual flavorings for food this is to slow food gray vibrance now when you use you can't just go to a supermarket by firing off the shelf and try that because we're sort of food flavorings on the Shelf I've got an awl or an olive oil or some sort of oil advice to them you cannot use all your vices in pipes guys that's a no-no you'll clog up your cars it give you a sore throat it just definitely well work but these concentrates from a kite manufacture these are actually a very base which is absolutely brilliant so you know in effect they are vaping concentrates denser stronger concentrate so I'm gonna give those a guys will also if any juice reviewers or anybody that uses cockeyed world juices and they are bloody cheap 30ml there I think it was one pound I

bucket don't I start with put that back on there guys no problem all I'll do is empty that bottle I'll put it back inside when I finish put all that in there make sure every last drop of goodness is quite a blow get me old whisker get off the excess water here we go give it a good old whiskey whiskey whiskey whiskey to this white he looks by D but it's not it's because there's trillions and trillions of bubbles in there now wish you could never do that boy you sell out of this all the time are doing this all right good old bloody go bloody bubbles in it ah bloody cloudy we bought more so many bubbles in there that's incredible chubby scales that's that finish we've now washing up now playing here now blows nothing to do I've done the recipe I've got seen my bottle pour that back into the bottle nice mixed I should have done it that way around in the first place but that's my old bloody over isn't it you know after as weeks go by guys I saw we've got more polished we don't get to be with you polished doing with Christ never really sight we've got to be polished pop on the old top there you go here we go let's give you survived shall we go is this have ashlar tape thinking I've left some but I have this to talk about guys but in our daughter God so much Brazil just get confusing on our donor confuse anybody I really want to show a bloody simple this DIY mixing is they all I mix into me as a future it really is I don't know what the big fight companies are going to do in the future the Lord's producing on the shelves Corsa will vary but who do you always company now with a bloody vengeance there's lots of people trying to do it and there's lots of people doing it out there but there is a lot of people that I'm going to clue what they always all about and this is what this challenge before that was a lot of you air that they are looking both in what you know and they're seasoned mixers nothing you want to play the hell's that bloke doing I'm just I just want to show you how easy it is I don't get too technical on you know exact precise precision bloody measurements and combinations of juices you know if I go down that line a bit further down alive and we will get used to what we're doing guys with we're both here to learn you know I'll be mixer for a long time now I'll mix some lovely juices I really have choked up on me so got the old drip food on there it's give me some gardening juice spring back up for a second guys blow blow Cory to for I've got one two three got four hours to get yourself might be a bit late he's coming up tonight guys so it might be past seven o'clock might be closer to nine o'clock yeah okay bye pal sure best for you vaping live this one is or get some juice on top of there now because this one it's got a rare our way we've got a vanilla custard in there Guster than the smooth mix in there so I take awake two weeks too steep and that's when these coasters really take off you need to be patient with the custards and the by cruise and the you know the caramels it's I should be those just put away for a week two weeks give them a bit of a shake up the cap now and again put the cap back on another shake just be a little bit more passion with those I will see what this is doing good job we're down to do that at [ __ ] 50 watts Stephen let's work out there and try this and see what she's doing straight off the bat I don't expect too much with this without it's sleeping because the sides got those creamy other Mancini's here we go piping live this is your lemon service now this could be nasty it could be nice you could be going I'm sure so nice that was really quite a nice guy straight off the bat and that will be if that steep sort of two weeks or a week that'll be even more intense that will be lovely he's bloody pretty well on the spot there I've got four cents of it custard trying to think what the top note is there now that I've got in there perhaps it needs just a little bit more lemon because of custard he's on the top sherbert the Bureau of fruitiness from the sugar that's in the side the lemons in the side is well above the easting vanilla custard the top layer it's the top notes on that well you skim out hints of that lemony sherbety that is quite nice oh good fact that all died now as that is a lovely creaminess left on your tongue it's not very sweet face noise no libel that one up I've got the recipe on the side I'll put some knife now something here and I'll have a look at that in a week's time I can guarantee you in a week's time that'll be even more of a a deep bold intense creaminess in that and the lemon just might pop up a little bit but I'll try it in four days time and if the lemons not coming out I might put a touch more 1/2 percent more juice lemon in that that is nice I'll put it in my ready to steep file I'll make some notes on that and whatever look at that later on oh just coming to the end of that video as well which is nice time you guys what we got on there anybody that's great [Music] you know I've got what I want to do as well as I said I want to put some notes up of comments made every other video as well just pop that down yeah I want to put some notes down tissue juice makers best friend or a good roll of tissue especially or not my bloody stuff all out of the bleeding place I tell ya his spies everywhere when I start getting bitter soapy up water to get through the juice trust me he's not too bad I mean the kanima ones can stay up a bit this gets some more of that on there because that is probably leaving a taste in my mouth that is that is quite bloody noise that's waving lovely smooth taste in my face not sure I like these bottles of course I have the tenth one pok\u00e9mon mill ones that I've now bought about 50 50 ml ones the caps on that maybe that's alright though it's not too bad put that in the ready to steep I'll go in the cupboard we'll give that a shake everything down again at the top at the top I can't give a shake and we'll try that make sure you can see that's doing well I'll probably try it weekend let's give it another go anyway I'm gonna stuff this we're bloody volume up on this one because I think it's going to handle it a pretty creamy Viper's well straight off the bloody bath shaker vibe which most have a good combo yeah oh I see better noisy watts watch your back watch your back for good that's lovely rice we going up for IAT so they no longer been going off all guys if you enjoyed that so don't get too complex as loads of things I want to go in so that was the lemon

evokes lovely of their lovely announced juice nice stuff really Audio vocal stuff guys okay till Friday like guys tell out", "6aOGxhbe-Hc": "hey guys listen I want to talk about\nliquids intermittent fasting and ketosis I get a lot of questions on can I drink\nthis during  intermittent fasting when I'm supposed to be fasting is it gonna\ninterfere with my fat-burning let's talk about that okay the first thing we're\ntalk about is tea can you drink tea absolutely you can\nnow tea and coffee do have caffeine obviously you can drink too much if you\ndrink a small amount of tea it has some caffeine it's probably not going to be a\nproblem at all but large amounts of caffeine can start\nstimulating insulin but small amounts don't seem to have an effect\nokay so tea is okay of course just get nationally decaffeinated that would be\neven better alright so coffee is coffee okay well\nlet's talk about coffee again I think one in the morning would be great and I\nknow some people get really upset because I you know they're used to\ndrinking it all day long and I say I'm trying to take it away from them and I\ndon't want to do that because of the addiction I mean the craving that they\nhave but the point is that too much coffee can rev up the adrenals and\nactivate cortisol which can then activate insulin okay so that's the\nproblem because it's a stimulant and stimulates the adrenal now caffeine also\nstimulates adrenaline which actually does help fat burning by the way but I\nwouldn't drink coffee to lose weight alright so one in the morning I think\nis gonna be fine now as far as what to put in it is milk or\ncream gonna be a problem from just working with lots of people it's not\nreally a problem if you do small amounts now let's talk about if you're adding\nthe bulletproof which is the butter in there for some people they can do it\nother people it's almost as if they're taking a meal because they're consuming\na good amount of butter in there so I mean if you want to use that as a meal I\nmean go for it but if we're trying to do in a minute fasting we're trying to fast\nand not add that much fat into even the time so you're not supposed to be eating\nbecause anything will trigger insulin to some degree like a meal now\nsugar can we want to put sugar in there absolutely not you can put sugar alcohol\nyou can put xylitol or erythritol I don't know if I would want to put stevia\nin there because it that would be kind of a weird taste but a small amount a\ncoffee is okay as long as you don't add sugar and you just do a small amount of\ncream and maybe a little butter with some people they can get away with it\nother people can't so I've had mixed reviews on that so now if you do a\ncoffee bean extract there are certain phytonutrients in the coffee bean that\nare really beneficial for insulin resistance and that's probably why it\nhelped some people lose weight but if they don't have insulin resistance it's\nnot gonna happen lose weight again that's the coffee bean extract\nthing I don't want to get into that but as far as when you roast the coffee you\nkill all those phytonutrients okay because you're heating it way up so\nthat's coffee try to do small amount all right water water is not going to be a\nproblem you can drink water when you're on the ketogenic diet you are gonna lose\nsome water so don't be afraid to drink it I just like to add electrolytes to it\njust because normally you're gonna lose some electrolytes not just potassium but\nsalt to some people that all of a sudden feel very kind of fatigued during the\nketosis diet or even intermittent fasting we plug in a little bit of salt\nand boom they just kind of perk right up so it could be either salt or potassium\nbut of course don't do the tap water juice filtered water or I like unspoiled\nI like Pellegrino the best myself so I'll drink a good amount of that per\nevery day or some other of spring water bottle water I love carbon and water\nmyself carbonation does not interfere with either one of these at all now\nvitamin water usually comes with a lot of sugar don't do that okay then we have\nbone broth bone broth is actually a really good thing to consume even\nbetween your times that you're eating and the times of your fasting because\nyou're getting a lot of electrolytes with not a lot of calories okay so I\nthink this is totally fine to do and the electrolytes and the nutrition\nthat would actually help overcome the ketogenic flu or any symptoms that you\nmight have so this is okay this is okay diet soda no because aspartame will\nincrease insulin so those artificial sweeteners will increase insulin but if\nyou buy like a diet set of it is with stevia or xylitol or erythritol\nthat's non GMO that would be fine so I'm gonna say no for diet sodas apple cider\nvinegar very okay apple cider vinegar will help regulate blood sugars it's\ngreat to help you if you have a fatty liver it's great for digestion making\ninsulin more I'm sorry glucose more sensitive so the need for insulin goes down this is a\nreal good good one alcohol just keep it below a six pack a night no I'm just\nkidding no alcohol there's certain types of\nalcohol that have low calories but still the alcohol will inhibit the liver\nfunction and completely knock you out of ketosis so don't consume alcohol alright\ncoconut water no this is a no and this is a no because it has quite a bit of\nsugar yes it has electrolytes but it has a lot of sugar okay so I don't recommend\nit again if your metabolism is really fast you might be able to get away with\nit but I'm just telling you in general if any type of sugar or juice anything\nlike that will raise the insulin now also you have unsweetened cranberry\njuice and if you put it water now I used to recommend that the problem is it\nwould believe it or not knock some people out of fat-burning and I was\nsurprised and then I took them off that and I have them just do the lemon and\nthe outside living in her vinegar and water and it went right back in the fat\nburning so that's like a test that I found that works almond milk well almond\nwill a milk usually you want to get it unsweetened and you can have some of\nthat it's there's not a lot of sugar in that usually sometimes there are some\nthat do have hidden sugars but as

guys every meal the nutrient breakdown of those meals and the rationale behind the food choices meal timing distribution and so on and for the last few months I've been following a strict body decomposition approach to my nutrition following the guidelines in my new body recomposition guide that i'm excited to say is finally available for pre-order on Geoff nipper comm how many of you guys know I've been working on this project for the last six months or so with my good friend a nutrition researcher Chris Erica and it's the exact protocol that I'm gonna be following for the rest of my lean bulk so the book is gonna be 30% off for the pre-sale and if you pre-order you'll get two chapters sent to your inbox right away and then as soon as it launches you'll get all 15 chapters which

30% off any training program as well as a bundle so if you guys are interested in taking your nutrition to the next level I'll have the new nutrition guide as the first link in the description box down below as a sense Steph and I have been back here in Kelowna we've been kicking off every morning with a morning walk so I'll wake up I'll usually weigh in and then I'll drink some water and we'll walk to Tim Hortons where we get a coffee there isn't anything really special about doing that walk fasted that just helps kind of wake me up and get me ready for the day okay guys we just got back from her walk I'm gonna get some breakfast ready first I'm gonna show you guys what my macro targets are gonna be for today I've got 225 grams of protein 75 grams of fat and 300 grams of carbs and that will give me an approximate caloric target of 2800 calories per day a couple months ago I was more around the like 2600 calorie range but since then have gradually increased that number up and over the next three or four months try to increase that number further to somewhere around 3200 maybe 3400 or more calories per day while maintaining the amount of fat that I have on me so my goal is to build as much lean mass as possible while minimizing the amount of fat mass that I gave now some people will note that that protein figure is really high from my body weight I'm only 163 pounds however I do think it's better to go too high on protein than too low especially when your goal is recomposition there's at least four reasons for that the first is that extremely high protein intakes have been shown to improve a body composition in the literature even as high as 3 point 4 grams per kilogram so that's just over 1.5 grams per pound which is super high for protein intake also protein is the most satiating macronutrient it also has a higher thermic effect than carbs or fats and also I think you have nothing to lose by going higher on protein and very high protein intakes have been repeatedly shown in the scientific literature to be safe for bone health the kidneys in the liver so I think a simple cost-benefit analysis is going to show you that it'd be better to go too high than too low and then I set my fad at around 25 percent of my total caloric intake and then just fill in the rest with carbs and I should say I don't always track macros and sometimes I will take more of an intuitive approach depending on the day and I have been tracking for like I don't know a decade so I have a really good idea of what's in foods now but since I've been focusing more on body recomposition I have been tracking more diligently so we're definitely gonna do that today all right let's get breakfast so for breakfast just to be doing the usual here I'm gonna do some scrambled eggs some turkey bacon some goat cheese on the eggs Kiwi of course do that every morning and what else oh and some hashbrowns or well potato patties technically oh yeah how about you that looks like a good just to me people always give me a hard time for this breakfast they're like why why are you eating those foods well I the hashbrowns and you know most of it for this meal most of it just comes down to it's a high protein meal it's relatively low carb which I like to do because I like to partition my carbs more around the workout and later in the day when my appetite picks up and other than that it's just an enjoyable breakfast with foods that I like so guys I'm gonna put the macros for this meal up here on the screen you guys can pause if you want to check it out and also I'll have to fish oil capsules and three well it's actually just one serving of a multivitamin I do try to have one or two servings of fatty fish per week but I'm not I don't always go through in that so I just take two of these just to be safe and I think of a multivitamin kind of as like a nutritional insurance I think you should always try to max out your whole food options first and if you do a good job with that you probably don't need a multivitamin I like a quote from Alan Aragon he says a poor diet with a multivitamin is still a poor diet but I think in the case of athletes where it's really common to have nutrient deficiencies it does make sense to supplement with with a multivitamin for no real downside so anyway that's why I do that I'm gonna dig in enjoy this meal and I'll catch up with you guys in the next one alright guys up next we're gonna be doing at our pre-workout meal now I would say the pre-workout meal is the most important meal of the day because ultimately it's gonna be responsible for fueling your training which is what's gonna drive your body recomposition progress forward so I would say for most of the other meals the actual timing of the meals isn't so important but for the pre-workout meal that's one that I definitely would pay much more attention to alright so guys for the pre-workout meal I've got a chicken sandwich here I've got some fresh chicken breast some shredded cheese Mayo some spinach and a little bit of mustard on some ancient greens bread which is my favorite bread and then I've also got 100 grams of blueberries over here a banana to go along with that I'm so for the pre-workout meal I recommend a soft minimum of one gram of carbs per kilogram of body weight so for me that amounts to about 75 grams of carbs and you also want to prioritize choosing carb sources that are going to utilize multiple transporters for absorption Yorn tromelin was nice enough to send me a copy of his PhD dissertation and as part of this thesis he recommends Co ingesting glucose even fructose to fuel performance as they use different intestinal transporters for absorption so the simplest way to do this is to just combine a starchy carbs source like bread with fruit source which is high in fructose so for any food workout meal I always recommend having at least one food source like a banana and I also like to include some berries so these are the macros for the meal we've got 46 grams of protein 13 grams of fat in 82 grams of carbs which is going to make this my highest power of meal of the day and so for a meal of this size generally I try to eat it about one hour out from the workout itself and then about 15 to 20 minutes before I leave for the gym I start sipping on my pre-workout and I try to turn that to be about 30 minutes before my first working set in a perfect world and that's when you're gonna get the most benefit out of the caffeine so I'm gonna dig in eat this meal let it digest a little bit start sipping on my pre-workout and then we're gonna hit a workout let's go home all right guys we're about thirty minutes into the workout and at this point is usually when I'll have my intro workout nutrition now I wouldn't say an intra workout feeding is mandatory but I would advise it under any of the following five circumstances now so the first one is you're really trying to optimize your training performance second of all you have plenty of carbs affair so you're not on like a lower carb diet you don't want to waste them just by like drinking them or eating into a workout third your workouts last longer than an hour if you have relatively short workouts I don't think it necessary at all you've trained fasted so you didn't have a pre-workout meal probably a good idea to get some carbs in and finally it's been three to five hours since your pre-workout meal that's more similar to fasted where you might want some extra nutrients to keep energy a little too high I'm so for me what I've been doing they just pop them back shoot these fuzzy fuzzy peaches so the main idea is you want to have a fast digesting carbs or just for continued energy through the workout and as a general rule you want to have about a half a gram of carb per minute of training starting around thirty minutes into your workout so say your workout lasts for an hour you'd start at 30 minutes have some fast digesting carbs source and you'd have about 15 grams of carbs so half a gram or a minute after that first 30 minutes and so for me 15 grams of carbs it's just like five or six of these top back like a few of those throughout the rest of the workout and that's really all there is to it sometimes I'll go for a liquid carb source so I'll just like mix up some kool-aid or tang or something like that lately I've just been going with the fuzzy peaches so anyway we're gonna crush the rest this workout check me guys back home alright guys just got back from the gym we're gonna have our post-workout meal now whenever I finish up a workout my appetite isn't the strongest and so I don't really try to rush to get protein in as quickly as possible my rule for timing your nutrients post-workout is that it's much less urgent than pre-workout like I said earlier I think pre workouts the most important meal for the post-workout meal I think you should try to get some protein in as quickly as you conveniently can so that means slamming a shake after your workout perfect that's great if you don't have much of an appetite like me it's perfectly fine if you wait until you get home and have a meal and I would say according to the best evidence that we have on this the general recommendation is to not space your pre and post-workout meals by more than four to five hours so for me I went to the gym I don't know a my pre-workout meal at 1:00 so I would want to make sure if I'm trying to optimize everything that I have my post-workout meal in by no later than say 5 maybe 6 p.m. the wider that window gets around the session the more likely you are to potentially taeju recovery or miss out on some potential gains because the muscle is most sensitive to amino acid uptake after resistance training and then it starts to go back down so there is some anabolic window it's just that it's much wider than people originally used to think so anyway with all that said we're gonna get a meal ready over here it was kind of like a quick and easy snack more or less like I said I don't have like my biggest meal post-workout but I do like to have yeah it should be 1 serving of oats this is select protein for oats now you don't need to use this kind of protein powder but I like it because it does mix really well and it also a way casein blend and actually like blended proteins post-workout I'm according to one of my favorite books on nutrition of all time the protein book by Lyle McDonald combining casein and whey post-workout may have a benefit compared to consuming either one in isolation of course we're talking about like the tip of the iceberg here but there's 10x left to go there so I'll stick this in the microwave for a minute I'm so anyway here are the total macros for that meal we've got 34 grams of protein 4 grams of fat and 25 grams of carbs and even though I think a lot of people make a big deal out of carbs in the post-workout period I think that are more important pre-workout where they're actually gonna fuel training and where my appetite is a little lower after training a 10 - like I said earlier prediction more of my carbs toward later meals in the day it's just for simple adherence purposes I'll have a little bit lower carb intake post-workout um so yeah I'm going to finish up this meal and I'll check in with you guys for the next meal alright guys it's been a couple hours since my post-workout snack so I'm gonna have another meal so it's kind of interesting because now my appetite is really starting to pick up that it's later in the day this is always when I get the hunger juices around like between 6:00 to 10:00 p.m. so I'm gonna have a huge meal right now so this is a big Tupperware full of chili that my mom made for me so but my mom will do is she'll cook for me pretty lucky in the sense either Sam or spaghetti or chili like three or four nights a week and just give that to me in Tupperware with the macros what I'm saying with the macros so basically just makes it really easy for me to track so I'm gonna eat all this this is a three cup serving of chili and in here actually I'm gonna heat it up first I'll show you what we got so and I don't know like if there's nothing to input because obviously my mom made the chili I don't want to put in everything individually I'll just add it like in MyFitnessPal just go protein macro you can search for that and then I'll just add 62 grams of protein for that meal and it'll just add fat macro carbon at across because my mom you know does up these macros so if you have a recipe and you know the content you can just put it individually like that it needs to be fall a little bit but you can see we got some chickpeas in here we got some kidney beans ground turkey some peppers garlic in there it's just super healthy meal probably probably my most healthy meal of the day super high fiber and I'd like to have fiber later at night one gonna help me feel more satiated and two is gonna slow the rate of digestion a little bit so I tend to have a bit of a longer overnight fast like it'll usually be maybe 10 or 12 hours that I go without eating so I try to cram a lot of fiber in eat slower digesting sources of protein later in the day so anyway gonna heat this up again and enjoy a little taste test I mean I also added about 15 grams of shredded cheese on top and that makes it taste so much better mmm that's so good I forgot to sail so my mom I think got this recipe online so I'll put the link to the recipe in the description if you guys want to make it for yourself after this I think I'm gonna go play a bit of basketball of them playing in like a little men's league here in Kelowna so I'm gonna go shoot some hoops this is a huge meal so I tried to time it about like an hour before I go play see I'm gonna down this do a bit of work and then go shoot some hoops so I'll put the macros for the meal up here on the screen if you guys are interested in that super high protein and also very high fiber meal and I'll check in with you guys for my last meal before I go to bed just got back from basketball for whatever reason when I run full court basketball it absolutely kills me so I'm feeling so tired right now I ran for well it's quarter to ten now so it was a couple hours a couple hours um so we got one more meal to go before the end of the day here now so there's gonna be our last meal I was gonna point out to you guys I've been reading through this this thesis I showed it earlier from yawn and another one of his main points in the book he's actually written about this for a while but he's kind of big on pre-sleep being potentially important being window so he says here an important in missed opportunity to consume a high protein meal in well-trained athletes is before going to bed and I do think it's an underrated time of day because it's when you're gonna go the longest without eating again so you have you're basically at the greatest risk of catabolism when you're fasting so when you go to bed so anyway I've been trying to really optimize this now I'll show you get you're gonna go with cottage cheese so cottage cheese is a very slow digesting protein primarily from casein basically forms a clump in your stomach and then it takes time for those amino acids to be digested and absorbed so we're gonna go with some of that and I've been eating that with some of these weekend's over here so get a few of these crackers dip it in the cottage cheese don't knock it until you try that it's actually really good oh and forget little good old kale salad with a ban I actually love Cottage cheese's this is a treat I love it soon as the chili I'll add a little bit of cheese on top I typically we just eat these as a snack when I'm watching the TV so lately I've been reaching the Breaking Bad series and I just started season five and I'm convinced that Breaking Bad is the greatest show of all time re watching it gave me such a deeper appreciation for it cuz I watched it when it first aired and now re watching it I just I feel like I appreciate the show so much more so I haven't seen the movie that's out yet I want to finish the fifth season first but yeah if anyone has any show recommendations that you think that you think is better than Breaking Bad comment below but I personally don't think any good I'm gonna watch that these are tough potatoes they're kind of like rice crisps but obviously I guess but they're really low carb per serving really high volume so it just makes for like a really nice light snack so yeah I love these you haven't tried them I don't know if they're available everywhere we have them here in Canada so I'm gonna put the macros for this meal up here on the screen we got 40 grams of protein 23 grams of fat and 72 grams of carbs for 630 calories so I'm gonna enjoy this last meal I'm gonna flick on an episode of Breaking Bad over here but if you guys are interested in checking out the new nutrition guide make sure you hit up that pre-sale link at the first link in the description box down below also I did want to say that in this video I did focus on some of the finer details of nutrition which I actually find most interesting and that is the tone that we take in the book however we do also cover the basics where basically if you wanted to get you know some of the results are probably most of the results you could just focus on hitting your calories hitting your macros and we go through all the details in terms of how to set that up in the book but then also go several layers deeper and explain all the complexities of nutrition in there and so I think it's a really great resource if you're interested hit up the button over here next to my head I'll take you to the pre-order link you leave me a thumbs up if you enjoy the video subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you guys all here in the next one", "JNRQ3MkSk_w": "[Music] you

And that's like, you know, you're not\ngoing to add 120 calories per tablespoon, so it's not a high\nvolume diet. So anyways, I bought the prolon. I was\nworking with regenerative medicine, doctor Dr. Alison Victor, Idaho. And she's like, dude, before we do\nthese injections and I was doing, I can't remember which ones I did\nwith her, but I do like STEM cell and, and I do platelets. She doesn't do\nplatelet, but I do that in Mexico. In any case, I was getting some injections and she's\nlike do the five day fast mimicking diet first because then your body is\nproducing more STEM cells anyways. And your body will receive the new STEM\ncells or whatever we were injecting better. And anyway, um, I tried the ProLon kit, 250\nbucks, 500 calories a day. Like you do the math, those are\nexpensive calories. And I'm like, they must be gold, gold calories. And it's scientific, it's tested, there's lots of little packets of things\nand you open all the packets and that's just not my way of eating.\nSo, Oh, and I'm also like, there's thousands of good fat\ncalories absurd. I'm in the pantry, right? Like there's, I got fat,\nplenty of nuts and seeds and Ghee and.... Anyway, uh, I don't know.\nI didn't like tally up, like how much did it cost\nme to do my own version? My yogahealer, Cate Stillman's\nversion of the fast mimicking diet, which I wrote an ebook for\nSo we have another ebook, of course. Um, and that's all part of\nthe challenge within the challenge. So anyone who buys the challenge\ngets that, and many of you are in it, which is why you're now listening to this. Or whatever. So it was easy. It was dirt\ncheap. I mean, like, I, I really didn't buy anything,\nso it didn't cost me anything. I just changed what I was eating\nthat was already at my house. And it was, was it hard?\nOh, I cheated. Um, I, I cheated according to some people, not\naccording to other people, I should say, uh, some people say you're not supposed\nto like really have caffeine at all. And I, and I did like, there's,\nthere's that bad boy, you know? And so I did also\nBulletproof on my keto days. So I'd have black coffee in the\nmorning, uh, espresso press, like, you know, doing it that\nway, Americanos style. And then by late morning, like 11, I do Bulletproof. So I do ghee\nand MCT oil because why not? It was in my kitchen. It was calling\nto me. And I was like, I kind of, I kind of felt like cheating. Like I do a lot of detoxing and\nI was very serious last fall. And this time I was like, you know what?\nI think it'll just be fun and easy. Plus I was teaching a workshop\nall day workshop master of you workshop. So it's a two day\nworkshop and it's, it's intense. Imagine that, especially because we\nwere, we're working on vision strategy, which is just all fire. So it's\nlike fire, fire, fire. So anyways, the Bulletproof is good fire\nwithin to sustain the fire without let's see, what else did I eat? Not eat, did a ton of steam, steam.\nWe have a steam shower, but I mean, whatever, like if you\nhave whatever, if you have a bathtub, if you have a shower, if you have two hands for an oil on\nyourself and sit in the sun, like, it doesn't matter. That was\nmy, that was my given. Yeah. Nourishment sat on the floor, did quite, quite a bit of a meditation\nfor me, I used to be a much bigger meditator. And then I like really fell\noff the bandwagon. And then I was like, I can't stay off. That's dumb. Yeah.\nI think all of us are slow learners. Like you, like, you have\nto, you have to do it. And then you have to experience\nthe opposite of it to be like, Oh, that's why I do it. So\nwhatever there's that? Okay. This is really what I ate. Sometimes I have some nuts, so I soak almonds and I\nsoak them in salt water. And then I know this is going\nto sound so anal, but like, Ayurveda people that are weird\nlike this sometimes with our nuts. So peel the nuts, put them in the dude,\nhydrator fully dehydrated, the nuts. And then, and they're just in my pantry. So like sometimes I'd have like a handful,\na small handful, like a baby handful, tablespoon handful, and like, bam, there's like a hundred to 120\ncalories depending on...had some roasted pumpkin seeds. I, I, I had a little, little bit of almond butter\non those Ryvita crackers. Yup. I did that once or twice olives. I'm a member of thrive\nmarket for better, or for worse. I don't know your politics on that,\nbut in any case, it, for my lifestyle, it makes my life better.\nSo in any case, uh, they sell these little packets\nof olives and it's like, this packet has whatever, 50 or a\nhundred calories of all of this. And it's like, Oh great.\nSo it's easy to track. Um, I've never been a calorie counter. I've actually probably been a decent  follower in the anti calorie\ncounting movement since I was like 14, but I, it, so that there's like\nsome part of me that's like, I'm allergic to this, but then\nit's like, well wait, what is this? And then the same thing with the macros.\nSo macros is a protein carbs or fat. And I've always thought the\nketo people were so... oops, so annoying because they get off\non their macros. And it's like, what are you guys talking about? Why can't you just say like\nnutrient or something like that, but they put the fancy\nmacronutrient anyway. Um, so how many carbs are in an\nolive? Like that's how you, if you really want to get\ndeeper into auto... autophagy, autophagy, autophagy, I'm learning\nhow to say it the right way, yeah. That's what you're gonna do. You're gonna do the ketogenic\nfast mimicking diet, which is also for those who\nhave it. It's in the ebook, the fast mimicking diet ebook. What\nelse did I eat? Oh, this was big. I mean, in terms of volume. So I take a lot of water and I\nput it in a veggie broth cube. That was kind of like my form of\nelectrolytes. Cause like the ProLon kit, they do a lot of like, we have these\nfancy electrolytes and like, yeah, I'm sure. And if your annual diet is really\ngood and has some local and wilds, like you don't need to worry about not\nhaving every single little micronutrient for five days. Like your body's\nbusy doing other stuff anyway. So I think the fat matters, I\nthink going deeper into autophagy. I think that makes a lot of\nsense. Like the high fat and the, this was another like, aha. You know,\nwhen you have an, a high and you're like, I think I've already had that.\nAha. And it was one of those. So in Ayurveda, when you\ndetox, you eat ghee. Yes. Yeah. I know delicious. When you eat, ghee, you lose your appetite and\nyou have to eat the ghee. You have to eat the Ghee it's\noften medicated. So here's\nyour Ayurvedic doctor. You're in India. You're doing\nPanchakarma, which is like, we are going to remove toxicity from\nyour body, which is causing disease. Beause you already have a disease and\nyou're like, I'm over this disease. I don't want medication. Or maybe I'll\nstay on the medication. But like it, that I need to get stuff out of\nmy body. That's Panchakarma. And in India it's long,\nlike 60 days is not, is not short if you're doing\nit right. Like the full thing. And you're thinking like, wow, that\nwould be totally inconvenient. It's like, yeah. So is chemotherapy,\nright? Like, come on theory of relativity. All\nright. So in any case, boil water, put in a veggie boss cube\nand then I'd take Nori. You know, Nora is the things, those,\nthose a flat strips, of seaweed that they wrap up sushi with. And that's why you can pick up\nyour sushi because of the Nori. Seaweed is super thin. So if a huge\npacket Nori at like a 50 pack of Nori, like I said, I did not buy anything,\nbut I had a bunch of stuff in my house. Nori is interesting. It's like eight\nit's only eight calories a sheet. Ah, so that was like, Ooh, I could have like\nsome substance. Because I mean, you know, it's like a little bit of\nnuts. Uh little ghee, some olives. So anyways, I do like this hot water, the little bit of veggie broth or\nbeef broth cube. And I get some, I think I get the BOU collection. They have some cool broth and gravy\ncubes that look like they're not totally bad for you. And they're\nfun and easy and good flavor. So there that's what I was\nusing a couple of strips, of nori, big scoop of miso with miso like the water cannot be above.\nLike it would burn your finger. If it burned your finger, it's\ntoo hot. It'll burn the miso and miso is like the good guy,\nlike that's gonna help you poop might as well do that. And then speaking\nof poop, sauerkraut, and I'm not, you know, the sauerkraut, like it's\nprobably actually we could go look at it. This is, what's so annoying\nabout the DIY version. But I think it's only annoying\nuntil you get the hang of it, how you do it and what you feel\nlike. Because what was good for me, my body wasn't. Oh yeah. And\nthen there's these things too. You heard of those Italian\nsnacking Lupini beans. Okay. So that's the kind I like, and it looks like five calories\nper two tablespoons. Where is it? Where is it? Fiber, carbs. See there's carbs two\ngrams protein, zero. Right. And fat's going to be zero, there's fat. So like that's the total\nannoying part of, um, figuring it out for yourself, like what you want to eat because\nyou're not necessarily going to want, you might, you maybe want kimchi and\nmaybe the number's three grams of carbs. It's not going to have any fat or\nprotein. So now you're like, okay, kimchi and sauerkraut are carbs. So the Kaphas and the Vatas are going\nto do more with the spice. Right? Of course, of course. Why? Because\nthey not already spicy, like the pittas so there's that. So I'd have that soup\nwith some seaweed and miso. Yeah. Putting some\nsauerkraut for my carb loading. Because you can, whatever. I don't\neven know how many carbs it is a day. I don't remember. But it's all in the\ne-book you kinda just go by like the, most of it. That's what I found. Because\nI don't, I want to do some numbers, but I also wanted to experience it\nintuitively. So this is my lesson. The more you do it, the more\nintuitive you become. So like problem with the ProLon kit is you don't\nget to access your intuition in that way. So that's like, well\nthat's a problem this way. You do it. And you don't want to\nbe totally like numbers, numbers. You actually want to start to feel\nthe carbs, protein, fat ratio. That's what you're going\nfor is you feel it, feel it, you feel what autophagy feels like. You start to feel what\nketones feel like. Right? So you're developing, you know, a subtler, subtler experience in your\nbody. Oh, which brings up the enema. I told this story, I taught a master\nof you workshop right last two days. And I told this story to my workshop\npeople and the story was something like this. My daughter's like, Oh my\ngosh, we not a normal family. And she's kind of laughing about\nit. And I was like, yeah, I guess. And so where we were was in my\nbathroom and I was doing an enema and I had added some liquid chlorophyll\nto it and the dog and the cat, we have big bathroom. It's\nbeautiful. It's mostly marble. And everybody was in the bathroom.\nIt's like party in the bathroom. Because mom's doing an enema. And then I'm releasing\nthe enema on the toilet. And that's when she told me that we are\nnot a normal family kind of laughing because enemas are pretty normal. I\nmean, it's not something that's like, let's try that. Let's do enemas. It's\nnot like that. But it is like, Oh, someone's in a detox. You\nknow, let's not be surprised. Someone being me really only\nexclusively, I'm the only enema doer, but it's normal for them than I do that. It's normal in the yogahealer community. Like I would say like many\nand advanced Yogidetoxer has a few enemas under their belt. So I was doing that and that\nscintillating Prolon feeling. When you do that or say you do Wim, Hof breathing and you\nstop after and meditate. You're just like, Whoa, this is what energy feels like in\nyour awareness is going from the gross physical body. The annamaya \nkosha into the subtle energy body, the pranamaya kosha. And you're\nstarting to live more from that. So if someone's like, what are the\nbenefits of the fast mimicking diet? I'd be like, well, your awareness moves from\ngross to subtle on all levels and your physical body\nbecause it's, you know, more or less trying to\nfind nutrition within instead of without. So instead of looking outward\nbecause something else is coming in, it starts to look inward. Now someone\nactually just asked this in the challenge, within the challenge,\nnot within the challenge, but just the actual intermittent fasting\nchallenge it's like of gaining weight. She's probably, I'm guessing\nfifties. And I'm like, Oh yeah, because awareness is\ngoing within finding food. But when she's breaking her\nintermittent fast, right. Which she's doing every 24 hours\nin this case too much food. the body's like, wait, no, we\nactually found some stuff in here. We're sort of busy right now. And\nthen you have like a big meal. Because your mind and your emotions.\nLike I need a reward. I need love. I need, need, need, but that's not what you\nknow, that's not what calories are for. Okay. I think like, what else did I eat? Like not really not. Oh, you\nwant to see the olive packs? Okay. So these are the olive\npacks, pitted green olives. Oh I should show you some other high, high carb treats I got for the total\nlimited carbs. This is just all oil, salt, and some, some\nmixes and stuff. So yeah, it's five olives per serving size 25 calories. The beauty of the\nolive is you get high fat, you get high fat. Also\nyou get high sodium. And that's something I also started to\nnotice  because like there's so much sodium naturally. It seemed to me like\nin the FMD or like, you know, broth cubes over a lot of sodium or all\nthose that are marinated or I use some artichokes that were marinated.\nAnd then there's also these crazy. See they have these little and I'm\nnot in the packaging, but I get that. Some people are the packaging.\nBecause it makes the calories easier. This whole package only has 20\ncalories. You get 500 calories a day. So then you're like, what's in it.\nUm, I'm just going to tell you, because the writing is\nway too small, sodium six, six grams of carbs. See the\n20 adds up fast. If it is 20, I'll check it and put it in the notes. It's\ngot some fiber. So then I'm like, Oh, it'd be able to poop. That might be a\nnice 20 calories to have. And that's it. So that's a high, that's a high carb.\nMini-meal right there. If you ever needed, like if you're a biker,\nlike I'm a mountain biker,\nright. If I ever needed like, Oh I picked my carbs up, break\nout one of those bad boys, right. Instead of a power bar, you're\nnot getting many calories. Okay. You're only eight 20 calories. So you\ngot to keep that in mind. And this to me, that's what I had to answer. The\nwoman who was like, you know, basically saying like\nI'm, I'm gaining weight. Which to me means like I\nprobably overeating right\nnow for this phase of dietary transition. There's different tracks. There's different times when\nyou need to eat more for sure. And you want to mix it\nup. You want to mix it up. So you don't always want\nto, you know, be doing, say, you're doing fast mimicking. You don't\nalways want to be doing like a 16, eight. You don't always want to be doing\na 24, which is often, you know, like an OMAD it's like one\nmeal a day plus a snack. I've got to say in fast mimicking, you're going to learn what you want\nyour snacks to be. Because your snacks, when you're an FMD, that's it mini meal. And a mini-meal. Well... You kind of get the picture, like\nyou still want to eat a real meal. You don't really want to eat a snack. Because it's all you get to eat\ntoday and it is fun and it is fun. Right? It is so good for the\nemotional body just to be like, Oh, life is good too and my belly\nis full and that feels nice. So what happened is that by\nlike day three, four, five, your stomach starting to digest\nstomach fat first, you know? And you might be like, I have none.\nI have no stomach fat. And you know, if you're underweight and that's true,\nthen you don't get to do the FMD. That's only for people who\nare at normal body weight. So you've got to get to\nget your body weight up. Can you do that through intermittent\nfasting? Yeah, I have that. I have that ebook on the metabolic types\nand this would be like super Vata type. So you'd be looking at like a 14, 10, maybe three to four mini\nmeals, so Vatas do need more, Kaphas eat less frequently\nin general, in general to gain weight. That's true because otherwise what\nhappens is the Vata overwhelms their agni, their digestive fire. And then\nyou just have like indigestion, which is honestly painful, right? Like you can get gas bubble to like the\npoint where it feels like a real tumor. It's hard as a rock. Not good. That's also why in my FMD, like I really wanted to keep things moving\nand fluid. So adding some, you know, adding a little bit of spice. It's\ngood. If sauerkraut is too cold, Kimchi is nice and hot carb\nloading. I know you called it. All right. So what else? So when you're\nstarting to burn that stomach fat, depending on how much stomach fat\nyou have, like, we have a joke. Me and Andy that like we measure,\nwe measure our stomach fat. So the way you measure your stomach fat, I think I've shown you guys this before, but basically you take your\nhands and to your waistline and you, and you're just like, how\nmuch is there? How much do I have? How much do I have? So this is\na little bit more than I need. So it's an, you want like a good\ninch. So that's maybe just a little bit but you want a little\nbit more, just an inch, just an inch. So if someone\ncan do that and you're like, there's like five inches\nand I'd been there. Like I could probably pinch a few inches, especially not after I just did\na five day FMD. So I'm like, there's a nice time for me to do\nthat for y'all. You know what I mean? Because I'm Pitta Kapha, which\nmeans I tend towards cohesion. My body likes to build it likes\nto gain, not lose. All right. So Kapha eats...  Kapha omads are good talking about mixing it up. Like after FMD and after IF Kaphas can also do like\ndo a 14, 10 throw 14, 10, in every now and then it can\nbe called binge days. Right. And you're just like snacking, Dr.\nMindy Pelz is really good on this. She's on YouTube. I'll put\nthe link in the chat there. We should get her on this podcast\nbecause I think she knows more and she's looking at all the, like\nthe science behind it. And so she knows all the numbers and\nall the things like that super fancy. I would like to find out what\nshe knows about Ayurveda, because I don't know if she knows\nabout the Ghee because if she did, I think she might tell her community\nlike, you know what we should, um, we should try this with just\nghee for our fat calories, because then you're\ndoing pervakarma. Bam, pervakarma comes\nbefore a panchakarma. So I think there's just an enormous\namount of exploration that we as  Ayurvedic practitioners of the world.\nYes. I'm calling on you all. Imagine this, imagine you're\nin yoga health coaching, you're doing the business\nmodel to sell your annual pass. And you include in that four,\nfour guided FMDs a year for your people. Like we're doing it together. Seasonally throwing in five day FMD.\nAnd now if people are underweight, you can have them do intermittent\nfasting and like they, more or less, if they're underweight,\ntheir job is to gain weight. So they'll do that through\nthe good absorption. I already outlined that whole thing.\nThe 14, 10 yada yada a bunch of meals. Mini meals. Yeah. So I think this is\nbig in general. I really do. I think that this will be the\nbiggest differentiator for people This is Ritucharya. So Ritucharya is  the turning of the wheel or the, the\nchange throughout the year. Right?\nThe continual the growth cycle growth  and death cycle, course.\nRight? And death. Why are so  why are people so upset about Death? Sorry that... I don't know. That's\nso obnoxious, but like, I, it's something I'm curious about. If there's anyone that I should talk\nto you about that on the podcast, let me know. Okay. So\nthat was my five-day FMD. Other lessons learned are, um, I have to do this four\ntimes a year. I have to, Oh, I almost forgot to tell you. So\nthere's, there's a variation. There's a variation of the now, so,\nOh yeah. There's a few things I, to tell you. Okay. One is calorie restriction before it was\ncalled fast mimicking diet was called calorie restriction kind of, or\nthey were on the same subset. So FMD would be in this. It would be\na subcategory of calorie restriction. And we've been studying\ncalorie restriction on mice\nand rats for a long time. And it seems to, it seems to be really\ngood if you don't want a chronic disease. That's what they found in\nmice, tougher to get the mouse, to have a chronic disease. If\nthey just reduced their calories, something about like all their metabolisms\nare more efficient and stuff like that. So the five, two. What the five two is two days\na week, you do 500 calories, five days a week. You\ndo whatever you want. So I think that's the other thing I\nlearned is that coming out of my five day, FMD, that lights in a way\nthat I would just like, wow, I wonder if I could, and I\nreally want to do this naturally. Like I want to do this\nfrom the place of like. I feel so good. Like I\njust fall into it like, Oh, it was naturally a 500 calorie day.\nNot like this mind over matter, but I get that. It might need a\nlittle bit of, um, I don't know. I'll, I'll get back to you\non that. When it happens. That's probably the best way to handle\nthat. But that's what it feels like also. So when I went to bed last night,\nI was like, I told Indy, I'm like, I'm so excited to go to bed\nbecause I can eat tomorrow. And then tomorrow is today, right? So\ntoday I'm done or I was done yesterday, but yesterday was day five obviously. And I wake up and I'm like, I don't\nreally want to do anything different. What? seriously! I don't really want to do anything\ndifferent or at least that's how it feels right now. It could wear off\nand I could just be like dive in So I don't really have anything planned. Uh, I read a lot about ketogenesis\nand the ketogenic diet and how doing a five day 500 calories, fast mimicking diet that was ketogenic,\nmeaning like high in fat, low in carbs, low in protein, that it was a really\neasy entry weight in to eating more keto. Keto sounds like aikido and they\nhave nothing to do with each other, but maybe they do. So\nwe'll see what happens. Um, I'm guessing, I mean, I have a track record with this, right? I've been leading the yogidetox\nsince 2002, at least twice a year. So I have some history with doing  Such things like this. I think it was pretty bumpy\nafter I ate the ProLon. What happened after the ProLon... Actually,\nthat's an interesting conversation. So after the ProLon kit, I, I went into what was more or less. I like\ngot triggered into about a month long. Kitchery cleanse with\nlike a lot of green juice. Because I was leading the Yogidetox after\nI did that whole five day thing. So I did like the five day thing and\nthere was like a week break and I was just sort of eating, I don't know,\ncleansyish food soups, soups. Kitchery so soupy, soupy foods\nand maybe some wild red smoothies. So I get these service berries on\nmy, I picked berries for hours. At least I did this August gallons and\ngallons and gallons of service berries. And a lot of people don't know\nabout the service bearing. Like they think it's not a great fruit\nbecause it's really high in pectin. So it's not, it's not like a\nblueberry. And if you're like, I want the service Berry\nto be the blueberry, then you're going to be disappointed\nbecause the service berries is a service berry, I'd rather have service berries\nthan blueberries because they are way more powerful, like wild\nfood versus conventional food. It's like, do you want your\nfriends wild or conventional? And you gotta be careful if your\nfriends are too conventional. Because that gets really boring. So that's kind of how I\nfeel about service berries. So I had some of those smoothies and\nsome soups and some kitchery and that was more or less the month of October in the\nmiddle of that. I did deep panchakarma, like crazy pants. Um, and on those days I was just juicing\nor basically eating medicine, which is, you know, if your body's used to it, good.\nIt had been awhile since I'd done it. And I was like, Oh right. It's detox time. And when you're in it, you're in it. And that's the beauty of panchakarma\nis it just sucks you into the experience of softening to release, which is, it's a totally different state of\nbeing and you know, as Westerners, it's not like you're taught\nhow to that very well, unless you've gone looking\nhard for it. All right. And that brings me to courses. Yeah. I know. I teach courses.\nI've taught courses. Well, since 2002, it started off with classes and then it\nbecame courses and then it became big courses. And so now we have\ncourses that range from 5k to 15K most of our members. And I say most because I haven't\ntalked to every single one of them, but it does seem like all  are thrilled that they got on the\ninside of the community, that like, it became a part of their life\nand the return on investment being phenomenal in, in priceless aspects. So that's in general, the feedback\nI get from course members. And I'm not saying that\nto Pat myself on the back, it's kind of annoying to have to\neven talk about it. But I get that. You don't know what it's like on the\ninside, unless you're on the inside. And it's hard to get in the inside unless\nyou're willing to buck up because I believe in skin in the game, right.\nIf I'm committed, you're committed. It's the only way that's going to\nwork. Because that's an equal sign. Now we can make an\nexchange. That's just basic. It's as basic as\neconomics gets. All right. So courses, uh, body thrive.\nThat's our habits course. It's our cutting edge. Like people who really want to\nbe living the habits of  ayurveda and yoga and see\nwhat happens and being in a, basically a little it's\nlike being in a think tank, but it's for your body and\nyour mind and your spirit. So you're in there and it's\nlike, it's going forward. Like I think tank goes forward. Like they look back and they look\nforward and they know what's going on. And that's it. That's like, uh, it's\nincredibly supportive. I've seen, I mean, when it started out, like\nI, I was surprised you showed up. And that was 2013 was my first\ntime coaching body thrive. And over time I find it's like,\nit's continually all levels. My first group was all levels. And\nmy current group is all levels. And by all levels, I mean like the people have been\nteaching yoga for 30 years and meditating and someone, who's no idea what meditation\nand yoga really is. Right. But it has back pain and\nhas a chronic disease or an autoimmune disease, or is worried that\nthey might get that. Because they don't feel very good. It's been a long\ntime since they felt really good. And they might give up on feeling\nreally good and that's not worth it. So that's body thrive... Living ayurveda. 2007. Yup. It was the year\nI got pregnant with indie and I was in Sally Kempton's\nchief of sutures course with some homeys. That was pretty amazing.\nAnd I saw this woman you know, demonstrate this online teaching\nbusiness model and the Vedic tradition. And I was in the Vedic tradition with\nayurveda and yoga. And I was like, she's rocking it. She's smart. She's\nwritten a bunch of books on meditation, but she was a Swami in\nIndia for like 20, 30 years. And before that she was a writer in\nManhattan for like, I don't know, like the modern equivalent of GQ. She was this just like hip\ncool woman had a couple of decades on me. And I watched her\ndo this business model. I was like, that's amazing. So I grew that over the years and that's\nyoga health coaching where we take body thrive, plus a business model that works,\nthat just works for leading a journey. That's where I was talking about like\nthe four FMDs a year for the yoga health coaching. Like I'm going to\nbe teaching that that's important. This is important. This is\nnext level. Humans need this. Like if, if you have a friend that has an\nautoimmune condition or is diagnosed with cancer or stressed out and you're\nnoticing like it's not good for them like that, it's important. It's\nimportant to get control and change. So the healer's course that's living\nayurveda that teach body thrive and teach an annual pass and teach whatever\nit is that you're really good at teaching. And really want a guided\njourney. That's yoga health coaching. That's two years, that's\n15K. And then our it's interesting master of\nyou. So it's that workshop. And this is where you're like,\nwhat, what exactly are my goals? Like no messing around\nmulti-dimensional goals, all that. And how do I\nmake them happen now? Like let's get on it. So that's the\nmaster of you and it's intense. Um, obviously, and it's two years and it's\n15K and it includes these workshops. You actually gets six of these\nimplementation workshops, plus all the weekly lessons\nand the coaching and part\nof the community. And like, you're on the journey. Like\nthis is what we're doing. So that's, I think that's it. I\nthink I just covered all the courses. That's all I have to talk about\nthat. So thanks for, um, for being, I guess, curious of what\nelse kind of, you know, it's like what kind of education\nyou might be needing, like needing, I don't even go with wanting, right? Because like you might not get your wants\nmet, but you better get your needs met. And if you need to grow and you need to\npeople that are growing and are thriving and are learning and are\nchanging and evolving, right. And that's the big one are evolving, then there's there's pockets\nwhere that's done well pockets. If you stumble upon one,\nget on the inside of that because everything changes after\nthat. And the change is good. It's good for you, but it's good\nfor all the people around you. All right. Well, I'm Cate Stillman signing off\nthe yoga healer and here in Wyoming, I hope you enjoyed my pantry\nkitchen episode teaching. I don't know what that\nwas. Catch you later.", "z84GCy5m_YY": "As I read my 10th book, I thought, My gosh, this\u00a0\nis powerful knowledge and science based. Somebody\u00a0\u00a0 needs to tell the world about this. And I\u00a0\nhad no background, no nutrition training,\u00a0\u00a0 but I'm a very passionate person. And I know I can\u00a0\nlearn things quickly. So I thought, you know what,\u00a0\u00a0 I'm gonna do whatever I can. So I gave up my 25\u00a0\nyear corporate career, I went back I thought,\u00a0\u00a0 well, I don't have time for a registered\u00a0\ndietitian degree. I already have two. So I\u00a0\u00a0 went to the Institute for integrative nutrition\u00a0\nin New York City, which gave me a certificate\u00a0\u00a0 in health coaching. So it wasn't the deepest\u00a0\nknowledge, but it was enough to get started.\u00a0\u00a0 And from that, I actually put a curriculum\u00a0\ntogether teaching plant based nutrition. Welcome to the Plant Based DFW Podcast weekly\u00a0\nshow with Dr. Riz and Maya. Our podcast focuses on\u00a0\u00a0 lifestyle medicine, which is the use of evidence\u00a0\nbased lifestyle therapeutic approaches, such as a\u00a0\u00a0 whole food, plant based diet, regular physical\u00a0\nexercise, adequate sleep and stress management\u00a0\u00a0 to treat and even reverse the lifestyle related\u00a0\nchronic diseases that are all too prevalent.\u00a0\u00a0 Every week, we will feature physicians,\u00a0\ndietitians, health coaches and everyday\u00a0\u00a0 people who will share those stories and speak\u00a0\non one of these lifestyle medicine modalities.\u00a0\u00a0 All right, well, in Episode 101, we are\u00a0\ngoing to learn about all things algae.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm really excited about this guest because\u00a0\nlast year I featured a mushroom expert,\u00a0\u00a0 who told us about all the reasons why we\u00a0\nshould be consuming mushrooms. In this episode,\u00a0\u00a0 you'll learn why algae is good for you, where\u00a0\ndoes it come from why you should consume it.\u00a0\u00a0 And also we will be given the 20% discount code\u00a0\nin case you are interested in trying it out.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, I was given a package of the energy bits that\u00a0\nI was able to try with my smoothies in the morning\u00a0\u00a0 and I did enjoy it. However, this is not meant\u00a0\nto be a meal replace or we never encouraged to\u00a0\u00a0 replace actual whole plant based foods with any\u00a0\nsort of supplement or capsules. We encourage you\u00a0\u00a0 to eat foods as they are and eat a lot of green\u00a0\nleafy vegetables. But if you are interested in\u00a0\u00a0 some of the benefits that ENERGYbits can offer,\u00a0\nyou definitely give them a try. Let's meet today's\u00a0\u00a0 podcast guest. Today we will be speaking with\u00a0\nCatharine Arnston. She's an algae wellness expert.\u00a0\u00a0 She's the founder and CEO of energy bits. We're\u00a0\ngoing to learn how she got started on this algae\u00a0\u00a0 journey. We're also going to learn about the\u00a0\nbenefits of consuming algae for immune health,\u00a0\u00a0 for energy for recovery for endurance. Also,\u00a0\nif you're fasting or you want to lose weight,\u00a0\u00a0 algae can be absolutely beneficial. Even if\u00a0\nyou're already plant based, there are things\u00a0\u00a0 that we might be lacking. And so welcome,\u00a0\nCatharine, thank you for joining us today. Thank you for having me here. And I'm sure algae\u00a0\nis going to be pretty new to most people, the only\u00a0\u00a0 familiarity they may have is that they\u00a0\nsee it in their floating in their aquarium\u00a0\u00a0 or they see it washing up on shore. And\u00a0\nI'm going to help you understand why you\u00a0\u00a0 don't want to eat those types. But the ones\u00a0\nthat you do want to eat and why they will\u00a0\u00a0 level up every single part of your body, your\u00a0\nhealth, your nutrition in a fast and simple\u00a0\u00a0 and easy and scientifically proven\u00a0\nway. So it's it's great to be here. Before we get started with all things,\u00a0\u00a0 algae, tell us a little bit about yourself and\u00a0\nwhether you have a background in nutrition. I'm actually Canadian, but I've lived in\u00a0\nBoston 33 years, and I was doing International.\u00a0\u00a0 I have an MBA in international business. So\u00a0\nI was doing international corporate work,\u00a0\u00a0 nothing to do with nutrition. And 12 years ago, my\u00a0\nyounger sister in Canada, develop breast cancer.\u00a0\u00a0 Now she's completely fine. She's 10 years cancer\u00a0\nfree. So I just want to assure everybody that\u00a0\u00a0 so it was a very good outcome. They're wondering,\u00a0\nas she was preparing for her chemo, her oncologist\u00a0\u00a0 recommended she changed her diet to an alkaline\u00a0\ndiet. Now, they didn't tell her what an alkaline\u00a0\u00a0 diet was or why it was good for her. But at\u00a0\nleast they told her what to do it. And so when\u00a0\u00a0 she got home, the first thing she did was call\u00a0\nme Not that I knew anything about nutrition,\u00a0\u00a0 but I'm a really good researcher and I love\u00a0\nmy sister. So I said I have no idea what\u00a0\u00a0 this alkaline diet stuff is, but I will find\u00a0\nout and we will get through this together.\u00a0\u00a0 So to the internet, I went to the library, I\u00a0\nwent remember those things called libraries.\u00a0\u00a0 And I researched alkaline diet, and it turned out\u00a0\nto be mostly a plant based diet because of all the\u00a0\u00a0 chlorophyll and the phytonutrients that have been\u00a0\nscientifically proven to build your immune system.\u00a0\u00a0 And of course, she's gonna go into the chemo. So\u00a0\nher oncologist wanted her to have a strong immune\u00a0\u00a0 system. So she did go through chemo and 10 years\u00a0\nlater, as I mentioned, she's still cancer free now\u00a0\u00a0 in the process of helping her. I started reading\u00a0\nmore about plant based nutrition. Now this was\u00a0\u00a0 12 years ago, and nobody was talking about\u00a0\nplant based nutrition like they are now now it's\u00a0\u00a0 mainstream, thank goodness. And as I read my 10th\u00a0\nbook, I thought my gosh This is powerful knowledge\u00a0\u00a0 and science based. Somebody needs to tell the\u00a0\nworld about this. And I had no background,\u00a0\u00a0 no nutrition training, but I'm a very passionate\u00a0\nperson. And I know I can learn things quickly. So\u00a0\u00a0 I thought, you know what, I'm gonna do whatever\u00a0\nI can. So I gave up my 25 year corporate career,\u00a0\u00a0 I went back, I thought, well, I don't have\u00a0\ntime for a registered dieticians degree,\u00a0\u00a0 I already have two. So I went to the Institute\u00a0\nfor integrative nutrition in New York City, which\u00a0\u00a0 gave me a certificate in health coaching. So it's\u00a0\nwasn't the deepest knowledge, but it was enough\u00a0\u00a0 to get started. And from that, I actually put a\u00a0\ncurriculum together teaching plant based nutrition\u00a0\u00a0 at corporations. And I did that for almost a year.\u00a0\nAnd I gave my workshops for free. Now, the reason\u00a0\u00a0 I mentioned this is because this is when I had my\u00a0\nepiphany that led me to algae. So my epiphany was\u00a0\u00a0 this, as I was teaching plant based nutrition, and\u00a0\nthe importance of it. And there's statistics that\u00a0\u00a0 showed it 97% of North Americans do not eat the\u00a0\nrequired amount of vegetables, or fiber 97%. I\u00a0\u00a0 mean, that's a big number. So as I was teaching\u00a0\npeople the importance of vegetables and salads,\u00a0\u00a0 they said to us said to me, we know we should\u00a0\neat more vegetables, but the reality is, it's\u00a0\u00a0 too hard. They didn't have the time, they are too\u00a0\nheavy to carry over to the grocery store. And they\u00a0\u00a0 took too much space in their fridge, too much too\u00a0\nlong, too clean, too long to cook too long to eat,\u00a0\u00a0 their kids wouldn't even their husbands would eat\u00a0\nand so on endless numbers of barriers. And so I\u00a0\u00a0 thought to myself, okay, I've seen the science,\u00a0\nI know the importance of plant based nutrition.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet if I can't get people to eat more vegetables,\u00a0\nhow am I going to help them be healthier, because\u00a0\u00a0 the reason we're getting sick is two reasons\u00a0\nwe either don't have the nutrients we need,\u00a0\u00a0 or and or we have too many toxins in our\u00a0\nbodies and plants will help correct both\u00a0\u00a0 of those situations. So I thought, Okay, I\u00a0\nhave to find something that's fast and easy,\u00a0\u00a0 and alkaline, and nutrient dense, that will\u00a0\nhelp people. So I went back to everything I\u00a0\u00a0 found for my sister the previous couple of years,\u00a0\nnothing was working, nothing was working. And then\u00a0\u00a0 when I got to the algae, it was like Alice in\u00a0\nWonderland falling down the rabbit hole. Because\u00a0\u00a0 algae is the most alkaline food in the world box\u00a0\nchecked out. Algae has the highest concentration\u00a0\u00a0 of chlorophyll. chlorophyll is what makes plants\u00a0\ngreen. And we're going to talk about chlorophyll\u00a0\u00a0 I hope and a little bit more detail, because I'm\u00a0\ngoing to tell you some really cool things about\u00a0\u00a0 chlorophyll that I'm sure you don't know about.\u00a0\nSo it has, it has 1000 times more chlorophyll than\u00a0\u00a0 Chinese greens 200 times more than spinach. It is\u00a0\nthe most nutrient dense food in the world. That's\u00a0\u00a0 not my opinion. That's a quote from NASA. NASA\u00a0\nsays algae has 1000 times more nutrients than any\u00a0\u00a0 other fruit or vegetable, one to 1000. Ladies and\u00a0\ngentlemen, that's what I call efficient nutrition.\u00a0\u00a0 And algae has been studied. It's the most studied\u00a0\nfood in the world. The problem is all these\u00a0\u00a0 scientists like to talk to other scientists,\u00a0\nright? All these PhDs, they don't know how to\u00a0\u00a0 talk to mere mortals like you and me, which is\u00a0\nactually why I did the thing that I didn't know\u00a0\u00a0 anything about nutrition because everything I\u00a0\ndo, I love science, but I everything I write and\u00a0\u00a0 design everything. And I'm the Chief Scientific\u00a0\nOfficer, so I do these deep dives, to help you\u00a0\u00a0 understand them in a way that's much more\u00a0\nsimple. And I've got some great stories to\u00a0\u00a0 tell you today about that. So a alkaline nutrient\u00a0\ndense, scientifically based, endorsed by NASA,\u00a0\u00a0 oh, also endorsed by the United Nations as\u00a0\nthe answer to world hunger because as three\u00a0\u00a0 times the amount of protein and steak three times,\u00a0\nright, all in amino acid and it's been used for\u00a0\u00a0 1000s of years. In Asia. It's a multi billion\u00a0\ndollar agricultural crop. Now you may be\u00a0\u00a0 surprised to know that algae is not a supplement.\u00a0\nIt is a food. It's no different than kale or\u00a0\u00a0 broccoli. I've got a picture here of an LG farms\u00a0\na spirulina farm. And so all we do is we grow\u00a0\u00a0 it in fresh water. And then we air dry it and\u00a0\npress it into little tablets that we call bits\u00a0\u00a0 because they're bits of food that you can add to\u00a0\nspinach or salads or trail mix or whatever. But\u00a0\u00a0 so it's been used for 15 years where it's a multi,\u00a0\nit's almost as big as the beef industry is here.\u00a0\u00a0 So the only problem is with algae, people in North\u00a0\nAmerica didn't know about it and the quality was\u00a0\u00a0 really poor. So nobody branded it properly. Nobody\u00a0\nhad packaged properly. It's been sold in really\u00a0\u00a0 Asian looking packages in America for 15 years.\u00a0\nLike why would you buy that it doesn't give you\u00a0\u00a0 any explanation about what it is or why it's good\u00a0\nfor you. So I decided after I'd seen the science,\u00a0\u00a0 I'd seen how it helps people because it will help\u00a0\nyour energy, your immune system, weight loss, your\u00a0\u00a0 skin your digestion. I mean, there's nothing that\u00a0\nstuff doesn't do that, okay. I'm going to spend\u00a0\u00a0 the rest of my life helping People understand what\u00a0\nalgae is, why they need it, why it will help them,\u00a0\u00a0 their children, the environment. And I'll make\u00a0\nsure it's high quality because up until now,\u00a0\u00a0 most of it came from China and the quality was\u00a0\npoor. And so I can talk to you more about why\u00a0\u00a0 ours is the most nutrient dense, safe, pure, we\u00a0\ndo third party lab tests, we only sell through\u00a0\u00a0 doctors in our website. So it's pretty exciting.\u00a0\nI'm 11 years in, I probably have at least another\u00a0\u00a0 11 years to go. But, you know, I, the analogy\u00a0\nI make is, you know, there's a company called\u00a0\u00a0 vital proteins. And they're, they're known for\u00a0\ncollagen. And let's face it until about five or\u00a0\u00a0 six years ago, nobody knew about collagen, until\u00a0\nvital proteins found a way to help explain it.\u00a0\u00a0 People two years ago, didn't know about\u00a0\nstevia, they didn't know about matcha,\u00a0\u00a0 keela. These are all foods that are very\u00a0\ninstrumental in improving your health. They're not\u00a0\u00a0 supplements, they're not made in factories.\u00a0\nThey're they're food based, and ours is plant\u00a0\u00a0 food based. So I'm particularly proud to be the\u00a0\nspokesperson for algae. I can't take any credit\u00a0\u00a0 for algae, that's Mother Nature. But I will\u00a0\ntell you, I've done my very best to make it\u00a0\u00a0 less weird. And to help people we do all\u00a0\nthe packaging make it really attractive. So\u00a0\u00a0 so but it's all science based. I don't tell you\u00a0\nanything. I don't have the research to back it up. Did you visit any of the farms in Asia\u00a0\nwhile you were doing your research? No, I, when I started the company, you I gave\u00a0\nup my career and I didn't have an income. And\u00a0\u00a0 I do fortunately have a really great partner who\u00a0\nhas been working with algae for probably 30 years.\u00a0\u00a0 And he's visited the farms in Asia, including the\u00a0\nones that that we used to grow our algae. In fact,\u00a0\u00a0 he married we got ours in Taiwan, he married\u00a0\na Taiwanese woman, I do plan to go there,\u00a0\u00a0 hopefully this year. And we'll do a video tour\u00a0\nand all that sort of stuff. But I didn't have the\u00a0\u00a0 money or the time to visit. And when I had\u00a0\nsuch an expert already, by my side advising me,\u00a0\u00a0 when you're building a company, there's so\u00a0\nmany things that you have to do whether it's\u00a0\u00a0 you know, education, science, supply chain\u00a0\npackaging, hiring marketing's the social media,\u00a0\u00a0 you can't do it all. So you have to learn to\u00a0\ndelegate to people who have the skill set,\u00a0\u00a0 you don't. So this gentleman has the skill\u00a0\nset I don't. And I've relied on him, you know,\u00a0\u00a0 for ever since we started to be my eyes and\u00a0\nears about the the actual production process of\u00a0\u00a0 growing algae and selecting the best, highest\u00a0\nreputable certified companies to grow ours. So you were on Shark Tank discussing\u00a0\nenergy. What was that? Like?\u00a0\u00a0 Did you benefit from any of the exposure? And\u00a0\nhow difficult was it to get on Shark Tank? I'm not someone who actually seeks the\u00a0\nlimelight. I'm just I just want to make\u00a0\u00a0 a difference in the world. And frankly, all\u00a0\nI wanted to do it first was help my sister.\u00a0\u00a0 And I did that. And I thought well, I can help a\u00a0\nfew more people. And then I did that, and I could\u00a0\u00a0 help a few more. So I'm not. So when people I must\u00a0\nhave had hundreds of people tell me you should be\u00a0\u00a0 on Shark Tank. And Okay, finally all apply. And I\u00a0\ndidn't do anything special. I just went online and\u00a0\u00a0 submitted my materials. And it was it was like\u00a0\na full time job getting on there because of the\u00a0\u00a0 documentation I had to provide. And the videos\u00a0\nI was interviewed every week for six weeks. And,\u00a0\u00a0 you know, it's they say it's harder to get on\u00a0\nto Shark Tank than it is to get into the Harvard\u00a0\u00a0 Business School. So I was proud to have been\u00a0\nselected. But I didn't want their money because\u00a0\u00a0 these people are big egos. And when you're an\u00a0\nentrepreneur who has a big vision to change the\u00a0\u00a0 world, I didn't want another someone's ego, you\u00a0\nknow, coming between me and my vision. So, but I\u00a0\u00a0 did want visibility. So I when I got selected, I\u00a0\nleft the opportunity. And it's it's true that the\u00a0\u00a0 judges don't know anything about you until the\u00a0\nmoment you're in front of them. You're always\u00a0\u00a0 working with the producers up to that stage.\u00a0\nAnd so I knew they weren't going to understand\u00a0\u00a0 algae because frankly, I was it was taped almost\u00a0\nthree years ago that we've aired me 25 times.\u00a0\u00a0 So I continue people recognize me wherever I\u00a0\ngo. I think it's my fancy pink glasses, but\u00a0\u00a0 I knew they weren't gonna understand. So I was\u00a0\nactually not afraid which usually I you know,\u00a0\u00a0 quite nervous but wasn't didn't have any fear\u00a0\nthere because I didn't want what they had to\u00a0\u00a0 offer. So, you know, when they they laughed at me\u00a0\nsaying it tasted terrible and you know, spirulina\u00a0\u00a0 I will admit does not taste very good, but I chew\u00a0\nmine, and you can swallow it and we're gonna talk\u00a0\u00a0 about spirulina and the other one is chlorella.\u00a0\nWe're going to talk about the differences.\u00a0\u00a0 But there's nothing that will give\u00a0\nyou more nutrition, more energy, more\u00a0\u00a0 health benefits, then spirulina or chlorella so\u00a0\nwhen they choose them, I said, don't you And that,\u00a0\u00a0 you know, things just went downhill after that\u00a0\nthey said, no one's gonna buy this and, and\u00a0\u00a0 they said, We don't think you're in love\u00a0\nwith being an entrepreneur, you're just in\u00a0\u00a0 love with algae. And my response to that was,\u00a0\nwell, if you knew as much about algae as I do,\u00a0\u00a0 you'd be in love with algae too. So, so overall,\u00a0\nthe experience was good for me, because I got\u00a0\u00a0 exactly what I wanted. I got on the show, they\u00a0\naired my segments, and they continued to aerate.\u00a0\u00a0 And so it helps people become a little bit\u00a0\nmore familiar with algae with me with our\u00a0\u00a0 brand. We've gone through, you know, five new\u00a0\nwebsites since then three or four new packaging\u00a0\u00a0 designs. And we're in a much better place now\u00a0\nthan we were then. But I still wouldn't take\u00a0\u00a0 their money even if they've knocked on my door\u00a0\ntoday. Because I've defied the odds. I was just\u00a0\u00a0 actually on an entrepreneur. Call recently, and\u00a0\n80% of companies fail within the first two years.\u00a0\u00a0 And something like point 00001% make it to\u00a0\n10 years. Well, we're in our 11th year. And\u00a0\u00a0 I've grown slowly, because I wanted to do it\u00a0\nright. I wanted to do it carefully. I wanted to\u00a0\u00a0 teach people, I wanted to be sure they knew we\u00a0\nweren't selling them something that was weird,\u00a0\u00a0 or unscientifically documented. And and so\u00a0\nbasically, I had to earn people's trust.\u00a0\u00a0 And that takes time. It's like love, it just\u00a0\ntakes time. And because I'm a lifer, and I,\u00a0\u00a0 this is my dream, this is my path. This\u00a0\nis my joy. I'm okay with it taking time. Definitely. But um, I'm sure it also helped\u00a0\ngive you a little bit more exposure. Right? That's give me a lot of credibility, because\u00a0\nit is very difficult to get on the show. Yeah,\u00a0\u00a0 so. So who knows, maybe one day, we'll have me\u00a0\nback. And it'll be what happened to, you know,\u00a0\u00a0 so and so. And I'll be able to say, well, we're\u00a0\n$100 million company now and blah, blah, blah, so\u00a0\u00a0 And the only reason I would want to be that large\u00a0\nis so that we can help we can do more with our\u00a0\u00a0 money. I want to start a foundation. I'm kind of\u00a0\nfollowing what Daniel Lipinski did with Kind Bars,\u00a0\u00a0 getting a you know, a healthier product\u00a0\nout to the market, in our case, healthiest\u00a0\u00a0 probably in the world, but also to create a\u00a0\nfoundation that can make help with change,\u00a0\u00a0 bringing better nutrition knowledge to larger\u00a0\ngroups of people, whether it's children or,\u00a0\u00a0 and donate the product to disaster areas, and\u00a0\nwherever we feel there's a need so so I do have\u00a0\u00a0 some bigger visions than\u00a0\njust selling stuff. Right? What is algae and why don't we know about it? So as I mentioned, algae is a food.\u00a0\nIt's a food category. It's not a fruit,\u00a0\u00a0 and it's not a vegetable, it's its own category.\u00a0\nAnd within that overall category, there are two\u00a0\u00a0 types of algae. One is called macro algae, and\u00a0\nthe other one is called micro algae. Now macro\u00a0\u00a0 algae is that big stringy stuff that you see\u00a0\nwashing up on shore, also known as seaweed,\u00a0\u00a0 kelp, dulse. And macro algae has a lot of fiber\u00a0\nand iodine. So it has some very good reasons\u00a0\u00a0 for you to be eating it. But it actually does not\u00a0\nhave a lot of nutrition. And we're not going to be\u00a0\u00a0 talking about backdoor algae. But I do want you to\u00a0\nbe aware that it's still part of the same family.\u00a0\u00a0 What we're talking about is micro algae. Now\u00a0\nit's called micro because it's microscopic in\u00a0\u00a0 size. Something like 100 of the micro algae cells\u00a0\nwould fit on the head of a pin. It's that tiny,\u00a0\u00a0 you can't see this unless you have a microscope.\u00a0\nSo and this and micro algae is everywhere. It's in\u00a0\u00a0 the oceans, the lakes, the rivers, the soil. Yes,\u00a0\nyour swimming pool. Yes, your aquarium. And it's\u00a0\u00a0 what feeds the fish when it sees the Oh, it's the\u00a0\nsoils, the plants, the whales, and all of those,\u00a0\u00a0 and there's probably 30,000 or 40,000 strains of\u00a0\nmicro algae. Now the only two that are harvested\u00a0\u00a0 as food crops for human consumption are the two\u00a0\nthat we're going to be talking today about. One\u00a0\u00a0 is called spirulina, and it's known as a blue\u00a0\ngreen algae because it has two pigments in it.\u00a0\u00a0 One is chlorophyll that everybody knows\u00a0\nabout. And the other one is a blue pigment\u00a0\u00a0 called phi cosine. And we're not going to talk\u00a0\ntoo much about phycocyanins, but it has lots of\u00a0\u00a0 great healing properties. But that's what makes\u00a0\nspirulina a blue green algae. The other algae\u00a0\u00a0 type is chlorella. And it is a green algae.\u00a0\nAnd it only has one pigment in it called\u00a0\u00a0 chlorophyll. So but these are not grown in the\u00a0\nocean. It doesn't matter whether you go Please\u00a0\u00a0 don't buy your algae but maybe you will at Target\u00a0\nor or you know, Costco that algae I can almost\u00a0\u00a0 promise you is good. In China with less careful\u00a0\ncare and attention to the growing conditions,\u00a0\u00a0 it might have toxins in it, but nonetheless,\u00a0\nit's always gonna be spirulina and chlorella.\u00a0\u00a0 And as I mentioned, they they're spirulina. Well\u00a0\nboth of them grow in freshwater. And then we we\u00a0\u00a0 don't we are water is triple filtered Spring\u00a0\nMountain water that the reason I mentioned\u00a0\u00a0 that is because algae will absorb whatever's\u00a0\nin the water. So it needs to be really clean,\u00a0\u00a0 and ours is really clean. And then we air dry it\u00a0\nwe don't we don't use high heat other companies do\u00a0\u00a0 because high heat kills the enzymes. And\u00a0\nthen we pack it into little tiny tablets\u00a0\u00a0 that we call bits. Because they're, they're\u00a0\nbits of food that you can either swallow add to\u00a0\u00a0 smoothies, I want to show you what they look like\u00a0\nspirulina is a blue green algae that's this one.\u00a0\u00a0 And chlorella is a green algae we call our\u00a0\nspirulina ENERGYbits. Because spirulina is known\u00a0\u00a0 to give you energy, focus, insurance satisfies\u00a0\nyour hunger. Why you may ask? Well, it's because\u00a0\u00a0 spirulina has the highest concentration\u00a0\nof protein in the world, as I mentioned,\u00a0\u00a0 as three times the amount of protein in steak,\u00a0\nanimal proteins about 20%, spirulina, 64. And\u00a0\u00a0 spirulina is technically a bacteria. This is what\u00a0\nand so why is that important, you may ask? Well,\u00a0\u00a0 because there is no cellulous wall for your body\u00a0\nto have to break down to get access to the aminos\u00a0\u00a0 it gets into your bloodstream almost instantly\u00a0\nis the fastest of absorbed food in the world.\u00a0\u00a0 This is why endurance athletes love it so much,\u00a0\nbecause that gives them that it's got done 18\u00a0\u00a0 of the 20 amino, so it's it's a complete amino,\u00a0\nit's a complete protein that has all the ones your\u00a0\u00a0 body can't make. And it has all the B vitamins B\u00a0\nvitamins convert glucose and protein into energy.\u00a0\u00a0 It's loaded with boron, which helps with your\u00a0\nbrain thought. It's loaded with essential fatty\u00a0\u00a0 acids like omega three, which helps us reduce\u00a0\ninflammation and help again with your brain site.\u00a0\u00a0 And it's what's called a vasodilator releases\u00a0\nnitric oxide, which opens up your blood vessels,\u00a0\u00a0 so that blood and oxygen and nutrients can\u00a0\nflow faster to your brain to your muscles\u00a0\u00a0 to wherever you need. So that's why and between\u00a0\nthe essential fatty acids in the high protein,\u00a0\u00a0 it satisfies your hunger. So people use this for\u00a0\nintermittent fasting. They use it for weight loss,\u00a0\u00a0 there's only one calorie per tablet. So you\u00a0\ncould have maybe four or five in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0 Five calories, helps you with your hunger,\u00a0\nget you started for your day doesn't increase\u00a0\u00a0 your glucose does not decrease your ketones. And\u00a0\nwhere else can you go to get rid of your hunger,\u00a0\u00a0 your cravings and still get all your nutrients\u00a0\nbecause there's 40 vitamins and minerals. In\u00a0\u00a0 algae. This is a replacement. This is a food based\u00a0\nreplacement for most of your supplements. You\u00a0\u00a0 can get rid of your multivitamin, your fish oil,\u00a0\nyour co q 10, magnesium, potassium, calcium, all\u00a0\u00a0 the algae and algae is food so your body absorbs\u00a0\nall of it or 99.9% of it. So it's very efficient\u00a0\u00a0 nutrition. So most people take their spirulina\u00a0\nin the morning in the afternoon anytime they're\u00a0\u00a0 hungry, tired, just pop a couple of tablets, you\u00a0\ncan swallow them if you don't like the flavor,\u00a0\u00a0 have them before a workout. It they're safe for\u00a0\nall ages, children, newborns, pregnant moms,\u00a0\u00a0 nursing moms, granddad's pets, are your pets have\u00a0\nloved them. And pets are smart animals are smart.\u00a0\u00a0 So so that's spirulina, very energizing. Now\u00a0\nremember, there are no cat, there's no caffeine,\u00a0\u00a0 chemicals or sugar, no stimulants. So the energy\u00a0\nyou feel isn't like lightning bolts from the sky,\u00a0\u00a0 you're not going to be like Superwoman, Neo,\u00a0\nleaping off at all about love building in a single\u00a0\u00a0 bound. But the way you will feel is we call,\u00a0\nit's the best way to describe and you feel fresh,\u00a0\u00a0 you feel like you just had a great night's sleep,\u00a0\nyou had a nice walk in the cold air, you're alert,\u00a0\u00a0 and you're ready. That's how you will feel nothing\u00a0\nmore. You might not even notice that except\u00a0\u00a0 you'll notice that you aren't tired or hungry\u00a0\nanymore. You know, that's pretty good to me. So how soon will we notice any improvements? Yes, that's a good, good question. With the\u00a0\nspirulina because it satisfies your hunger.\u00a0\u00a0 You will notice it soon as it gets into your\u00a0\nbloodstream. If you chew it within a couple\u00a0\u00a0 of minutes, if you swallow it, maybe 10 or 15.\u00a0\nThat's all and you'll notice that every single\u00a0\u00a0 time it's not like a drug, we have to build up\u00a0\na tolerance. It's not like you have to take more\u00a0\u00a0 than next time. Some people if you're very anemic,\u00a0\none or two tablets might make the difference.\u00a0\u00a0 If you're a high performance athlete, you might\u00a0\nneed closer To 20 or 30, to feel the difference,\u00a0\u00a0 we feel NHL teams and they put 75 of the tablets\u00a0\ninto their smoothie before a game because they\u00a0\u00a0 need that energy on the ice for those fast spurts,\u00a0\nand then they put 75 chlorella tablets recovery\u00a0\u00a0 bits into their smoothie after the game, because\u00a0\nit pulls out toxins including lactic acid. So\u00a0\u00a0 it's because it's food, you only you will know\u00a0\nwhat you need. I tell people, some people are full\u00a0\u00a0 on a small salad. Some people need a larger salad.\u00a0\nYeah, there's no upper limit, because it's just\u00a0\u00a0 food. I personally have about 100 chlorella\u00a0\ntablets a day, just because I love them so much,\u00a0\u00a0 and I snack on them. And we'll tell you some of\u00a0\nthe benefits of chlorella in a few minutes. But okay, so you start off your\u00a0\nday with the spirulina. Yeah, I would, you know, try five or 10. You know,\u00a0\nif you want to, you could start with lower if you\u00a0\u00a0 wanted, we sell them in large bags on our website\u00a0\nlike this, there's 1000 tablets in a bag. And\u00a0\u00a0 if you took 10 a day, and by the way, in these\u00a0\nbags, we give you a little tin, so you can fill\u00a0\u00a0 it up and carry it around with you. So you always\u00a0\nhave some when you're shopping or hiking or doing\u00a0\u00a0 anything. But if you took 10 a day, a bag would\u00a0\nlast two, three months. And I don't want people\u00a0\u00a0 to get sticker shock because a bag is $120. But\u00a0\nwe have a discount 20% discount code we're gonna\u00a0\u00a0 share at the end with her immunity. And I want you\u00a0\nto know, we took that quote from NASA that says,\u00a0\u00a0 one gram of algae has the equivalent\u00a0\nnutrition of 1000 grams of vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0 So I did the math and figured out one bag of\u00a0\nour algae has the same nutrition as 551 pounds\u00a0\u00a0 of vegetables. Now, that's 551 pounds that you\u00a0\ndidn't have to buy it $3 a pound for $16,000,\u00a0\u00a0 551 pounds, you didn't have to carry home from the\u00a0\ngrocery store, right? Cook or eat. So every single\u00a0\u00a0 one of these tablets, every single one has the\u00a0\nsame nutrition as an entire plate of vegetables. So you know, as a plant based community,\u00a0\nI always encourage people to get their\u00a0\u00a0 nutrients and their minerals from whole foods.\u00a0\nWhy would your algae product be an exception? Yes, and that's a very good point. So here, if\u00a0\nsomeone's already embraced a plant based diet,\u00a0\u00a0 or are thinking about it, here's why you need\u00a0\nalgae, the reality is our soils are destroyed.\u00a0\u00a0 So even if you are eating greens, the soils do\u00a0\nnot have the nutrients in them that they used\u00a0\u00a0 to have 50 years ago. So the plants just don't\u00a0\nhave the same nutrients either because there's\u00a0\u00a0 nothing for them to pull up and are the plants or\u00a0\nthe vegetables are also thrown far, far away. And\u00a0\u00a0 they're harvested before they're properly ripens.\u00a0\nAnd so there's not enough nutrients that have\u00a0\u00a0 gotten into the leaves or the fruits or whatever\u00a0\nit is you're eating so so you're getting fiber,\u00a0\u00a0 and you're getting calories, but you are cheating,\u00a0\nyou're being cheated on the nutrients, algae\u00a0\u00a0 will fill that gap because it's so concentrated\u00a0\nmembers 100 of those cells on the head of a pin,\u00a0\u00a0 just imagine the concentration. That's why it's\u00a0\n1000 times more nutrients than anything else.\u00a0\u00a0 So it's very efficient. So that's number\u00a0\none. We even if you are eating plants,\u00a0\u00a0 I can promise you, you're not getting the same\u00a0\nquality that your grandparents got. Number two,\u00a0\u00a0 once we start traveling again, or even when\u00a0\nyou're out shopping or doing any kind of errands.\u00a0\u00a0 And if you haven't pre packed, your bag is full of\u00a0\nbroccoli or whatever. And that's gets messy. And\u00a0\u00a0 trust me I've done that. You go into any store,\u00a0\nwhat are you facing a bunch of empty carbs,\u00a0\u00a0 bagels, chocolates, sweets, all this stuff\u00a0\nthat either has terror is an anti nutrition\u00a0\u00a0 causes stomach distress, or worse. So if\u00a0\nyou always have some algae tablets with you,\u00a0\u00a0 it will hold you over especially the spirulina\u00a0\nuntil you get home and you can have a proper meal.\u00a0\u00a0 So it's a sort of an intervention. intervention.\u00a0\nSo that's number two. Number three, let's face it,\u00a0\u00a0 men and children hate to eat vegetables, and yet\u00a0\nwe love them. So if you want the men in your life,\u00a0\u00a0 the children in your life or teenagers to\u00a0\nget the nutrients that they need without you\u00a0\u00a0 having to argue with them all the time. This\u00a0\nis your answer. Like just swallow a few instead\u00a0\u00a0 of and even with your kids before they go to\u00a0\nsoccer practice instead of giving them a sugary\u00a0\u00a0 bar protein bar, give them some spirulina I can\u00a0\npromise you they will have the most focused best\u00a0\u00a0 game ever and every time so it's it's it answers a\u00a0\nlot of nutritional problems for people that aren't\u00a0\u00a0 necessarily interested in eating vegetables\u00a0\nand that can extend to nursing homes. You know\u00a0\u00a0 One day, I want to get us into school lunches. So\u00a0\nit's so that's for the people that we love who we,\u00a0\u00a0 you know, we just get tired of arguing with them.\u00a0\nOh, I guess actually, one more thing I would like\u00a0\u00a0 to mention. And I'm guilty of this too, like,\u00a0\nbecause I'm a plant based person. I can't eat\u00a0\u00a0 everything that I bought, and it breaks my heart,\u00a0\nthrowing stuff out when the lettuce leaves get\u00a0\u00a0 alone yellow, or the mushrooms get a little, you\u00a0\nknow, soggy. There is no waste with algae. It has\u00a0\u00a0 our tablets, we have to buy the FDA regulations\u00a0\nput an expiry date on it. It's always about three\u00a0\u00a0 years. But I can tell you, algae never goes bad.\u00a0\nYou can have it for 15 years. And it still will\u00a0\u00a0 have all the same potency as when you bought it.\u00a0\nSo it's shown stable, again, very efficient. So\u00a0\u00a0 if you want the best value for your money and for\u00a0\nyour health, that's led so those are my top four,\u00a0\u00a0 for why even for plant based, oriented people,\u00a0\nalgae still is would fill a lot of needs. And these stories yet Oh man, We get stories every day was one woman who\u00a0\nis who is anemic. She was in Miami. She was\u00a0\u00a0 actually a newscaster. And she took two of the\u00a0\nspirulina and she texted us emailed us saying\u00a0\u00a0 I had the best workout of my life. Because she\u00a0\nwas she was so anemic. And she needed the iron\u00a0\u00a0 and all the other nutrients that are in there.\u00a0\nAs I said it gives you energy. Another woman\u00a0\u00a0 same thing. She we sent her samples and she got\u00a0\nthem in her mailbox. She lived the country and\u00a0\u00a0 she ripped them open while she was still in the\u00a0\nmailbox. And by the time she walked down her\u00a0\u00a0 driveway and got to her house. She had so much\u00a0\nenergy she that she redecorated. She painted\u00a0\u00a0 her kitchen like it was it was insane without\u00a0\nother people call us email us and say their\u00a0\u00a0 children had ADHD. And they sent us pictures\u00a0\nof the kids with an A plus on the report card.\u00a0\u00a0 Soccer Coaches email us and tell us they had\u00a0\nteens that were challenged at school because they\u00a0\u00a0 couldn't focus and they gave them the spirulina\u00a0\nand they get they had the bet that they were able\u00a0\u00a0 to perform on the field and it made them so proud\u00a0\nthat they started performing better in school\u00a0\u00a0 70 year olds who were on oxygen tanks who are now\u00a0\nrunning marathons, digestive issues going away.\u00a0\u00a0 It's never ending never ending it because we're\u00a0\nso nutrient deprived and we don't even know it. So you touch on a couple of topics that\u00a0\nI want to go into a little bit more\u00a0\u00a0 but I don't know if you want\u00a0\nto cover chlorella first, Just a recap. spirulina technically a bacteria\u00a0\ngets absorbed very quickly, high protein,\u00a0\u00a0 great for nutritional, snack, intermittent fasting\u00a0\nand giving you energy and focus. And by the way,\u00a0\u00a0 spirulina was the first life on Earth almost 4\u00a0\nbillion years ago, before spirulina. Earth was\u00a0\u00a0 just gas and water. Algae releases oxygen when\u00a0\nit's growing. And so after a billion years,\u00a0\u00a0 there was enough oxygen on earth for other life\u00a0\nforms to grow. And the next one that started was\u00a0\u00a0 chlorella. So spirulina was first and chlorella\u00a0\nwas second. This is one of our spirulina.\u00a0\u00a0 chlorella, as I mentioned, is a green algae. So\u00a0\njust like spirulina has the most protein in the\u00a0\u00a0 world, chlorella has the highest chlorophyll\u00a0\nin the world. Now, there's a couple of things.\u00a0\u00a0 You may say to yourself what's so\u00a0\nimportant about chlorophyll? Well,\u00a0\u00a0 there's about three I want to address. Number one,\u00a0\nI used to read articles about how up until World\u00a0\u00a0 War Two, even when they didn't have blood for\u00a0\ntransfusions, the doctors would give the injured\u00a0\u00a0 liquid chlorophyll because they would heal just\u00a0\nas fast. And I used to wonder what what is it\u00a0\u00a0 in the chlorophyll that's making these people\u00a0\nhealthy? Well, I found out here's a picture\u00a0\u00a0 that shows you the chemical composition of your\u00a0\nblood and the chemical composition of chlorophyll.\u00a0\u00a0 They are virtually identical. There is only one\u00a0\natom that's different in your blood. It's a heme,\u00a0\u00a0 the hemoglobin has iron in the middle and that's\u00a0\nwhat carries oxygen. And chlorophyll has magnesium\u00a0\u00a0 in the middle. Otherwise, they are absolutely\u00a0\nidentical. Mother Nature is so smart. She\u00a0\u00a0 gave us chlorophyll to help us build our blood.\u00a0\nBecause if you have healthy blood, you are getting\u00a0\u00a0 healthy nutrients to the rest of your body. That\u00a0\nincludes your brain, your organs, your digestion,\u00a0\u00a0 your muscles, your stomach, everything. So number\u00a0\none, chlorophyll is a blood builder and it's been\u00a0\u00a0 scientifically documented and used that way by the\u00a0\nmedical community up until about the 30s. And then\u00a0\u00a0 the pharmaceutical industry kind of got in there.\u00a0\nNumber two, an interesting fact about chlorophyll\u00a0\u00a0 which I discovered is that chlorophyll is a fat\u00a0\nbased pigment. Now why is that important? Well,\u00a0\u00a0 all of your health issues good or bad start at the\u00a0\ncellular level and the mitochondria in the cells.\u00a0\u00a0 So the way one of the key ways to keep your\u00a0\ncells healthy and your mitochondria healthy,\u00a0\u00a0 is to have permeable cell walls, and\u00a0\nthey need healthy fats to do that.\u00a0\u00a0 So I used to hear people saying, Well, I'm doing\u00a0\na cleanse, I'm thinking, Well, what exactly is\u00a0\u00a0 cleansing, and I'm going to tell you what this is.\u00a0\nCleansing is when you get the chlorophyll, because\u00a0\u00a0 it's fat based, it heals your cell walls. So that\u00a0\nallows nutrients to get in, and toxins to get out.\u00a0\u00a0 And the best way to visualize this is you know,\u00a0\nwhen you have dirty windows, you can't see out\u00a0\u00a0 and sunlight can't get in. So think of chlorophyll\u00a0\nas window washers for yourself walls, okay?\u00a0\u00a0 That keeps everything humming, that makes sure\u00a0\neverything that goes in is getting in. And all\u00a0\u00a0 those toxins that you don't want are getting out.\u00a0\nAnd that combined with the fact that chlorophyll\u00a0\u00a0 is very cleansing to your organs as well. And when\u00a0\nyou digest anything with chlorophyll, only 10%\u00a0\u00a0 of the chlorophyll actually gets digested\u00a0\nin your stomach, it the rest of it travels\u00a0\u00a0 through your liver, which is sort of like\u00a0\nyour water purification system in your body\u00a0\u00a0 and all the way down through your colon.\u00a0\nSo it's it has this you know, think of\u00a0\u00a0 the Scrubbing Bubbles working their way all the\u00a0\nway down to your body. And by the way, when you\u00a0\u00a0 take chlorella and spirulina to a lesser extent,\u00a0\ndon't be worried if your poop is a little green,\u00a0\u00a0 because it's just proof that the chlorophyll is\u00a0\nin there and doing its job. So that's number one.\u00a0\u00a0 chlorella has the highest chlorophyll in the world\u00a0\nthat heals, is a blood builder and heals your cell\u00a0\u00a0 walls. The other cool thing about chlorella is\u00a0\nit has the hardest cell wall in the plant kingdom\u00a0\u00a0 ever I said spirulina has none. chlorella has\u00a0\nthe hardest cell wall so hard, in fact, that it\u00a0\u00a0 has to be cracked to production on LTE. I'll tell\u00a0\nyou something interesting about that in a minute.\u00a0\u00a0 So what's so amazing about that hard cell? Well,\u00a0\nwell, the first easy thing to know about is that\u00a0\u00a0 it has fiber in it because it's a cellulose wall\u00a0\nfiber to heals your gut, your your bacteria in\u00a0\u00a0 your biome need fiber, so they can create what's\u00a0\ncalled short chain fatty acids that also heal the\u00a0\u00a0 rest of your body. And when your gut is healthy,\u00a0\nthen you can absorb nutrition. And there's this\u00a0\u00a0 direct connection. Think of it as a major highway\u00a0\nbetween your stomach and your brain called the\u00a0\u00a0 vagus nerve, and they communicate back and forth\u00a0\nbut most communication is from your stomach to\u00a0\u00a0 your brain. So if you are concerned about your\u00a0\nbrain health the most, the first thing you need to\u00a0\u00a0 do is look after your gut health, and that will\u00a0\naffect your brain. So chlorella has the fiber\u00a0\u00a0 that your biome needs. So now they're having\u00a0\nnumber two and I think this is the drum roll.\u00a0\u00a0 And most important thing about chlorella, is that\u00a0\nhard cell wall attaches to toxins, lead, mercury,\u00a0\u00a0 radiation, aluminum. It also attaches to alcohol\u00a0\nif you're interested so you have any wine or beer\u00a0\u00a0 or anything. Take some chlorella afterwards,\u00a0\nyou will be sober in an hour and a half and\u00a0\u00a0 you will never have a hangover. It also attaches\u00a0\nto lactic acid. This is why athletes love it as\u00a0\u00a0 a post workout, because it pulls out the lactic\u00a0\nacid so their muscles aren't sore the next day.\u00a0\u00a0 Some people use activated charcoal to remove\u00a0\ntoxins. But the problem with activated charcoal\u00a0\u00a0 is that it pulls out all minerals, not just the\u00a0\nbad stuff. chlorella is not like that. It only\u00a0\u00a0 pulls out toxins. It doesn't matter whether it's\u00a0\ntoxins from mold, poisoning, it doesn't matter\u00a0\u00a0 whether it's toxins from your your feelings\u00a0\nwhen you get them pulled out. We still have\u00a0\u00a0 a lot to biological dentists, when they\u00a0\npull out their fillings because there's\u00a0\u00a0 mercury in there and they take it they\u00a0\ndon't want the fumes of the mercury and\u00a0\u00a0 they give it to their patients as well.\u00a0\nThe United Nations use chlorella after the\u00a0\u00a0 the Chernobyl radiation disaster. And after the\u00a0\nFukushima disaster eight years ago in Japan,\u00a0\u00a0 the entire chlorella world supply was bought up\u00a0\nwithin 24 hours because everybody in Asia knows\u00a0\u00a0 that it's the only thing that pulls out radiation.\u00a0\nSo chlorella is a detoxing algae. So when you take\u00a0\u00a0 chlorella Not only is the chlorophyll scrubbing,\u00a0\nwashing, doing the washing windows of your cells.\u00a0\u00a0 It's pulling the toxins. So think of chlorella as\u00a0\ngiving your body a shower from the inside. Okay,\u00a0\u00a0 we all take showers on the outside, but what about\u00a0\nthe inside? That's job of chlorella. And you know,\u00a0\u00a0 you can't unless you live in a bubble, you can't\u00a0\navoid toxins, it's in our carpets. It's in our\u00a0\u00a0 air. It's definitely in our food. It's in our\u00a0\nclothing. Our prescriptions are covered. metrics.\u00a0\u00a0 And so we need to pull them out. So you might\u00a0\nwant to go through, you know, take a higher\u00a0\u00a0 amount first to get rid of the toxins, and then\u00a0\nyou want to maintain it and own it. And then talk\u00a0\u00a0 about another thing that chlorella does, which is\u00a0\nbuild your immune system. But on the detox part,\u00a0\u00a0 you're always going to be faced with toxins. So\u00a0\njust so it's something that we think people need\u00a0\u00a0 to take on a regular basis. And most people,\u00a0\nyou can take it anytime a day, something like\u00a0\u00a0 spirulina, but most people take the chlorella at\u00a0\nnight. Remember I said they take the spirulina in\u00a0\u00a0 the day for hunger and energy. While most people\u00a0\ntake the chlorella at night, because maybe they've\u00a0\u00a0 had a couple of cocktails, maybe they will and\u00a0\nthey want they want, they don't want to have a\u00a0\u00a0 hangover. The next day, maybe they did a workout\u00a0\nand they don't want to be sore the next day.\u00a0\u00a0 But most importantly, I'm not sure if you\u00a0\nknow, but your body goes through a detox\u00a0\u00a0 and repair cycle when you sleep. So if you have\u00a0\nchlorella, in your body while you're sleeping,\u00a0\u00a0 it's like having the, you know, in big offices,\u00a0\nthey have the cleaning staff come in at night\u00a0\u00a0 while everybody's at home. Well think of chlorella\u00a0\nas your cleaning staff at night while you're\u00a0\u00a0 sleeping, okay, it's pulling out aluminium out\u00a0\nof your brain is pulling out toxins from your\u00a0\u00a0 cells. And guess what? chlorella also stimulates\u00a0\nperistalsis, also known as bowel movements. So,\u00a0\u00a0 it prepares you for a beautiful bowel movement\u00a0\nin the morning, and gets rid of all this stuff\u00a0\u00a0 that you don't need, so that you're ready to\u00a0\ngo with your spirulina when you wake up. So\u00a0\u00a0 it's, it's quite remarkable. And it's also got\u00a0\n40 vitamins and minerals, but they're different.\u00a0\u00a0 They do different things in your body. So in\u00a0\naddition to the cleansing and the detoxing,\u00a0\u00a0 because of the chlorophyll and the other the\u00a0\nother nutrients like vitamin K to chlorella is\u00a0\u00a0 world renowned for building your immune system. Do\u00a0\nwe not need a strong immune system right now? Yes,\u00a0\u00a0 we do. There's a lot of new there's about a list\u00a0\nof about 10 nutrients that the medical community\u00a0\u00a0 has identified as helping build a strong immune\u00a0\nsystem and most of them are in the chlorella.\u00a0\u00a0 The only ones missing is vitamin C. So I\u00a0\nwould still encourage you to take vitamin C,\u00a0\u00a0 and if you live in the northeast vitamin\u00a0\nd3, but everything else is in the chlorella,\u00a0\u00a0 all the B Vitamins A vitamin, zinc, chlorophyll\u00a0\namino acids, it's got it all it's a one stop shop,\u00a0\u00a0 you don't have to race out and buy a whole bunch\u00a0\nof new vitamins you don't erase out and buy a\u00a0\u00a0 whole bunch of different kinds of food to build\u00a0\nyour immune system. It's in the chlorella. And\u00a0\u00a0 the good thing about chlorella is it tastes pretty\u00a0\ngood. I eat it all day long. I put mine I just had\u00a0\u00a0 the equivalent of another another salad. I put the\u00a0\nsalt on it, I eat it with almonds, macadamia nuts.\u00a0\u00a0 I just while we're talking about how\u00a0\nefficient it is, here's a picture.\u00a0\u00a0 If you don't have time to prepare a big salad,\u00a0\nyou get all the same nutrition. In one tablet.\u00a0\u00a0 I've been talking to you I've had two I'm gonna\u00a0\nhave another one. I'm gonna have like the third\u00a0\u00a0 sell. Okay, there's no stopping me. It's just\u00a0\nbecause if there's so good, by the way, I have\u00a0\u00a0 no makeup on. My skin is really clean and wrinkle\u00a0\nfree. One of the things has is vitamin K2, which\u00a0\u00a0 pulls out health excess calcium from soft tissue\u00a0\nincluding skin, blood vessels, organs and moves it\u00a0\u00a0 into your bones where it should be. And almost\u00a0\neverybody is deficient in K2. And so chlorella\u00a0\u00a0 does that as well. It has also the highest RNA and\u00a0\nDNA in the world that helps you as you get older,\u00a0\u00a0 your RNA and DNA get damaged. And interestingly,\u00a0\nchlorella has something else called a chlorella\u00a0\u00a0 growth factor you mentioned about healing from\u00a0\ninjury or surgery. Part of the reason why when\u00a0\u00a0 you take chlorella you heal faster is because\u00a0\nof a the chlorophyll which builds your blood\u00a0\u00a0 being the RNA and DNA which of course is necessary\u00a0\nfor healing. But it also has this thing called\u00a0\u00a0 chlorella growth factor, it speeds up the growth\u00a0\nof your cells. chlorella is the fastest growing\u00a0\u00a0 organism in the world. If you've read anything\u00a0\nabout biofuel, it's always with chlorella, because\u00a0\u00a0 they're trying to trap the the the energy of\u00a0\ncells as they subdivide or the oil that's in it.\u00a0\u00a0 So it does that to your body as well. It\u00a0\nspeeds it up. So it's, it's like having\u00a0\u00a0 a doctor in your pocket. I mean, and if you like\u00a0\ngreens, you are gonna love this stuff. It's just,\u00a0\u00a0 it's so clean, you will crave it because your\u00a0\nbody intuitively knows that it's good for you.\u00a0\u00a0 And when you you can put it on your salads, you\u00a0\ncan put it in trail mix and have it straight up\u00a0\u00a0 like Do with some sea salt? I wouldn't imagine\u00a0\ngoing to bed without my chlorella at night. Well, I like the fact that you said at\u00a0\nsome point that really we don't need to\u00a0\u00a0 supplement with anything else. So a lot of the\u00a0\nvitamins we don't absorb very well anyway. So\u00a0\u00a0 this takes care of a lot of our needs\u00a0\nalong with the food that we eat.\u00a0\u00a0 Can you talk about also the\u00a0\nantioxidant power of your product here? Well, algae has the highest concentration of\u00a0\nantioxidants in the world, there's something\u00a0\u00a0 called the ORAC measurement, they don't use\u00a0\nit as much anymore. It was predominantly\u00a0\u00a0 developed for fruits. But it's, I don't have the\u00a0\nchart in front of me. But I think it's something\u00a0\u00a0 like 1000 or 10,000 times more antioxidants\u00a0\nthan even blueberries. berries are very good\u00a0\u00a0 for antioxidants. But algae is way higher,\u00a0\npartly because the antioxidants are because\u00a0\u00a0 antioxidants, what they do is they fight free\u00a0\nradicals. Free radicals are caused by any kind of\u00a0\u00a0 activity in your body. It's just the processing.\u00a0\nIf you exercise more, you have more free radicals,\u00a0\u00a0 it just it's and your mitochondria perform\u00a0\nbetter when there are fewer free radicals.\u00a0\u00a0 So because there's so much antioxidants in the\u00a0\nalgae, it's like if it when it gets into the\u00a0\u00a0 mitochondria of the cells, that sort of if there\u00a0\nare free radicals there, they mop them up, think\u00a0\u00a0 of them it just absorb them and get rid of them.\u00a0\nSo that's also part of aging. We're all you know,\u00a0\u00a0 everybody wants to stay as young as possible\u00a0\neither at a cellular level or visible level.\u00a0\u00a0 That's why we even have a brand new spirulina we\u00a0\ncall beauty bits because of the high antioxidants\u00a0\u00a0 and the high protein that it's way higher than\u00a0\ncollagen. But I don't want to diss collagen,\u00a0\u00a0 because it's good stuff. But this will help build\u00a0\nyour skin and your hair and your organs because\u00a0\u00a0 of the high antioxidants which put out the flame\u00a0\nof free radicals and so much of metabolic health\u00a0\u00a0 issues are due the inflammatory inflammation at\u00a0\nthe cellular level you're not even aware of, but\u00a0\u00a0 you can get tested for it. We work with people\u00a0\nlike Dr. Dominic D'Agostino, who's a scientist\u00a0\u00a0 at the University of Southern Cal southern\u00a0\nFlorida in Tampa, and he's a member of NASA has\u00a0\u00a0 NEEMO mission, they do a submarine mission\u00a0\nevery summer. And, and so he has bloodwork done,\u00a0\u00a0 you know every day to because they're looking for\u00a0\nways to help either other astronauts or you know,\u00a0\u00a0 anybody perform under very difficult conditions.\u00a0\nSo he's always taken our algae with him on these\u00a0\u00a0 trips. And he's always reported back that\u00a0\nhis implant inflammation markers were the\u00a0\u00a0 lowest ever it ever was and his something\u00a0\ncalled Vo2, which is oxygen uptake was high. Can we talk about how people use fish oil\u00a0\u00a0 to obtain their essential fatty acids? Why\u00a0\nis algae better than consuming fish oil? A lot of people will because you have\u00a0\nplant based you might have some vegans\u00a0\u00a0 and vegetarians on your call. You know,\u00a0\nomega-3 is very important essential fatty\u00a0\u00a0 acids very important for reducing inflammation.\u00a0\nBut the main source most people use is fish oil,\u00a0\u00a0 which goes rancid after they've done\u00a0\ntesting goes rancid after about a month.\u00a0\u00a0 And it's causing so much ecological damage\u00a0\nbecause the fish are being fished to nothing.\u00a0\u00a0 And if you're vegan, you're out of luck because\u00a0\nit's a fit. It's a you know animal source.\u00a0\u00a0 So I remind people, where do you think the fish\u00a0\nget the omega three from? They get it from algae.\u00a0\u00a0 So whether you're vegan anyways or not. Getting\u00a0\nyour omega three needs and essential fatty acid\u00a0\u00a0 needs from algae is just a smarter thing to\u00a0\ndo. It's better for you. They never go rancid.\u00a0\u00a0 It's good for everybody. It's good for\u00a0\nthe ocean. It's sustainable, eco friendly.\u00a0\u00a0 So it's just a healthier choice. Number one. The\u00a0\nother thing I want to mention is that I know we've\u00a0\u00a0 covered a lot of material here and some people\u00a0\nmay need to listen to it twice. But you may decide\u00a0\u00a0 that you would like to take algae doesn't matter\u00a0\nwhether it's spirulina or chlorella, maybe you're\u00a0\u00a0 doing intermittent fasting. So I would recommend\u00a0\nspirulina. But here's the interesting thing. You\u00a0\u00a0 may choose to use it for one purpose, but because\u00a0\nit has so many other nutrients, you're going to\u00a0\u00a0 find other benefits in your life, whether it's\u00a0\nimproving your gut biome or having more energy,\u00a0\u00a0 having your hair grow faster, or maybe you want\u00a0\nto detox well. You're also going to find that\u00a0\u00a0 your as your skin will clear up, your digestion\u00a0\nwill improve, your elimination will improve so\u00a0\u00a0 I know in our scientific world we have specialists\u00a0\nfor everything we have heart doctors and cancer\u00a0\u00a0 doctors and skin doctors and and I applaud this\u00a0\nnew approach the holistic natural path functional\u00a0\u00a0 medicine approach, which is a holistic approach\u00a0\nthat takes the entire body into consideration.\u00a0\u00a0 That's what algae does. It takes your entire\u00a0\nbody into consideration, you may be motivated,\u00a0\u00a0 because of, maybe you want to, it's January,\u00a0\nyou want to lose some weight. But I promise you,\u00a0\u00a0 there will be a whole other list of benefits\u00a0\nthat you will start to notice. So whatever your\u00a0\u00a0 motivation is, this delivers value. Algae is one\u00a0\nof the few things that I can under promise and\u00a0\u00a0 over deliver on. I can't say that for everybody's\u00a0\nalgae, ours is known for being pure and safe and\u00a0\u00a0 nutrient dense. And because we take extra care to\u00a0\nmake sure that happens. But we have never had a\u00a0\u00a0 single person in the 11 years we've been doing\u00a0\nthis tell us they didn't feel some benefits.\u00a0\u00a0 So yes. So it's really it makes me we sort of\u00a0\nfeel ourselves as an adoption agency. Every time\u00a0\u00a0 we make a sale. It's like, Oh, it's going to go\u00a0\nout there and do cuz things like puppies, right? You've said before, and I like what\u00a0\nyou mentioned about algae that taking\u00a0\u00a0 algae every day is like putting\u00a0\non your seatbelt every day. Yeah, it's just um, it's your nutrition insurance.\u00a0\nWe have a lot of people who are older, who\u00a0\u00a0 they've emailed us and said, You know, they they\u00a0\ncanceled their health insurance other than the\u00a0\u00a0 catastrophic. Because they don't, they're not\u00a0\nthey're not getting any, any illnesses. And they\u00a0\u00a0 have much more energy than their their older their\u00a0\nfriends. It just, I can't think of anybody for any\u00a0\u00a0 reason who wouldn't benefit from this. And because\u00a0\nit's so simple. If you can breathe, you can take\u00a0\u00a0 this, if you open your mouth and swallow down\u00a0\ntwo, or three or four or five tablets, five or 10,\u00a0\u00a0 however many you want. That's it. No cooking, no\u00a0\ncleaning, hearing, no fights with your teenagers.\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing. Right. So I know I have found\u00a0\nsomething that will help people without it being\u00a0\u00a0 a challenge. That was my goal, I want to get\u00a0\ngood nutrition into people in a way that's easy.\u00a0\u00a0 And, you know, we try to make it as fun as\u00a0\npossible by making the packaging attractive,\u00a0\u00a0 I have some new new packaging coming out with\u00a0\nlittle canisters, logos that you can shake it out.\u00a0\u00a0 So and you can you can come and visit\u00a0\nus at ENERGYbits comm if you want to\u00a0\u00a0 try it out and make a purchase\u00a0\nor learn or just learn more, I have known other people that are plant base.\u00a0\nIt's interesting to me that some people continue\u00a0\u00a0 to have IBS issues or Crohn's disease, for\u00a0\nexample. And you've said that your product\u00a0\u00a0 can actually help with those. Do you know\u00a0\nof cases where that has been reversed or\u00a0\u00a0 people have improved their Crohn's\u00a0\ndisease because of your product? I don't have any that I can relate, necessarily,\u00a0\nalthough we could certainly ask people because we,\u00a0\u00a0 as I mentioned, we only sell the products\u00a0\nthrough doctors and chiropractors and\u00a0\u00a0 functional medicine so we can start asking them\u00a0\nas they could share. So yeah, great to collect\u00a0\u00a0 all that information. Each one of us has a DNA\u00a0\nand a lifestyle, dietary, we have dietary issues.\u00a0\u00a0 And so the best thing you can do is observe\u00a0\nhow you feel after you eat certain foods. And\u00a0\u00a0 you know, if something makes you, you know,\u00a0\ngives you gas, or stomach pain, that's a\u00a0\u00a0 food you need to stay away from, or eat it in a\u00a0\ndifferent combination, or maybe a different time.\u00a0\u00a0 It's quite complicated because your stomach has\u00a0\nenzymes that digest foods at different rates,\u00a0\u00a0 you should never eat fruit with protein, for\u00a0\nexample, because they require different enzymes\u00a0\u00a0 and the fruit gets digested very quickly. If you\u00a0\neat the two of them together, the protein might\u00a0\u00a0 sit in your stomach for a long animal protein for\u00a0\na longer period of time and, and ferment, which\u00a0\u00a0 causes gas. So there's a lot of issues that go\u00a0\ninto finding good gut health and good health, good\u00a0\u00a0 gut health will lead to good general health. And\u00a0\nthe thing that I'm so happy about with algae is it\u00a0\u00a0 causes no problems of any kind for anyone for any\u00a0\nreason. It's sort of like the kid you always want\u00a0\u00a0 to invite over to play with your kids because\u00a0\nthey're clean, they're neat, they're polite. So if people want to learn more about your\u00a0\nproduct, what is the best website and also\u00a0\u00a0 do you have a discount code for our listeners\u00a0\nwho may be interested in trying the product? The website again is ENERGYbits energy b for\u00a0\nboy I Ts calm.

sugar shaken espresso i if you watch my channel you know that double shots on ice are my favorite starbucks drink but they've rebranded to shaken espresso so i ordered their new drink but i ordered i'll just show you how i ordered it right here and this will save you like two dollars if you want blonde espresso which is how it comes change it to blonde espresso i just left it normal espresso because i don't really care so actually i like blonde espresso but you know let's try it i'm not really getting the brown sugar yet maybe if i had a straw oh there it is um can't say i noticed that much of a difference it is literally just a splash so if you like starbucks double shots and ice you would like this [Music] i brought these scones from trader joe's they're like cranberry orange and it looks like there's almonds in them too and i just brought them in a statue bag got some more carrots here are all the snacks that i brought i have some cheese sticks i have some protein bars some little um like smoothie drinks from trader joe's some pomegranate seeds some chomps some salami um uncrustables and carrots and this i'm not necessarily going to eat all in a week but i went ahead and brought it for my room hey i forgot my lunches can you bring them yeah yeah thank you love you bye i forgot my lunches at home which honestly wouldn't have been a big deal because i can make plenty of lunches out of these things here but john also prepped my lunches for me last night while i was grocery shopping and so i was like it's early enough to where he would be here before the kids got here why not just happen brilliant because he was awake this morning so there's that classic mailing move um this stuff is more just for like snacks we have a snack time and the kids eat lunch at home right now and so i'll just grab something like this or in the mornings i can drink one of these i can snack on these so i'm currently doing a little bit of work on my computer but i'm gonna go ahead and eat one of these scones for breakfast my husband actually makes scones that are super good um and so i'm curious if these are gonna be anywhere near as good as his are you can see the yumminess in it wow the flavor really hits you it's good but it's more cakey and not as crumbly as like a scone normally is so i'm gonna say my husband's scones are better but these are still good [Music] it's a little after five o'clock and we're gonna make some of the biscuits we were originally gonna make them yesterday but i guess we got busy so we didn't make them so we have to make them today so we're gonna make them kind of as like a little appetizer we saw them on celina and chef and they looked really good so that's what we're gonna be doing so you do your first layer and then you add your cheese green onions and bacon mixture and then you add your other layer and you do it on top and then you add your third layer and making john do all the hard labor so we don't usually make biscuits but the process for these looks super cool also like i said earlier this recipe is um from tonya holland and we saw it on selena and chef so i'll put a link in the description box to the recipe we're using so one other trick that we learned watching celina and chef was to put a little bit of water on your baking sheet before you put your parchment paper so your parchment paper stays down and i think that's genius i did a pretty poor job of like cutting them out to use the most of our dough but but we did make these little tiny biscuits tesla want some but you can't have any now all we have to do is brush them [Music] okay they just came out of the oven this is what they look like pretty good the top has like a crinkly little little texture to it from the cream they're pretty good they're not life-changing but they're they're pretty good it's about seven o'clock we are gonna make dinner um we were supposed to have rotisserie chicken and carrots last night however um i got stuck in traffic and so i was out super late so we didn't really even have dinner so this is what we were gonna have yesterday notice how we did not make the biscuits so anyways we were gonna have pork tenderloin today with this ravioli that we have and some french green beans but because we have the biscuits it doesn't really make sense to make the ravioli but it is going bad so we are going to cook it and just save it um for like meal prep or lunches or something and then we are gonna have the roasted carrots that we didn't have [Music] all right so we've got oil and salt on the carrots and then they're gonna go in for like 40 minutes and then we'll season off a little bit more i don't know why but that's just what the recipe told me to do so we're gonna do that more more okay our pork is seasoned we well my go-to is usually cajun and i love to make this adobo sauce and if you've watched the channel before you've probably seen me make it but i'm too lazy because that's just gonna be another dish tonight so this is our prep okay we've got our brussels sprouts on the pan you have to make sure whenever you cook brussels sprouts that you put the cut side down so they get nice and crispy they're not ready to go into the oven just yet but we always roast our veggies at 400 degrees olive oil salt pepper garlic onion roast at 400 degrees for like 15 to 20 minutes or until they're cooked the way you like them for me i like them to be a little bit crispy and then for the pork we always put it in a stainless steel pan because we sear the outside and then we transfer into the oven to finish cooking also got to make sure that when you are cooking your pork you get it crispy on the outside on all sides even the side side probably only cooked it for like maybe six or seven minutes just long enough to get it like charred and crispy on the outside and now we're gonna go and put it in the oven brussels sprouts are going in everything is probably has like 20-ish minutes left this is what it looks like after we pulled it out it's been in there for about 15 minutes i totally forgot to flip the carrot or like rotate the carrots and then add the seasonings so i'm doing that now even though it's a little late but i'll put them back in the oven and it'll be okay i've got onion garlic and then we're adding some rosemary these are brussels sprouts this is usually about how done we like them you can see they're like kind of golden on the bottom here's our dinner turn up for tonight i feel like it looks kind of plain without the sauce that we normally have but it's still going to be super super good okay enjoy the carrots first so i'm hoping they're good taste the same as last time still pretty good brussels sprouts delicious mm-hmm what so everything is super good the only thing i'm not a fan of is the cajun seasoning is a brand new bottle we normally buy the like weber grill brand cajun seasoning it's got like a purple label on it super good this stuff not the best cajun seasoning but if you have a good cajun seasoning you like put that on your pork and you'll let it do that but you could also get blackening seasoning and put that on your pork too also i feel like i should say one of the things that has made the biggest difference is learning how to cook vegetables if you're someone who says that they don't like vegetables try cooking them a different way for the longest time i thought i hated cooked carrots you guys know i love raw carrots but i always hated cooked carrots because they're always in things like soups and they just kind of like take on a bad flavor and they get soft and they're not very good i always thought that i hated brussels sprouts because i had always had them steamed no you need to roast your vegetables learn how to roast your vegetables learn how to add a lot of seasoning to them and they're like a hundred times better a hundred times better if you watch my channel if you keep up with my instagram you know that bachelor nights which is monday tonight are usually the nights that we like to have like a little a little special dessert i deserve almost every single night but this is the night where i'm like let's like make a dessert i've been lazy lately and so this is what i bought for this week's dessert i mean you can't go wrong you just can't and you have to eat some of this raw too right [Music] good morning today's tuesday we're going to get started by making some coffee totally thought i was recording when i started the coffee but i wasn't but you guys have seen me do it before [Music] i've been using these little syrup samplers that my sister got me because we ran out of our normal like vanilla syrup but i actually think i want a caramel latte today so normally the only syrup that we buy that's like big which this isn't even the big one this is just like the little one from walmart is vanilla um so yeah i guess we're gonna switch it up and use some of this flavor so i'm gonna put some of this in my mug froth up my milk and then add my espresso in here and then add my milk so it is before school i'm here i have my coffee came out really really good um you guys saw yesterday i had a like a scone for breakfast i used to be a big breakfast person when i was at home and even when i was teaching at home like i love to have a warm breakfast but now that i'm back at school it's just like i'm not i'm just not hungry in the morning so like if i do anything i might eat like a protein bar so that's just how it is for me some days i like breakfast some days i don't sometimes you know i start my day and then an hour into it i'm like dang you know what grits really sound good right now but i'm teaching and i don't have any grit so i can't do that but let me know if you guys eat breakfast before school at school what are your teacher breakfasts because i just am not hungry like i love on a normal like weekend to make delicious things but when i'm going into work it's just that like nothing sounds good for lunch i had the exact same thing i had yesterday so here's a clip and then here's what i had for snack today with the kids and then here is what i had after school just uh a little cliff bar cause i got hungry a lot of times when i'm at school i feel like i need to just constantly be eating that's part of like my relationship with food is that i love to snack so i make sure that i keep them in the classroom so that my mouth can stay busy so that's what i'm doing now i also wanted to make one quick comment about my lunch um this is one that i have for tomorrow it's not heated up [Music] i know that i have other snacks throughout the day that are going to add up okay so it's around six o'clock um we came home worked out i obviously take pre-workout and drink my bcaas but i'm not including that in this video but we originally we're going to make chicken fajitas with our leftover rotisserie chicken but i never got the rotisserie chicken on sunday so we don't have any leftover chicken so we're just going to use some frozen tenders and make some fajitas which when i say fajitas i don't really love mexican food so they're not really fajitas i mean we just don't put cumin cumin i don't i don't know how to say it um okay so we'll say cumin i just the flavor is so overpowering to me and i can't do it so everything else is pretty much the same um just minus the cumin cumin so this is how we do our fajitas it's like a minute later and i was looking for our corn because we were gonna have roasted corn with it and i could have sworn we had like two bags left don't have any roasted corn and then i was like wait a minute do we even have tortillas and no we don't [Music] i mentioned i did rinse my onion in cold water just because it helps with like the crying aspect with white onions and then also my garlic as shoots growing out of it i double checked and sometimes when you get them from the store like this be a little i guess intimidating but people actually cut these up and put them on their food like the actual shoots kind of like you would do like green onions anyways i just chop them up and use them anyway and it's fine some people say like they taste different but i feel like if you cook it you don't notice a difference if i see any little green things in here i'll just take them out but for the most part it's not gonna be a big deal also if it wasn't clear we are still making fajitas um john went to the store he's getting corn and the tortillas that we get so that's just the way it goes sometimes we could have made something else but we were dead set on having fajitas tonight so that's what we're gonna do [Music] okay veggies are cooking and i'm gonna start the yellow rice i just follow the instructions on the package okay so for the veggies we just have pepper chili powder paprika red pepper and some chipotle flakes and then for the chicken i have all that plus cayenne i don't feel the need to put cayenne on the chicken and on the veggies plus we also have that red pepper so that's all the seasoning we have if you are not using fresh onions or fresh garlic then definitely add in garlic powder onion powder but this is everything we're putting in ours [Music] okay veggies are like almost done you're probably thinking amelian why don't you just cook the chicken first and then add the veggies in and the reason is because i just don't like doing it that way so [Music] okay john got corn from the store they didn't have the roasted corn that we like to do but i'm just gonna broil it and it'll be fine and then these are the tortillas that we like to get they're high fiber and they're 50 calories per tortilla they're not like amazing like flour tortillas but they're still good and they're only 50 calories [Music] since we're having fajitas i'll go ahead and show you how i make my margaritas too so we just use this basic tequila and then i like this mr and mrs tease brand that i can only find at walmart but i like it because it's 10 calories per serving then triple sec of course and then a lime just to kind of like amp this up a little bit and then i like to add orange juice but a regular orange works [Music] fine [Music] the chicken is pretty much done now we're going to add the garlic i just don't want to burn the broccoli when you taste test also notice that john has salt in his room and i don't because i don't play the game um so good though a little frothy i didn't say it was a bad thing dang also john said that the tequila that we used um whatever this is is pretty good it was dirt cheap like cheaper than quarterback and cheaper than cuervo and better than corvo so if you can find this maybe try it but we're also not tequila experts okay so here's the corn it wasn't a little steamer bag so i steamed it for like three minutes and then i put it under the broiler and this is what it looks like and we just have salt pepper and a little bit of chili powder on there just to kind of give it that seasoning we're gonna be eating off of my favorite plates they have the little the little curve to make scooping your food easier [Music] here's how our dinner turned out um we only made six tenders but it actually is like so much but here it is so we've got our fajitas yellow rice tortillas roasted corn and some limes so how i like to do it is i like to take my tortilla and put some yellow rice on there no you say you always eat your rice on the side i never said that yes you did yeah at restaurants and then some chicken and veggies let's see who can um get theirs better john went cheese on rice i went rice on chicken on cheese and he's putting queso her does queso i'm really bad at this oh oh oh okay here's mine here's mine she's that off oh she's good no bring it in bring him hmm from far away yours does look better flip it over okay we both suck but it's so spicy [Music] good morning today's wednesday i went ahead and made some just um what do you call it drip coffee and it's raining outside today but this is the bears brothers irish cream coffee i love it it's seasonal but it is it's so good and honestly bears brothers coffee is the best coffee that i've ever had and i said this on my instagram but you know how people say oh like this coffee is really good and you try it and you're like it just tastes like normal coffee to me no this coffee is actually super super good i have a link if you wanna try it it's definitely worth it and you can get sample packs too that are like a dollar or two and you could try all their amazing flavors anyways i am gonna eat my other scone that i brought um from trader joe's this morning once again i will say that my husband's homemade scones are better so we might have to do that in a future video just so just so you guys can see how to make them but i mean this is good for now i'm very [Music] excited so it's like 7 30. i lied earlier because i said we were going to work out but i forgot that i'm taking my rest days on wednesday and saturday so it didn't work out did my nails so today we're going gonna make chicken broccoli and sweet potatoes so we had on our menu and we are really bad about letting our sweet potatoes like just rot i keep them in the pantry and i always forget about them if i'm not like meal planned but i always buy them so we are going to go ahead and chop up all the sweet potatoes because we will be having them a couple nights from now and then we'll have them at some point next week and if you get your sweet potatoes and you just chop them up and put them in the fridge they'll stay good for i don't know like a week and a half two weeks and then you can just pull them out and roast them and it's so much easier and then you don't forget about them and they don't go bad oven is 400 like i mentioned yesterday 400 is what we roast all of our vegetables at so typically what we season anything that we like roast in the oven is salt pepper garlic and onion but with these sweet potatoes we really love that sweet potato gnocchi that i've been eating for lunch every day from trader joe's and it's got like a garlic sage butter sauce on it we tried to make gnocchi sweet odoki from scratch and it wasn't good um i messed it up completely so what i do is i add a little bit of sage and like a little bit of time more sage than thyme to the potatoes and they taste really good they have the same flavor obviously not the same texture because it's not gnocchi gnocchi but really really good these are leftover potatoes we're not doing anything special literally just putting them in an airtight container also i forgot to mention when i got home between then and now i've had some santia's chips just the chips because i don't need salsa [Music] the potatoes have been in for about 25 minutes i'm going to give them a little tossy flip and then i'm going to add broccoli to the pan and put them in it for another like 20. [Music] my camera battery died so i'm switching to my phone for just like a hot sec so the chicken has been cooked we added the peppers back into it so we cook the chicken separately and then add the peppers back in on the chicken we have onion black garlic this is from trader joe's it's new to me but it's really good and then we have oregano on the chicken and then salt and pepper and thyme as well that's how that looks this is what our veggies look like so again the sweet potatoes have been in there for about like 45 minutes broccoli has been in there for like 25 minutes give or take just for fun here's two different plating options you can mix it all together or you can do a kind of like vertical thing like this one over here i prefer this one which we actually weren't planning on putting in the peppers and i decided last minute since we were doing it in bold style that would be really good and we have orange red and yellow peppers but i thought since the sweet potatoes were orange we should use red and yellow peppers so then we have all the colors anyway so this is how tonight's dinner it turned out looks super good [Music] okay still on my phone but we're going to taste it but he never has anything incredible to say it's good it looks good i really do feel like the black garlic does make a difference so if you go to trader joe's pick it up try it a little veggie action happening mushy with just a little bit of crisp and they have the same taste that like like i said the nokia does just by putting that sage on there so definitely try it okay so john and i are playing this game and i was like okay i want dessert so i went and grabbed our fudge pops which i know that these fudge pops are only 40 calories like it says on the front 40 calories what i did not know is that a serving size is three pumps hilarious anyways these are really good and i'm gonna have one [Music] good morning it's thursday i was going to make a latte at home this morning and i just said no we're going to starbucks so i got a cinnamon dolce latte but i got it with a little bit of white mocha um here's specifically like how i ordered it it is absolutely freezing this morning i love cinnamon dolce and white mocha i love cinnamon dolce and toffee nut like white mocha and toffee not any of those combos like those three flavors they do something for me i also brought a cup to put it in because i usually am not great about finishing it right away i almost got um like that double smoked bacon and cheddar or that the hammond swiss croissant and i was like i really don't need that this morning so i'm probably gonna wait like 20 or 30 minutes and eat one of my one up protein bars like right before the kids get here because i feel like i need to eat something this morning i know in a lot of these videos you see people like making their breakfast every morning but like when you need to be at work super early in the morning like it's just not super realistic and i don't make breakfast most of the time before i leave the house i was actually craving something warm today which is why i said i almost got a sandwich but i didn't so yeah i'll see you guys later so i enjoyed my coffee this morning i did end up having one of my 1up protein bars this is the kind that i like it's s'mores [Applause] it's so good then for my snacks that i normally eat with the kids i had some more of my salami then i had one of these string cheeses from trader joe's and i had some of my pomegranate seeds that i got from trader joe's and so funny because some of my kids were like miss call i love those and i was like i know they're my favorite too so good so i'm gonna finish these off tomorrow um that was my snack super good honestly i could have this every single day then after school i had some of my carrots and then my husband brought me a like spare computer cord so i can leave one here and have one at home because i'm really bad at that but he brought me a corndog from sonic because it's 50 cent corn dog day or hour i don't know but he brought me that so that was a surprise and i ate that and then i got distracted and busy i've literally been working non-stop after school and i did not eat my actual lunch which is fine because i can just eat it tomorrow i didn't have anything prepped for tomorrow so that works out i did have a protein bar just now i know i had one of these here's the thing would it have been better if i had eaten my lunch that meal prepped yes it would have but this is why i keep things in the classroom because it's better to just like eat a quick something that's not terrible for you versus being so busy that you don't eat at all so that's how today went so it's about 6 45 we're gonna make dinner we're actually making one of my favorite meals ever and john's too it's the italian sausage pasta and i made this in a video you can click up here it's the cook with me video five of my favorite meals and i went into detail on how to do it and i also have the full recipe linked below so i might not be super specific when i show you tonight but it is my favorite meal first i want to show you guys my favorite way to get sausage out of its casing if you're still cutting the casing off of sausage you need to see this hack because it's my favorite thing ever and i don't know why more people don't do it or don't know about it just for reference we are using this hot italian sausage i always buy it when i go to trader joe's so for this to work you need to have a hot water or warm water what you're gonna do is run it under warm water and you're gonna slowly kind of rub the casing off and it should come off super easy [Music] the pasta that i'm using is orgeti or kitty is my favorite pasta it's got this like cup shape and it just like hugs the sausage perfectly i really really like the kind from trader joe's but the reason i like this kind is because the noodles the pasta is thicker than the other brands that i've had which really i've just had like walmart brand but if you get it you need to make sure that it's like thick pasta because that's that's what makes it so good too maybe i just like this i think it's this and just look at the texture of this pasta doesn't that look like something you want to eat it looks like ice cream almost salty like the sea if you know where that's from we can be best friends [Music] [Music] here's what the sausage onions pepper spinach looks like you could tell i added a ton of spinach in here and it looks like almost nothing like i'm tempted almost to add more but i'm not going to um our pasta is done i drained it i did save some pasta water here i almost forgot but i remembered so now what we're going to do is combine the pasta and the rest of it add the water and parmesan and make a little sauce and then i also like to go back in and season the sauce as well also if you make this make sure that you don't cook your pasta like 100 because it does need to sit for probably like 10 minutes we're gonna probably let it sit while we shower so that's going to be like 15 or 20 minutes because the longer it sits the better it tastes so don't cook your pasta completely because it's going to cook a little bit more [Music] so if i move it you can see kind of how much liquid is in here right now we're going to add the parmesan [Music] sometimes i add a little bit of this grated parmesan if i want to thicken it up just a little bit so if you don't nail the pasta water ratio and it sits for a little while and you want it to be a little bit thicker just add some of that and it kind of helps so we're gonna put this on low and cover it okay let's take a look oh yeah that's gonna be good that is exactly [Music] all right and here is how it turned out um i did garnish it with a little bit of parsley and i added a little bit more pepper on top and some chipotle flakes because we love them but it tastes i promise it tastes ten times better than it looks and it looks really good okay we're gonna taste it even though we both this is one of this is like my favorite meal every time it's this good every time delicious as always so good if you make one thing from this video i'm not lying i could eat that whole pot like it's that good something else really important about this dish is if you make it make plenty of it because the leftovers fantastic this dish is so good heat it up so yeah definitely try 10 out of 10. we love it also i have one more thing to say with tesla in the shot this dish technically has fruits and veggies in it because there's peppers and a ton of spinach so we've got the other major food group of cheese and [Music] good morning it's 6 a.m on friday i'm gonna brew some coffee i was gonna make a latte but honestly i just feel like normal basic coffee so let's pick one out i think i'm gonna go with this one by bears brothers i have a link in my description if you want to try them and i feel like i've already talked about them in this video but this one is streusel cake it's one of my favorites um and i think this will be this will be really good for today [Music] i also said yesterday at school how much i really wanted a hot breakfast so i think i'm gonna make some oatmeal yeah like i'm not hungry now but i know as soon as that oatmeal is done i'll be happy it's just weird for me to eat like so early in the morning [Music] so i went ahead and put my oatmeal in this yeti just so it stays warm i have actually eaten some already this is what it looks like it's a little hard to tell but it came out super good i'm gonna take that i actually really like this and taking a couple bites of that made me feel like a lot better i made it to the costume i'm gonna eat my oatmeal i don't know i felt the need to come on and tell you but i'm gonna eat my oatmeal and then make coffees which you'll hear about if you watch the weekly vlog from this week i forgot how good my homemade oatmeal is so good so i tried to show you when i was making it but all i do is i add in cinnamon and then some cinnamon roll flavor seasoning from flavor god and it's really really good i have a link in my bio if you've never tried flavor god but i would honestly get it just for the cinnamon roll some people put it in their coffee i should have tried that this morning because i made the streusel coffee and i put just a little bit of stevia for sweetness and then a pinch of salt to balance it out and then i added in the wet ingredients so milk and then butter um vanilla extract i feel like it makes a really big difference and that's it it's the end of the damn friday here's what i had for a snack um just some salami some carrots and cheese stick and then after school i had a chomps stick i actually got super hair away with school and meetings and just like everything i had to do and mostly talking and i completely completely forgot to make my lunch until i was like oh it's time to go so i brought the lunch that i was gonna eat today home because i do need to eat it um but yeah so today not the best day but that's okay also i feel like it's important for me to be like honest and share that with you guys especially if you are a teacher because how many times do we forget to eat how many times at least at least once a week so again just being real just being honest just letting you guys know some days like i forget to eat lunch or i run out of time or i don't have time to like make breakfast or i don't have time to like do whatever so that's just how it goes some weeks and that's okay it's been like a second for you but it's been many hours for me so it's almost seven o'clock and we're going to be making tri-tip which is my favorite steak ever and now that we're in california it's so easy to get so tri-tip we're also making brussels sprouts and we're making some of those sweet potatoes that we chopped up two nights ago so potatoes are going in the oven the same way we prepared them last time actually i might leave out the sage this time i might just make them like basic seasoning [Music] for the steak we're gonna do salt pepper garlic and onion [Music] [Music] john um grilled the steak outside and then we're gonna put it in the oven for a little while just to finish cooking [Music] the veggies brussels sprouts are probably there for a little too long [Music] okay here is tonight's dinner so it's tri-tip sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts um which actually works out nice that this is my dinner today because like i said i didn't really the lunch that i packed i just had other stuff and there will be plenty of tri-tip left over if i want it which i probably will i will say because i don't want anyone to to make any judgments here the steak is a little bit overcooked it's a little bit overcooked but that's okay and also john and i decided that from now on we're gonna call these cube fries how's the cute fry delicious not cute cute fries also one more thing i want to point out is i do like the sear you get when you cook the tri-tip in a pan versus cooking it on a grill john doesn't like cook it on a pan if we can help it because it smokes up the whole house so that's why we grilled it but the pan sear is a much better option and then just transferring it to the oven like that my microphone is turning around so sorry for the audio but it'll be okay for three seconds i just love it it's good so many better comment down below what your favorite steak is if budget like wasn't a thing and you had to choose one what would you pick because i would pick tri-tip well okay i might pick filet mignon flamingo is really good one day he fed it to me he fed it to me one day he made it and i thought it was sirloin but i was really hungry and it was like really good and i ate it in like two seconds i was like wow that was amazing he was like you just ate a whole filet and i was like now i'm gonna be snacking on some of these trader joe's dark chocolate covered blueberries we've had the dark chocolate covered cherries and they're amazing these blueberries are amazing and my favorite are the they're i think they're dark chocolate covered um coconut almond like they're like almond joys but they're super super good [Music] good morning it's saturday and well it's actually one in the afternoon i've been editing all morning john's been really tired but i've been begging him to do breakfast actually i wanted donuts but that's not happening so maybe we can get donuts tomorrow but we're gonna have some sausage some toast and some eggs just a normal classic breakfast i am also going to make some coffee too so happy saturday you guys have seen this before i keep it in one of these bitter homes and gardens containers with the little scoop inside and we keep it in our fridge i'm just going to take this and fill up my bioletti okay so she's filled with water the espresso powder is in there whenever we were in italy which is where we like first saw these because we were in airbnbs and they all like prepped these for us um they said not to like push down on the espresso powder which i know like typically like you would do so this is just the way that i do it i don't push it down too much and then we put it on our stove which you guys have seen me do this a couple of times before but i just wanted to like talk you through it a little bit more because i keep getting questions about it so we're just going to put it on the stove espresso will start to come through the top [Music] okay our sausage is done and i know a lot of people will like pour their grease into like a little jar and we used to that too but recently not recently like a year ago or something years okay well we learned this hack where you can put paper towels like in the grease once it's cooled down for like a second and then it'll absorb it and then you can just throw the paper towels away if you want because you can't pour grease in your sink you can't put grease like in your trash can so if you do it like this i mean it works the trick that i've learned recently is to keep our bread in the freezer because if you can't eat it fast enough and you're just gonna use it for something like toast it toasts perfectly fine just pulling it straight from the freezer so i'm really glad i learned that and by recently i mean i've been doing it for like two years i just have no concept of time [Music] also if you know me you know that i don't just butter my toast i melt the butter and put it on my chest so for our drinks this morning i'm gonna make us some lattes i'm just gonna be using vanilla syrup yeah i do okay so i'll put some caramel in there too okay we're gonna pour however much espresso you want in your drink i'm just gonna pour mine in my cup here for john then we're gonna froth up some milk [Music] [Music] and i like break the rules because i like to do this i don't know if there's a name for it i just like makes mixing it all up for john's i foamed it or frothed it up a lot more he likes more foam than i do not really a film person here's my melted butter i did kind of like overcooked my toast a little bit okay i burned it a little bit but that's okay wasn't intentional but that's okay um yeah so this is our breakfast this morning my eggs just have everything seasoning and then a little bit of cheese i've got my toast got my sausage i'm going to eat my breakfast and finish editing this week's classroom vlog if you've seen it let me know because it should be up poor tesla is always left out of our breakfast she's always left out so it's after seven um i'm still wearing my pajamas uh pretty much the only thing that we've done all day is eat breakfast like i'm literally in the same spot doing the same thing coffee is very cold um but john so far has started prepping our meats and veggies so tonight we're making one of like my favorite super fun meals we're doing fondue we're gonna do kind of like melting pot style where we cook like our veggies and our meats in broth so yeah i'm excited here's our little fondue pot we're gonna be using chicken stock and pretty much are gonna be weighing the rest of it i can't remember what recipes that we've used in the past for it so we're just gonna throw in just a bunch of delicious seasonings and things a little bit of oil in our pot and we're gonna go ahead and cook up some onions also i almost forgot but we have these little potatoes for it too very excited that i remembered and we're kind of weaning it so i'm gonna do some of this marsala in there do you think that's good we're gonna let it like reduce a little bit so maybe that much that's probably enough for like the flavor okay so we've seasoned it with salt pepper a little bit of red peppers and then i added a little bit more of this like chicken broth powder just to kind of amp up the flavor of our actual broth so everything in there looks good to go do us good trader joe's which was good we're also throwing in some green onions just because we had them in our fridge so why not that looks good though this whole all right we have a bubble putting the potatoes in first so they can cook up while we wait for our other food to cook [Music] so we have our timer going so we can make sure because it's hard to tell like whenever you're just sitting here how much time has passed but we know like approximately like how long it's going to take for these to cook so that's our little tip [Music] i don't think i told you what we have but we obviously have our broth and you saw us make that and then we have some fresh broccoli um because normally we just keep frozen and then john has some mushrooms over there and then we have those little potatoes in there too and then we have chicken and filet mignon for our meat that's our little potato broccoli mushroom scooper we forgot we love to dip it in teriyaki melting pot gives you a few different sauces but teriyaki it makes it good [Music] so this is this feels like one of those um like team team building activities like you should need to cook fondue with one of your co-workers are you trying to get people converted it is about 11am on sunday um mostly because of daylight savings time i hate it not happy about it but i originally thought we were going to make breakfast here or we were going to go get some donuts but john said we should go get some brunch so very excited last time they brought us the champagne and orange juice on the side which is the best way but this time okay this time we got it the way we had last time he brought us the champagne this is the berry like jam dip and then this is the custard that's super good these are the cute little beignets and then what i did last time is i took all almost all of the fruit because it's still really good in the little dips but i put it in my mimosa to make it extra delicious [Music] john says this is bad etiquette but if you've served before you know i've got the chicken marsala pasta is it good and i got the filet mignon pasta i did pick out all of the mushrooms because i'm not a mushroom person but this is what i had last time and i really liked it also i got extra parmesan cheese this time lunch was delicious technically is french because we were eating at like noon here are the donuts we got and here's the cute little shots we got a couple of the cookie craze john got a banana rama we have a maple a normal glaze and then a cinnamon sugar and we got some bavarian cream shots adults a dulce de leche shot and a strawberry shot this is the banana one that john got i'm gonna try the cinnamon one with the with a dolce shot so you insert and inject do a little bit just a little bit you use that that's right oh really okay it's kind of hard to get in this one i'm gonna try the cookie craze oh gosh the funny thing is like i don't love bavarian cream but getting to inject it myself makes me want to eat it more i'm gonna try some maple let's do it with some do you think they'll say to let you be good or bad probably good right do a little dulce de leche in there it's so fun to do it like this drama saying last night about um melting power about fondue like why is stuff like that so fun and he was like we like to work for our food and i think i think that's very true i know this is what i eat in a week video i wanted to show you some of the snacks that we got from trader joe's um just that we're going to have in the house actually this one is for bachelor night tomorrow we're going to try these log cakes from trader joe's and then picked up a couple chomps for me and john we're back in stock with our ghost pepper chips which are our face so we got a couple bags of those and then we got some of these oh babe we should try the ginger candy we got some of the the chocolate selections so these are the coconut ones i like these are the blueberry ones that i was eating i think this week these are the cherry ones that you guys have seen us eat before so we stocked up on these just to have them and then john thought that these ginger ones sounded good so i actually i want to try them i don't think i've ever had ginger as a candy i'm not from [Music] it's very ginger one final thought on the donuts our favorite donut or at least i think your favorite donut is krispy kreme donuts i think that the best doughnuts um these donuts are good but they're not like blow your mind good they're not very good to be honest but these but these are fun so tonight for dinner we're gonna be making this barbecue chicken teriyaki um it is from trader joe's um it says trader mings because it's chinese food in case you've never shopped there before this is what it is john and i have never had this one before just the orange chicken which is super good and then the kung pao chicken which i think is my current favorite so hopefully this one is good john also says the beef and broccoli is [Music] good [Music] so trader joe's is telling me to put this in a bowl with plastic on top of it which is strange because normally they'll give you like stovetop instructions but they don't um so i'm gonna try to cook it in a stasher bag and i'm gonna leave it like a little bit open i don't know maybe i should close it i'm going to try it and see how that goes also i've never had jasmine rice before just my husband he got it for his curry that he makes um it smells so good the rice i think is pretty much done i never time it i just like check it to see but i always worry about burning it so this looks good broccoli honestly needs like another 10 minutes looks like this after like five minutes in the stasher i left like a very very tiny slit yeah i think that that cooks fine [Music] all right i think we're ready to plate it up there's a lot of liquid in here i don't know i guess i thought it would be oops i thought it would be thicker uh but it's not so i guess that'll be good for like our rice because it'll like get in there [Music] okay here's how our dinner turned out so you can't really see the rice underneath but it's there and then the only extra thing that i did was put some red pepper flakes on that is it okay we're trying this one for the very very first time the first one we ever had was the orange chicken we were like wow this is pretty good then we had the kung pao chicken we were like wow this is really good and then you had the other one the broccoli beef and broccoli and he liked that one i don't think i had it but overall we do still agree that it tastes better than when you go to like one of those like buffet chinese restaurants so still really good and also one of my favorite things to cook if you just don't feel like cooking because this can be done in like 20 minutes so and that's just because the broccoli i like the rice though oh good you guys need to try jasmine rice and if you knew about it why didn't you tell me you", "M5E3zsMItCg": "what isn't it soon soon isn't it early i meant to watch on seven o'clock and welcome to kimball's corner where we are nothing professional um i'll let rocky introduce the snack that we are having for this evening very important i know you're all wondering well tonight's snack is provided by well actually it's not really sponsored no sponsors no sponsors but universal yums is a basically it's a subscription box for treats that come from all around the world around the world this month it's all about italy and uh we already ate a lot of it so this is well we took it out we took out the savory snacks and then rocky was like i'm gonna taste some of these so but basically okay let me explain the treat of the evening that we're all looking forward to really is this orange we'll just save that one so we're gonna save that one um but basically we used to do tokyo treat which was awesome loved it and uh but it started kind of repeating snacks but different flavors so quality so universal yums picks different countries every month i'm trying to talk like go ahead you're good i don't know what that is but it's good almondy anyway so we did universal yums because that way we can get a different treat from different uh countries every month and one box will last us every like month like we can have a snack from it every weekend um i know right oh my god using the old noggin jenna says hi hi are you the only one with us tonight yeah i don't think anyone wants to hang out with us tonight no that's so someone else just joined welcome someone else so i'm gonna paint on this canvas with some palette knives i have never actually created art with a palette knife other than i can show you right now because i did it like five days ago for one of my lessons this piece which i didn't actually create the face of the palette just the background i did some smudges that's that's my extent with the knowledge of using a palette knife cast home says hi all hey justin says hi jenna kimball rocky everyone oh love you kimball i brought my tea and i brought it back up so i don't have to leave you tonight that's thoughtful of you but i got enough liquid for an hour you're gonna go potty eventually wow so i don't know how to do this and i don't really care i'm gonna just we're gonna play a lot we're gonna i'll play together really i think that's what's the most exciting is like how do you do it i got my uh what what what what where who am i uh my different acrylics are back here i'm using the jane davenport acrylics and denise says hi hey girl i'm using my jane davenport palette pad okay i don't know if i'm actually going to use this i think i'm just going to put paint on here and kashmiri i'm not sure krishmir let me write that down onto the campbell dictionary real quick and can you tell me exactly is you can make it up okay it's not in the cur mirror and then i bought like a six piece thing of canvases i'm just trying to get through them so that's what i'm using from artist loft nothing fancy perfect kimbo how can you define christian mirror for me real quick just like to make sure i write this down the card what did it how did i use it i'm going to smear it on all over this exactly i'm going to smear shmear it's just another way of saying shmear but it's like with style like you're going to do okay sure smearing it is hot i'm hot get off of me this i started calling this my art again oh style got it okay right so these are the palette knives i have this one is really flimsy i don't know if i'm gonna use it oh wait no this one feels better maybe i got rid of the flimsy one whatever i'm prepared i tell you i think i'm gonna use this one the most because it has multiple angles i don't know we'll see well trisha is trying hard not to open a bag of potato chips and jenna says go for it you have no snack it's always a yes dip it in chocolate and go and he says hi did i say it already hi yes perfect i'm grabbing a purple colored pencil right here because i found a photo that i want to work from it's not purple it's not purple it's palma violet [Laughter] all right photo we'll say your name's tasha we don't know i don't know who this is and i'm just doing i'm not trying to draw her it's for reference these are the crunchiest little snacks ever listen we're from way back here i can okay so i'm gonna draw her ooh and by that i mean loosely actually maybe she should drop really i don't know how to i don't know how i'm gonna do this with uh my palette knives we'll see trisha is saying that it's 11 o'clock at night which might be why she's not opening the chips but to that i say chips know no time true they know no bedtime i say crunch away we're enablers away crash away all right we're good trisha confirms that she can hear the crunch i'm gonna stand the hallway let me know if you can hear it from there wow welcome to kimmel's corner where we see if you can hear crunching noises all right i can hear it that was from the hallway i'm drawing her diagonally i don't know why because it's more interesting kimball you're smearing her across the page that sounds awful um i it was not intentional but we're going with it trisha says stop it either to me crunching or us enabling her to be potato chips i'm not sure either way the crunch is delicious you should go for the crunch everyone had a bunch of work to do this weekend that i didn't actually do there's always tomorrow i say there's always after kimball's corner i say by the way this chocolate hazelnut bar from italy has the most hazelnuts i've ever seen in a chocolate bar i'm not even sure you could call it a chocolate bar it's more like just chocolate covered hazelnuts that have all been smashed together so it's nutella before they ground up the hazelnuts probably one you're going to love kimmel this is like um looks like i don't know it's like tiramisu in a little lint chocolate truffle type thing remember that time we ordered 40 pounds of lint chocolate truffles yes or however much it wasn't it came in a cooler and then we all gained 20 pounds over the holiday but i was already heavy you couldn't tell that i gained any weight okay i'm sailing we make good life choices if you really think about it every day him okay really quick i had salmon today i'm healthy i want you to try so this is lemonade pepe all right i'm not trying to draw this out mister that's fine i just want you to sniff it and tell me what you what you think it's going to taste like ready well i know you said it tastes like fruit it smells like fruit loops it smells like fruit loops okay and me just smells lemony here you go you tell everyone what that tastes like why is so funny go on swallow it what are you getting it tastes like a lemon bread stick with pepper yes you nailed it hence the peppercorns all over the bottom there all i taste is pepper really want to eat it but it smells like fruit loops yeah it has like a really light lemony flavor uneven eyes honey get it together jenna's asking how everyone's week was going i concur how is everyone doing this week what are you up to what are you doing tonight just kind of darkening up because i know i'm going to lose a lot of my details when i start i feel like this is your like introduction to the bob ross world you know you kind of said that last week no but it's palette knives kimball i'm like that is so like her that's fine not everyone has perfect symmetrical eyes she doesn't i would argue that a lack of symmetry can be very beautiful jenna says tonight she is sewing oh what you're working on what she's throwing i'm gonna give her some big old crazy brows apparently oh really big crazy brows i should have drawn her like straight and down it's a little easier [Music] all right squeeze all right we're all and moving on from that next jen says she's going she's sewing skirts dot dot dot the only thing she really sews oh slash masks remember the movie mask that had the character rocky in it oh yeah with cher yeah remember how they're doing like an adventure or three i don't know if i'm gonna give her ears i'm not really sure yet but she's how did you make that year look so easy just then well it's scribbles and just scribbles yeah but like it looks better than if i spent an hour trying to draw an ear what's that about it's because i don't know i feel like this could be archer almost but it's not oh okay arches archer elaine says evening all right well good evening honey darling welcome to campbell's corner happy sunday attempting possibly monday depending on what part of the world you're in i guess attempting whatever the heck i'm doing palette knives okay so wait i think you're at this stage now where we need to get into the no gelato wait i need to block in a little bit of shading okay well i stopped for nobody it's chocolate kimble i know but i really want to get this off you don't worry look how many nuts are in this thing yeah mmm that looks so hazelnutty i'll give you the part with those it's so soft isn't it that's like the hazelnut spread that you get isn't the chocolate really good in it though um thanks italy why is everything better than italy seriously well i think a lot of american sweets are a little too sugary i think and obviously not all of them um but i think that like whatever you're eating like the chocolate hazelnut flavor comes through a lot more than sugar oh you get all of it i just took one bite it's really good though here come also have one of these almond things here you go just okay rachel says hello everyone hi jenna says if you're just joining tonight kimball and i kimball will be painting on canvas with jane's acrylic and pellet knives the snacks come from universal yum's box and it's campbell's first time ever using a pellet knife so he's not nervous at all and his hand wasn't twitching before we started that's true she probably has hair going that way somewhere okay thank you lovely model you may go thanks um tanya whatever her name was all right i have no idea how to do this it's a pusheen break you have to grab a pusheen and show it to camera that sounds inappropriate i already showed them my this one this is all i can find right now you showed the tiniest thing the camera just then can you see you can't even see it hold it up pushing there you go it's not in focus but that's fine whatever okay distracting me i wouldn't okay i'm so nervous elaine says in the uk it's just after 11 p.m hi jenna i've started following you on instagram i love your craft room [Music] noah says if you're just joining curmumbus is about to lick a cactus you're curmumbus you know all i have to say is 300 seconds noah that's all i have to say he's got the power so i think i'm not going to blend so much on the on this right away i think i'm going to just put the paint on there and smear it around with a knife i don't know kimbo yes no you're going to wear it schmear which is to smearing with style okay you got to use your own words here i feel like i'm going to end up with a lap full of paint is what i think rachel says loving the canvas work lately oh thank you oh no it was timed out 300 seconds wait again i know if you're just joining us and don't really know the full context noah is jenna's husband and jenna is the moderator so she often will put him in timeout if kimball either gives the word or if it just strikes jenna's fancy we have fun with it but we love noah and we really appreciate him coming to watch and be timed out all right what a trooper if you think about it dolores says hi we are having beautiful weather here and are out seeing the world again that's really nice looking forward to kimball's creation at rocky's chitchat chatter rock is just full of the chitta chatter lately that's like the nicest way of saying my babble you're constant talking look this is how we do makeup in this house is it we never doing my makeup don't you watch you never come to me with a palette knife and acrylics i'm going to back away slowly i'm going to use purple for shading because that's what i like so is every stage of this one going to be the hot mess stage or what like what are we oh it's it's going to end up just being a hot mess there's i got nothing i'm excited i really don't know how it's going to work how it's going to turn out are you wanting it to stay somewhat blocky or yeah no i'm going for full on scratchy um what if this becomes your favorite technique i'll do it more often okay this is a lot of paint did i ever tell you that i love the name dolores no i don't know why but i just feel like you you cannot have the name dolores and not be like a cool person dolores umbridge just delores like it's such a cool name it's like i don't know because you like the baseball movie oh a league of their own yeah maybe who knows i can't explain why oh my god there's so much paint on my palette knife missy lulu says hi everyone i'm working with a palette knife girl you call it working i call it struggles but i'm having fun i just i really should clean it off that worked do you need another paper towel no okay well now there's nothing on it bob ross puts more on how does bob ross do this you know this is just the first layer he doesn't paint faces let's all be fair that's true he paints happy little trees and rivers with waterfalls and majestic mountains also a little cabin tucked nicely away in the woods if this fails miserably i'm just gonna pull out the paint brush you are just scraping blank canvas at that point there you go this is not how i pictured it in my head well you just keep going kimball there's only one way forward and that's through time actor says both my parents have sister's name dolores now my brother married a dolores oh my god that's so much goodness it's a lot of dolores is going on tricia says he uses oil paints bob ross yeah i can't blend acrylic i can't actually i just can't do it with a palette knife whose idea was it to do this live but if he did he would say we're going to add a happy little cloud here and it immediately dried you know what i could do let's try this did you spread water on your face just a little bit is that some toner yes do you need more paint is that what's happening well i don't know rocky it's my first time doing this look at her she looks like a meat mask catherine sergeant says hey guys hugs hi hugs enjoy this tricia says bob ross likes trees he sure does that is true happy ones though okay we're gonna draw a panicking little tree we're gonna draw an anxious mountain oh my god that's how i would be i like and today we're doing nervous snow snow-capped mountains of delight i feel like this woman is climbing up mount everest and forgot a face mask and she's getting a little pink around the cheeks but she's still trying to look like a model look i might have to abandon no you have to keep going you can't just quit yet well i'm campbell you don't know this could turn out to be something really incredible are you seeing the same thing i i just know your i abilities i think i've gone beyond my abilities no you've tapped a new one elaine's complimenting jenna's rainbow dress today which is super see because she's like i can't be bothered to watch the horror movie on screen i mean if you're anything like me you're just like very interested to see how this is going to turn out it's like when you watch lost and you're like what's in the hatch give me the mermaid when the next season comes you're like who are the others and then the whole season ends and you're like i was just pointing so you're saying no you got to turn this around kibble turn the painting around i don't know what i'm doing and it says campbell don't give up well i mean i would just pull out the brush and make her pretty yeah yeah what if someone took like a pile of hair and just like stuck it on the wet acrylic to do her hair ew okay don't i didn't say it was a good idea i just said what if here do you want an almond thing no i'm too distracted and panicking just get a base on and then start doing some like heavy strokes of where things would be in my mind she was beautiful is that what you're gonna say if we ever have a child [Laughter] no all right if anybody has any tips on how to paint with a palette knife because all i could picture is doing snow-capped mountains with it okay well i'm gonna catch you up on some comments here noah says in college i used to get drunk watching bob ross and then go to art history class that sounds like a good time elaine says kimball you keep going on like your last video okay you kept going on your last video keep going but i kept changing the product rachel says you two are hilarious to be the fly on the walls and hear you talk every day i think you'd all be really scared actually just yeah rocky and his little like i'm going to sneak videotape kim doing really random things apparently i'm very funny and i don't know it i think you're hilarious because kimble gets all like eccentric sometimes i can hear him making sounds in the other room so i just start recording in case he does something all i did wasn't talking about the treadmill when you did the last time you were like like to yourself in the other room i was like oh i have to record whatever's happening oh my god have you guys seen the movie leather face cause this is this is that's not your one this is a whole vibe right here um we also will just spontaneously break out into the same song out of nowhere yeah what were we singing this morning i don't know that was weird it's not like it's unusual it's not unusual and then dolores says hi jenna i'm loving your craft room me too i'm 75 and only known the other two two other dolores and they spelled their name dolores like d-o-l-o and they spell their name dolores as they share well you'll turn it around you know everything goes through an ugly phase just like your childhood just excuse you that did not call for a weezy laugh it wasn't that funny you were the cutest little kid i know i used to be blonde that's all actually i used to have like vibrant red hair when i was a baby baby hair do you want a pepper cheerio no i want to know how to do this campbell just think of your time in italy and what that inspired you and then just go go where i don't know go somewhere quickly i need to i don't have oh i do have a white-ish color i'm so excited about this piece don't forget her hair well you know i'm just gonna do what i did to my other piece that i didn't like burn it up no i can't do it i painted over it oh i think you could still do something that's a nice foundation under there yeah this is just the under painting as us professionals call it missy says you all were singing tom jones song yes we were we'll see the thing is i don't know who tom jones is but he's the one that wrote it's not unusual well i figured because that's the song we're saying here kimball you have to capture this in your mouth ready one two oh i dropped it if you could throw it that way two three oh i'll eat that later don't worry yeah look for that later i don't know i'm really busy i'm an artist okay well i'm a scavenger why did i picture like this i didn't think it was going to be like so difficult if we find the ants up here later i'm not sure why you had better oh you just need like little glops of paint in specific colors and do like single strokes still i get features wait so you know how to do this do you want to come show me i'm just saying look at that nose now that you have like color blocks i feel like you just need to like i think having the paint on that palette actually helps okay and i can like i can kind of make oh wow this is really exciting now now it's exciting i was just trying to get you motivated for what get motivated i think if anyone has ever seen as a mongodb the anime do you understand the reference i'm not i'm sorry it's very obscure i need to find are you it no are you no it's um i thought you were saying a color name jessica yes but that is going to come out so fast if you squeeze that like that inappropriate right i'm just saying this tube of paint oh that's what's happening here you want me to poke it it'll help get it out you need to stop with your well i wasn't doing anything i was trying to help you no one's putting me out in 300 second timeout so that's true highlight there you go there she's really coming together now i'm just gonna scrub in some white there just so i know there's there's paint it exists missy says i'm the artistic director and then does not put the laughing violently face what color are her lips do you want to take a deep breath it's already fine you want to take a deep something a deep dive into your emotions god i can't handle it i'm almost done with this entire thing of tea and i cuz you're stressed drinking you're freaking out watching the second one this is how we do it she done what's happening don't laugh though because this is these are the important strokes wow it like hurt my tooth well it's because you have weak teeth kimble tell everyone about the whitening toothpaste you bought um i bought whitening toothpaste oh there you go story told i usually get act no i usually get um like the princess bubble gum flavored toothpaste because it's good like i hate i hate mint toothpaste i hate the taste of mint unless it's coated in chocolate so her lips are coated in chocolate i like your attitude no it looks good [Laughter] don't make me laugh a serious artist at work yes it seems to be doing exactly what you want yes would you say yeah i can't you tell i have mastered i'm definitely trusting you if you come and do my makeup like for sure so i was inspired by the joker and no no no no that's the wrong color we're gonna try this now i just i'm waiting for jenna's update to be like if you're just joining us kimball's getting more and more frantic she's like if you're just joining us i'm sorry um noah says he uses me re-minimal re-mineralizing toothpaste from japan well that sounds expensive and exotic what cambodia it has to be working somewhat so it looks like a face over there yeah you're just really close maybe i should um see it from my point of view i love you you're doing great uh it's your first time ever using a palette knife and you're really using it probably not in the best way intended well it's a palette if it's for mixing paint on the palette well you're using and mountains paint on a canvas now um it just reminded me of parker posey when she he's like i can't remember where her dad says she's like oh thanks dad you're about as funny as a heart attack and then she's like oh thanks dad yeah left hand that's not working why won't you do it i won't that's it we're scrubbing it in campbell's like a control person when it comes to art so this is like definitely i mean it's looking like lips it's better than i could do with a paintbrush if it makes you feel any better it makes you feel good doesn't it loads okay you want to see that let's just i'm gonna give her bigger lips now smudged oh honey ate a corn dog before her lips set that's well rachel says i think it looks great and then mr lulu says the lipstick is looking good but would you do your lips like this [Laughter] i'm going to have some sugar that i'm going to go she is looking better slowly but shortly or she said she's licking butter i'm not sure all right how is that explain describe what are you tasting what are you feeling where are you where are you they know how to make candy better than i know how to paint the palette that's for sure um tiramisu oh pusheen break uh show pushing to the camera hurry he's over there no you got to grab no i need to dribble here i'll help you you know this is going to take like six years of paint so i know right here i'll help you this is look he's looking for better taste in art right here there he goes look at that you your wheezy laugh tonight there you go thank you wait let me put him where everyone can actually see him because i think it's important there he goes you know it's going really scary i think it's because i'm not good with the palette knife well rachel says are you going to define with colored pencils yes she's going to need some definition a defining moment can't wait until he gets the eyes oh me too looking forward to it really oh um i mean i can put those in right now i don't think it's gonna hurt anything we'll start we'll just give her a green base actually let's give her like aqua eyes [Music] are you gonna mix on there and then take it i'm gonna try isn't that what people do i'll see if i can show you guys what he's working with here um even though it's like not focused very well there we go so he's focusing or he's doing his mixing on that professional cut a roll isn't that what bob does well she's coming for my soul [Music] okay well i was going for teal but she has green eyes now that's why she matches your shirt oh i'm so ready to bust out some paint brushes i think she's ready for your pant brushes but are you really done with the palette knife can we still have eyebrows to do well that could be a good one for the palette knife i'm bringing out the dark color so we're gonna we're gonna really get into it now see that into it the confidence rachel says do you sell your originals um no i just throw them in the closet i how would that make you feel if you were thrown in the closet camel i would sell my original if i thought people wanted them i feel like you have hard time letting go of your originals some of them i do but if i can if i know i'm gonna get rid of it then i don't grow an attachment to it but do you put as much effort yes okay because my name's on it i want it to actually look like my work rachel says smaller palette knife question mark don't question me um well i can use this the edge of this one for doing details probably yeah cause i just bought a pack of really cheap ones and i thought oh this will be fun to do and you you weren't wrong i wasn't wrong i think it's doing exactly what you wanted absolutely this is what i was going for i feel like this is more of an art challenge at this point because at any point you could pick up a paintbrush and just don't tempt me i mean i really do want to pick up a paintbrush i know but you have so much to do do i i mean with that if it was just super thick paint the whole time oh it dried me nuts we're gonna put in a happy little jawline right here jawline we're going to carve in a nice happy little jawline um i think rachel wants to buy this one says missy i mean okay again this could end up being your favorite piece you've ever done well you don't know at this point that is true that is i don't know at this point well at which point do we have the orange carrot cake um that's shelf stable and from italy you know i'm ready you're ready i have shaky hands already so load me up with some sugar i will feed you i know you already had a bite of this from the other day so it's not like an exciting completely new experience but oh i think what make sure i didn't flick paint in my coffee all right there it is campbell don't eat the wrapper okay and that's delicious it tastes like fresh fresh oranges elaine says this one really could go in the fridge like it looks like a first grader did it or all right we're getting you know i want to say the siri right all right we're just putting blue on here rachel says why do you say get rid of your art is amazing and to some people a real treasure thank you just like you no i added why do you say get rid of i don't know because it takes up a lot of space i mean instead of my journals that doesn't but like like this i don't know the other paintings i do they usually just chill under my desk or in a closet [Music] because you ended up printing a bunch of things out that we hung up like on canvas right yeah that's right left-handed palette knife challenge i mean it seems to be working i'm so glad i didn't cut myself when i was chopping veggies earlier missy says she's starting to give me shenanigan vibes i just added hair it could just be oh yeah it could just be a background but now you can tell it's hairs nothing compares nothing to blue hair wow hey that was no legit wow like wow that's so deep and meaningful it's what i thought i know sometimes it's hard to like gauge how i'm saying something whether you're being facetious or not where's my phone i have to send a group text to my work peeps why because don't leave me in my time of absolute insecurity he'll be back he always comes back he came back rocky i'm terrified of this can i switch to a brush now no you're fine i'm going to switch it to a brush now did i say you could switch it i don't want to does it matter what i say no okay we'll do whatever you want then palette knife total success i think we can all agree i was just using the palette for an under painting i'm gonna try a brush now okay you go for it and then maybe i'll bring the palette knife back in because i'm kind of feeling like it's a fail i'm sorry go ahead no what's happening mr giggles i just it's not a fail it's not a fail i tried really hard i'm not done though i'll practice we'll do this again someday what are you where's my um rachel says i would love a video on your originals show them to us okay someday all right let's get down to business still keeping it sloppy jenna says it's not a fail because it's not finished well the palanexa fail i feel like if you were doing some other like form of art that wasn't a face or if you're doing something super abstract it would be fine but i feel like the fact you're trying to a detailed person like i feel like that'd be really hard with the palette knife with acrylic specifically i think just the hardest part for me was working on canvas like the texture it was hard to get it to lay down evenly i didn't think that through i was going to use a canvas board because this is like you know pushes in can you do it on something really smooth and non-porous i don't know these are all things we're going to have to look into you have to paint on glass next week i hate you okay look now i'm going to like change the title to try painting with a palette knife and that was awful i'm just gonna get a little moist helps it smooth out a little bit sorry i'm writing a text i'll be right back with you that's okay i feel like everyone's upset and judging me no they're not rachel says i could never ever make a paint and palette knife make that not a fail thank you it was a good first time i mean who knows maybe i'll maybe i'll figure something out and do it better next time i forgot that i drew her face diagonally i'm not upset about it i mean it was actually fun it's just i want to have some kind of piece when i'm done peace of mind rocky yes campbell how dare you do work stuff well just give me one minute i'll be right back with you oh the blue is definitely still wet okay maybe she's just has like a syphilis like the red eye sofia rye it's like stretching all the way out to the ether with cat like i or sophia lovren i is that what's her name jennifer coolidge yes what was that from though um it's from best in show i think okay i know i was just about to say i wish i had some music playing but on account of the copyrights can i play your music probably but it might still ask for a copyright approval true true true oh my god i'm so close to just pulling out watercolors by the way acrylics not my jam i mean i like acrylics i just i'm not very very good at them i enjoy playing with them but i like watercolors the best moisturize sweetheart moisturize she's coming together to replenish the pimple have you decided what her name is yet oh she wasn't planned i can't tell if this is the dark how about not planjula she's not a drag queen all right coming in i feel like it's very quiet tonight oh that's well that's purple she now has a five o'clock shadow you're welcome get into the groove what you doing over there rocky well i people are responding to this work message now i have to respond back uh responsibility rachel says mermaid markers question mark um please yes third jane davenport product they are like dyed ink inside of an aqua brush so they're kind of like a watercolor it's like a loaded aqua brush with like watercolors she looks a hot mess rocky she looks really weird on the screen she looks much warmer here she looks very dead over there noah says i know what the problem is you didn't use teal that's true well there's still time i think i'm not used to doing a big painting like this i think i'm just making excuses like i need a bigger brush all right this is what it's coming down to acrylics are done okay we're moving on to do you need to dry it yeah i'm going to collect myself okay uh i'm gonna use mermaid markers okay on acrylics then i'll use maybe shiny acrylics on top save the keep those out my water is already dirty i haven't even done anything with it more coffee rachel says use it on the girl and then noah says it's teal time i might do teal colored pencils we're gonna do just a little drawing i'm just gonna drag a little bit who's this is a disaster is it yes you've got it have you been watching i have been watching i don't think you've been i don't think you could i've been present the whole time 100 what's her name exactly oh i asked you earlier and you said she didn't have one i made one up so speak to me how do we fix you oh all right i'm out of this so i'm gonna refill it with some of this okay i don't know if anyone can see that but it sounds good you may hold this okay i'm holding it good job so i'm gonna unscrew this let me face the label so everyone can see it oh so i'm refilling it with incredible ink okay which is not mermaid marker ink i'm putting just a little bit in there because it's a strong color okay and then you add water or yeah and we add water that's the easiest way to do it yes listen all right we're going to add water probably spill it all over myself that's fine [Music] just a little bit as long as you don't get dye on yourself it's just water let's probably diluted enough what are the loot annoying i was just about to say that but i was busy scratching my back i know how you can't talk when you scratch your back i was really concentrating all right give that a little shake let's find out how dark this is that's probably the old color but you know it'll just transform as it goes there you go i think that's in line with this painting go what is ahead transform as it goes [Music] all right putting this aside putting my awesome palette knife aside putting that aside think of it this way kimball whatever this turns out to be you're painting your new best friend okay so this whatever this turns out to be that's gonna be your new best friend for life girl i am so sorry you get to hang out this first person you see every morning you guys have coffee together be a doll you refresh that milky water sure you can dump that in the toilet and then you know all right i'm gonna lay down some oh it's very berry colored on the plus side it does lay down nicely on this hopefully the acrylics are actually dry did you refill the water fresh water style i didn't even hear did you dump it out in the sink no i did it in the toilet per instructions because i'm a good listener thank you elaine says yes she's a transformer well she is more than meets the eye elaine says pretty girl in disguise the nicest thing that anyone's ever said about her what's your best friend's name again what was the first show you guys ever binge watched uh until we meet again wow i'm not talking about me i'm talking about her she doesn't even have eyes yet like what are we supposed to watch poor girl's like i her eyes are so dry she doesn't even have highlights okay um bringing out the scary dark purple actually before i do the scary dark oh just do a little purple in the mouth there we go dry that so it doesn't totally bleed into it can i save her i think so i don't come back sweetie come back all right moment of silence for her lips shh everyone be really quiet rachel says her name is rocky rookie that's how your ex manager used to say your name she technically wasn't my manager she was the store manager well she liked you the most i don't know about that i do okay this color is very what says her name is pelatina blair palutina palatina for palette knife and then blair for blair witch i'm not sure well i didn't come with anything so palutena blair it is palatina i think it's a beautiful name nora gigi says hi hi gigi welcome to my mess welcome to campbell's horror remember when i thought i was gonna clean up her lips so i like got all crazy with it

want to do right now talk about how awful it was that's a good like six minute video i have forever now a little collection for you i have to remember that like this isn't watercolor paper but like i treat it like it is come through palatina come through speaks with all these speeches do you think there was an art teacher watching this she'd be like what the hell are you doing yes and you'd be like shut up if my art teacher was watching this they'd be like what the hell are you doing i think they would like don't question me they'd be like he's learned nothing [Music] [Laughter] i would beg to differ i think you've learned how to turn everything around turn the beat around because i have to i just like to create problems for myself and then try and fix them through pluckiness and i'm not sure why you want to just let me create the problems i don't know if you want to create a problem okay we're getting somewhere i'm feeling it i'm feeling it we're going to bring some pinky cheekies in it oh you're juicy oh i can't get you one oh don't cry honey you're gonna ruin your makeup you're awesome flawless makeup what you doing over there rocky i'm just observing you're ignoring me yes absolutely that's what come down to noah says she keeps whispering don't listen to rocky you can only trust me in the knife oh i'm scared now she's gotten violent painting big is hard like i'm so used to like journal work what about the other painting you did it's right over there it's bigger than this one i don't know what is it look behind you well that was fun it's because you didn't start with a palette knife oh i tell ya rachel says she agrees with me about it doesn't matter she says about you turning things around turn the people why it's not getting stuck in my head now um i feel like i should if i told you you had 150 viewers would that make you nervous at all no if i was like wow it's the most people have ever tuned into your life kimball so six no 23. it's not the most but i'm just saying it'd be funny if this was your like breakout vlog or your breakout live session make it go viral i can just see the headline now struggling artist and we all laugh at him like is that you it's me kicking i was like there's a peddler outside the beds around the roof okay you need to go to the eyebrow shop what are those places called the um i'm trying to think of threading oh my god maria and her getting her eyebrows threaded that looked really painful i don't think it is though i'm pretty sure it is doesn't just rip your hair out i don't know i think it just like twists out until it's straight and have any of you had eyebrow threading or like i don't know hair threading leave a comment down below i just want to is it painful it looks really painful to me who's that what oh crunch you look really alarmed well it didn't sound natural okay so i'm tempted okay okay okay i'm gonna i'm gonna um i'm gonna do something we're gonna paint on this part first because then it'll be like plastic noah says palatino blair de la vine de la vignette and then denise says super painful at first about the threading uh like painful like like the beginning of it and then it kind of goes numb because it's so painful or like the first time is the worst and then after that it's like when you go to the shop again after you've already had it done yeah like did i feel like i feel like it's a tattoo the first like two seconds is like ow and then it's like it goes numb because it's like just don't feel anymore she says yes initially painful ah she has a lot more purple on one side than the other why'd you do that to yourself well it's just a lighting kimbo that's right um time for a random pusheen break this time oh my god i'm gonna just try and even out some of this nonsense up here who did you bring to the party we've got the little evil dragon pusheen all right she says it feels like a bee stings after well it stinks is that what it feels like bee stings after the first time oh i've never been stung by me lucky well that's because when i see them i go running and they all just laugh at you kimball fine with me well i thought i was going to even it out but no okay well there's pillow knife work under there somewhere she's so cute all right now we're pulling it maybe the blue part by your ear just like refining it a bit more because it's like sticking down so much well i'll probably use i might pull out my big fat watch sharpie there you go thank you marker and do like some big chunky lines that might be fun let's fill in this down here what color should this just area be that could be teal if you need some teal on there or you could do something warmer maybe yellow you're just waiting for me to say yellow oh it's still wet oh get off my brush you ewing why would you well you're going to get some teal down there now destroy my life like that how is that blue it's still wet it's been out there first probably probably and then we're going to add just a couple dabs of you rachel says that it went numb unless she had her eyebrows threaded uh that's what i think would happen that's how i imagine it anyway everyone's different i know but that's how i think it would happen with me look it is teal kinda green okay it's it's the underpainting it's like her eyebrow our eye her eye color see that's what i was going for nothing but professional here i always stain the canvas you know color something happened i don't know i lost my train of thought i don't all i know is everything in this piece was intentional um obviously have you ever seen how i work everything leading to this moment was exactly you thought i was panicking didn't you no i planned it from the very beginning i'm not good i'm an actor if that goes in my coffee here just one more here can i oh no let's let me see if i can throw it in your face wait i have to get the one that's way down here okay well you know little cat treats if somebody walks in right now

awkward one second all right try that up so we can layer some colors actually i can put in the stock real quick stock start off really watery i'm back if you were wondering i wasn't because i sensed your presents then i thought he's back perry says the heck you drawn onions for oh so in a challenge i gave kimble a couple weeks ago um we had an onion that was kind of growing some green out the top some stock so kimball drew drew it and made it like a little onion boy and so now it has kept growing and has been with us for like three weeks and it's growing into a teenager at this point so kimball is drawing the evolved version i love how it's growing into a teenager like that's how they do oh you sure do he's got his little mohawk happening april is onion season his birthday is coming up that's what noah said all right my water is very full of binder stuff i'm not sure how onion kid has remained so vibrant and healthy i know we never feed him he just sits there by our bananas i like more checking out and the like automated lady's like weigh your bananas take your bananas i'm like i'm going to go bananas trisha laughed at something that you said because i'm hilarious sometimes are you just opting not to show his like little old peel part sticking out the back no i just okay i mean it's still wet i had to paint this front part first i got you oh god it's your creation kimbo well then shut your beautiful little mouth i'm a teenager look at my little teenage sprout happening back here all the cool kids have one it's not sexy not everything is sexy when

for the last video when kimball painted last time when he painted onion boy and now our onion has grown into a full-grown teenager so he's updating it because that needed to happen it was kimball's idea no and then before this he was he painted an entire piece using only palette knives yeah not really no i tried it was an utter fail but that's all right that's how we learn i learned i hate palette knives i recommend just going to the five minute mark of the live and then skipping to like the 50 minute mark to see the transformation because you'll be like wait am i on the same video well yeah i had to bust out some other art stuff texture our teenager he's getting so grown up right before you know he's gonna leave the house before you know we're gonna chop him up and put him in the front pan no we're not i feel like he's gonna be like really gross i know we're keeping him until he's an old man for sure okay all right well i need to add a little more extra oomph to his stalks what are these car are these stocks is that what we're calling these i don't even know i didn't even know onions did this can we all just take one more look at how like what when and how did this happen well we took really good care of it it just started one day and we were like well we can't get rid of it now i know i was like do we put in the dirt like do we keep them i think we should plant

about children's brain nutrition and their brain health optimizing children's brain health right and our speaker today is deep kill she is the co-founder of glamour and purpose and she is a health coach a personal trainer and a yoga instructor and deep is going to take us through a whole lot of different information but this is really a very interactive session so i think you guys are going to have a lot of fun uh so welcome deep great to have you here hi everyone so let me just share my screen here we go can you guys see this yes perfect all right welcome everyone my name is deep and i am the holistic health coach and i'm also certified early childhood educated so i have worked with children for over nine years especially aged uh zero to five years old so it it's this topic is very near and dear to me i'm really passionate about children's health and what impacts their health so i'm really excited you all are here and just like simmer said this is a very interactive session so there will be lots of questions and answers and you can put your answers in the chat and so yeah so let's get going right all right so today's topic is optimizing children's brain with nutrition so what you will learn the challenges facing children's health the role of nutrition in optimizing children's health and cognitive skills role of nutrition in helping children regulate their behavior deal with stress and better thinking ability and easy solutions for happy healthy children so chill or quickly during their early years done at any other time so it's when they learn the skills and behaviors that will stick with them for the rest of their lives so this means supporting a healthy brain is important for establishing a smart start for your child's future so this is really really important so checking facts about children's nutrition so there are so many different theories and ideas that people have like what works what doesn't work so mixing fables and internet fallacies blurs the line between facts and fiction and that's damaging because we can't make smart decisions without accurate information so what we're going to do is it's going to be like a quiz session so we will go through different questions that normally people have when they're like dealing with okay what what can children eat what cannot they eat right so let's discuss some children's nutrition topics so you sort facts from fiction already so the first question it's okay for kids to have lollies they run around so much so what do you think is it true or false you can put your answer in the chat and simmer will go through the chat so i'm just gonna wait for like 10 seconds go ahead just write true or false whatever you feel is completely okay okay we have false sometimes sometimes maybe occasionally false true sometimes perfect all right so it's okay for kids to have lollies they run around so much it's false let's just go through why we don't want that happening so artificial dyes flavors and preservatives in processed foods can significantly impact attention and focus so take them completely out of your kids diet that's right you really want to see that you know all of this artificial stuff can really impact them if your kid is having attention and focus problems even little sip of cool blue gatorade like it's an energy drink or that one little bag of flamin hot cheetos once a week at soccer practice can be enough to impact their focus and attention at school for the rest of their week so can you believe it it's a huge impact compared to what little like you know even if they're eating little amount it can it can cause a huge impact to the rest of their attention span all right so the next one pancakes and maple syrup for breakfast is healthy true or false and anything you say is completely okay okay so we have true um false false sometimes false false false false false alrighty pancakes and maple syrup for big fossils healthy so that's again fault so many kids with attention and focus issues suffer from blood sugar swings high sugar diets have been found to increase inattention in some kids so eating simple carbs like pancakes and metals maple syrup for breakfast skyrockets their blood sugar insulin changes their blood sugar to try to bring it back down to normal levels but overshoot so blood sugar crashes kids get cranky melts down or totally lose focus and clay more sugar to get back to the baseline so they eat quick sugar fix snack like goldfish or pretzel or fruit juice which again skyrockets their blood sugar and the cycle begins all over again so this is really really key and and it's just like you know once you have this kind of start with the especially with the breakfast you have those simple curves of course once that cycle starts it's going to happen again and again and again on your kit basically throughout the day your kid doesn't have that focus to actually do the task that they need to do because they are dealing with this sugar swing that is constantly happening all right so let's see in case you have any questions about this you can just put it in the chat as well so who's seen this sugar swing happen to their kid after a birthday party or a cake juice or candy candy feeding frenzy so i'm sure you all have seen this happen i used to work with kids every single day and i knew it there used to be like one birthday happening every second day and we knew it that today is the birthday and we know what we have to deal with it's it's it's very common to see your kids going clearly after the sugar but if we are feeding them for breakfast like every other day so you can imagine they have to go through that in time for the entire day and almost every single day they are going through that so we don't want that happening all right so the next thing is healthy breakfast is filled with healthy protein and fat true or false do we have anybody saying anything let me check true true true yes true true yes a lot of a lot of truth coming on yes that's true the protein and fat slow down how quickly sugar is absorbed from a digestive tract into our bloodstream so blood sugar rises slowly and steadily instead of skyrocketing and setting them off on that blood sugar roller coaster right so eggs nitrate-free free bacon sausages nuts seed butters seed butters and are all great protein options for breakfast so you want to make sure that the breakfast that you're giving your kids does include a healthy protein and a healthy source of fat if your child isn't sensitive to dairy then half cup of full fat greek yogurt packs in a whopping 10 grams of protein so and if your child just isn't a big breakfast eater then just making a fruit and veggie smoothie with greek yogurt or protein powder is another alternative so instead of eating breakfast they can just drink their smoothie and you can pack nutrients into a single smoothie all right so we want to make it easy for children we want to make it yummy but we do want to include healthy sources of food in their diet so the next thing is juice is as healthy as whole fruit true or false we have false false false false balls too much sugar false okay so juices as healthy as whole fruit falls you all are so smart juice is convenient and tasty but the amount of sugar in most juices the lack of fiber and differing epigenetic impacts make whole food the healthier choice the fiber is the main driver of these interferences and it's well known that fiber consumption impacts your microbiome and in turn the absorption of some nutrients so juices i know it just seems like um sort of like a convenient option i think that we'll just take take the juice drink the juice sometimes we just feel like if the kid is not having uh what you call that lots of fruits and stuff so juice could be like easier but it is also full of sugar so the so the impact is going to be the same on their blood sugar swing so making a smoothie with yogurt and then putting like a couple of fruits in it could be benefit because then that would have fiber in it as well so smoothies are better than just plain juices okay so the next thing breakfast is the most important meal of the day true or false true true true true false true true i don't know true true okay perfect breakfast is the most important meal of the day true so studies have linked breakfast to academic performance memory healthy weight mood and more and there's something to be said for starting the day off with the balance of healthy foods getting protein complex carbs healthy fats and whole grains with healthy fiber provides a good foundation for the day and can keep your kids full the healthy balanced approach also avoids crashes that could be caused by sugary cereals so that's another thing like you know with the cereals you want to make sure they don't have sugar in it like just check the ingredients on the boxes because that's another thing it's like early in the morning they're like off with the sugars all right next thing kids just don't like vegetables true or false false true true maybe true for the most part the kids just don't like vegetables that's fault so nobody is born hating vegetables but pop culture friends anecdotes might have new parents believing all kids automatically hate healthy foods right like broccoli or carrots some children and adults are picky eaters and this pickiness can result in kids lacking dietary balance and getting more calories from sugar than they should so but early exposure to vegetables and other health foods can make a big difference to a child's life so you want to make sure you're exposing them to healthy snacks right in the beginning your child isn't predisposed to vegetable hatred but taste developed early can have long-term consequences so it's kind of like having that taste so if they haven't had um say what a lot of sugary treats in their early years they're they're not going to be like that much craving sugar all the time and the same goes with vegetables if and like you know in their early years they get those veggies they they get the taste of it they are going to keep loving it they're going to keep wanting to have those so definitely introduce your children to vegetables all right so another kids can get all the nutrients they need from their food true or false i wish true false maybe okay false depending on how you cook okay great anybody else all right all right the kids can get all the nutrients they need from their food that's false due to mass production of food and other practices there is a huge nutrition gap that we are dealing with and this is as true for children like like you know as it is for us so i'm gonna just share about the nutrition gap all right so when it comes to nutrition gap there are so many different things that impact the way the food is like you know the kind of food we get in the market now the first picture if you see here it's a earth summit soil mineral depletion analysis so the in 1900s our soil was like full of minerals and nutrients but now there are only few of these nutrients left in the soil so this is from the earth summit soil what you call the analysis you can check this on the google um most if you see 85 percent of the soil is depleted in north america south america 75 asia 76 percent australia 55 percent so most of the nutrients are missing from the soils and if they are not in the soil we don't get them in the vegetables and if they're not in the vegetables we don't get it either right so that's the first thing and it's the most important one and the another is farming practices because of the mass production we have people like you know they're spraying so many pesticides and so many other sprays are happening on the on the vertical fields and they don't just go away you know like that even if you wash them like multiple times some of the preservatives are still going to be in the food so that's another thing third is genetic modification and this is really scary because so many of our food that we find in the market in the in the in the in the stores that look like really like you know healthy and you can just eat it sometimes they are genetically modified like my mom she went and she got these bananas from like a farmer's shop kind of place and she ate it and within like half an hour or so her tongue just fall up and within a couple of days those bananas just shrink shrunk down to like half of their size so it just shows that there's so many like you know modifications getting done to the food just to make it ripen faster and they so they it can be sold so that's another thing we are dealing with and then loss of quality in the shipping we are getting fruits that are not you know that are not uh what you call that available in our countries and but the quality how much nutrition do we think it's going to be in that food right i mean it's amazing that we want to be eating healthy but still we want to see the nutrition value in the food that we are eating so another thing use of medicine these days like while i was working with kids i had so many parents dealing with this thing that every time the child would get sick the doctors would like you know recommend antibiotics or something like that and that impacts their digestive system so much and that is another reason like you know why we want to be like you know why the gap is there and we want to be having a lot more nutrition in our diet another is changing habits so many of us are busy and sometimes we just like you know okay let's go we want our kids to enjoy life as well so if they want to eat out or something once in a while then yes we want to be able to do that we can't micromanage each and every meal and see that each and every nutrient is present so that's another thing that's happening and then preservatives frozen foods and then as they grow up we know that there's al so this nutrition gap is huge when it comes to like what we are eating and what we actually need so most of our antioxidants and nutrition we get from fruits and vegetables so recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables is 8 to 13 servings per day and a lot of the kids they don't like to do that they don't eat that many servings per day it's just crazy so yes that's another thing that we have to deal with so when it comes to children's nutrition i will go through few of the main vitamins that are really important a few of the main nutrients so the first is vitamin b12 so can you just check the chat to see if there are any questions or anything else that's there no questions at the moment nathan said that a lot of adults don't like to do that either yes yes we are dealing with the same thing all right vitamin b12 unfortunately vitamin b12 deficiency is common around the world this creates problem for breastfeeding infants these infants only sorts of vitamin b12 from is from their mother who is possible may be deficient herself and vitamin b12 plays an important role in neural development children whose mothers have a deficiency are unknowingly negatively impacting their children's brain function during critical developmental periods so this is really important when it comes to the vitamin b12 that we want especially if your kid is an infant we would want moms to be uh getting that nutrition even if they have to supplement so that their kid gets hit another omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids so research has shown positive effects of essential fatty acids both omega-3 and omega-6 in children with attention and reading difficulties so new research shows that these fats could improve reading ability in mainstream school children foods high in omega-3 include fish nuts flax seeds leafy vegetables most omega-6 fatty acids in the diet are obtained from vegetable oils the modern diet is particularly low in omega-3 fatty acids which are important for signal transmission between nerve cells and the regulation of signaling systems in the brain so in a three-month study researchers saw a significant improvement in breeding skills after the first three months in children taking the omega 3 6 fatty acids compared to the placebo so while no children diagnosed with add adhd were included in the study those children with mild attention problems achieved greater improvements in certain tests such as faster reading after taking the real supplements so this is really really important to see like you know our brain is mostly made up of fat so we want to include that in our diet like you know we want our kids to have that source every single day so if they're not getting it from the diet then we want to include that supplement into their food or every single day that they're eating and that is directly related with the way your brain is functioning the way your attention span is the way your focus is so which is why it shows that okay reading reading what you call that they have like improvements in reading and attention and all that when they include omega-3 and omega-6 in their diet consistently for three months so within like few months you will see the result okay the next one iodine the children of women with low iodine were 60 more likely to have scores in the lowest 25 percent for verbal iq reading accuracy and reading comprehension than children from mothers with higher iodine levels so when the group with low iodine was further subdivided it was determined that the lower the mother's iodine level the more likely their scores were to be in the lowest group so this is also really really important nutrient for kids to get every single day this study showed that even mild iodine deficiency is a preventable cause of mental impairment in children so in order to prevent fetal iodine deficiency an intake of at least 200 to 300 mcg per day of iodine before throughout pregnancy and during lactation should be encouraged so it's really important for the monks to take iodine so the kids get it as well iodine supports normal growth and development by helping the thyroid gland to do its job so that means releasing hormones important for healthy brain development protein synthesis metabolic metabolic function and enzymatic activity already so this is where we come to use animals this animal is a children's nutrition supplement it's from usana i will cover later why we are talking about usana here but let's go through these animals these animals are carefully formulated to deliver the nutritional support you're growing child ages 2 to 12 needs they provide a wide spectrum of benefits supports healthy immune function provides b vitamins plus choline to support healthy brain development and function support strong bones in teeth with calcium magnesium and vitamin d includes iron thiamine and b12 to support energy provide cellular protection with fruit powders in the antioxidant phytonutrient complex each animal's tablet is made without artificial flavors or sweeteners so you'll be excited to give it to them too so this is so important there is no sweeteners in there or artificial flavors a lot of children supplements they come with a lot of sugar in it so that the children would actually eat it basically that's one of the reasons why the sugar is there but we want to have at the supplement which would support their health but it's also like we don't want those sweeteners in there we don't want that extra sugar we already we want to keep our supplements and our food clean all right so the key ingredients is vitamin a c d e and k b vitamin complex so entire of the b vitamins calcium iron iodine magnesium zinc antioxidant phytonutrient complex so this is really really important that kids get that nutrient so so deep the next thing yep have this question that a couple of people have actually asked me what kind of protein like you talked about smoothies so what kind of protein is good for children that children can actually have in their smoothies just so that they're eating a healthy breakfast especially for kids that are really picky so you have the greek yogurt like full greek the proper greek yogurt and that one is really good because you can just mix it with few fruits and you just add that no i can have that sorry i wasn't clear in my question they were asking are there any uh protein powders that could be good for kids okay so when it comes to kids the cleanest one is the best so i would recommend checking the protein powders from usana because they're all your stuff is like pharmaceutical grade which means no additives fillers and all the crazy ingredients that we don't want our kids getting near and it also is like a full meal replacement not just like protein because i don't think so kids need a lot of that kind of protein the way we do uh so definitely check i will i can share that at the end of the session and yeah otherwise the natural if you can get natural ingredients that's also really good but when it comes to powders yes you can give them um but i would recommend usana because it's really really clean and it's really healthy and i've seen my friends give their kids the shakes like mix it with fruits and it's yummy and so yeah so i would highly recommend that because it's it's clean protein and it's pharmaceutical grade and it's really healthy for them and they start to develop the taste for other food as well so that's really important another thing i want to say is that once kids start getting the nutrients they need they will stop craving those added sugars like you know the cakes and the muffins and all that crazy stuff because their body will actually have the nutrition it needs and so your brain if you don't get the nutrition you need your brain keeps signaling you you're hungry and once you're hungry you're either gonna go for something salty or something sugary so that's really important because when kids are hungry they're gonna run for chips or like you know candy or or something like that like if you give them a jam toast or fruit they will pick the jam toast for sure so if they have the good nutrition over time they're gonna stop craving a lot of that other stuff as well they will crave more healthy foods as well that's also another thing i wanted to share all right so the next thing is why is omega-3 supplement important for kids so the daily fish oil supplementation has been found to significantly improve attention and focus help kids to think more clearly and reduce hyperactivity and behavioral problems so studies have found that fish oil supplementation can reduce adhd symptoms by as much as 50 percent so this is really important like especially if your kid is already hyperactive you want them to stay away from all that sugary stuff because that is again causing the same hyperactivity and another adding fish oil is gonna it's gonna give their brain the fats that it needs and they it this is gonna help with the focus with the attention with like calming down so over half of the brain is fat and dha is the most concentrated poly unsaturated fat in the brain eyes and nervous system so by feeding your child's body the dha needs biomega helps support the proper structure and function of the developing brain this structural support of brain cells help them relay information and may help support many aspects of cognitive development so it's really really important so these are few of them learning ability vocabulary acquisition listening comprehension acute memory attention and concentration so we want our kids to get all of this ample quantity behavior and mood so there are a lot of kids that have like you know going up and down just don't know what is happening they don't know what is happening and a lot of it is related to the food they are eating every single day right yeah i belong i check i check my mail i haven't checked you okay i shall i rush it don't shower okay let me just say is somebody asking questions no i've mailed it okay thank you all right so this biomega is another it's omega-3 supplement and kids can have this it's also uh what you call the double distilled supplement so which means it's mercury tested there is no other like you know there's no metals in it or all that crazy stuff so when it comes to kids we just want everything like you know pure pure nutrition pure food and when it comes to supplements they have to be pure all right so when it comes to usana why i recommend usana is because it's pharmaceutical grade which means superior ingredients hundred percent ingredients on the label are in each and every tablet for the capsule containing it contains no binders fillers xcpn substances used as dilute w tends for drug like dyes or unknown substances and the quality is exceptionally high so when it all the other supplements like you know that i've seen most of them in the market are food grade so what happens with food grade is 20 percent of the required ingredients if they're in the bottle it's fast so there could be additives in there binders fillers so the quality is like it's it's questionable like what is the quality of this thing right so which would you prefer cheap supplement which is not properly absorbed or a slightly more expensive one which is metabolized and used up well so when it comes to supplementation we want pure ingredients in our body we want some that is not going to give us some kind of side effects six years down the line so definitely pharmaceutical grade is the way to go and usana is one of those companies that has pharmaceutical grade nutrition supplements all right so this is a third party research it's a book called new research comparative guide to nutritional supplements it's from the canadian government and this person lives with william he's researched over 1600 products in united states canada and around the world and out of like these are like one some of the main ones that i know of that i've seen in the market and everywhere where this book has been published usana has been of the top quality it's got five star rating which is based on the all the what you call the supplements that are tested for their quality so when it comes to quality usana is really really exceptional so especially when it comes to kids we want the exceptional usada products are also enlisted in major medical publications so they are listed in the men's in the physicians desk reference and in the cps so which is really amazing because the doctors can actually recommend these supplements to the patients as well already so that's the end of it another thing i want to end you with is that exercise is king nutrition as a queen and put them together and you've got a kingdom so when it comes to kids i know i didn't cover much about like anything about the exercise today but make sure they are moving every single day along with healthy food you want to include exercise as well and the more they move the more they are like you know the energy is getting expended and the more happy they are going to be and the more they can have that tension and focus alrighty simmer can you please check the chat are there any questions or any okay so bhavna said that i love the omega from usana my daughter can take the oil as it has lemon oil so no fishy smell and there were a couple of questions for uh you know what's in what kind of fish is used in the oil fields we can't hear you hello can you can you hear me yes we can hear you yes can hear you now okay did you miss what i just said earlier no okay so there was someone asking what fish are used to make the oil for usana and nathan's answered that anchovies and okay so one person said is it good to give honey in the morning to our kids i think with the honey is is a way better resource than the processed sugar so so yeah that should be okay if if not too much yeah it should be okay it depends on i'll just say a little bit of something about that so honey is is is a little bit it's interesting it's like it's like nut butters um because honey can be extremely healthy and very very good for them if it's the right kind so you really want to get locally sourced honey that is not processed because if it's part of your local ecosystem for example bees are one of the most important elements of all ecosystems so the honey that they make is actually very connected to the local biosphere you're the local ecology around you so the if you have a really really good honey that comes local that's locally sourced then you actually get all of the benefits of that that element but you don't want to get honey probably that you get at like the grocery store that has you know like it's shaped like a little bear and you kind of pour on the on the bread or something like that you want to stay away from that i would try to get like raw local honey from you know some from a farmer's market or somewhere if you have like health food shops something like that yeah you want it to be from a good source because a lot of honey these days they also add sugar in there yeah a lot of them are actually pure sugar you just have to be careful but honey is a great option just get the right cut yes and if you have questions about where to check these supplements and all of that so just reach out to the person who invited you they will give you all the information about it and they will let you know like you know where you can where you can find information about the supplements and stuff and when it comes to food especially with the children the clean the cleaner the better okay so there's another question um is banana good for children who are active after 4 pm a lot of my friends stop giving high sugary fruit due to sleep issues banana is a natural source it should be okay yeah and it has fiber any anytime you have anything that has a combination of a naturally occurring sugar like like fructose and fiber the fiber it lowers the impact of the sugar compared to what most people like for example even if ketchup is full of sugar right if you're if you're you're feeding a kid something that has like a little bit of ketchup that they're dipping it in that's going to be more impactful than something like a banana and you know you can make sugary treats like you know like a healthy treat for kids at home like ice blocks whether with what you call that um with just fruits with water just freezing that and they can like you know a lot of kids they love ice blocks and stuff so just having having those instead of the ones that we find in the market which is like full of sugar that's another healthy option like cutting strawberries berries putting all of those into it and then freezing those and same with the ice creams like you know you can make ice cream at home for kids just greek yogurt put some berries and and or banana or something just like you know what you call that mix it up and just let it freeze and kids will have that as a healthy sweet you could add honey to it to add a little bit of sugar so a lot of stuff they can actually have it at home and it's easy to make as well so they have the same stuff they get those treats but at the same time it's healthy so they're not adding loading on that sugar awesome and then one person saying that my my son's a hyperactive kid i do make healthy fruit lollipops so awesome yeah like that's an amazing example kashish thanks for sharing that so yeah that's another way to give them fruit lollies but they are getting love so they are happy about that it's a treat but at the same time like you know it's a healthy option so they don't have to deal with that sugar rush and all of that crazy you know stuff and we make we actually make ice cream out of frozen bananas we put it into the food processor and add like raw raw cacao to give it like a little bit of a chocolate flavor and it's amazing yeah and kids kids will love it they will love it frozen bananas frozen mangoes with mangoes you don't even have to add anything you just like you know whip it in the processor and they're ready to they're ready to be eaten and it's an amazing ice cream someone's asking about homemade fruit juice so any any any time that you're extracting the fiber away from the juice then the juice is going to be high in sugar because fruits are naturally occurring right so that they they do have fructose which is a natural sugar which is better than refined sugars so a natural a homemade juice is going to be better than one that you get at the grocery store but it's still going to be high in sugar because it's basically pure it's basically pure sugar so it's better if you can blend blend fruit is basically juice vegetables and blend fruit is basic is is are the the basic ideas um so yeah hopefully that's helpful making like a smoothie is better than having just fruit juice because smoothie would have that fiber fiber element to it but the fruit juice is like just pure sugar no matter where you're drinking the juice from it is sugar so kajal said wow thank you that's an eye opener yeah i didn't know that either only once you start learning about the stuff you learn more and more i used to think juice is the most healthy thing i could have early in the morning until i got to learn about that i'm like oh my god i need to switch to smoothies all right guys any other questions no more questions so uh cindy said thank you that was great information thank you for joining in cindy all right guys so please reach out to people that invited you and thank you so much for your time in joining me today in this session if you have any other questions i'd be happy to answer you can reach me out on the instagram glamor and purpose and and just thank you for your time today so we're gonna this we do the health topics every other every other every other week right so the same time every other week we have a different kind of in-depth health health training the next one is going to be on the first yes awesome all right thank you everyone thank you so much", "zhlkqOkGU8c": "hey guys it's Margaret from days well-spent and in today's video I'm going to show you how to make the most refreshing mixed berry iced tea you're going to need some blackberries raspberries and blueberries you'll also need some tea bags I like to use Lipton but use your favorite something to match the berries with a potato masher or a fork works just fine and then you'll also need some water to brew your tea with so for the tea bags you're either going to need three family size teabags or ten to twelve small teabags depending on how strong you like your tea if the tags are on and go ahead and remove the tags and then tie your teabags together if they have a string okay so we're gonna begin by heating up our water this water is already hot I have two quarts in here and you're gonna want to use more water if you have a larger picture we're going to take the teabags that we prepared drop them in and the burner is off and I'm going to go ahead and slide this to the back and set my timer for eight minutes okay so while our tea is brewing let's go ahead and get our berry mixture ready I've got one cup of fresh raspberries that have been rinsed got one cup of fresh blackberries also have been rinsed and now a half a cup of blueberries again rinsed and made sure that there's no stems on any of the berries come ashore and mash these up you can use a fork now we need to get our lemon juice and we need 1/4 of a cup of lemon juice that's usually about one medium sized lemon I love this little juice or mindfully to it it just fits on any mason jar or a cup that's equivalent I like it because I can juice in it and then stick a lid on it and store it in the refrigerator if I have more than I need add that to the mixture and now we need to add our sugar you're gonna want anywhere between 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of sugar depending on how sweet you like it you can also use honey so now we're just going to stir this all around and our teabags are just about done but now our teabags are done you want to carefully remove the teabags I'm doing is just adding the berry mixture to the tea you want to go real slow so it doesn't splash okay so now what I'm going to do is let this cool just a little bit before I put it into the refrigerator we're gonna refrigerate it for about three hours and you want to make sure that you leave the berries in there wallets cooling that's gonna allow the berry mixture to infuse with the tea okay so our tea has been in the refrigerator for about three hours I'm gonna go ahead and give it a good stir what I'm gonna do is pour it into the picture I have a strainer on top of my picture you could also use some cheesecloth if you don't have a strainer that fits on to your picture I'm just going to empty this that can go into our compost bin the reason you want to into your strainer is it'll just go faster if it there's not a lot in it let's drain this last little bit and you can see the strainers captured all of those larger particles and the seeds okay after you give that a good mix you want to go ahead and add the rest of the raspberries blackberries and blueberries remember these are unmatched and to serve it all you do is pour it over a glass of ice you can strain off the berries or pour them into the glass and enjoy them while you drink your tea I hope you enjoy this mixed berry tea as much as I do if you have any questions about making infuse teas or about the instructions that I gave during this video be sure to let me know down in the comment section and I'll be happy to answer them as always be sure to visit days well-spent for more inspiration", "pybsLXXaoXY": "welcome to our third week of continued education classes uh we have naomi here with us who i think she picked a really good subject for her because she's really good at this stuff um she knows her um oils for kids she has three children she'll probably tell you that and um she's been using essential oils for a while she had a really good discovery with mer essential oil for her kids was it tooth decay naomi um and she's been using oil since she was pregnant with her third daughter that's when she enrolled with me um and then she's been a wellness advocate for a few years she has a lot of knowledge with oils for women and hormones um and skin care and all that good stuff so i'm excited to have her teach she's gonna cover two topics today um and that's gonna be oils for every age and oils for women's health and hormones so i'll let you introduce yourself and take it away naoms and just let me know if you need me hello sorry i had to move things around my lighting was not as good on the other side so hopefully you can see me a little better now and yes i am really glad to be here it's been a long time i haven't been able to share in a while so forgive me if i'm a little rusty um so ashley was explaining that i had started oils while i was in the end of my pregnancy for my third child and i'm really similar in the sense that i had my children also in like a four-year span just like ashley and it's just such a different it's such a different experience to have another child right after being pregnant versus being pregnant and then having some time to recover and then being able to you know experience it kind of in a fresh start and so i think that's really where the oils came into play the most was i experienced how much your body just depletes and when your body depletes it's such a different experience your life your life is such a different experience in general there's just so much pain and there's so much mental cloud and there's so much of a different self-esteem that comes with that so that is why i think this is really important is that self-esteem and emotional uh health it's so integrated with your physical health with whatever is happening physically in the body is going to affect how you view the world and how you feel about life and if you have energy or if you have the willpower to plummet through has so much to do um with the chemistry going up and down inside of you okay so this is why it's really important even if you don't have kids even if you are you know haven't experienced um any kind of hormonal fluctuations yet it's almost as if you can you know think of this as like the drug system of your body because that's really what you're dealing with is you're dealing with what controls happiness pain pleasure all the things in life that make it worth living are the reasons why oils um are so effective and a lot of people don't really know exactly what makes oil so special or vitamins so important in your life i'm it's because what you're doing is you're kind of reprogramming your life to experience things in a much happier healthier way and until you've done it you really might not know what you're what you're missing um so i think a lot of it is if you can trust that we've been doing this for a long time we know what it's like to not be healthy i mean i partied a lot i was living the model life i know what it's like to be up till four in the morning and you know have uh a lot of heartache and a lot of heartbreaks and and then go from that to you know being pregnant and having to care for another person and really losing your identity um and so in losing your identity as a person as a mother i had to really reconstruct my life and this really helped to do that um a if you haven't tried oils i don't know who everyone is but if you haven't tried oils then if you want to get any samples from us you can on anything that we talk about today if i don't have it ashley has it so um let's see first off let me try to share my screen and get into the let me set this up for a moment but i'll just tell you a little bit more about what i've discovered with hormones the top things that i have to say right off the bat while i get up are slides is yes vitamins are essential but it's not just any vitamin it's what kind of vitamin okay so there's a difference because a lot of stuff that's over the counter even though it's great it's still made with chemicals it's still made with artificial ingredients that i am not one to preach to you do you need to be organic everything at all i mean you know do what works for you do what you can afford but i'll tell you when you're putting things directly into your gut and you're putting things directly into your body when you're trying to recover from you know a lifetime of stress that your body's been going through or an environment that you can't control and what you can control is what you're replenishing yourself with so along with you know oils the vitamin pack that doterra has is filled with a whole bunch of vitamins that you need anyway in your day the difference is how it's made it's it's allowed to absorb into your body in a lot easier way and that's really what oils do what these oils do and what this company has done is they've allowed your body to be able to absorb what you need in a much more effective faster way without any of the residue without any of this aftermath um kind of you know side effects that usually come okay so that is really the difference i'd say between what we're going to talk about with these vitamins with these oils versus other brands just off the bat i have tried so many different vitamins being pregnant three times i had multiple types of vitamins of you know natural things that i tried before i met doterra and doterra was by far the most effective the safest and the least stressful for the body um and i'll tell you how i started was putting lavender in my badge we'll get there in a second i'm selling all my vitamins to me um a lot of people always ask like well what did you first start with lavender and tea tree um i'm not a doctor but i'll tell you if you have a infection a drop of this or a drop of this the maluca on your hand and just stick in and rub around every hour or every time you have to go potty that will help to ease out whatever's stuck in there and it will especially address yeast pain and i know this is really too much tmi but it's the btmi the whole day because we're talking straight talk with me and hormones and this is the stuff i wish people told me okay why am i telling you that off the bat so that you know how much i've experimented and tried and that you know that this is real okay um there was nothing else that soothed my pain when i was pregnant the last time i had internal um varicose veins for my third one it was just bulging and it was so sore i couldn't even get out of bed for about a month and then i started putting this on my hand and just trying it out because i couldn't get anything else to work and you know by the third one you're like well well been there done that third time and it worked it was the only thing that eased my pain and made it where i could actually get up and walk and not feel like i have this aching just sensation constantly same with yeast infections when you're pregnant you can't just keep taking antibiotics over and over and over again you get a lot of irritation down there and even if you're not pregnant hawaii just hawaii women just get a lot of infections hey we're in the sun we're in the beach we're in this wet swimsuit it's a human environment people are super sexual in hawaii right so it's like the promiscuity sometimes you know or the just extra stuff going on the guys are dirty they bring you know a lot of stuff to you so this can help just to have it on hand like just a little drop and clean it out after and that will help to prevent it but also if you are going through yeast infections this will kill it i swear all right okay so let's get to my slide here we go okay so ashley made this slide and she's so amazing at prepping us for everything so i'm just gonna go through this and then kind of do my own uh two cents i'm just going to add in where i feel okay all right so if you wanted to get this recording after you're welcome i think you can ask ashley for it and if you forget anything then you can just pull from here i also was told which i'm missing my phone that if you um what is it that we need to do to get a free something ashley yeah if um anyone unmutes themselves like you have an opportunity for them to share their personal experience anywhere we have a gift for them um so they get to choose either a on guard sanitizer or two empty gold geo rollers that you can diy so um yeah we want our our team members to share their experiences if you have any for sure okay there we go thank you um so here we go talking about the lifelong vitality the vitamins forgive me i have something sticky real quick okay um so the vitamins that we were just talking about lifelong vitality it feels like a lot i feel like a lot of people get a little freaked out about how many vitamins that we take as um you know girls that are definitely doterra obsessed i'd say um but it works this stuff really works okay so why does it work because not just are you getting um all the nutrition that normally is lacking in your food today i mean i'm sure you all are caught up to date with really how our diet has changed with everything becoming industrial right so of course there's nothing wrong with having spam to be everyone smile because i do that but in the long run you're going to need to replenish constantly into your body what you're not getting in your food and nowadays with canned food with things taking a long time to you know get to the table we're not getting things fresh outdoors we're not we're not going outside and butchering a goat and having it that night so by the time that it gets to us there's been a lot of things in play um even our vegetables even our fruits they're not getting the same amount of um you know uh soil nutrition because of the way that our environment's changed and so that is where vitamins are really essential and if you can't take them all like um if you watched giselle she said she just takes a little bit every day but this is basically what i'm taking every day and why are why is it that you need a certain amount of nutrition that's going to help with your hormones because again imbalances everything about your life is about balance if you are not getting enough in and you're not getting enough out your body is going to go into wreck and if you don't feel it in your body it's going to go to your brain okay so everything is going to circulate out it's the same thing with like if you don't sweat right if you don't work out and you don't sweat things out and you don't take that extra energy then you're gonna gain weight right that's the same thing you gotta whatever you put in has to also come out so if you're having problems with your mental focus if you're having problems with your emotions a lot of it has to do with what's coming in what's going out okay so we're gonna talk about what's going in and i'll tell you what needs to go out and how to get that out and why all right so slim and sassy is another one that's really really great and i don't have it on me right now but it's um really good for nausea um it does really help to smell i would say that's a great one to have if you have any kind of um you know up and down feelings or even if you're hungover this is a great one for hangovers you can just drop some of that into your water um i personally drop things in my coffee if it has some mint in it because it'll add a little extra flavor in there some people will take it straight you can add it to orange juice um it will help with your metabolism as well so your metabolism is uh of course everyone knows a huge part of your body system and it's also how you feel good about yourself so this is not just how you need to take care of your skin and your hair and you need to have things good for you because your mom said so it's because if you want to feel hot and sexy and you want your mojo back and you want your life back where you actually can wake up in the morning and you're like i feel amazing i look amazing nothing can stop me you know screw whatever comes into my day that is the feeling that i want you to have because it's the only way we're ever going to get through women life we deal with so much we have everyone else's you know drama on our plates we deal with men and men are the biggest babies ever i'm so sorry if you're a man and you're on this but just as a woman to take care of that as a woman we're totally in a different realm and the things that we're dealing with are just so different that you want to be able to wake up and and have that daily um power in your life and so this is how you're going to get that you're going to get that by feeling good about yourself inside and out you're going to start with putting into yourself what you need and you're going to smell things that are going to clear out your head and make you feel focused and make you feel like yeah my metabolism is is going like i'm not going to i'm not going to be feeling junk about my body and this is going to be a slow process okay so if you're not seeing results right away give it a couple weeks do something for a 14 day just every day eat this these are the packet forms you can get it in the bottle forms too but i have i've seen that a lot of women have an easier time with the packets it's preset for you don't forget it okay you can travel with this and then try a couple of these things in your day okay smelling eating dropping into coffee keep it around put it by your coffee put it by your counter leave the la you know leave the little reminders to yourself of where you want it in your life okay um aromatouch is my favorite and the reason why this is my favorite is that it has a combination of almost everything that feels good for your body um has basil in it which is really good for hormones okay basil is also really good for detoxing and um well it helps with that i can't remember exactly but it's either liver kidneys helps helps with one of them which is you know essential to your body's detox function but it really helps with um waking up the mind and it helps with respiratory um and they're all linked so that one is in aromatouch you can smell that there's some lavender in there there's some peppermint in there so the things that are going to detox and stimulate your body and get a lot of circulation blood circulation is huge and if you're having a hard time working out if you're pregnant or not pregnant this can really help to stimulate and get things going and i would suggest just putting a little drop i'm going to use basil right now because i'm on my own touch but you're just going to take a little drop and if you can't handle the smell um don't put it by your nose just add it to your feet bottom of your feet or the back of the neck okay and put it somewhere that is not going to be in the way if it's causing you some irritation sometimes people can't handle the smell right away it's too strong for them um so put it somewhere that you're not going to smell it or mix it with something so if that's too strong for you try it with a little bit of coconut oil okay you can just start with a little bit in your hand i usually do that i drop a lid on my hand then i drop a drop in and then i rub around okay um otherwise you can get it in lotion lotion is probably the the least amount of smell retention i feel so you can um squeeze a little ocean we've got some really good one from doterra that's very um clean and and uh no extras in there and just mix with that okay um this really helps to i feel soothe the body but it also wakes me up around the touch it's definitely one of my favorites and it's not intense like deep blue it is not straight peppermint it has a lot of um things that i feel also calm down in your mind in addition to waking you up it's it's strange sensation okay copaiba that one everyone loves the best way i don't describe it is i heard initially it was a cousin of marijuana and so that if you just think of it that way it's going to do similar kind of things if it's in the same family or if it's in the same train right so it's it's helping to calm down the mind help to with the nerve damage help to kind of ease and soothe any of the emotions that keep coming up a lot of people that have brain issues or damage they are eating copaiba regularly along with frank okay and it's because what we're doing is when we calm down the nervous system then it allows the brain to not freak out so much um and not have that constant right that anxiety um and copaiba is also really soothing for a lot of skin issues too and it helps with a whole bunch of things it's just really good for overall immunity for overall um rebuilding of the body's you know defense system but the nerve system is really hard to address and this is so gentle that during pregnancy this is really baby safe okay i'm going to speed things up because we only have about another half an hour okay um but here we go for infants and toddlers this is where things usually get really complicated in general of them if you're always diluted with coconut oil okay if you are not sure if it's baby safe my two things if you can remember never put it by the eyes ever don't have it on your breast or your chest or anywhere baby touches okay so baby's gonna come to you you don't want it anywhere that's gonna get by them so make sure you're putting it on your feet your back um even like rubbing into the low belly might be dangerous because if you put baby on you and baby touches your belly right or is around it on the front side of you that could be irritation if you don't know what's going on yet okay generally the things that are really good for babies are always going to be flowers um woods okay so what i mean by that woods when you think of a wood cedar sandalwood yeah um even myrrh is technically like part of the wood it's a resin but the woods frankincense um this is also like a bark of resin all the woods are going to be really gentle okay and then flowers flowers jasmine magnolia lavender and things like um roman chamomile that's a flower too those are all very baby safe so if you can just remember flowers and woods woods will help with respiratory woods will help with some cell strengthening flowers will always calm you down and flowers will always help with soothing skin wounds rashes okay so those are the safest by far um so if you are from hawaii we keep our umbilical cords usually uh if you have any hawaiian ancestry usually that's what we do and the process of keeping the the umbilical cord intact as well as it depends if your home birth or not but a lot of people will put myr and we'll put frankincense on the umbilical cord to kind of keep and retain that um form but it's also really good for healing what is what is still sticking out of the baby um the actual piece that's becoming your belly button a lot of times it gets irritated and it'll keep bleeding right after you've cut it so um dropping a little tiny bit of myrrh um not that you want to play you don't want to rub in and touch because that'll hurt but dropping a little bit of murr and a little bit of frank will really help to soothe and kind of rebuild that if you can't afford those lavender is a great one for that too okay um tamer so the kids kit if you haven't seen the kids kit it's super cute um my kids actually we break it up because i have three and they all they all get a couple that they get to take with them so that they don't fight over it but there's there's sticks in there okay and the set is um it's rebuildable so if you need to buy one at a time to put it back in there you can instead of having to buy the whole kit again again but it's just really cute because it comes it comes in little colors a little card so people are really excited about it the kids are excited about it the tamer is very soothing um also helps with digestion digestion is a huge issue for kids because a lot of times that is what causes them to be fussy upset stomach uncooperative um it causes the blowouts you really don't want your baby to be blowing out all the time and peppermint is often really strong for babies okay and so i mean if you're gonna have bloods regardless don't say you know naomi said i don't have bloats and you baby they're still gonna be a mess and they're still gonna be crazy but at least you can try to soothe them a little bit if they are having a lot of gas um peppermint usually is what adults will use on an upset stomach or digestion but if you are in the baby stage or you're sensitive spearmint is a great alternative so spearmint is what's in tamer spearmint is um a lot less of an intense mint it's kind of sweet it's soothing but it still will help with digestion and help with respiratory and it'll help to clear out the sinuses as well so it's a great way to switch out some of your things if you have little kids or if you have sensitive skin okay here's that lotion we talked about um this lotion i usually put in a bowl um and i use ceramic and the reason i have ceramic bowls or porcelain bowls is because it's glass and anything that you're mixing with a an oil that is from doterra doterra is so potent it's so pure that it's going to start pulling in any of the impurities from plastics so that is why we try to stay away from plastics when we are dealing with oils um so i would recommend either you have like a stainless steel bowl or you're using a ceramic bowl or your hand and you're just going to pour in like a couple spoons of lotion and then you're going to drop in whatever you want okay um i know we're going fast sorry about that there's that kit that i talked about um and here are some things that are really important for kids as well the pb assist junior this one is like a pixie stick i'm gonna open them up for you i'll be right back but the um the vitamin sets the reason why kids usually don't like to take vitamins or we don't like to take vitamins it doesn't taste good so i feel like this is probably the best way that your kids are ever going to have a probiotic besides the chocolate chewies which i don't like the chewies i don't like the gummies because the um cavity factor and my kids did get cavities and um we'll talk about how murray used to put that on there this is that probiotic that i was telling you about and real quick before we go there so don't forget about mer myrrh um as ash was explaining you can actually drop this onto your teeth um i did a lot of research because i had a year and a half it was a year and a half and he already had a cavity or she did and i just did not want to extract um he had one in the top teeth that were stuck in between as he was teeth as he was coming out with teeth he was still breastfeeding it wasn't like you know i was giving him candy or anything but sometimes it'll get stuck in between and he had that overlap for a little bit and it was causing a cavity that i couldn't figure out what it was he couldn't talk yet and he was in so much pain i finally realized it was a cavity by the time we found out it was almost to the root on the inside and the dentist said that we either had to extract it we had to cap it which i did not want to give him a metal cap but you know aged two or we had to let it rot out and i thought oh my god i'm not doing this no one would do a porcelain there because of where it was angled no one would do the white caps because it was angled in a way it was really hard so i did a lot of research and i saw that essential oils that were pure could really help to stop the process and just kind of cap it where it was um and i did not feel comfortable putting the stronger ones on my kids like on guard on guard is a great one for cavities so um if you are having issues yourself as an adult i would drop on guard onto your toothbrush and then use it to kind of get in there or just straight coconut oil with whatever you want in there myrrh coconut uh melaleuca um even um bergamot broccoli can help with cavities too drop a little bit of that and rub on after you brush let it sit let it soak in that's what i was doing for my kids with myrrh the reason i was using that was because my look was too strong it was too strong of a flavor and also had a little bit of discrepancies in the research for teeth for children not for adults but for children and then clove of course is way too hot so i said okay myrrh is not hot it tastes disgusting tastes like dirt i've tried it but um it definitely does the job it actually did stop the teeth decay from moving forward it just kept it there it just stayed there for about two months until i found a dentist who i could work with to kind of scrape it out and really do a good job and he told me that um he said what did you do because there's a line like you see the line of the decay that just stopped all of the stud ends just stayed there and he said what have you been doing i could tell there's a difference in this little like there's a few centimeters here and i told him her and he said is it doterra said yeah and he said okay i'm going to buy some from you so he started buying from me he's one of my clients um and his name is dr gavin he's in oahu if you need a really good dentist by the way okay so the pb assist just like adults need probiotics kids need probiotics and the reason why is let's talk about this detox with the gut okay when you are growing up you have this really fresh immune system and everything is clean um when you get out of breast milk stage you start having food everything that you put into your body is going to have um you know some residue in there which is also why you're supposed to have fiber you're supposed to eat a certain way we don't and stress is a huge part of this okay so the less stress you have and the better gut system you're gonna have the better detox you wanna be going dude every day i know giselle talks about this a lot if you want to go and read and listen to her but this is a way to get your kids to um have a better digestive system but also just to kind of clear out whatever you can't control okay so daycare was hard because i couldn't control what they're eating half the time their kids bring snacks ate juice and like all the things i don't do at home uh goes out the window once they start preschool right um but this if you want to see it just open some people want to try it right this is actually like it's powder oh shoot it's on my computer okay well it's powder and it's um like a pixie stick super yummy my kids think it's candy okay it's a great way that even if adults cannot take pills try all the kids stuff because this will actually do the job my kids will go doo-doo within 20 minutes of this um my son constantly has the pro the hardest time going doo doo and i will give this to him and he'll go within half an hour okay um the touch versions of the on guard is why it's listed here because a lot of kids are really sensitive and so if you put things into a roller and fill it up with coke and oil then it's going to be a lot easier for them to handle i like having rollers around this is the easiest way to teach your kids to self-soothe and self-care when my kids are coughing i'm like where's your oil and they just rub on this is already pre-made they don't have to touch it it's not gonna get their eyes okay the beadlets are really small version i don't have them with me right now i'm sorry than my car but the beadlets are super small versions of pills when my kids cannot swallow the big pills because you know this is a kind of a this is the size of the onboard this is a zender kin but i'll show you that this is the same size as the on guard that's still pretty big for a child sometimes the beadlets are a tiny tiny drop they're tiny tiny dots so that is an excellent way to have them swallow um some immunity pills okay the vitamins are really good um to suck on i personally don't like the flavor of the orange um this is for america so omega is really good for your brain and this helps with the kids development of the brain this is really essential actually to have this i don't like the flavor alone so what i'm going to do is fill up put in about a spoon i take about a big spoon of that syrup pour it into glass fill it up with orange juice mix it really good or apple juice like that really thick apple juice orange juice and that will really allow people to to handle it in a way that they don't really taste it um the other option is you can put a little bit into like a soup i know some little gross but sometimes if i have stews or something that's like a big mushy bowl that they won't tell that you know has already some broth in it i'll just put a little spoon in that mix it around because then they can't really taste it okay um let's see all right so click clear skin a lot of this has to do with what's in your gut and your stress level and the levels of melody that we talked about of course are really essential for this and you need that um in your body to basically put in everything that you're missing and that's going to help revitalize the whole system um it also has a lot of frank so these vitamins that we're talking about has a lot of frankincense inside and it has a lot of other things like oh boy off the top of my head i can't remember but it has a lot of plant subs substances that are in there that are pure based that i do not have any synthetics so getting the synthetics out of your body is going to help a lot as well we talked about probiotics for kids definitely probiotics for adults as well for your skin and the skin system is awesome i dealt a lot with acne especially going through pregnancies again and again my body was just completely overwhelmed with hormones in the no drop the way that i was eating would change in a drop you're not getting the same amount of sleep so your patterns are just so up and down that this really helped me the hd clear roller i would break out in a lot of like this kind of this is all hormones right here but a lot of this is gut too so if it's up here then you know that the gut needs some work but down here i was getting these breakouts so that was helping me to after um washing my face which they have a really good skincare set here that has a face wash but the roller helped to kind of just soothe and clean it has a lot of molecular in there had eucalyptus had some other things that we don't even offer alone um and so that really helped to kind of deep clean and smooth in between and then letting that when you let that dry then putting on a lotion because you want to make sure you're getting a lot of moisture into your system just like we just like we detox and we need to replenish with water right it's the same thing for skin when you're when you're cleaning out you need to replenish with moisture so it's allowing your skin to get reabsorbed again and this system my brother uses my brother is in his 20s and he always has had acne issues and he uses this so it's for guys too it's not just for women um emotions are huge this is half the reason why we bottle stress acne irregular periods and pain in our menstrual cycle it's all because of the stress and the emotions and so adaptive is huge it's actually relatively new in the sense like it's only been around a couple years and it's just a big mix of everything it has um a lot of what we talked about already lavender copaiba um it has orange in there too it's a very all around inclusive oil for all stress um all hormones um it can soothe skin but it also has a little bit of energy revitalizing um ingredients in there so i think that would be a great one to start with if you really don't know where to start and of course diffusing is what's going to help you to i'd say wake up in the day um something that i woke up with after depression when you're you know in that slump after having kids i mean my gosh your life is just this jungling mess you feel so out of control uh the one that i loved was elevation this is by far my favorite oil for stress for depression and i would keep this by my bed and i would keep a water bottle by my bed because there's some days i couldn't even move because i'd have a baby attached to me right i couldn't get out no one could help me so i was just keeping a water bottle and this right by my bed with a diffuser so i could just open it up and literally refill with whatever i was drinking refill and put this in there and this kept me from crying all day i swear there's sometimes that the smells of things really just hit your brain and i'll tell you why elevation is so amazing um it's because it has tangerine which is really upbeat and really revitalizing for your confidence and boldness it helps with all kinds of immunity detoxing your your system and your gut lavender which of course is soothing and always is a is a good comfort for all mind um body amorous which we don't sell alone um smells really pretty and clary sage clary sage is also in this clary comb and clary sage by itself um while it is a great one to have by itself it can cause a labor start so if you are pregnant you want to stay away from your very composition actually jump start your labor if you want to get baby out and you're light a few drops of this on the inner ankles the inner ankles oh my gosh here we go right here okay the reason why is that is that is your your connection um to the uh vaginal genital area your inner ankles in there is connected to the same stuff is there as they're all laughing at me right now i know straight up here we go um so this smells like a really strong lavender with a little ting of like a tartness to it and some people don't really like this because it kind of makes you sleepy it has like a kind of like a roman chamomile aftermath there at the very end it can has a little like powdery scent at the very end so this is great to mix with other things but if you need it for menstrual pain and you don't have clarison clary calm this one you can eat put this straight in because this is the pure form but it's also in clary calm which is a roller that's made with um a lot of things that we talked about it has a little base on there too and it helps to release a lot of those um pain in there but also revitalize um the hormones it actually specifically targets your womb area the um oh goodness everything that has to do with your womb your vagina your ovaries this clary sage is directly affecting that and it's in clary calm so that is a great one to have on hand especially if you have a lot of pain okay it's also in elevation which is why i was tying that together but elevation has clary calm which is partly why you're getting that whole oh did i miss the slide go back wait stop okay did i miss one where did we go here okay there and we're gonna go forward hold on and we're gonna pause it okay here we go okay so um besides your daily vitamins what else is it that we could really use in our life i talked about probiotics which is a huge one if you are already taking a probiotic or you already are using hours then terrazyme is another great one to add in i'll show you a probiotic real quick okay this is not super huge um i've had a lot of probiotics this one is really good you do notice a difference in your bowel movements okay and that's tmi but you kind of need it um you need to get out all the things inside your colon i read a lot of books okay i have like red i'm a very big nerd um and the thing that i read about your colon is that your cone actually has all these little flaps in it okay so your flaps in your colon are actually holding on to things uh throughout the years which is why a lot of times when you do like a metal detox or you do you know a detox and chemical usage you have to do a lot of gut detox and it has to be not necessarily your gut for your colon in itself because the colon is holding in the walls um these little like has these little pockets in there okay so what you're doing is you're gonna have to help it release which is why yoga works a lot moving around your body and doing those like scrunching and things are massaging and removing or pulling to squeeze and release um it's also like running helps a lot because running is actually shaking the walls to get off whatever stuff on there but things like this will help a lot okay lemon or any kind of um any kind of uh citrus lemon uh tangerine orange um even grapefruit they're all going to help to kind of clean out the organs down there they're going to clean out the organs in a gentle way and there's no acid this is the big difference with um taking an oil versus taking a lemon and just squeezing in your water there's no acid that's going to kill your teeth or give you um problems in your stomach okay so that's why a lot of people switch to the oil um this is a great one to give to your kids i personally give my kids orange because they don't like the taste of lemon but i can put an orange drop or a tangerine drop and they'll they'll handle that in the water okay the terrazyme is going to help you absorb what's in your food and so a lot of people are like what's the difference between this and your green powder the green powder that we sell and it's repackaged but it used to be called tara greens and it's basically all the extra food ground up fruits and vegetables that you would need in your system the difference between that and terrazyme is that even though you eat good food a lot of times your body won't absorb it you need other things to deserve it for example a lot of people have heard that with calcium even if you eat a lot of calcium if you don't have magnesium you won't absorb the calcium so you need kind of like a two-part system your body has to have another component to be able to accept certain chemicals or certain substances into your body so for example a lot of people that lack in vitamin d um right it's if they're not getting it from the sun they're trying to get it elsewhere but you still need kind of that combo magnesium calcium phosphate they all together help with um up with absorbing and vitamin d helps you to absorb a lot of other nutrients as well so it's like having all those different um those different i'd say you'd say like teen pairs of um nutrients in your body those minerals those those different types of digestive enzymes is what it's called that's going to help you to absorb whatever else is also coming into your body and that's what tyrosine is doing terazyme is a combination of enzymes that are going to soak in everything you're taking in other words just goes right through you right everyone anyone has had too much of something and it just runs right through you it's usually because you don't have what in a fiber you don't have enough magnesium you don't have enough um enzymes to break it down and keep it in your body how you need it okay so this is a huge factor if you are having some issues where let's say you are having big bowel movements even though you're having um you know better health and and you're you know maybe you're working out maybe you're taking vitamins every day but you're like something's going on it's not i'm still like just running it out or it's just like  all day sorry that would be a terrazyme need okay besides probiotic you want to get stuff out you want to get stuff out but you don't want to get everything out you want to keep some things in you okay but the stuff that you do need you want to keep terrazyme is going to help a lot with that okay so you would take lifelong vitality every day then if you are having a little like hmm i'm not keeping stuff or i feel like it's sluggish you want to add in the probiotic but also add in this terazyme so that you can keep things that you need and flush out what you don't need okay lemon is going to help a lot just gently kind of clean out everything to alongside your probiotics get out all the stuff you don't need um and then let's talk about do your prime before we get to europe but do your prime and this is an amazing one for just overall immunity building so a lot of people who have had some trauma with their body like let's say you did experience you know tumor cancer depression depression is so big um the ddr prime is going to help to boost your immunity uh overall a lot of people with autoimmune disease have come to me and asked specifically for things that are going to reboost and i can't quote i can't say anti-cancer and i cannot say anti-tumors and i can't say that this is going to revitalize cells because i'm not a doctor and i will be scolded okay by some people out there but i want to tell you from personal experience i've had so many people with autoimmune disorders buy this drink it every day and they've noticed a difference and because it has frank in there and it has other things like lemongrass which lemongrass we haven't touched on but lemongrass helps a lot with body pain as well but it's more like muscular pain and so a lot of things that are immunity related also affect the muscles because your ability to build muscles it's it's all connected okay um and clove clove is a big it's in on guard it's in ddr prime which is why this is a great alternative if you can't get hold of on guard or you're looking for something that's like an everyday immunity build but it's not going to just you know kill everything like on guard can ddr prime with clove in it helps to address all bacteria and kill that out as well okay so this is a great one to have in a day to day if you want to rebuild immunity if you just had a really you know maybe i don't know maybe you just got off uh you know addictions to something or painkillers or something and you want to revitalize this is a great system here um try use is really good for allergies i do have some people that buy this and they like pill versions instead of doing it diffusing every day they just are on the go especially uh airlines a lot of people who are flying a lot will take trays with them it's really easy anti-allergy and added on yarrow palm is amazing this stuff is i like this kills so many or not kills i'm sorry but it covers all birds in one stone in so many ways um yarrow palm it's really thick okay can you see how that is here i'm going here this is like a like a really thick blue goo that's why it comes with this top um this helps with scarring and if you're trying to recover from baby aftermath this is a great one just drop this into lotion rub that everywhere this is really good for um i have a little bit of acne scars that i'm still putting this on for this really helps to revitalize it okay this is great for wrinkles put a little bit in there but overall this is going to help reboost your system cells everywhere this is kind of your secret potion along with frank with frank and this i feel like your body can really recover from almost anything i know a lot of people that do eat this okay you can eat this but it's thick and it's sticky so the best thing is probably to get the capsules if you want to eat it i personally do drop this on my face and my skin i'll have like a little blue stain that i let soak in and it'll it'll make a noticeable difference within within a couple days if i'm doing it completely consistently but the capsule version i do take this every once in a while so for example um i had some acne breakout and i was i'm still busy i don't always have time to do this you know on my face i'll just take a couple passes during those times that i'm trying to recover from that okay it will help with your hormones yarrow pump will help with hormones it will help revitalize all your cells so that is a great one to use it's very gentle it's baby safe it's super expensive there's a travel kit version now if it's still available you might want to try that one the travel kit has a small version of all of these and then um that way you can kind of sample things and if you can't afford the big one okay so fraction coconut oil we talked about how to use that um turmeric turmeric is in a couple things but um alone this is so this is one of the biggest issues with hormones is that when your hormones are going crazy a lot of times you also have inflammation at the same time and it's usually coinciding and so inflammation what i mean is something if you get it outside if you get an outside uh infection you can see it you can see everything get and her and get you know gross but if it's happening inside of you you can't see that um inflammation can happen like if you hurt you fall down bursts you're inflamed inside okay um too much stress and can can cause an inflamed you know uh organ um like a like you're you're gonna have parts of your colon inflamed and so forth too much uh you know pressure of the way you're walking or anything like that so turmeric will actually help to calm down the internal inflammation going on um even things like you know tonsils and throat you can feel when it's inflamed that's what's that's what's causing that kind of extra um sore throat right to happen that's the kind of feeling of inflammation that i'm trying to explain to you so you understand what's going on so this will help to calm down that and soothe and almost like restrict whatever's been escalated in there um it does taste pretty bad by itself which is why even though we do have an oil most people don't want to ever take the oil internally because it's so strong and it tastes like uh oh my gosh it smells like moldy dirt and it has almost like a like a saline scented but it's also a right i don't know how to spray it but it's definitely strong it smells like something left in your fridge for a very long time that's what turmeric smells like in the oil form fresh straight so i would suggest to do the capsules okay the capsules are awesome they're easy to take um this also will help with not just immunity uh inflammation but all over immunity and so it's a great alternative if you have any allergic reaction to anything else turmeric usually you're never allergic to um and this is really ancient too the wines just use this a lot too obviously not piliform but you know this is like a long-standing soothing for skin because when you are when you are helping to ease what's going on inside of the body then your skin is naturally going to get better but this does help with overall skin care as well okay um so the hormones are related to blockages in the body so if you have a blockage in your body we want to ease the blockage we want to move it around in your system we want to release it out of your system and then we're going to put in what you're lacking so bone support is a huge thing in recovering from babies but just in women in general every time i had a baby i would notice i would start getting really owey teeth and it wasn't cavities it was it felt sore and i felt like like there was like when i bite it would almost feel a little loose so i started taking bone nutrition because baby does take the best of you it will suck out of you the best nutrients and when you're breastfeeding especially you're still sucking out the best nutrients so if you're not getting minerals into your body that are allowing you to keep rebuilding your bones your baby will take from your bones and that is a lot of why women will have problems later in life is because they actually have let all their bone tissues good and then they never replenished it okay so you want to be taking bone nutrition in addition to um not just pregnancy but the after birth and all of the recovery i'd say the entire time you breastfeed i'd say until a year after breastfeeding keep taking bone nutrition okay i know it's a lot to soak in but it's an additional supplement that you can take um any time okay um so on a scale of one to ten what is your monthly cycle like we only have about 10 minutes i know i talked so much i'm so sorry so i'm just going to go ahead and kind of do this for you you can you can text me later you guys can instagram me later whatever you want to do but um if your monthly cycle is pretty strenuous for your symptoms you're probably lacking a lot of these nutrients that you need in your body um i personally got worse periods after birth because your body is just warped and everything is kind of going back and forth and constricting if you are having pain of the constricting of the afterbirth when your body's trying to come back clary sage is a great one i forgot to mention that one will help you feel it i would literally drop this on and rub it over my belly and i'd feel that sensation soothe within like minutes like a half an hour um so that is a great one to really help soothe in there geranium is another one that can really help with all your hormones and all your pain this is really great for bleeding for wounds like if you have a scab or acne draining really will help helps with hair also so if you're having an issue with with hair loss or your hair is getting too wild or oily skin try rubbing in geranium into like i would basically put it in my my conditioner um or i was just eating it or i was just rubbing it along the hairline in the back okay and this will help with also the menstrual cycle um so any of these if you've got any of this stuff going on that means that we need to get you some more nutrients and some more things into your life and you guys can text us after we know about the reproduction system um fertility if you're trying to get pregnant a lot of times it's because your hormones are off balance and you're not getting enough in and you're not detoxing out so um i would say what we need to do here to get your body back in balance um and not that i'm saying that i'm perfect because i'm definitely not but to get your body back in balance first is you want to put in what you're missing we talked about that then you want to get out what you don't need so if you've got leftover stuff in there from life from stress from drama from a bad ex-boyfriend who gave you some drugs you want to get that out and that's we need to detox probiotics um xendocon is another one i know that you saw from this from gizelle um gentle massage getting out you can use things like aromatash like we talked about um you can drop out some some citrus into your your body to get that out okay um the phyto oh i can never say this ooh phytoestrogen that is a estrogen therapy for your body so this is really good for recovering from um birth where you've just depleted everything but this is also really good for um just general maintenance of your body and this is going to help with easing out that problematic menstrual cycle okay um because you're actually putting into your body what your what your what your woman hormone is which is the estrogen okay um and again look in the in the ingredients if you want to know more about it but i do take this every once in a while um rose rose is an expensive one but we've been really lucky to have it put into a roller form that is easier for your body to take also i was going to say if you can't get rose because it's still too expensive you can get it in whisper whisper has rose now which is a lot cheaper version it has a lot of other floral oils in there that will help with everything else that we talked about so this is a great alternative some other things that have rose in it actually the kids kit so the kids kits that we talked about has rows in it also and i don't remember exactly which one but you can look into the ingredients on those and that's a way cheaper option um i want to say stronger how's it i'm not quite sure yes stronger has rose in it so that's a way cheaper option i want to say that's like around twenty dollars i can't remember off the top of my head but that is also another way you can get rose into your system um there is a rose lotion as well which if you you know really just want to have that experience to to calm down the mind and you're not needing to eat it directly or um you know use it on wounds or anything then the lotion will be a great thing for that but really what is rose rose helps with libido okay why does it help with libido because it's addressing emotions what is it that the emotions are telling you we need love that is the ultimate answer in the world that really when you don't feel good about life and you feel really depressed and alone and you're lacking love and that's why roses make every woman feel so good because it's invoking the same chemicals that make you feel loved it has that same soothing effect okay and that also is boosting your libido and all your hormones that are associated with that that's why a lot of the flowers help to boost libido other ones that are great for that lingling um ylang ylang is another flower that helps lose blue slippy you know okay um magnolia um jasmine jasmine is a huge one okay so if you can't always get your hands on one oil that will help soothe with all of those hormones and those emotions that you really need to release and and there's a whole bunch of other flowers that we can choose from okay so here's that endocrine system as we end um one second i just want to see let's be honest so okay so we talked about this this box i'm just gonna hold it here for one second then we'll go to that slide the zendocrine that i mentioned endocrine has a lot of citrus in it um and that's also with rosemary and geranium like we talked about which helps with a lot of hormones juniper berry can also help with um vaginal uh not vaginal sorry the the p tract i'm sorry i can't speak right now urinary tract there you go geranium helps with all of the hormones juniper berry inside here will help with your um your p truck your your urinary system so that's another central part that's tied in right we get we get yeast impact we get uh urinary tract infections a lot and sometimes it's coinciding with a yeast infection or with a hormone imbalance not getting enough water but sometimes you can just strengthen that by taking something like cinderprint okay um cilantro also which helps to clean out a whole bunch of things it's a huge detoxer so that is another great one to add into your system i'd say first let yourself get used to the probiotics get used to adding in all the extras that we talked about get used to kind of cleaning out with oils alone and then try this if you really want to like get that deep seated um where the end of your end of your weight loss and you can't get those extra five pounds off it's probably this or you're at the end of taking antibiotics and you're trying to reboost with some good things but you still feel like you're sluggish you probably need this okay um the slim and sassy is really great to help with your your hunger cravings so sometimes we get really extra um hungry for sugar because we've been used to eating a certain amount or you're really depressed you're feeling down that will help a lot with that we talked about myrrh clove frankincense and i did speak a little bit on lemongrass lemongrass will help with thyroid it's a really cheap version if you cannot get hold of anything else um it's like ten dollars but thyroid controls a lot of the metabolism factors so if you're having hard times with weight loss and you feel like your hormone is out of luck a lot of times it is connected to the thyroid and the thyroid is um actually it does control um personality disorders too so it can make you a little bit bipolar in a way if you don't clean it out so lemongrass can really help with that zenderkin can help with that too but um the murder that we talked about the clove so even the toothpaste even switching over to ongoing toothpaste can really help to address things in the thyroid because you're still getting some of those you're getting clove and myrrh into the toothpaste as well okay so we are ending here a little bit uh late we start a few minutes late so we can go a little bit over but these are some examples of what um sorry let's go back to that here's an example of what kind of kit you might want to get just for uh hormones and emotions okay um chlorosage bone nutrition the phytoestrogen this actually comes in a pack right here those three so if you want to look in your back end you can find that in your shop and then if you were to add on um the rose then of course you're getting all of your emotions met it's going to help with hair skin nails all of your feelings it does also help with the menstrual cycle if you want to roll on over but it also just smells amazing and it does help with um some of that odor balance odor body balance geranium will do that as well so if you are needing a little bit of like a can i not be sweating so much while i'm detoxing or while i'm having my menstrual issue that will help or join in okay so if you wanted to do that you can talk to ash um or any of us and this will actually help you to not just address all the needs that we just went through but it will also get you some free things if you do it correctly so right now we're a little bit towards the end of the month so we've missed um some of the three things if you're already a member right but for next month this would be a great one to add into your box um to get the free product of the month because it's a 125 pv if you're new and you haven't signed up yet you can still sign up with this kit and we can add in some other things we can get some other freebies for you we can tell you about that after okay it is 1001 so i don't want to go over i do have something at 10 15 so i do have to go are there any questions for me in the next 10 minutes i'm gonna just look in this chat box and let you guys unmute you can just unmute and talk to me oh my gosh 99 in the chat tell me thank you amazing class um is it your birthday tomorrow oh on monday i was like i have it on my calendar is this the right day happy birthday thanks 33 so i think i'm hitting the i'm hitting the we're not quite you know middle but i mean i'm hitting your age range here so if you have not had kids yet you're still in my age group it's okay if you have had kids yet been there done that we're okay and you know a lot of different kind of stresses and skin care options i've tried so you can ask me anything um okay let's see thanks for the happy birthdays any questions in here can my pregnant sister take those nutrient complex um yes pregnancy you can take the nutrients all the all the vitamins if you're pregnant i'd say the only one i'd say stay away from is endocrine and gx while you're pregnant you can take um probiotics you can take the bone nutrition i would especially take the bone nutrition during pregnancy um copaiba you can take during pregnancy tumeric yes although um i would just say if you're pregnant you might not be able to swell it all down so that is my only i've i threw up all my pregnancies so i know how hard that is to take vitamins while you're pregnant so my suggestion is i would take the vitality as much as you can and then if if she can handle taking more um then yes but if you can't handle taking anything else then i would suggest trying to do the straight drops of i know turmeric might not be good on in in the taste so maybe just add that into your foot massage add that into like a daily you just put it on your body as part of your daily to absorb that um there is endocrine in an oil so if this is something she wants to try and she's pregnant she wants to detox a little bit then maybe the oil version is best to roll over um and then copaiba also has a roller version i mean not roller version i'm sorry oil straight oil version so if you can't take and handle all of that you can totally do that in the oil version the only one i'd also say stay away from for your sister is that the clary calm that comes with that that this kit right here this bone nutrition and phytoestrogen kit um does have the clary calm in there do not use this until after you want to give birth so till the day that she wants to go into labor then you'll start using this or to recover afterwards that would be great for the afterbirth okay i hope that answered your question yes i'm going to stop sharing now and i'm gonna stay on for like two more minutes what do we got um love the roll lotion yes oh and it does donates profit so the resolution we talked about donates the profits the stronger for the kids kit i guess that's a really great one to have because it has um copaiba in it too so if you're trying to kill you know one bird or three birds with one stone stronger is a cheaper option and it kind of will help with immunity with stress with nerves it'll also just heal all the emotions all in one and so a lot of it is like affordability um if you really don't feel like you have the funds to to try them all alone eventually you will especially be doing this business most of my things i got free like rose oil i got that free because i wrapped up all my points and i just cashed in for a rose bottle and my god it's so good which i will be giving away um soon i have been kind of m.i.a but if anyone follows me and babes with oils i do do giveaways i've been kind of lacking i'm sorry it was a really crazy holiday but as of spring 33 we're starting them up again and i do have six sets of rose oil samples so i have a rose oil sample and i have a rose oil lotion sample and then i have a little rose melt candle that will go with it if you want to win that um i will post this video on my site and you can tell me some things in a quiz i'm basically going to give you a quiz and if you paid attention you might win and there's six of them for the next month so i will do that you know what i'll start that monday we'll do that as my birthday gift to you okay you can celebrate with me that way um let's see anything else bone um hey naomi yes there was a question in the chat about breastfeeding and copaiba oh okay roller and or internal if so how many times a day okay okay um okay so for copaiba i feel like it's really flexible because i know people that take copaiba all day long especially if they're having anxiety attacks like if they're stressed out freaking out they're taking copaiba right there on the spot and that can happen a few times a day um i'd say start with the roller uh i'm not the roller i'm sorry start with the the bottle because the bottle you can make your own roller and if you don't know how to do that you can ask any of us but you basically just buy the rollers in the back or the shop office of doterra and i think they're like six dollars for a whole bunch you can kind of make your own remedies here i did that a lot when i was pregnant and breastfeeding because i couldn't use some things and some and then i wanted some of the other and i was trying to be sensitive for babies so that's how i did it and what you're doing is you're gonna fill it up with about 20 drops of something um to 30. so i you could put 20 drops of copaiba in there um and then fill it up with coconut oil yeah this one it's like 12. and this will fill up about a solid six i think if you're doing about 23 drops of an oil you can make a five six pack out of this one bottle if you just open up and distribute evenly but the copaiba itself is really gentle baby will not be hurt by that at all and if anything that would actually be really good to calm them down um and it does stimulate the brain tissue so it does kind of help with the smarts as well um but the copaiba eating does not taste bad so actually dropping that oil in your water might be the best option and because it's really simple it's very taste like mild and so you could add that to water juice or anything and have no issues with it um i would say just from my experience i've only taken about maybe 10 drops of um not i'm sorry i've only had 10 different times a day of an oil supplement that i've taken and the only times that i've taken a lot was when i was like trying to clear out a yeast infection a urinary tract infection um or or like i was hungover um or you know i was trying to get rid of a like a bacterial infection i was storing up things like that so oregano is a great one to roll on the spine for that kind of stuff um but i wouldn't take that all day you know what i mean versus copaiba i would take that all day um you know the the ones that you can take all day are not going to have a spice or herb so basically again a copib is more of like a barky resin so all the resins are okay the things that i would not take all day long that i would maybe cap to like four or five four times a day maybe max are going to be uh spices and herbs okay so um the mints like spearmint is okay but peppermint i would i would watch out how much you're taking it around baby adults can do that all day long but baby cannot so best to diffuse it if you really need it and you have baby around don't put it on your body diffuse it okay copaiba um that one i could take all day but i would not do on guard all day necessarily i would wait on on guard because you don't know if that could maybe upset things that baby you're gonna be eating you know what i mean so maybe diffuse the on guard take the pipe all day do the stronger roller that has copaiba in it and has um some some other things that will help boost your immunity but it won't it won't hurt baby like uh like uh on guard could maybe because of the clove that and the on guard also has um oh gosh there's a bunch of stuff i can't remember now cinnamon okay so that might be a little bit too strong do you know what i mean kind of think of it that way if it's a strong spice it's the same thing like spicy food you wouldn't give your two-year-old like a straight spicy bowl of something so you kind of want to think about that in your in your breast milk it's the same stuff right i hope that helps yeah okay um antioxidants in europe yes um any other questions if your husband offers foot rubs that's why you get in the mood yes tell him to use rose oil and clary sage geranium and um actually cinnamon will boost libido so on guard will boost your libido if you wanna you know just careful because if he's touching your feet and then he's touching you down there and that's like whoa that's a little much okay just careful where the fingers are going and what you just touched okay so like maybe stick to the to stick to the roses on the fee and then just eat the on guard to get the the up yeah okay all right what else are we good", "USIKoRhCPDY": "[Music] [Music] oh hi there today welcome to another episode of the okanagan gardener and forager channel today i'm going to talk about some wild and mostly edible berries found in the interior of bc thimbleberry rubus scientific name is rubus parviflores they are edible they have shallow domed dull looking fruits they kind of look like hairy raspberries and clusters of red drooplets they're typically eaten fresh because they're difficult to pick and seldom were gathered in large enough quantities to store and the leaves

liked it please give it a thumbs up", "R6tZ1BnM3kQ": "to make a simple berry compote you're going to need a small pan as teaspoon regular sugar white sugar and then about 100 grams of mixed berries I'm going to start off by putting all of the berries I'm using your teaspoon add some sugar 3 about 3 teaspoons 1 teaspoon 1/2 teaspoons of cold water I'm not named through and then you can start with that that's no that won't conduct heat as much I'm gonna bring it over to the stove this until the sugar caramelizes make sure that doesn't stick to the base low and the berries look what liquid liquid fire look you might want to just basically just give the frozen berries a but easy to use frozen berries I find just give I'm a little bit of a bash just to make it a more smooth the less chunky one especially if you're gonna have it with ice cream so this mixture has raspberries blueberries blackberries laughs berries and strawberries big selection in here you can you can blitz these and a blender or anything like that as well and just keep on stirring this until your nice caramelized liquefied compact after short simmer in a short amount of time should get a mixture like this I add a little bit more sugar and just basically you just want to stir it or simmer it until the sugar dissolves I have a nice mixture here another way you can actually match or break up some of the larger berries like the strawberry is in the black let's grab a fork and then you just stick it in there like this and then basically pull it away just use that for the bigger ones and help them when they're softer I just left the blueberries nice and big it's got a little bit of chunkiness to them just let it simmer until you have a nice decent flavor or until it gets nice and crispy until it's your warmth then then you can either pull it down and serve it with ice cream and there's little pastry biscuits that over here say it's how you make it very simple very common", "Eyd99E0uj3c": "what's up guys is here here and in today's video we're going to talk about my mix very blend smoothies fast that I did for a whole entire day do you want to know what fasting on mixed berries blend smoothies did to my body to lose a bunch of weight you want to know keep on watching alright 145 alright as what do you guys know that this was my fourth day of fasting so far first day I did a water only fast that I did a watermelon always bad and then I did a mango fast and now I'm doing a mixed berry smoothie blend that and specifically change things up so far in these videos I have really been telling you the benefits of doing these things and while I was doing this fast like for like all Karen be careful I just want to let you guys know that doing these fats have a lot of benefits to the body the inside of your body or organs and have a cold or whatever it helps to replenish everything because you're giving your body like a fresh start a way of eating that you're probably not used I mean I wasn't used to it obviously while I'm making smoothie I'm going to tell you the benefit of this into a student blend so you know that of course I'm ever in myself or in any way shape or form and all of these benefits vitamins minerals nutrients that are in the fruits that allowed to still eat as often if you're eating this only and solely for 24 hours straight for a couple of days in a row you're going to get a lot more benefit from these vitamins and nutrients if you were to eat other things so right now I'm gonna tell you the benefits of this week better is this antioxidant but why make it so keep on watching today we are doing the organic antioxidant blend which is a bunch of mixed berries with you know high-end team strawberries blueberries cherries and raspberries and I'm going to show you how to blend it up really we might add a little organic molasses it has a lot of calcium v6 iron magnesium zinc really good nutrients for the body and that's what we're trying to put inside our bodies what a fat so we add a little bit of this to it as well so let's get mixing so this antioxidant blend is basically full of things that would help any damaged cells repair cells and things of that nature it boosts your immunity it prevents cancer it helps with the living cells and the blackstrap molasses has a lot of iron and calcium in it so it will help with go and help and unlike other sugars that have absolutely no content whatsoever since most of the fruits that I've been eating doesn't have iron or calcium in it like that I thought it was a good idea just to add this just to make sure I'm not lacking any nutrients while I'm doing this fast so now what we're going to do is we're going to get some water now we're going to put on the cap twist it up a little bit and then we're going to blend it alright so let's try this out you don't say the molasses really refreshing so it's cold what I would recommend is that for teachers is make sure you drink water since it's so cold you don't want to like shock your system so much then you can happen it's good the more you drink it is better again but you can easily get a brain freeze so definitely drink it slow so is this a very blends movie due to me personally this is really good at every single taste that you had once it started to calm down and really coagulate with each other it started tasting better and better better but then like the last time I started to get a stomach ache ask you guys if you feel great and honestly I felt way better than I did the day before when that happened so I was able to drink another one it really really pulls you something last did I was anyway good morning is the next day we're going to see if we left anyway just drinking the mixed berry drink so here we go 1:45 so alas no weight which is cool all right okay so so far I love like nine pounds in like four days some of its water weight I told you before my pants are fitting a little better so it's not all water weight and like I said before I'm really not even doing this to lose weight I'm doing this more as a practice of keeping my word because even my word is more important to me than losing weight or anything like that so that's why I'm doing it it's a way of keeping my word and then it's also cleansing my body so it's all very very good thing I think to do every once in a while well thank you

video", "kz7hgURkopE": "Welcome to In The Kitchen with Ashlee Marie. I'm really excited about today's treat. It is my berry coulis. A coulis is a desert sauce. It's not as sugary or as thick as a syrup. It's really light and it taste amazing. And, it pairs really nicely with most deserts. I like it on top of ice cream. I love it with my flourless chocolate cake. And, my very favorite is to have it on my coconut panna cotta. So, let's get started. You can make your desert coulis in just raspberry, in just blackberry, in just strawberry- whichever one you like. Although, I will advise you not to do just the strawberry. For some reason, it comes out tasting like a fruit rollup. And, I don't really think of fruit rollups when I think of a nice, fancy desert like we'd be using for this coulis. So, I mix my berries. I do just a little bit of the strawberry, not a ton. And then, I split the rest between blackberries and raspberries. Now, we're going to add our sugar, our water, our lemon juice. And then, you want to use some zest. I like to use grapefruit or orange, whichever one that I have on hand at the time. Alright, we're going to turn this on. And, we want to bring this whole mixture to a boil, and then we're going to boil it for 8 minutes. The berries have been boiling for 8 minutes. You can see, it's a lot more liquid now. And, the berries are just kind of starting to fall apart in here. So, we are all ready to move on to the next stage. Alright, so now we're ready to pour the berries into our blender. Don't forget your lid, because this is going to splatter everywhere. It's still steaming and warm, and it smells amazing. And now, there's still a bunch of seeds in there, and we don't want that. So, we're actually going to strain it as we pour it out into a container, and then we can let it cool. This is actually a sink strainer, but I never use this one in my sink. I have a different one in my sink. This is one that I use for food. I like it because it's also nice and thin, and it really gets out even small stuff, like these small little seeds that are in this. So, if it's something berry-based like this, that has a lot of small seeds in it, whether you're using a big strainer or a small strainer, sometimes you have to go in here and move those seeds around, because they tend to collect and then kind of cause a blockage. So, rather than pour more right into this, I'm actually going to take these seeds, after I kind of press it out a little bit, take this big amount of seeds and toss it. Then, I'll pour some more in. I'm going to let this cool, and then we're going to serve it on some deserts. Alright. Mmm, so pretty, and smells so good. And, some fresh whipped cream. I wish we had smell-o-vision and you could just, at least, get a whiff of how amazing this is. Alright, if you enjoyed this recipe, either the flourless chocolate cake or the berry coulis, and you're interested in more, don't forget to subscribe. Also, if you have anything that you've seen on my site, or something you haven't seen that you just want to learn, leave me a comment and I will make sure to get to it. Thanks for watching.

candy bar texture just like the cookies and cream the cookie dough like it's just the texture is so great so the macros on this is 17 grams of protein we got five grams of sugar five net carbs um 140

recommend this their white chocolate is incredible incredible i have tried other white chocolates or keto white chocolate and not my fave this way chocolate is so good every white chocolate bar i've tried from them is on point and with the raspberry and this white chocolate it just goes together so well so let's take a little bite oh my god oh my god i just got that that raspberry cookie taste and it's like who needs those cookies it has real chunks of raspberry in there real chunks of raspberry so you get that nice texture of the like raspberry when you're chewing it and i think that makes all the difference i think if it didn't have that texture of the raspberry it'd still probably be good let's just be real but that texture just elevates it and the white chocolate with the raspberry i'm telling you if you love those raspberry cookies you need this because i'm not kidding you i used to kill a whole box of those back in the day and oh my god this just brings me brings back that

ball. -Mom.\n-Yes? -It was during.\nIt wasn't in between. -It was during?\n! -Okay, I have to go upstairs. Can I have it?\n-Yeah. Love you.\nHave fun. Maybe you're\nstress-baking-curious, but\nyou're a low-commitment cook. Have I got a dish for you. This is a frozen berry crisp that you can really use\nwith almost any fruit. And there is a huge payoff. It's warm, bubbly,\ncaramelized fruit basically with an oatmeal cookie\non top. This is my kind of baking\nbecause it's inexact. You don't have\nto get it perfect, and there's a lot of\ndifferent ways to riff on it. You can use a lot of\ndifferent kinds of frozen fruit. If you don't have flour in the\nhouse, don't worry about it. You do you. You do your crisp. And what I love\nabout this recipe, too, is that it's made\nwith whole grains and honey. So there's no artificial sugar\nin here. First, set your oven to 350. Next, get a small\noven-proof container. I'm going to use this\nsmall cast-iron skillet 'cause I love the way it looks,\nbut you can pretty much use any small oven-proof container\nyou have around the house. My Italian peasant ancestors\ndid not have a ton of different sizes\nof pans and pots. You'll be fine. A lot of people\nhave frozen fruit just kicking around\nin the freezer anyway from that time\nwhen you were sure you were gonna do a juice\ncleanse this time. Any kind of fruit works. You can even do a variety. But I usually put\nabout 5 cups in. Look what I found kicking around\nin the freezer, too. Some mixed berries. So I'm gonna throw\nsome mixed berries in. This is what I'm saying. Just whatever you got around\nis great. Now, a couple of things\nthat I really love about using frozen berries is, first of all, obviously,\nthey're just in the freezer. You can just pull them out. Second, they're already these\nlittle bits of deliciousness, and so,\nthey fall all over the plate, so you don't have to worry\nwhen you cut into your crisp for it to be, \"Oh,\nmy gosh, this looks so messy!\" It's like, \"No, it's supposed\nto look messy. It's berries.\nThey're all over the place.\" I have a lemon in the house,\nso I'm gonna squeeze the lemon over the berries to, like,\nbrighten the flavors. But you don't really have to do\nanything to them. Now you take a bowl. See, it's so easy so far. We can do this together. So, were just going to start\nwith a cup and a half of rolled oats. And then I put in about 1/2\ncup of flour. I usually use whole wheat flour\nin this, so it's all whole grain. Today I only have white flour,\nand I'm grateful for that. So we're gonna put that in. And if you can't find flour,\njust leave it out. Don't worry about it. And a teaspoon of cinnamon. This gives the cookie\na little more personality. Okay, just stir that\nto combine it. You honestly don't even need\nthe spoon because here's\nthe best part of this. We're gonna do the rest of it\nwith our fingers. Like, you just get into the bowl\nwith your fingers, and it just feels right. So, now I'm gonna do about\n6 tablespoons of unsalted, softened butter. This by itself is going\nto reduce your anxiety. You just pinch\nthe softened butter together with\nthe dry ingredients. And you can do this\nas long as you want. There are no knives involved\nor mixers, so this is perfect for a kid. Okay, now,\nwith these sticky hands, I'm going to pour\nin about 1/3 cup of honey. Look, I could take all\nthe yummy crumbles off of my hands right now,\nbut I'm not going to 'cause it's not the way I cook,\nand we're gonna be authentic. So, we've added 1/3 cup\nof honey, and now we're going to pinch it\ntogether again. Now we're going to put\nthis mixture right on top of the berries. You can just smush it on\nif you want, but I sort of like taking\nthe time right now. If you have some flaky salt\naround the house, put that on top. Not a ton, but honestly,\nthat sweet, salty flavor of a dessert,\nohh, that makes it. And it gives it\na little added texture, too. Just a little. Do it from a height so that it\nsprinkles a little more evenly. Now all you got to do -- pop it in the oven\nfor 40 minutes. Oh, my God. You should really let your crisp\nsit for 20 or 30 minutes so it can kind of gel together. Gets a little messy otherwise. But I can't wait. I am ready for this. And because it's fruit\nand oatmeal, that can be breakfast, right? Mmm! Warm fruit with an oatmeal\ncookie on top? I'm in. You know what? I think this spoon\nis the right spoon! We're not messing around here.", "u4xFPLkGDYA": "so I'm Brandi and who wants smoothies me perfect because I have a smoothie recipe that's super easy i'm going to show you how to do it so we have all our ingredients on the table the first thing is a banana so who'd like to cut this banana for me you he beat you to it I think okay i'm going to give you half a banana okay we're only going to use a half so i want you to cut that into little slices you do that for me excellent so the next thing we're going to need are some berries now we have some fresh berries now we could take these fresh berries chopped them up put them in a little bag and put them in the freezer and then you just pull the bag out and dump it into the blender but we're gonna start with fresh berries so we're going to need about a cup and a half of berries so let's give you two a couple of these giant California strawberries how about will give you that one and i'm going to start filling this up with we've got blackberries and blueberries raspberries and it really you can just chop them into like that perfect yeah so about as big as this blackberry so we want them to be all about the same size so when we blend them all up it's going to go really fast and they're going to break down at about the same speed that make sense that's perfect all right so why don't you grab those and put those right into the blender for me perfect and so the banana is going to give it some nice sweetness and a good thickness for our smoothie you're doing an excellent job excellent all right when we put your berries in there perfect perfect we're going to add some blueberries blueberries are going to make them nice and purple so this is about you know this is a very precise recipe no it's not so it's about a cup and a half of berries and then we've got a half of a banana okay the next thing we're going to do is we're going to put spinach Jake is that your favorite one spinach set your favorite vegetable okay yeah perfect all right I'm going to put about a handful in here now this looks weird right but you're not going to taste it I promise you kale you could also do kale you could chop up tail and do the same thing so whatever greens you kind of have laying around perfect then the next thing we're going to add is about three ounces of plain yogurt and this is how I measure it about like that right in the blender super easy the next thing we're going to add is about a half a cup of fruit juice so this is this is all pretty thick stuff so we want it to be a little bit thinner so that we can actually drink it and this is how I measure that we're going to put it in until it looks about right now you can also use milk any non-dairy milk or regular Barry milk in place of the juice it's really entirely up to you so where's our lid I'm going to put this on and you're in charge of the blender so show us how it's done to turn this on and we're going to blend it yep for just a few seconds yeah perfect now you seem about little pieces here so we probably need to blend it for just a few more seconds more so turn it on for me okay super so hand me one of those glasses that's how easy it is could you do that tomorrow morning right super easy you could make this for your family in bed or whatever we have a rogue banana but we'll just ignore it I'm going to pour this into a mason jar and that's that all right who's gonna be my taste tester 1jq and try it okay check it out let us know how it is what do you think yeah good I love it okay excellent you you", "o4ziZhuF85w": "hello and welcome to Katy fix today we are making a deliciously fruity little side to drizzle over ice cream or cream cakes or don't mention pancakes my recipe anyway deliciousness is what it is and it's super super simple but never for people so today we need a bag of frozen berries now this is any berries of your choice I've gone for raspberries cuz I'm a sucker for raspberries but they normally come in around 300 to 350 gram bags this will be enough to serve out four people and a delicious fruity kampachi sauce so one bag of frozen batch vege fruit I make a really interesting combo these are gonna go straight into a pan so in that goes to that we're also going to add 1 tablespoon of water to straight out the tap we're also going to add in half a lemon I really like a ding now I know that raspberries and in fact blueberries and blackberries or what-have-you do tend to have their own natural tartness so that's going to go into our oopsie thief design it's all worthwhile we do need to balance things out with a bit of sweetness now you can do that with sugar absolutely fine you can also do it things like agave syrup or Oh maple syrup that's what it's called I have here just some nice box standard runny honey and I'm going to pop in one tablespoon of that as well that's gonna go oh she's got a bit of lemon we're done then whack that on to a medium to high heat we do want this to boil because when it boils it's gonna start to reduce and that's why we're gonna get our lovely jammy completely spherical thing going on we're just gonna leave that on the heat it should take about five to seven minutes I'd say you want to bring up to a boil don't have to go too crazy so when it's catch plus it's just gonna make cleaning the pan an absolute nightmare though avoid that but we're just gonna leave that to melt down to reduce down and then once it gets to the right goods it should be kind of like when it face it covers the back of your spoon so it gives that lovely jammy glassy glaze we're good too okay so that's how the good kind of I said out seven minutes actually we went for the full top end of it boiling and it's just gone into this beautiful glossy really lovely like you've still got the bits of grass but you've still got a little few nuggets in there and obviously the seeds I have you I've used raspberries so the feed through in there too obviously at this point what you can do is put it in a sieve sip it all through and be left with a really smooth just berry sauce if you fancy that I love those little bits I love that texture I love texture and food so I'm gonna keep those in there and just enjoy this gorgeous like jammy compote we've got going on and as I say what I mean with it is it it just kind of creates a lovely sheen on the back of a spoon ah yeah look at the color ah mama that is so good so one thing to remember is that when it cools it will start to thicken up as well and go much more jam light and you know what this goes really well on it before but there and cakes check it out go check it out and enjoy and if you like this recipe and you want to see me just subscribe we're here every single Tuesday cooking super simple super

blueberries whatever you have whatever is in season and its really simple takes about 15 minutes to prepare the first thing you do is put a stick of butter in your 8x8 baking dish and you're going to melt that now if you are on cholesterol or fastens to diet I put it a nap on purpose or you can use a half a stick of butter and create this recipe okay we're going to heat this in the oven at 350 degrees to the buttermilk and while that's melted we're going to go ahead and get started on out there okay so I'm using blueberries and strawberries it's my favorite combination we're going to use a pint of blueberries these little small flecks together two of them at the pint but you usually can find a pint and then one pound of strawberries so I've already rinsed the blueberries I'm going to go ahead and add those to my bowl and the strawberries we're going to slice them thinly and going to add sugar vanilla and we're going to let the sugar dissolve and then we'll be ready to make our batter and put in the hook less than 15 min so I'll be right back all right strawberries it's like we're going to add a cup of sugar to that then dump the whole thing fine and the teaspoon of vanilla I like to use pure vanilla extract and we're going to stir this up and I know it looks like it will take a long time but in less than five minutes probably less than that all of this sugar will dissolve and it will be ready to be added back into the butter so we're going to dissolve the sugar just stirring constantly and I want to show you in real time so you're not scared to do this this sugar break down when it interact with the strawberry and makes a beautiful glaze it has been about one minute you can also have you are in a hurry just fit it to the side or you can even heat it up on the stove but you're just about done already about it's a two-minute mark and then was lit look at that it's already got the nicely but you don't want to buy them from each other so I started all the sugars involved it's pretty good so about three minutes okay we're done now we're just going to sit this to the side well is prepared to make the rest of our cobbler if you have a sifter you can use it if not you can stir together these dry ingredients we're going to use 1 and 1/4 cup of flour and 3/4 cup of sugar get those together and it just finds you don't have a sister but if you just be a nice excuse to pull it out all right today we're going to stir in 1 cup of milk and we're just going to stir it up until most of the lumps disappear so kind of was like pancake mystery a little bit going to make the large lump disappear you want to see a lot of trucks dry ingredients there and that's it in real time we're going to get our melted butter now we're going to take our batter and pour it right into the center of the butter rather use the half stick 3/4 stick or a full six all tastes great we're gonna pour it directly into the center this is with a half stick you see the butter coming over on the top there cuz I poured half of it out cylinder huh okay now we're going to just gently they're the very in the center and you're not going to stir it up easily there's a berry into the batter mixture we put the berries into the batter and the batter into the butter now we're going to stick the whole thing into the other and I'm going to put a cookie sheet underneath this pan because sometimes it can bubble over the side you don't want that smoky smell in your house though let's take a cookie sheet underneath now under this pain but on the lower level or lower home racking the up

given to me a long time ago and we're going to\nuse that a little over a year ago I did a video on sugar and it has some vanilla\nbeans in it so for a year these vanilla beans have been just marinating in this\nsugar we're going to use this as the sugar for in our jam so seven cups of\nsugar is a lot of sugar but I only use a little bit of GM each day so I'm going\nto go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and count 7 cups these are 1/2 cup\nincrements there we go we have 7 cups of sugar in with these berries if I could\njust give you a scent a vision it smells absolutely amazing with this vanilla\nbeans that were in this sugar now it didn't make the sugar a little bit hard\nbut I can go ahead and I'm going to work on the rest of this because it is just\namazing so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna heat this and bring it to a\nboil and once we bring it to the boil we're gonna add one of our liquid\npectins then we're gonna put it in our jars and I'll show you what it looks\nlike next now I have a full video on this and I'll share with you the link when I finished here we're gonna go\nahead we're going to fill up all of our jam jars and then we're going to add our\ntoddler lids now I'm not a big fan of toddler lids this is the first time\nusing them they're very expensive and I just didn't use the others but right now\nI use what I have and so I have the toddler lids and we're going to use them\nso we'll see how much this gives tire lid and we're going to take this seal\nand put it together and you're going to do it to finger tight and then when they\ncome out of the canner then we're going to tighten them now one thing nice about\nthese tattle is you can use them over and over and over again they are very\nexpensive though and I'm not comfortable enough to use them for anything pressure\ncanning at this point all right so now we're gonna put we're\ngonna take our jelly jars out and we're going to go ahead and we're going to\ntighten them some you can see already sealed pretty\ncool not bad they're okay it's just not sure what I think of it so there you go\nis the GM with the tagline is yo my friends is my jelly all of them sealed\nbut one it's really easy to tell if they are sealed they will concave in just\nlike the metal ones I'm a little bit apprehensive about the Tattler lids I\nlike them I don't think they work quite as good as the metal ones but I will use\nwhat I got take care everyone we'll see you guys\ntomorrow sit here at my desk editing a video I just want to thank you taking a\nmoment just to thank you for all of the wonderful things you've done for me your\nlove and your support and watching my videos and sharing your life with mine\nthese things I hold in my heart forever you", "gz12WxQl-30": "hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make a berry pie and this is what it looks like this pie has both a top and a bottom crust and in the center is lots of different types of berries so this is the perfect pie to make when berries are in season one because that's when they taste the best and two that's when they're the berries are reasonably priced where you can go pick your own so the first thing we're going to do is our pastry there is a video on the site and a recipe if you want to use that or if you have a favorite recipe go ahead and use that like I said you will need a top and a bottom crust so make enough pastry for that and then so what we're going to do is roll it out take out one at a time because your pastry does have to be well chilled before you roll it out you will need a nine inch that's 23 centimeter pie pan I'm using metal that's my personal preference you know some people prefer glass or ceramic earthenware I mean whatever you find you like so the first sale off put that aside of course you need to flour your counter when you're rolling out your pastry now this is an all butter pastry that's my personal preference so keep that in mind if you want to use the recipe on the site and then just take your rolling pin now we're going to roll this out to fit the 9 inch witch so we're gonna have to roll it to about 12 a 12 inch round both 30 centimeters and when you're rolling your pastry keep moving it around to make sure it doesn't stick if it does and just add more flour and the thing is which it is sticking you will find if your pastry is too cold you will have a lot of cracking and if that happens you know just let it sit on the counter or what you can do is just take your rolling pin and kind of bed conversely if you find it's really sticking and to the counter if it's too soft then just you know put it back in the refrigerator for a few minutes to firm it up so just keep moving it around just said we need about 12 inch round another way you can do is just put your pie plate upside down and of course you need it a little bigger than the diameter of your pie plate you know rolling no pastry making pastry is a bit of a technique or art so if you don't get it right at first I mean don't worry about it just kind of get it in your pan as best as you can and you know what no one's going to know once it's baked so don't get too worked up we all go through that learning curve with pastry okay that's good okay so what I do to transfer it I just use my rolling pin I kind of roll it around if you have too much flour then what you could do is just take a pastry brush and brush it off like so and then just unroll it on top and never when you're putting it into your pie pan never like stretch it because then it will shrink and we don't want that so just kind of gently and then what I like to do is kind of push it down to make sure it's in there because we don't stretch especially you went around the corners there yeah looks good you want a bit of an overlap as you can see and then I just go with my finger here and just make sure now you can do this couple ways you can if you like if you like a lot of pastry around the outside crust then what you could do is just go and tuck all your pastry like so underneath you don't waste any if that's what you prefer or the other way is just kind of press it down like so and then take a knife and see if I just kind of cut it off like so so showing you both ways so now what you at this point you can do a couple things you could just leave it like this you take the tines of a fork and kind of do a design or it might look I always do the same thing I take my two fingers like this and then I push in the pastry and then I get this I guess you could say it's a scalloped design I guess there's all different ways you can do this this is kind of my way okay so that's that is our bottom pie crust so now what we're gonna do is cover that because you know we worked it's a little soft I want that to chill I'm gonna cover that put it in the fridge I find those you know maybe about a half an hour before we add our filling but of course next what I'm going to show you is our top crust okay so now for our top crust what I'm going to do a little different here is I'm going to cover the top with stars pastry stars now you could just use a solid round of pastry and just cut some slits if your personal preference is a lattice crust you could just cut into strips what it really whatever you want now I find I like to roll the pastry into about a 13 inch round which is about 33 centimeters so you might want to have your trusty ruler and I've already started rolling since you've already seen me roll don't need to see me anymore so again looks good and then I have about a two and a half inch that's about six six and a half centimeter star just a cookie cutter you could use other shapes if you want and just cut it out and then I have a parchment lined baking sheet or you could just have boil or some or even plastic wrap down there and then just put your stars there and just cut out I find for this size I need you know somewhere about 18 to 20 of these stars so if you have to gather up you know once you cut out you'll have some scraps you might have to re-roll okay so that's number 20 that's right so I just what I'm gonna do is cover and put them into the fridge because again we work the pastry so it's a little soft so I'm gonna put that in back in the fridge you know 15 minutes half an hour just until they firm up so while both our bottom and our top crust it's in the fridge you want to pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit which is 200 degrees Celsius now if you have a regular eye oven meaning your element is on the bottom then have your your oven rack in the lower third you want to because you want to bake that pie more towards the bottom of your oven so that the bottom crust will bake I have a convection oven so it's with a fan which so therefore the the oven rack placement is not as important excuse me and what I also like to do is take a baking sheet right now and put it in your oven and let that warm up get nice and hot so then when we that also helps the Browning of your bottom crust so when we come back we will make our filling and bake our pie okay so now we're ready to make our filling so in a large bowl you will need five cups which is one point two liters of berries you can use like a couple of few types one type whatever I'm using a fresh blueberries using some blackberries raspberries and strawberries the only thing I will say is don't use too many strawberries because I'm using about a cup 240 milliliters because strawberries have a lot of water so you know pine maybe a little too runny if you use too many strawberries so just keep that in mind so um of course wash your berries first pick through them get rid of any of those soft ones or moldy ones and for the blueberries if they have any of the little stems pick those off and so we have that and then we obviously need to sweeten our berries so I'm you know it's really hard to say exactly how much sugar because it really depends on how sweet how sour your berries are a guideline is usually between 1/2 and 2/3 of a cup which is a hundred between 100 and 135 grants of granulated white sugar so I have that in a bowl and then of course you know berries say well let off their juices as they bake so we need a thickener I'm using corn starch I find for this berries again it's kind of hard to know because how how much juice your berries are going to let you know release I guess the sort so you I'm going to put about three tablespoons about 28 grams of cornstarch in there and then I like to add a little lemon zest that's the outside peel of your lemon I'm only adding a boat one teaspoon which is about one gram because and that adds you know kind of berries with lemon it kind of highlights their flavor so that's why I like to add a little of the zest and then just stir that all together now when you're we're also going to add one tablespoon 13 grams of freshly squeezed lemon juice when you're doing this of course always wash your lemon first and then take the zest off first and you can use one of these or just a box grater and then cut it in half and then get the juice not the other way around because if you only have half it's kind of hard to get that the skin off after that so stir that up and then dump that in and I'm also going to add that one tablespoon 13 grams lemon juice cuz the lemon juice just I mean you need a little bit of citrus with berries it just really brings out their flavors and that's our feeling see I you know I really want when berries are at their best I don't want a lot of other flavors in there we just want to really appreciate the flavor the berries you wanna make sure they're all sweetened and then that thickener is covering all the berries and I'm just going to so do the way and pour it into our chilled pie crust this speaks summer to me berry pie you know what you could do also sometimes I do if peaches or nectarines are in season sometimes I just replace a bit of the berries with some chunks of peaches and I don't know whether I said but the strawberries you know depending on the size if you can see this there I've cut them into just large chunks and then just kind of even that out so that's good so now what we're going to do is when footer stars first I have a little cream here because we want to what I'm going to do is take a pastry brush with my cream and just put around the outside edge of my cross net so that the when I put the pastry stars they'll stick because our crust is quite cold because we chilled it don't overdo it you don't want to try not to get it to pull too much just it's just gonna like it acts like a glue so now with our pastry stars starting I'm going to start at the outside edge kind of take the little tip and press it into the crust and then we just work our way around I like to overlap a little like that just press soon and work our way around okay so now I have the first like that so that I'm just going to carry on and until we have the whole pie cover it with the Stars okay so there we have it if you live in the States this would be perfect for the 4th of July all the stars okay so now we have that now we're going to take the cream and we're just going to lightly brush our stars with the cream again try not to have it pull too much this this is going to help with browning nice color to our pastry okay so that and I forgot to do something so I'm gonna do it now hopefully you won't forget to do it once you put the filling in there you're supposed to dot the top with little cubes of butter but one tablespoon 13 grams and I've cut into little pieces and so I am just going to you of course will not do this at home you will remember hopefully so I'm just going to try to push all those in okay there we go no one will know I'm not going to tell anybody when I serve the pie so now luckily there's all these little holes I can stick this in okay so now what I'm going to do is just take a little extra sugar sweeten the pastry a little for the top and we're ready now we have that baking sheet in the oven as I said it helps with browning and plus sometimes you will get your pie the the filling bubbles up a bit and we don't want that on the oven floor so the baking sheet will also catch any drips so now we're gonna bake this for 20 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit 200 degrees Celsius and then you're going to lower the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius for somewhere between 35 and 45 minutes so what what you're looking for is of course the crust to be a beautiful golden brown and what you're going to see is you know the juices are of from the filling are going to start to bubble up and that's when you know the filling is done now sometimes what happens is you get some over browning especially around the outside crust or even if you on the top if your pastry stars are brown over browning before you're filling bubbles now the outside crust what I do is just you can either use just a piece of foil or I have actually a pie shield and you just put it over like that and that will prevent any more browning on the outside or like I said Center just put a big piece of foil and usually that well into the leg maybe after about 25 minutes or so before you typically before you need that so and we go okay our berry pie is now done see beautiful golden brown cross on or whether you can see it but the juices are bubbling and it's a good thing I had it on baking sheet cuz you can probably see and I use an old baking sheet that I did the juices did bubble over so now what we want to do try not to cut into a any type of fruit pie when it is hot or even warm it really needs several hours and that way those juices will thicken and be absorbed back because if you cut this pie too early what will happen is the juices will run and then there's really I mean that's it they're never going to like get nice and thick so what I'm going to do is probably leave this probably about three hours out on the counter and then when we come back we will cut a slice so now we're ready to cut our pie I'll let mine sit about two and a half hours just in room temperature so let's let's see how it worked sharp knife mmm then you all know that first slice that was a tough one will see you wouldn't get it out in one piece okay go that look nice you can see there's not a lot of juices running so they've been they thickened absorbed back just how I like it Kate to serve very nice on its own or you know little scoop of vanilla ice cream or even a dollop of whipped cream goes very nicely if you're so inclined so let's try a bit oh that's very nice of course you've got that buttery crisp crust both on the top and the bottom and then a quart all those berries you know I just I put you know almost maybe a half to 3/4 to 2/3 of the cups somewhere between 100 to 135 grams of sure and for my berries you know that's that's just about right I really like that so a perfect pie when berries are into season try it and until next time I'm Stephanie gave joy baking calm", "KeNTAZ-OHxA": "[Music] hi it's lori from recipe girl and today i'm going to show you how to make my triple berry salad this is a great summer salad because it showcases beautiful fresh berries that you can find all summer long now the story behind this recipe is kind of funny my sister came to visit me one summer and i looked at her and i saw how skinny and beautiful she was looking and i said hey what's the story what are you doing with your diet and she said i eat salads every day and i said well that gets kind of boring so anyway that night she sat down and she said you know we're going to add berries we're going to add sugared almonds we're going to add avocado and that is what this salad is all about so i can't wait to share it with you you're gonna love it for this recipe visit recipegirl.com", "8XE8_JKgoCA": "hi everyone i'm nori i'm the maternal child health worker for prince george and today we're going to be making a mixed berry jam i also have my friend here to help us hi i'm amy i work for curious county family services as well i work in the barrel department [Music] [Music] so we have here our freshly picked berries or you can use frozen berries whatever you prefer we're going to use approximately two cups of each and we're going to mix them into this bowl here and then what we're going to do is we're going to reduce them down a little bit squish them you can use a blender you can use a potato masher fork whatever you have on hand but today for the ease of things amy and i have freshly washed our hands and we're just gonna squish them the fun way it does not feel the best but it is quite easy no special utensils required if you are a person has that has sensory issues you can also use the blender or the food processor like i said before because it does feel quite gross so now that we have our bowl um with all of our smushed fruit just be warned if you do use um frozen berries it will freeze your hands a little bit so um our hands are now clean and we're ready to discuss um the equipment that you need for canning sometimes it can be overwhelming because you think you need a lot of fancy equipment and you actually don't a good pot a thick pot that you can put on your stove and fill with hot water or filled water and then bring it to a boil i have that on the stove right now ready to go um you don't need a special insert if you don't have one and amy has a really good tip for what she does yes so when i'm canning without a canner i use these rings and i just laid them this isn't the pot but i lay them in the bottom of the pot like that and i fill it up and then i put my jars in and it protects the bottom of the jars from smashing together and from getting too hot on the bottom of the pot and yeah good tip yeah i didn't know that i learned that from mimi today it's awesome so a couple other things that we have um that you can to use to get the stuff out of the pot i have i do have some canning tongs you can use regular tongs you could use um i don't know what else would you use to get another what do you use amy i have a big silicone glove oh that's gonna be consistent and i just grab and then i have a tea towel in my hand and i like that and then make sure i put them gently down so that it doesn't break the seal perfect okay so we what we're going to do is we are going to start measuring six cups of our crushed fruit into our pot amy's gonna do that this smells so good it does smell really good [Music] not too bad it was pretty close hey six i can adjust later six six ish of fresh fruit so now that we have this in our pot we are going to add our um sugar another little tip is if you can find the low pectin um low sugar or sorry low sugar serto that's a healthier option especially for people um that have diabetes because you just have to i think it calls for either only one cup of sugar or you can also use a cup of pure apple juice as your sweetener today because we couldn't find any of the low the low sugar soda we're going to add the ton of sugar to it it's so much sugar um it calls for seven cups of sugar so we're gonna add that to our um our mixture so we have our mixed berries on the stove now we're gonna bring it to a boil once it's boiling we are going to add our seven cups of sugar and one box of soda make sure to keep stirring this constantly or you will burn your jam i have and it tastes like smoked jam i've had smoked strawberry jam before oh it's not very good so as you can see our fruit medley here is come to a boil and amy is going to continue stirring and add the seven cups of sugar and our serto to that mixture it's okay just keep stirring and we're going to bring it to back to a boil and let that boil for a minute so that all of the sugar and the soda dissolves into the mixture another tip and trick that we have is a lot of recipes will call for you to skim the top of the mixture sometimes it will get a little frothy and one thing that you can do is you can just add a tablespoon of butter to that or margarine whatever you have on hand and it'll keep it from getting all frothy i'm just making sure to take them make sure the lumps are all squished of the sugar so as you can see we have um six sterilized jars and lids they we've just removed them from our canning pot we've boiled them for probably about five to seven minutes and now we're going to add our jam to them so we have all our ingredients in front of us we have our pot with our gem that we've removed from the stove and we have our sterilized jars and now we're going to use our funnel and we're going to begin to fill the jars we're going to make sure to leave a quarter of an inch at the top for a seal a proper seal to be to be formed i'll let amy fill these and then i'm going to use this towel and i'm just going to wipe the rim to make sure that there's nothing on them and um make sure the seal will seal properly so we have some spills just on the inside of the jar i'm just going to take this towel and wipe it just to make sure that there's nothing left on there and then the jar will seal i'm going to take one of our lids and make sure that there's no water left behind on it and we're just gonna screw on the lid finger tight not too tight and sorry and then once they're all filled we're gonna put them in our our pot and we are going to process them for 10 minutes so here we have our big stock pot it's full of water we have a little um canning trivet in the bottom that i will have amy now put all of our pros our jars that are filled with our jam she'll put them in the bottom and then we will process them for 10 minutes and when we remove them we'll put them on a clean towel on the counter and just wait for the the seal to take place in a normal counter you'd have to put them in one here one here one here one here one here one here otherwise it tips these ones are already tipped a little bit and then we will put on our lid and we will process that for 10 minutes hey everyone so here we have our jam it's all completely finished it's been processed for 10 minutes and the lids are already starting to pop to let us know that they're sealing and they should taste really yummy thanks for joining us amy welcome anytime okay", "1fCTpO9Bikk": "[Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale a miscible sort of water in the kitchen I want to share my recipe for my fresh berry compote it's delicious it's really I like to think of this it's like a fresh quick jam really because this is what it reminds me of but there's no pectin in it so it's not gonna be stored like you would store Jam it's easy and quick to do so let me take you over the ingredients so you can get started I'm gonna need a mixture of berries and I'm using some blackberries raspberries and strawberries which means any kind that berry that you like plain all sugar some cornstarch and you're going to need an orange because we're going to be using the zest and juice of the orange now this is something that's absolutely fantastic on so many different things I use as a topper on ice cream I use it today I'm gonna be using it with my homemade waffle so it's like really delicious and goes together perfectly you could use it to top pancakes you can use it with I don't know your croissant you can just use this however you would use jam you know on a muffin or a cupcake or even like um I use this is the fruity layer on one of my trifle recipes delicious and also to make like little parfaits for breakfast but anyway let's get into the cooking shall we I have a large saucepan here I'm going to preheat it over medium heat I'm going to put in my berries now the raspberries the big ones of 1/2 the small ones I've left whole I'm going to put that in there with the sugar whoops and the zest of an orange now the one thing you want to be careful here is that you don't mix up the berries so much that they're gonna fall apart because you want to keep the shape you want to be able to child that you have beautiful pieces of berry in your compost so you know try not to mush it up to too much now well that's happening smells fantastic already I'm just gonna give this a light just like that's fine I'm going to cook this over medium heat until the sugar dissolves it'll take about 5 to 7 minutes and again don't move it up to too much because you want to be able to see the berries in the meantime we're going to make the slurry for that's going to go in here to thicken it up now what I have here is some corn arch into this cornstarch I'm going to add in the juice about let's say half of an orange you need about a tablespoon or so of orange juice that's good a little pop goes in there guys perfectly fun it's going to be delicious so just give this a stir with a little spoon this makes a little slurry this is going to be the thickening agent that takes this from liquid into a really nice thick consistency so I'm going to just set that aside I'm going to babysit my berries giving them a stir every now and then until it comes up to a boil and once it's up to a boil just cook it enough for the sugar to dissolve my mixtures up to a boil and the sugar has dissolved so now I'm going to add in our cornstarch slurry and just stir it in very gently as you can see you can still see the berries are nice and plumped up and have their shape so that's wonderful and I'm going to let this cook I'll let it boil for one minute and after the one minute I'm going to just let it cool a bit till they fit ends up a little bit and then we'll serve it now after I put in my cornstarch slurry I let it cook for a minute and then I'm just letting it cool for a little bit but you know me I'm impatient and I'm ready to eat so I'm gonna eat this with just a little waffle today it's just delicious it's one my favorite ways to increase look at that it's like the most gorgeous look at the beautiful colors the texture the fact that the berries still look like berries is the most important thing to me maybe not to everyone but that is what I'm looking for making my mouth water because I know how much I love it this is really good um just don't bite everything really it's gonna piece it back on piece of my waffle hmm that fresh jam a tasting jam but I don't know it's just like 10 times better it's really juicing the actual fruit looks like free it still has its texture it's delicious I'm going to go over the black bar because blackberries are actually my favorite berry if you didn't know that hmm I hope you've enjoyed spending time with me and I hope I've given you some ideas as to what you can use this for but don't you worry because upcoming videos I'm definitely gonna share those ideas with you go to deputy wwr in the kitchen now calm to get the recipe I'll see you next time [Music]",

guys in the next one deuces [ __ ] [Music] [Music]", "a-dCICl6GeE": "hi guys hope you well so today we're gonna make a beautiful homemade crumble threeways beautiful stewed fruit with a crunchy crispy topping it's an easy go-to dessert to make people very very happy what I want to do is start off really basic on the filling and then really basic on the topping and then just change it up three times to get you all ready to go so first up let's start with the humblest crumble ever the great british apple crumble now i grew up with just Bramley apple crumbles delicious but what we want to do to achieve the most apple ii delicious flavor and texture is actually mix it up using different eating apples so we've got this lovely mixture some big chunks some little chunks you want to get a nice splash of water in with the apples pan on the heat and then I'm gonna add 150 grams of sugar just a few strokes of lemon zest really really nice so a little lid on top give that five six seven minutes and then when it's a little bit tender then we'll get the crumble topping on top and get it in the oven so when it comes to the beautiful crumble topping it's a really simple recipe half fat two flour I'm gonna use a kilo of plain flour and then we're gonna use half as much butter so 500 grams why am I making so much so I can bag up the rest and put it in the freezer and then a month later two months later you see some fruit bang it together crumble on top in the oven and you've done the dessert in no time at all bring this together and then one about or two 500 grams of sugar that's golden caster sugar you could just take a little bit of brown sugar gives a like a crunch so Muscovado sugar it's a little bit licorice II you can do one you can do a mix you can even put a bit of honey in it so mix that up add some vanilla so you could use vanilla pods or paste now absolutely smells amazing now so that's your basic standard easy-peasy crumble topping and there you go so I've got my apple here sprinkle it on top beautiful so in the oven it goes at 180 degrees Celsius which is free 50 Fahrenheit for about half an hour in Goldin and blipping and delicious that's your basic apple crumble let's take it up a notch let's do a second version fruit combo we shouldn't just think that fresh fruit is the only way frozen fruit is a game-changer what I've got here is berries and blackcurrant mix and whack a gas hob on put a little bit of water in a pan add some sugar just about a hundred grams and then straight in with the fruits about a kilo just half an orange in there let's get a lid on bring it to the boil now as far as its basic crumble topping is concerned could we do anything to it to sort of inflict even more deliciousness and the answer I think is yes these are flaked almonds crunch them up like that I absolutely love them and it's over look in here smells incredible and now we've got a beautiful bramble crumble with an almond and vanilla topping yes right so this goes in the oven half an hour again until golden and crisp and then I can show you potentially my favourite crumble and this is a stone fruit crumble have a look at this so I'll show you what I've done I've just got beautiful stone fruit like plums nectarines peaches apricots you could use any combination you like take the stone out put it in half store quarters I've sweetened this with two things one is some honey beautiful and two I just got some strawberries and grated it and it's a really nice natural way to sweeten it and that roasting for about 20 minutes it just makes it jammy and intense and delicious and the other thing I love love love to do is beautiful poori jokes so a nice handful in like that just use your hands porridge oats give it an incredible flavour a lovely texture and I absolutely love it so this goes back in the oven for about 20 minutes half an hour until golden and delicious let's let these cook and when they're all cooked up I'll show you what to do later so it's that time where the three crumbles are ready beautiful beautiful crumbles look at them very exciting let's go in with our Apple first come on very pleasing I'm gonna go for classic custard then we're gonna go for this beautiful brambles look at that come on the smell is something else and I love it when the ice cream starts the milk yeah and last but not least we're gonna go for the roasted stone fruit crumble beautiful such amazing intense flavors now I get to have three mouthfuls or free crumbles humble apple crumble mmm memories of school dinners good ones good school dinners misses Gilby love you amazing and then we got the frozen fruit I'd go into a freezer and grab some toppings and some fruit and knock out something that's homely and like a little hug this is what we need in life I think mmm so I love that so good completely different last but not least the roasted fruit crumble you know it kind of feels a bit more grown-up a bit more adult he I suppose and what a wonderful way to finish your meal hmm i'ma have to start from the beginning again I'm not sure if I said everything correctly I think it's just an amazing dessert that makes me very happy and I hope you enjoy it too so until next time take", "1wVS8h33ttU": "hello lovelies if you've been watching over the last few weeks you probably already know that we are welcoming the summer season here on the channel with lots of delicious frozen treats we've made tons of great ice cream flavors and today we are doing something a little different we're actually going to be making five amazing sorbets these are all fruit based surveys and they are incredibly easy to make and super super tasty like honestly even I was surprised by how delicious they are so for each of these delicious sorbets we are going to be using a sugar syrup now this is really really simple to put together in a small saucepan on the stove now you always have the option to skip this step if you don't want to add any additional sugar to your sorbet but this not only adds so much needed sweetness it also really helps with the texture of the sorbet so I definitely recommend it if you're gonna go ahead with these recipes this all starts with our saucepan over medium heat and we're basically just going to dump our sugar into our saucepan and then pour over our water I'm just going to heat this through stirring constantly until that sugar dissolves completely and then once all that sugar is dissolved you can simply transfer this to a heat safe dish and allow it to cool completely before adding it to any of my surveys for my first sorbet I am making a classic a very berry sorbet and for this recipe we are using all sorts of gorgeous berries now of course you always have the option to freeze your berries yourself especially if you can find them beautifully in season this time of year but I'm shooting today with some store-bought frozen berries I have an amazing combination here of strawberries blackberries blueberries raspberries and even some cherries for good measure and I'm gonna get them all in to my food processor you can also do this in a very high-powered blender but if you don't have a high-powered blender I would definitely recommend using a food processor instead I find it makes this job way easier that I am also going to add a splash of my sugar syrup of course you get to control how sweet you want your sorbet to be so you can add a little more or a little less depending on your preference I'm going to pop the lid on my food processor and let it work its magic guys look how beautiful this is super smooth super frosty way delicious it's got the perfect consistency so you can either eat it immediately or pop it back into the freezer for a few hours and let it firm up a little bit either way it is super delicious and I think you guys are going to love it this is one dessert that is basically impossible to resist if you like pina colada you have come to the right place because our next sorbet is a pina colada sorbet nothing reminds me of vacation quite like the flavor of a pina colada so this is a combination of frozen pineapple a good splash of coconut milk we're also adding our sugar syrup of course and then I'm going to finish it off with the zest and juice of one lime on goes our lid this is gonna be great guys [Music] I don't know how else to say it you need to run not walk to your kitchen and try this stuff it's unreal don't believe me you should ask the rest of our team we devoured it before the shoot was over you're sorry next for something slightly unexpected but wildly refreshing we are making a cucumber melon sorbet now today I am using some frozen honeydew in this recipe but you could also just as easily do this with frozen watermelon both would be incredibly delicious and super refreshing too that I am also adding some frozen cucumber I just placed them up pop them into the freezer and as you can see we're going to combine these in the food processor with a splash of our sugar syrup another great option here would be to add some fresh mint or fresh basil but I'm keeping things simple with this sorbet blend this all up and what you basically have is a sorbet that tastes like a day at the spa super relaxing next for another classic flavor pairing I am mixing up some frozen mango with some frozen and raspberry such a delightful mixture I love this combination because the mango is nice and sweet and tropical tasting and of course the raspberries are sweet but also slightly tart and sour so they're a really beautiful combination once they're mixed together we will also add a little bit of our sugar syrup and get this blended away the color of this alone makes it worth the effort don't you agree there's not one of the prettiest things you've ever seen finally guys we are making a sorbet that I think really celebrates the best flavors of summer it is a peach basil sorbet and of course it starts with some frozen peaches in my food processor next I'm going to add my fresh basil leaves come summer I just want to put basil in everything it belongs getting everything and it smells so good and so fresh and it's so beautifully complemented with peach and then I'm going to add my sorbet syrup to this and then I'm going to get this all blended the combination of peach and basil as you guys probably already know from a bunch of my other recipes on the channel is one of my all-time favorites trust me you will not regret this one it's so refreshing so delicious perfect served at like a cool party on a sunny summer day I hope you will give all five of these sunny sorbets a try and if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or snapchat me a photo because of course you know I love

deliciousness where this came from", "Rqf2WczX468": "hi welcome back to our channel and today we're going to make um fruit jam okay let's start by putting two cups of frozen or fresh berries we already have done that and then you guys could just on it and then keep it on medium and just keep sauteing it wait two to three minutes until the next step it's been two to three minutes now you guys okay you guys should add um half a cup of sugar i have a 1 4 cup so i'm just gonna add two of those there's one cup i'm just gonna add a second cup now and how much that's a half a cup and now we just gotta saute it okay now we're just gonna add a pinch of salt and then we're just gonna stir so you guys can lower the heat now because the bubbles bubbles um kept rising so now we're just gonna add the lemon so it sets the jam my mom told me this now we're just gonna squeeze that watch out it's really hot and then you just mix it so we put on high heat because we want it thick and if you saw our jam before we put on high heat it was liquidy so we just want it to evaporate so it gets thick you guys want to have like um a pan that has a better better width because it's faster to evaporate you guys don't want a um a pin like a narrow also can be like harder to evaporate the liquid we're trying to make a chunky to tell you the berries we use we use strawberry blueberries and blackberries and you guys can do like strawberries um blueberries you can do raspberries raspberry blackberries blueberries any combination you want and now we're just gonna mash it like this you guys just press it and let it just get under it you can hear that sound it sounds so nice my mom always says a good chef preps and then always cleans up while the jam is cooking we're just gonna clean the air right now so we don't have to do that like the end so we're going to put this one my mom got this from sausalito in a place called heat ceramic you guys want to um a jar or glass that's heat proof so it doesn't get um too hot and start to melt i'm going to zest the lemon right now but be careful guys it's still very hot because we just offed it getting some off after you add the amount of lemon dust you want just stir it and you guys can eat this like with crackers cheese you can have it with peanut butter and some sandwich um after this you guys can just um put it in the jar but mine is still hot so we gotta wait so this is an after-school snack i didn't make this for my sister and i and we didn't eat with cheese into some crackers so my sister and i finished the crackers and we ate some of the jam with it you guys should try this and if you guys want more um recipes like this subscribe like and turn and post notifications", "-Em_ADe2qpU": "hey everyone I'm Laura Klein in your organic authority

(upbeat music) - Good Mythical Morning. - Here in our little patch to the universe, our small human brains spend countless hours theorizing\nabout our own dimension. Our purpose within it, and the very fabric of our own reality. Does time bend like rainbow? Or swirl and multiply like swamp gnats? And if there are other realities, what kind of goodies do they got? - So today we'll find\nthat out by playing God and defying the universal laws of physics to taste real foods,\nfrom alternate universes. It's time for part four\nof Multiverse Munchies. We're gentlemen and scholars so, you can trust us when we tell you that if we can think of something, anything at all, then it must be an actual thing\nin some parallel dimension. That's the multiverse, baby. - So, once again we've stretched our good\nmythical imaginations and we've thought up some\nalternate universe snacks and then the mythical\ncrew has actually gone out and tracked down these snacks, - Yeah. - And brought them back to our dimension. And now we're fixing to find out, if each Multiverse Munchie is\nfrom a Delicious Dimension. - Yeah, dat. (laughs) - Or if it's a Snack Offension. - Okay, first off, there's\nan alternate dimension where they don't have the tiny rock candy that we call Nerds, instead they have Jocks. (laughs) Jocks. They're bigger. Jocks come in a bigger box. Okay, break 'em out Link. - So let's okay so. I was told to be gentle. - Yeah, you've gotta be gentle with Jocks. - They've traveled a long way. - Yeah, apparently in this dimension the jocks in high school don't peak in their teenage years. They continue to get bigger, stronger, and more toxically unable to examine their interior emotional lives. - Oh my goodness, they're a bit large. - Oh wow. - Okay. - Oh, they smell like Nerds. But they feel like Jocks. - Now don't leave these laying around your hot mom. (laughs) Okay? - Yeah. That's right. - You know how they do. Did we dink it? - We dinked it. - Did we? And now we sink it? - You gotta think like, how big of a bite are you gonna take? - I love a nerd. - You're gonna take an apple, oh. Oh, I feel like you're\ngonna break something. - It's a little lighter colored inside. - Why was yours so hard to bite? Mine was very soft and just completely gave in to\nwith the weight of my mouth. - Very crusty on the outside. If you've ever had a nerd, just imagine it a whole lot bigger and that's exactly what's\nhappening to my mouth right now. - Is that just 100% sugar? - [Josh] No, it's a sugar, egg white, cream of tatar, and the\nspecial nerds flavoring. - Okay. - Yeah, 'cause it's got\nother natural flavoring. Gotta have grape. - It tastes like 100% sugar. Oh, has it made my mouth purple? I got Jock mouth now. I got Jock mouth. - Now in this alternate dimension, - It's an STD. (laughs) - They turn all. - What do they call those now? What's the proper name?\n- STI's. - It's an STI. In 2020. (laughs) - I'm trying to talk, they turn all drinking and eating into games. - And that's what we're\ngonna do right here. - Oh gosh, look at my fingers. I got Jock fingers. It's an STI. - All right, so let's play Jock. let's play Jock pong. They turn all eating into games, so they don't have to connect\nsocially or interpersonally. - Now, I wanna let you\nknow something Link, you're Jock balls are\ngoing to stain my shirt, (laughs) if you hit my shirt. - I can get you another one of those. - Just letting you know. - mythical.com - Yeah, oh very nice. - So, it's kind of a, you hold it in between your forearms and then you, wait, you wanna go first? See if, Oh, is that my fault or your fault? Your fault. - I think that was a little short. Now you go. Was that - You gotta squeeze harder. - Was that my fault? Or your fault?\n- Your fault. You're fault, all right, try again. - Again - All right, here we go. (mumbles) - Look what you did to my shirt. I gotta a Jock stain on my shirt. - I'm a Jock, I don't need math. - It's an STI. - Hit me one more time. - How many times can I say STI? - Now, you've reached your limit. Now, basically we're trying to determine, is this Snack Offension or not? - If I make it, this a snack is a, it's a snack Delicious Dimension. All right. - Oh yeah. And it tastes great. Yeah, so we agree a Jocks\nare a Delicious Dimension. Delicious Dimension\n- Delicious Dimension - All right now, Cinnamon Toast Crunch is an essential part\nof a sugary breakfast. But there's an alternate universe where Cinnamon Toast\nhas never been invented. - What? - And in that timeline, every generation is a\ngeneration of millennials, and everyone is there brunching\nfrom noon to midnight noon, and that's why, their favorite cereal is Avocado Toast Crunch. - Yes. And in this particular universe this is the official\ncereal of white people. (laughs) - Oh my gosh. - Okay, let's see what we've got in here. - Pour it. - Well first of all, - Yes. - We've got us some little some toppings. - Okay. - Some salt, pepper, chili. - Got a bonus pack - et cetera - Yup, yup, we'll come back to that. That goes on the top of your. - Oh, look at, oh look wow, it looks like it's dusted with avocado. - Now, I just, I kinda just wanna, - It smells like fish food, but. - Oh does it? - I'm still holding out hope. - Oh my God. - It might work. - It does smell like it's for the fishes. - Did you fish eat avocados? - Little guppy that thing. Now each one of these, in that dimension, costs four bitcoin. - Yeah, I get it. - Should we taste one, or should we? - They have bitcoin there. - Should we go ahead and pour? - Let's eat cereal, how\ncereal should be eaten. - Yeah, well I'm not\ngonna put that one back. - With the milk? - Yeah, well, I'll pour,\nit's kinda my thing. (laughs) All right, so, here we go. Look at, you're not even looking. - It looks great. I'm gonna go ahead and out some toppings on\nbecause based on just the smell that came out of the\nbox it needs toppings. - Now these toppings are salt,\npepper, red chili flakes. Which is, what you put on Avocado Toast. Right? - I'm going liberal, okay all right. - I think everyone who eats\nAvocado Toast goes liberal. (laughs) - Yeah. You're right. Now get a big spoonful. - You think I'm afraid? You think I'm scared? I ain't scared. And dink it.\n- Dink it. - Sink it. (crunching) This might be a little\ntoo far left for me. - It doesn't taste like avocado. - Whoa, yeah it's turning\ninto a paste, look. Why you giving up on it? - I thought it was avocado, not algae? - [Josh] It's dehydrated avocado, which apparently just turns into algae. - Yeah, right. - Oh my gosh. - You sure you didn't\njust find an old aquarium and scrap the insides? And you've dusted over\nsome Cinnamon Toast crunch? - [Josh] Think I did\nthat for another episode. - Listen to him. - Here's the problem,\nas with all millennials, it's not about eating\nit, it's about posting it on your Instagram. - Ah, right. - So, I'll do a selfie here. - And we gotta look\nlike we really love it. Even though we hate it. - Hold it closer so it's you know, it seems like it's about the bowl, but it's really about us. Couple more of those all right. - Okay but. - We'll put that on our Instagram so that you can make us\nfeel better about ourselves. - Okay, Avocado - Mythical - Avocado Toast Crunch is definitely a Snack Offension.\n- Snack Offension. - In our universe, we've\ngot jalapeno poppers. Sometimes deep fried, sometimes grilled. Always delicious. But they lack a little spark, missing some kind of (foreign language) - Yeah, oh French. But, in an alternate universe they've got Jalape\u00f1o party poppers. - Whoa. - So do we have a regular party popper? To show what they do. Yeah, so just to refresh your memory. Hey. Oh, that was nice, it stinks too. - Smells like, yeah. - I can't stop smelling\nit, even though it stinks. - Don't try to go through the\nTSA after touching this stuff. - Okay, so. This is a universe of total partyers man. - Yeah. - Hey. So, (laughs) we've actually loaded popper stuff inside of a actual popper\ninside of a Jalape\u00f1o. - Right. - And I'm gonna pop this, in your mouth. - You know what, how about I\npop it, into your mouth first? (laughs) - Well, I'm already holding it. - Yeah, well, - And I'm already aiming it. - I can get another one. (laughs) Let's just let me do a\nlittle quality test here. - Okay well. - You know, just kinda\nserve as a baseline. You also have eye protection. And you have a lot bigger mouth. (laughs) So, and I'm more accurate. So I mean, it's all really adding up here. - I'ma try to put my\ntongue over my esophagus, so it doesn't just youp. - You don't wanna get a cheese plug, in the back of your throat? (laughs) - No. So I'ma try to block it. - Face me a little bit more. Okay, you ready? Am I too close? - [Woman] Yep. - Wait, that too far? - And this is just right.\n- Y'all making me nervous, (laughs) What? - Hey man. - You just wanna wear the glasses? - No. Okay sure. - Well I mean, and get popped. - Open your mouth as big as you can. Three, two, one. (laughs) - Ah The torture. Did you do it? - I pulled it. - And it fell? - I pulled it, but it didn't pop. You know what, they don't always pop. This could explode at any time though. I just want you to know. It's like a grenade at this point. So, I'm gonna set it facing you. (laughs) And go to another one. - Let's face them. - Okay, are you ready? - Seriously? - I think I thought about\nit too much on that one. Open your mouth. - I also thought about it a lot. - Just open your mouth. Okay, hey, now I got an\nidea of what I gotta do. - Just get close. - It doesn't come out. - Just get close. - It doesn't come out hard. - There's some on my glasses. - It got on my shoe. - Oh, look at that. - Eat it off that. - I'm not going to eat this part that touched your shoe though. 'Cause I know you pee on top of your shoe, I saw it yesterday. - That was when I washed my hands. I came back from the bathroom, he said, \"you got, a little\ntinkle on your sneaker.\" (laughs) - That's not how I said it. - All right, do me. (laughs) - Is that your protection? Your protecting the glasses. (laughs) Okay. - Hold on, how close was he getting? - What? - I don't want an Ah - What you did, I'm not Once you pop, - Don't get. - You can't stop. - You gotta be at least six inches away. - Unless you go cheese blind, here. Oh, oh. - Oh, oh. - You almost caught it. - I got the paper. I started chewing, I was like, I got a Jalape\u00f1o and it tasted like paper. - It's down here. - There's some on my crouch. - Here it is. - Nope. You know what, I will say though. - It's fun. - It the little bit that\nI got off of the paper tasted really nice. And it was fun, I could imagine this\nbeing a really good time in a party. - Oh yeah. People just like, blasting\noff in each other's faces. - Yeah. - So I think we agree. This is a Delicious Dimension.\n- Delicious Dimension. - You know sometimes\nthe alternate universe is just next door and our brand new, state of\nthe art, Mythical Kitchen. After this video, go check it out and see Josh make a\nCheetos apple pie, what? Yes, he did. - Now in this timeline,\nwe love a hot snack and I'm not just talking\nabout Shawn Mendes. I'm talking about Flamin' Hot Cheetos. - But there's an alternate universe, where they hate spicy snacks. But they love Freezin' Cold Cheetos. - Oh look at that. They're so cold they've gotta\ncloud coming out of the bag. One of 'em cold clouds. - Okay now. - You gonna use a tong? - Yeah you can't touch. I think, they tong everything over there. - Can't touch these directly. Please note, this isn't Chester Cheetah, it's Chester the Snow Cheetah. - Oh.\n- Yeah. - We don't have snow cheetahs. - No we don't. - That's pretty great. - But we do have. - Now Josh, how do they make these? - [Josh] So they made\nlittle crunchy corn logs and then dusted them in powdered sugar and menthol powder.\n- I'm gonna feed you the tong. a little bit of blue food dye. So it should have a nice refreshing bite. - Refreshing bite? - Okay. I'm gonna, Woo that's crunchy. Woo that's refreshing. Woo that's minty. (laughs) Woo, there's still like a\nCheeto flavor underneath all that like mentholness. - I don't know what part is a Cheeto and what part is my teeth. You know I'm starting\nto get a little worried about what's happening in there. - Give me another one, give me biggin. I like a biggin. - You want one with girth? - I want some girth. Yeah. Now in this dimension\nGuy Fieri's hair is blue and on February 1st, if he wakes up and sees his shadow it's gonna be winter for like eight more millennia. - Oh, that's scary. Really good, yeah I gave\nyou the girthy part first. It's very minty, it kind of gives you. - Oh God, that's a little hard. - It doesn't give you a Cheeto breath in the same way. It's kind of a different thing. It kinda seems like you've been either like smoking some menthols or you know chewing some gum. (laughs) - Well let's just say a cough drop. - Whichever you prefer. - It's like a Cheeto and a cough drop combined, which, I think is pretty brilliant. I love it. What do you think? - I don't like it as much as a Hot Cheeto but it is a nice alternative. - Yeah it is. - You know what I'm saying? - Yes, I'm voting yes. - So we're saying Freezin' Cold Cheetos Delicious Dimension.\n- Delicious Dimension. All right, so we've learned that in some alternate timelines,\nJocks can be sweet, Avocados can not be cereal, Jalape\u00f1o can be a blast, and Cheetos are a dish best served cold. - Thanks for subscribing and clicking that bell. - You know what time it is. - [Darby] Hi, I'm Darby from\nLake Stevens, Washington. I'm filling up my ear biscuits mug on this fine Sunday morning. Watching Good Mythical More. Now it's time to spin\nthe Wheel of Mythicality. - P.O.V. huh? - Got it all. - Click the top link to watch us compete in the chopstick nerds challenge. And Good Mythical Morning. - And to find out whether (mumbles) - What you do is you take your Cheeto's from the bag, and then you just eat a couple. 'Cause they're good. Oh, oh, my bag broke. Why did that happen? - [Lady] I don't know Josh,\nwhy does anything ever happen. - It's a good point.", "5ltYupLDW_w": "welcome to food fights and today you and I are going to trying these two brands of fruit snacks on the Left weighing in at 14 ounces is Welch's mixed fruit fruit snacks and on the right wing and at 17 point 6 ounces is much assorted fruit snacks so this is gonna be a very interesting video for me and you because I have never had any type of fruit snacks so this is a first time for me who knows I may just love these things but right away I noticed that the Welch's it's made with real fruit yeah made with real fruit whereas the mots are fruit flavored so I don't know if there's any real fruit in there or not but we're gonna find out but first let's see which one of these are the best values so for the welts as I paid 395 for this box and that works out to 28 cents an ounce and that gets us 28 fun-sized pouches as opposed to mots 22 regular pouches parent light mots pouches aren't near as fun as the Welch's pouches for the Mocs I also paid three dollars and 95 cents for this box but that works out to 22 cents an ounce so obviously the batter values with the mods not by a large margin but you do get more packages out of the Welch's then you do with the Mocs I would think these would be really convenient to throw in your lunchbox to take to work or in your tackle box to take fishing or on the boat or whatever how fun they are I don't know let's look at the ingredients of these and see actually what we're looking at here so we have fruit puree and that has all the different fruits in there and I'll show you all this if anybody wants to pause and look at this argument back out a little bit so let's take a look at the mots and see what we have in here first ingredient corn syrup so that's not looking real good right off the bat I do see that there's some real juice in there I got pear juicy apple juice sweet potato juice who knew that that was in there well this is actually sounding pretty interesting I don't know the whole sweet potato thing is kind of throwing me off so let's start off looking at the packages and I don't know I think I like the the more wispy text of the Welch's over the the classic box letters of the I think the wellses package this looks better another interesting thing though they're not actually showing the fruit snacks on the box of the Welch's they're just showing pieces of fruit while we know there's not pieces of fruit in here and at least with the Motta's they're showing you are giving a close facsimile I suppose of what there should be in these packages but as I always say what's most important is what's inside so let's open these up and see what in the world we are dealing with here so let's start with the Welch's and see what we have inside here opens up just like a box of cereal I think there's a prize inside yeah there's a prize inside it's these little packages or fruit snacks and there's actually a little smaller than I thought let's see how big this package is now Cheryl wait on here let's see 0.5 ounces or 14 grams for the Walters package I didn't know if there's like one package to be strawberry one package would be blue here the other package would be sweet potato see that they supposedly are our mixed fruit in here so that'll be interesting to see all right let's try the moths and see what we get here and also like a box of cereal this your plain old simple box reclosable box and let's pull this out and yeah also the bag literally is the same size I still like the packaging on the waltz is better that just looks better than the March that just looks very I don't know very dated to me how many ounces is this can you see I don't even I don't even know if it says how many ounces are on here let's check the box and see if it gives a weight 22.6 grams for the pouches so yes you're getting you're getting more where the waltz is is 14 grams you're getting 22 and a half grams as opposed to 14 grams with the Welch's so that's a huge difference right there maybe if your friend has the motch and you have the Welch's this guy's gonna be eating fruit snacks for a bit longer than you are all right let's open these up now and see what's inside so I'm gonna start with the Welch's and open this up let's see how easy this is to open because that's important for these things I would thinking wow these are not easy at all to open unless there's like a little tear thing I like a little perforation I think we're supposed to tear there normally I open things like that you've seen me open potato chips but we got that perforation so let's try the perforation oh yeah oh yeah that's how you're supposed to open these all right let's dump these out and have a look they smell good I'm small well I'm really surprised we got a very unusual mix well not unusual at all we've got more of one just a couple of the others that doesn't seem to be very random I don't know what flavor that's supposed to be that looks like strawberry and this is I don't know what that's supposed to be what do you think that's supposed to be this I'm gonna say is the blueberries or blackberries or mulberry or dingleberry so let's move these over and let's open up the mods and see how hard or easy these are to open I don't see anything special here to open but we do have this area to ditch so let's see you try open it that way yeah that went pretty good not as easy as the Welch's but that went pretty good so let's let's pour these out next to the Welch's and they certainly look different not as not quite as fruity looking except for the grapes the grapes look good I don't know what these and definitely has a different smell just from from smelling these just and I mean I'm probably a good two feet away from these I can smell these things and they smell quite good but they certainly look different which ones look better to you I mean the mots are more shiny and the Anna MAHT seem to be bigger so how many we got we got three six or seven there and we got six seven so you do get seven pieces for each package so I suppose since each package contains seven pieces you're not going to feel like you're getting ripped off I suppose but yes lamotte's fruit snacks are a little bit bigger than the Welch's the vaulters have better shapes to them the monsters look slightly bigger but they smell different when I open them the the Walsh is certainly had a difference smell which one smelled better all I missed one look at this I missed one it is laying beside the package so the mots has got at least this package the mots has got eight pieces in there so the welts fruit snag eater might be feeling left out but these things don't taste good then I'm gonna be feeling left out at all so we got quite a different colour that's nice to see a little bit of color contrast there I'm gonna start with the Welch's and try this strawberry what I think is strawberry and I'm gonna see how this tastes all right let's go off the wall Chisholm supposedly strawberry that's different tastes good I was surprised by the texture it was much much firmer than what I was expecting I guess I was expecting more of like what a gummy worm or a gummy bear or something like that that kind of a texture this had quite a bit stiffer texture than I was expecting but the taste is good is it taste great I don't know it's good there's a nice snack if you want a little sweetness after your your sandwich or something after your lunch that'd be a nice break from your Bologna or peanut butter sandwich all right let's see if I can oh now this looks like a strawberry here so this is what I'm assuming is the MOT strawberry or their facsimile of a strawberry fruit snack so let's see how this tastes better texture to me better texture Wow actually pretty darn good I'm liking that Mott strawberry definitely a lighter texture than what the Welch's is yeah that's pretty good in that that's a nice flavor completely different flavor than the Walsh's seem like the mots is not as sharp as a flavor where the Welch's had really a really brisk strawberry or kind of strawberry flavor and of course them and the mots is also kind of a strawberry flavor boy which one do I like the best I don't know they were both good but I liked the lighter texture of the monster that was interesting alright so let's try a different one here I'm gonna try what I think is the grape compare that to the grape of Amman so on the left is the Welch's grape and on the right is the mots grape and really the match looks better I just like the shininess of it like I say this is my first time well I guess actually now this is my second time eating fruit actually it's my third time eating fruit snacks because I already had two so this was count as my third and fourth time eating a fruit snacks which one should I go first we're gonna go off the Welch's on the Left what I think is grape could be mulberry don't know so let's try the Welch's and see how this is first first impression rubbery rubber eraser I hate to say that as soon as you get through the the really heavy texture get a really sharp a really sharp fruit flavor I mean it's almost to the point of being sour just a little bit of sourness and a lot of people especially kids like the sourness and look at this I'm making a little a fruit snack man see that well in that cute or a star we can make a star alright sounds like I'm back in elementary school again isn't that cute but yeah my first impression as soon as I take a bite out of one of these it's rubber that's weird doesn't taste like Robert just the texture of like a rubber eraser I don't really particularly care for the texture of these Welch's but the flavor is just very powerful not in a bad way very very powerful maybe too powerful for some but I know kids like a a sweet sour thing so that might be really good for kids all right so let's try the mots pseudo grape and see how this is hmm I like that texture much better certainly a milder flavor not as a sharp not as tangy or not really that sour flavor just a smooth light grape flavor that's a good flavor hmm wow this is really interesting but I have made my decision folks Wow what can I say this was really interesting and I gotta admit this has been one of the most fun videos I've done so far because these are both products that I have never ever tried and probably never would have tried unless I was doing these videos and this was a lot of fun and this was educational both of these obviously as you can tell by my Murray accents both of these were really really good well we do have a winner here and you might be surprised you may not be surprised if you've tried both of these which one of these do you like the best I'm really curious to know what you guys think about these but I like the sharp taste of the Welch's quite a bit it was nice it was a nice shock after you get over that unfortunately what I would call a rubbery texture I had the first bite of these waltzes fruit snacks so the the sharp almost sour sweet taste of the Welch's overpowered it makes you quickly forget about the the rubbery texture that you had to go through to get to that really sharp flavor so that was interesting the mots had a smoother texture and also a smoother flavor so the texture I think matched the flavor quite quite well these both these products are good and completely different the one is not trying to copy off the other so this again is with a lot of food products it's gonna come right down to personal preference do you like a firmer texture do you like a sharper a sour sweet flavor or do you like a smoother texture and a smoother flavor well in this instance for me the winner is the moths I really enjoyed the moths I liked the smoother texture and I liked the smoother flavor but I'm not a kid anymore and maybe if I was in elementary school I might be just raving over these but then again we got to remember the mots are a better value in that you get more for the money but you only get 22 pouches so it's a give-and-take with both these but when it comes to flavor and texture I choose the mots over the Welch's so thank you for watching food fights and keep watching because there's more videos just like this coming up real soon so I'll see you in the next video", "uBj-NriY_pQ": "a really nice exciting quick cheesecake served with a strawberry and blueberry compote biscuits blitz hot pan sugar we're gonna form a really nice light golden caramel butter

so we hope you enjoyed the first video in our series where we share 5 great tips that are just small changes but that'll make a big difference throughout the year now today we're going to be making one of my favorite ways to start the day a berry smoothie and we're gonna get started right away so moving over to our blender we're gonna be adding in about half a cup of ice we're gonna add in half a cup of Greek yogurt make sure we get all that protein to start off our day right we've got half a cup of blueberries and blueberries are actually considered one of the best forms of antioxidants that you can have now in case you don't know antioxidants are actually this fantastic kind of element in the body which goes around finding all these free radicals they help to reduce inflammation they help to protect you against infection and they also help to keep you healthy for your busy 2013 start to the year next up we've got raspberries one of my favorite berries and finally we've got a quarter cup of blackberries we're using a little bit less just because I find they've got a pretty strong flavor so it's nice to use a little bit of us next up we've got flax seeds now flax seed this is ground flax seed is high in our omegas and it's recommended that you have about a tablespoon a day so by sapping it into your smoothie it's a great way to make sure that you're getting all those healthy fats and next up to sweeten it we've got just a little bit of honey love honey it's so good ok we're just gonna pop the top on here and we're gonna blend it until it's all liquefied and blended together to our perfect morning smoothie now once our smoothie has started to come together we all experience it too sometimes the blender doesn't want to keep blending it up so what I like to do because we've already added honey as one of the ways that we're getting sweetness in this we'll add a little bit of water just to help it all blend together just about a quarter of a cup and then we're gonna continue blending it until it's nice and smooth all right it's time to try our smoothie now remember guys if you're liking the video please feel free to give me a thumbs up leave a comment about a dish you'd like to see or maybe even subscribe to the channel we'd really appreciate it all right I am so excited I love smoothies and especially when they're made with berries because they're

of berry but it's sweet it's not too tart and I know it's packed with so much goodness and remember getting a smoothie out on the go can be risky some of them pack as many as a thousand calories and

This is a recipe you can use with any fruit, \npeaches, berries, nectarines, plums, anything you want to make a cobbler out of,\nthis is your recipe for it. Today I'm using a combination of \nstrawberries and blackberries. Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees,\nand lightly grease a 9x13 pan. Start with 3 pounds of whatever fruit you're working with in a mixing bowl and pour in the juice and zest of one lemon. Add in 1/3 cup of sugar, 2 teaspoons of cornstarch, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, toss this together. All right and then just pour this directly into your prepared pan. Spread it out into an even layer. All right we'll set this aside and start working \non our cobbler topping. Now you can be truly old-fashioned and use \na pastry cutter to make this part, but today I'm using my food processor. I have 2 cups of flour in here and I'm going to add in \n3/4 of a cup of powdered sugar, a tablespoon of baking powder, and a teaspoon of salt. Put the lid on and give this a quick pulse. Then I'm going to add in my butter, and this is the part that you'd use a pastry cutter \nto cut it all in, but the food processor makes this \nsuper fast and simple. I cut all my butter pieces into little chunks \nso that it's easier for the food processor to get it all. We put our lid on. Little pulses until it looks like sand almost. All right now I'm going to take the little \ncenter portion out. I'm going to slowly pour in 1 cup of half-and-half \nwhile I pulse it. Alright you should end up with a nice wet dough. Spoon this in clumps right over your fruit. Doesn't have to be pretty,\nclumps are just fine, you just want to make sure you cover the whole \ntop of the cobbler. I thought I didn't like cobbler, but that's just because people are making it with cake mixes instead of this old-fashioned sweet biscuit dough. It's totally delicious. Now pop it in the oven for one hour. Serve it up warm. You can top it off with a little scoop of ice cream\n or whipped cream or just eat it plain. Thanks for watching.

See you later.", "yeES8Vuec8A": "if you've walked by those pastry shops and you've seen those beautiful little berry tarts and you think you can't make it at home I'm here to show you that you can [Music] start with some frozen puff pastry that you bought from the store we're gonna roll this out to about the size of our sheet here try and keep it in that rectangular shape it doesn't take too long before it's almost the right size now we're gonna do something called scoring I'm gonna take a knife I'm going to be very careful not to cut all the way through and I'm gonna cut sort of a stencil on the inside I'm just creating a frame of about one inch on all sides now what this is going to do is when that puff pastry goes into the oven and Rises the frame or the outside crust will rise higher the inside will stay lower and then we'll push it down when we go to take it out of the oven but this is going to make a beautiful frame for some berries we're gonna brush this with a little bit of egg white all over the egg whites gonna give it a nice shine in the oven and now we're going to do something called docking we're going to talk of just the interior of this puff pastry this will allow some of the steam from the puff pastry out so that it doesn't bubble now transfer this to a baking sheet and we're gonna send this to the oven we're gonna bake it at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes now while your pastry is baking we're gonna make something called pastry cream really delicious really versatile and a great thing to know we start off with a vanilla bean this is half a vanilla bean and inside are a bunch of seeds that gives all that great flavor so we're going to slice this in half not going all the way through but just sort of score it and then we're gonna open it up and we're gonna show all those beautiful seeds and scrape them out they almost look like coffee grounds just like that and put that into our milk so once all your vanilla seeds are in there you'll see all the little speckles it looks like black pepper that's in the milk we're gonna bring this to almost a boil on the stovetop now to get all those seeds out because they're so delicious we're gonna put the whole pod in there as well and then we'll remove it at the end now while that's coming to a simmer we're going to beat some egg yolks so beat these up and then we're gonna add some sugar we're gonna bring this to ribbon stage that's when the egg yolks and the sugar fall from the whisk like a ribbon so milk coming to a simmer eggs at ribbon stage I'm going to now just add some flour here just stirring it in this is gonna help stabilize the pastry cream and keep it from being too loose then you add all your berries on top when you no longer see any streaks of white that's good enough we're gonna bring our milk which is almost at a simmer now we're gonna temper it into our eggs which means we're going to add a little bit of hot liquid to the cold mixture here and then we're gonna add everything back into the hot pan the reason we do that is because if we just added all that hot ingredient all at once we probably scramble our eggs and we don't want that we want smooth beautiful pastry cream once this is almost at a simmer turn that heat right off we don't want to boil and here's where the tempering comes in we're gonna take some of our beautiful vine illa milk we're gonna whisk it into our egg mixture this will make the egg mixture thinner so that we'll be able to pour it easily back into the pan one more little hole should do it [Music] now we're going to transfer all of this mixture back to the saucepan as you do this you're going to whisk constantly and remember that kid needs to be off get every little last bit out of that bowl remember those are vanilla seeds or where it's all at now we're going to turn that heat back on and bring this to a boil so once this has come to a boil we're gonna let it boil for just a minute meanwhile let's check out our pastry oh it looks beautiful take this out we're gonna let it cool for just a minute then we're gonna rescore we're gonna push that down so we'll have a framework for our beautiful pastry cream in various once that's boiled for a minute it'll be nice and thick turn that heat off and we're gonna whisk in some butter I've got about four tablespoons of butter here and just whisk that in to let it know here's the thing we worried about getting lumps in our pastry cream but it doesn't matter because at this stage what we're gonna do is strain it if for any reason you've got a lump in the pastry cream it's gonna be removed as we remove that vanilla pod let's give this a strain [Music] just pour it through a strainer and then we'll do a little whisking in that strainer to remove any possible hosts there it is pastry cream you made it all you have to do now is let it cool so that could take a couple hours if you want to cool it really quickly pour it into a 9 by 13 cookie sheet or cake pan and that will cool it super boss beautiful back to our pastry let's do another little scoring now it's just had a couple minutes to cool we're just cutting through a few of those upper layers of pastry at this point to make sure that the inside is separate from the frame and then use a flat spatula just to push that center part down inside the border now we've got a perfectly par baked crust for our beautiful berry tart and gorgeous browning on the bottom a piece of plastic wrap right down on the surface of the pastry cream will help prevent a skin from forming on that so our pastry cream is cooled our pastry crust has cooled the last thing to deal with is what we're gonna put inside and you can use any kind of fruit you want today I'm gonna use some berries so I've got some blueberries some raspberries some blackberries and some strawberries we're gonna mix these all together with just a little bit of sugar now if they're really really sweetened already you may not need to do this but add sugar to your taste then we're gonna toss these around [Music] and let these sit while we add the pastry cream to the pastry pour this on into the center and get every last drop and then spread this out making it smooth the top as possible but it doesn't have to be like a skating rink you can have a few waves all the way into the corners and smooth out the top now add your berries rustic style you can put them in a pattern if you'd like to but there's no need just toss them on randomly making sure they all get into the corners as well that corner piece could be yours but there is one last step that we're going to do here and that is putting a little bit of apricot glaze on the berries to give them the shine for that perfect finale so just dab a little bit of that apricot preserves that you've melted in a pan melt them down so that they're nice and smooth and then dollop it on this will give it a lasting shine so that your pastry tart will look just like those in the pastry shops aid wallah look at that you did it all yourself [Music]", "n1ifOFfVeJY": "hi I'm Diane cometa and today ondition would die I'm going to show you how to make a healthy oatmeal breakfast smoothie this is really delicious very nutritious easy to make and there's no cooking involved so let's get started on Tisha with die so just throw a few ice cubes into your blender because we want this to be cold and now I have some blueberries here that I've rinsed and patted dry and also some strawberries so I have some really good sized ones and are nice and ripe so I'm just going to toss these in and they are going to make this real nice and like really nice and fruity tasting so you can substitute other fruits if you want but I really like the combination of the berries in there then we're also going to use some banana banana is loaded with potassium which is really good brain food which is something you really really could use early in the morning so we're going to put a good portion of that in there not the whole thing though and the nice thing about this is that you can make something like this the night before and then put it in your fridge in a little container to-go container and then that way you could take it to school or work and you have everything ready for you right there and you can just drink as you go perfect so now we have the oats now these are regular old-fashioned rolled oats you can use the quick cooking oats if you want to but I like these I use these for a lot of other recipes so you're just going to put some of those in there as well and that is where you're going to get a lot of fiber and extra nutrition and believe it or not they're going to chop up and they're going to be really fine and it's not going to be gritty or anything at all it's going to be fabulous this is vanilla flavored almond milk so you could use regular milk if you want to but I drink almond milk a lot and I really like the vanilla flavored so I'm going to add some of that and so that not only is going to make it you know a nice flavor because of the vanilla and the almond but we're getting you know the moisture that we need in there for the smoothie itself and then to make sure it's sweet enough I'm going to add some honey and that is pretty much it and we're just going to mix this up so start with it on low and gradually work it up to that high speed until everything is nice and smooth and you see little just little tiny bits of the oats in there and I'll show you what that looks like there it is look at that what was that a minute and this is delicious I think I'll put a straw in it mmm it's nice and smooth like not just the texture of it but the taste it's not too like sweet or the the oats actually remind me of eating an oatmeal cookie and that's one of the reasons I really love this so you have to try it something totally different and a great way to start your day or if you just want a little snack the recipe is on my website dish with DICOM along with lots of other stuff and I hope I made your life a little easier more enjoyable and delicious I'll see you next time buh bye you", "avjqEoa_zhA": "hi

my name is mary molds and i'm the culinary events manager at miele usa in beautiful princeton new jersey today i'm going to be teaching you how to make a beautiful triple berry jam using two ingredients our berries and our sugar we're going to be using our induction cooktop and our combi steam oven but we're always going to show you other ways to do it so see you back here in the kitchen in a few minutes so we can get cooking the first step in getting ready to prepare our recipe today is to wash all of our berries and cut off any unnecessary stems or blemishes so i've already done that and i've placed all my berries in a large bowl and i'm going to start with a simple potato masher i've got two sizes because i've got little hands so i'm going to use the little one and i'm just going to hand mash all the berries right in the bowl i like a rough consistency when i eat jelly and jam i like to feel a little bit of the thickness of the berries so i'm going to mash these down to a consistency where they're mashed but i'm going to leave a little bit of texture in there and i'm just going to keep doing this it's going to take me a couple minutes [Music] i finished mashing my berries to a consistency that i'm very happy with for today i've chosen to use strawberries blackberries raspberries and beautiful jumbo blueberries but obviously there's certain times of the year that berries are more in season so you can make this recipe with the berries of your choice all you need is six pints so it doesn't matter but today we're using four beautiful berries so i'm going to pour my berries into the pot and i'm going to turn my cooktop on again today i'm going to use induction i love induction because it's easy and i'm going to be able to clean up super simple at the end of this recipe but i'm not going to have a lot of mess because everything's going to be prepared right in my big dutch oven i'm going to add my equal parts of sugar and now i'm just going to wait for it to boil when we get to a boil we're going to come back and i'm going to show you what it looks like as the sugar and the fruit starts to reduce down our jam is coming to a beautiful boil so what i'm going to start doing now is actually skimming the top because i'm starting to get some foam it looks like a crema almost if you were drinking a meal a cappuccino but it's a foam that i'm going to skim off the top it helps to keep some of the seeds out of the jam and also keeps it a lot clearer so i'm just going to keep watching that boil and for about 15 or 20 minutes i'm gonna just skim the top every couple minutes and get some of that foam off the top i'm gonna discard it in a bowl and once i see that the foam has stopped that's when i know that i'm ready to start getting the jam into our jars and getting it prepared for the combi steam oven i've spent about 20 minutes by our cooktop and i've skimmed the top of our dutch oven and you can see i removed a nice amount of foam from the berries so now i'm left with all of the sugar all of the berries combined beautifully i have my prepared jars ready to go so what's a prepared canning jar it means it's been sterilized i've taken all my jars my lids and my rings i've placed them in the miele dishwasher i've sterilized them and now they're kept slightly warm until i'm ready to start putting the berries into the jar so they're warm i've added my funnel and i'm just going to take a little scoop at a time and i'm going to pour it right into the jar and i'm going to go right up to the first line on the jar the reason i do that i want to leave about a quarter to a half of an inch of headroom that's going to allow the jar to properly seal that's going to be the most important part of getting a prepared canning jar the jar has to seal properly so i'm going to fill my jars and then we're going to put the rings and the lids on and get them ready to go in the oven the jars are all filled and lucky for me i had some extra berries and i had a few extra larger jars that i sanitized just in case i've made this recipe a few times it's one of my favorite holiday things to do for my own friends and family so the only thing i wanted to do now is just to show you all how we're going to wipe the inside of the jar just to prepare it a little bit better for the oven i'm going to place the lid on and i want to tighten the ring i don't want to make it too tight i just want to put it on so that it is secure and now i'm going to put everything on my large perforated steam pan this is the pan that comes standard with each of your ovens and i'm gonna place this on level one in the oven and then we're gonna get started canning now it's time to get steaming as promised i've placed the jars on level one inside the combi steam oven i'm going to close the door and it couldn't be any more simple than this i'm going to turn my oven on select operating modes go right to steam cooking and i'm going to process these jars for 20 minutes i'm using the keypad here i'm going to hit ok and again every time i see green i'm going to hit ok one more time this is going to get the water up to temperature 212 degrees it's going to count down 20 minutes but i'm not going to open the door when the oven stops we're gonna meet back here because then we're gonna program our timer for 20 more minutes and we're going to let the jars continue to process inside the warm oven we're not cooking them at that point we're letting them finish processing so i'll see you back here in about 20 minutes so our jars have had an additional 20 minutes to process inside the combi steam oven so let's pull them out and see how they look i wonder if any of you hear that those nice little pinging sounds that is my favorite sound of canning you can tell how excited i get when you hear that it means that the jar has sealed and that's why we left that little bit of space for that air to get out of there so right now you could see some of these are actually pressed down it means that they've sealed properly and i know that we're anxious to touch them but we're going to let them sit here on the counter overnight it will sometimes take an additional 12 hours for the other jars to seal because it's going to use the ambient temperature in the room they just came out of a hot oven so we're just going to let them sit and then we're going to decorate them and they're going to be perfect for christmas did you hear that i really do get excited about this anybody knows me knows that i've made hundreds of jars of jelly here at the miele kitchen we've had centers that have opened and i've made hundreds of jars and sent them off for grand openings so this is my favorite holiday gift to give to family and i can't wait to share that with all of them there you go another jar has sealed so thank you so much for joining us for our holiday canning we will make these look pretty and we're going gonna share this beautiful recipe with all of you so i hope that you bring this into your kitchen this year and you're able to make something really nice for the perfect holiday gift happy holidays from the miele kitchen [Music] you",

channel for more lovely videos and recipes take care bye dear God our lovely mixed berries along with some seedless grapes oh it's a small bowel full of mixed berries looks so lovely isn't it look at them so you can either add some sugar and crush them or you can do what I'm doing and actually turn it into a mixed berry reduction by heating it along with a little bit of sugar and also here every one I've got 600 grams of custard it's a vanilla flavour custard look at this combination yum yum alright so I'm gonna make the berry reduction is heating a pan and placed off a lovely berries into that so I mixed berries along with some seedless grapes I'm also going to add in 1/2 2 tablespoons of sugar depends on how sweet you want it to be so that'll help it nicely caramelize maybe it's starting to bubble away I'm also going to add in half a cup of water that will help it you know nicely cook up and caramelize faster and it will also help these berries to become nice and soft and mushy so using the back of the spoon I'm just crushing the berries up see just crush it up slightly but all the juices come out so you can leave some intact and you can crush the rest or you can cross the whole thing it depends upon your personal preference put sort of a texture you like the mixed berry reduction to have but if you press it you know the flavors will come out of these berries and infuse into the syrup nicely but seriously smells so good you want to put this off into the blender and then put it off into the pan and heat it you'll get a most smooth very reduction but I wanted to have some texture doing it like this so as I mentioned again it's up to your personal preference you know how you wanted to turn out their different options and you can use fresh berries for this I'm just using the Cole's brand frozen mixed berries it smells so good in this kitchen right now and see that it's turning into this nice deep rich red color see my deep intense color it's slowly reducing the future become nice and so I'm going to wait for it to become a little bit more thicker by waiting for this liquid content to wrap in a bit more but it's nicely taking shape so the berries that I've gone into this are strawberries blackberries and grapes and blueberries they have every one so once it becomes nice and glazed II like this I'm going to take it off the heat we don't want it to get burned or anything like that this is a nice rich lovely mixed berry syrup look at it so I've turned off the heat and we can set it aside to cool down to room temperature it's looking nice and lovely so divine you can see it's forming like this thread sort of a consistency it tastes so lovely so rich and so amazing they will go well with the custard and once a mixed berry reduction has cooled down to room temperature we can take two glasses and start serving it up you got to serve them in different layers so first I'm going to add in a custard layer help with a little funnel you can pour it in neatly you can see so it'll be nice and neat when you form the layers yes you're going to do the same with the other glass as well and there is a once that's done we can add in the mixed berry reduction layer using a spoon for that and gently place it on top yes next we can put one more layer of the rather than about 2 teaspoons of the mixed berry layer I should say the mixed berry reduction so so far so good add in one more berry layer and I'm going to add it one more custard layer and one layer of berry reduction on top to top it off looking nice and lovely now if you want it to look more elaborate using a nice long clean skewer you can just put it in there and twirl it around until you get the desired effect that you're looking for so you can see using a skewer if you just turn it around you get these more elaborate designs on the side look at it everyone so lovely so I just went ahead and made simple designs so you can see it's so lovely it looks so floral looks like butterflies in this so it looks like it's a design of the glass and then you put some custard tumeric milk or something in there looking yellow but this is it everyone so nice lovely dessert so if you're having a romantic dinner you can end it with a sweet note and along with the infusion of berries you know what more can you ask for it's in it so it's nice and lovely and apart from that

berries and some yogurt now into a small blender I'll add some fresh ripe raspberries so one Punnett along with a generous handful of strawberries and we'll just take the tops off the strawberries and pop them straight into the blender you want about half of this Punnett and now pop the lid on and we're just going to blend this until it's a chunky puree fabulous look at that color now if you like you can add blueberries to this all black rose i'm gonna be using blackberries but I don't like to blend it together because it goes a purple color I really want the distinction between the pink color and the purple color so what I'm going to do is chop these beautiful blackberries have a look at that that is just divine and I'm going to cut them into chunks and that way when you present it it really does look like mixed berries and the lucky last one fabulous I'll place these into a large jug this is just going to make it easier to pour into the molds along with our pureed red berries and then to bind everything together I'll add a spoonful of Greek yogurt and for some extra sweetness some honey this is a really healthy snack now we'll just fold everything together wonderful now we can place them into our popsicle molds so these you can get from all good home wear stores I've also seen them at the supermarket sometimes and then putting it in a jug like this makes it so much easier now carefully pour this into a mold then they go into the freezer for a couple of hours or even better overnight [Music] now these have been in the freezer for a while you can see that they're set and the best way to take these out is just to have some hot water on standby just quickly place it in the water and then in theory this should come away quite easily and detach that are just like that really simple popsicles to make at home the best thing about this is you know what you've put in your popsicles here we've got lots of fresh berries I love the contrast with the pureed berries and the chunks of blackberries just fantastic you can present it on a pile of ice like this or if you're very impatient like me just dig in straight away mmm oh good [Music]", "6arq0zh0cHM": "[Music] good morning welcome to inside Kate's kitchen today we're going to be making strawberry jam I would gifted with two large bags of frozen strawberries and I decided to make jam out of it what you see here is the beginnings of the first batch a recipe which is right here it says six cups of crushed strawberry and four cups of sugar I've got those strawberries in there I've got the sugar over here and it also says I need to take 1 1/2 of that sugar put it in another bowl and mix it with our pectin which I'm going to do as well now I have prepared my jars they're all here getting ready getting hot in the canner and here's all my lips and ring they've all been washed and they're ready to go with WEP and we'll set this up and I'll bring you along as we make strawberry jam the first thing we're going to do we're going to put our pectin into the half cup of sugar that we set aside I'm gonna stir that up real well ensure it's very well incorporated into it then we're going to stir it into the strawberry and I'm gonna turn the heat on on this tri berry so let's start getting ready I'm gonna put it on about 6 because I don't want to burn anything there we go now we're just going to heat it up and bring it over where you can look down inside maybe mmm not too sure how well I can do this guy's I'm not good at running the running the camera and doing the cooking on spoiled date has nice birth he's almost always been here with me when I'm cooking running the camera for me so what can I say I'm a spoiled brat but it makes better videos when somebody else runs the camera at least I think it does now our recipe said that we're supposed to put it all together in here and we'll bring it to a full rolling boil now one thing it did suggest that I sometimes do and sometimes don't is to add let's see a half a teaspoon of butter when the purpose of the butter is that when this sugary fruit stuff starts to boil it makes a lot of bubbles and it makes a foam on the top and a little bit of butter helps keep that from happening so let's put a little better in this that should do it I have a feeling you guys are going to hear the birds today in the background you're feeling very talkative and it gets real noisy when they get that way I'm gonna stand healing work with it I've turned the heat up to almost high it's kind of medium-high and I'm going to keep stirring it until such time as it comes to a full rolling boil when that happens I'll bring you back for the next step I've been stirring for a while and as you can see we've actually come to a good boil the next step in the recipe is to add the other three and a half cups of sugar I'm just gonna dump it in we have to stir it around and once it gets all stirred in we have to bring it back to another full rolling boil and then cook it for 1 minute and then we'll be putting it in the jars as you can see it's stirring in pretty easily it's becoming very liquid I'll bring you back in a little while when I'm starting to put it in the jars we're now at a full rolling boil that cannot be stirred down it keeps boiling no matter what I'm gonna have to cook it for one full minute and after that then we'll start putting it in our jars hopefully we'll get at least six maybe eight tap fight jars and they're waiting in the hot water inside the canner they were washed real well and cleaned I did not sterilize them I did wash them in good hot water and they've been sitting in the canner on simmer for well over half an hour so they've got to be clean okay one minute is up turn that off cool down just a little bit and we'll keep stirring with one hand while I start getting the jars out with the other not going to work so well this is just a two-handed job no matter what element is cooling down I have to stir just a little bit here in there I'm gonna get out four jars to start I've got to tell you I really love my little silicone mint here this silicon mitt is wonderful for handling these hot hot jars when they are hot - all right now let me see if I can move out just a little bit and move you over where you can see me loading up the jars there we go hopefully you can see that I need to get one more piece of equipment panning funnels are wonderful pieces of equipment I don't know what I would do without mine now the recipe says to fill it to within 1/4 inch of head space as I'm used to leaving about an inch of head space but we'll make it a little less head space and match the recipe there when you're doing this be extremely careful because this strawberry concoction is very hot and with all the sugar that's in it even though I'm using the low sugar pectin and not nearly as much sugar as if I were doing it the other way there's still enough in there that if it splashes on you it can really hurt so I recommend that you be very careful and take all of the safety precautions now as you can see I have all four of my jars done next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take a damp piece of paper towel I dipped it in white vinegar and I'm going to wipe down the rim and the threads on each jar and you see you can see not sure if the camera will pick it up but there is red on there that I was wiped off of the rims you don't want that on there when you're getting ready to seal because it'll interfere with the seal and then your jelly won't go bad on you so very carefully be sure you wipe everything down the next thing we're gonna do we're gonna put our lids on there's a chip I live you just do it to what's called fingertip tight now no you don't want it so loose that the water inside the canna will get into your jar but you also don't want it so tight that it will cause - and as your jars heat up so finger types are kind of a subjective tightness what I do put it on I put it on until it turns the jar and then I do a tour to return more and these four are done I don't know how well you can see this let's see if I can get it up a little bit that's our jars of jelly I'm gonna put them over here and there's enough water in there put the full jars in the water level is gonna go up and it will cover the hold the jars required two inches that requirement under question some people say two inches some people say at least an inch the way I feel about it if it's two inches you know it's at least an inch and it certainly doesn't hurt to err on the side of caution and be sure that you get enough water that it raises the internal temperature of within your jars causes a good feel and mix it all the work you're doing preserving all of this goodness worth your time I'm going to turn it back down a little bit and we're gonna go on filling the jars and I'll bring you back later our ten minutes of processing time or up and as you can see I've taken some of the jars already and I'm continuing to do so even though I have loud birds in the background now one thing I did not tell you is when you put your jars in to cook to to process you need to put a splash of vinegar in there nothing more frustrating than doing a big batch of something putting it in a processing it taking it out coming back when it's cool and discover and you can't see anything in the jars because you've got the flights come from hard water all over it so I did that I put my little splash in there and I think they're gonna turn out fine this is what I got from 6 cups of strawberries all mashed up my hope that you've learned something I hope you enjoyed it and I will bring you back out the next time I do something and you take care bye bye [Music]", "B2NbzS1MVrc": "today's episode is brought to you by San Remo couscous recipes your family will love today welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm gonna show you how I make a berry parfait this is such a yummy treat a really good dessert to make so simple let's go get a large mixing bowl and putting one and a half cups of low-fat vanilla yogurt add one teaspoon of orange rind now you want about half a cup of icing sugar mixture or icing sugar pure icing sugar confectionery sugar now you want to use half of this so use only a quarter of a cup for this part and we save the rest for later then add half a cup of cream thickened cream that you've whipped so any cream that you buy pour in half a cup and then whip it whip it good now just combine this mixing in together now what you want is about 250 grams or 1 Punnett of strawberries and you cut them up about 1/2 a cup of raspberries and about 125 grams or 1/2 a cup of blueberries now you want to use most of it but just just leave a little bit for later so just a wheel like that now we want to squash this mix it up with a fork probably in a bigger bowl than what I've chosen so I'm going to transfer this to a bigger bowl so for these either mess it with a fork or the potato masher or something or both both it's pretty fun oh yes now get the remaining icing sugar which would be about quarter of a cup and just mix that through get a glass or something you going to serve in and basically we just want to layer it so I put a layer of the berries then the next layer you know just garnish with a few of the berries YUM now you can make as many layers as you want if you don't want to have just a basin and a top you can always just sprinkle that straight over the top like that YUM well yeah this is so good it's like heaven in a cup

with a lighter color this berry starts off yellow and turns a light red when it becomes ripe they taste like a mix of a mild raspberry and a blackberry these berries require a constant water source to grow with adequate heat for this reason they'll usually be found on the side of rivers and creeks they are a rich source of vitamin C and K and are high in manganese the salmon berries not ideal for eating but better for making it to jams juice and wine most berry bushes have multiple uses with the salmon berry the bark and leaves of the bush can be used to treat burns the name comes from an old native tradition of putting one of the berries in every Salmons mouth that was caught for good luck number nine crowberry The Crow berry or otherwise known as black crow berry or Moss berry is a round

manganese and copper number eight pine berry this white looking strawberry has a reputation for tasting and/or smelling like pineapple plus strawberries this is debatable but there is a tropical element to the berry which would give that impression the flavor is more of a tart tropical tasting berry with a muted flavor they are native to Chile and are available in early summer if you can find them the primary can be eaten fresh or served with desserts like ice cream cake and even mixed in drinks they are a partially self pollinating plant that are high in antioxidants vitamin A and boost the immune system unless you live in Chile they're very hard to find so if you do find them they're gonna be very expensive number 7 Hawthorn these bright red berries are grown on a thorny Bush that has insanely sharp needles the red berries get darker as the season goes on to indicate its ripeness the young leaves of the bush can be eaten and the old leaves can be used to make a tea the berry itself tastes a mixture of sweet and tart just make sure to spit out the large cherry like seed as they contain cyanide the Hawthorne berry has powerful healing effects to the heart including reducing blood pressure and increased circulation Hawthorne is dropped into the superfood category so typically if you see them being used it's in some magic potion to help you lose weight or feel better don't be fooled by these products but the Hawthorne berry is very good for the heart number six gin berry or orange berry these semi transparent pinkish berries grow in large clusters the berry is edible but the very large seed isn't they grow in warm climates and can't endure frost many aspects are very similar to the blueberries such as they grow in a bush or short tree the berry size that can be grown in a planter and they don't grow indoors very well the gin berry is typically eaten raw or juiced number five bear bury the bear bear is a small round red berry that grows on a small ground

avoid eating them all together number four fairy bell berries these are looking berries are bright red and grow in the shape of bells hence the name fairy bells not only do they look unusual they grow

British Columbia Canada number three fall Solomon seal this edible berry has a mottled color which transitions from green to dark red as it ripens he grows in large clusters like grapes and has the

North America the root is edible and cooked like a sweet potato the young shoots are boiled and tastes like asparagus the fall Solomon seal is high in vitamin see so if anything you can ward off scurvy with these little berries number two Solomon seal a completely different plant that just looks similar to its false counterpart yields berries that are dark purple both plants developed white flowers but instead of a large plume of tiny flowers the Solomon seal has flowers that hang in a row from the stalk these flowers will develop into green berries that will eventually turn purple when ripe the ripe berries taste just like molasses just as the false ones do but have a delicate sweetness to them with that said the berries are actually poisonous and may cause vomiting and nausea this is the major difference between the Solomon plants the root and young shoots are perfectly edible on the Solomon seal as well number one kusa dogwood buries the kusa dogwood is a tree that gives life to the kusa dogwood berry a round oddly shaped berry that has appearance of a soccer ball the inside is soft and creamy with the taste of papaya but the skin has a slight bitter taste to it for this

and the texture so I'm very excited to\nshare it with you now a few tips to keep in mind when you're making fruit salad\nis 1 you want to work with fruit that's in season and nice and ripe you want it\nat its peak without being too ripe that it starts to get mushy and it loses its\nintegrity and number two it you want to try to cut your fruit into nice small\nbite-size pieces that are fairly uniform this is just gonna make it easier for\nthe eater to enjoy their fruits out and while fruit salad is pretty\nstraightforward as far as the recipe goes or they want to focus on in this\nvideo is some of the techniques I use for cutting the fruit so to get started\nI have a nice big bowl and I'm starting with 4 cups of chopped up cantaloupe now\nthe easiest way to cut a cantaloupe is to trim off the top and the bottom then\nlay it flat side down and slice down in half lengthwise scoop out the seeds and\nyou'll see if the cantaloupe is ripe they will scoop out really easily and\nthen cut they'll cantaloupe into wedges I like to cut each half into half and\nthen take each quarter and cut it into half again until I have eight wedges\nthen I just use a paring knife to slice off the skin and then chop into\nbite-size pieces next I'm adding in two cups of chopped up mango which is about\ntwo mangos so to start I'm just gonna trim off the bottom of the mango and I'm\ngonna use a potato peeler to peel off the skin which comes off really easily\nthen I'm gonna stand it up flat side down and you can't see it but in the\ncenter of the mango there's a very big long pit it runs right through the\nmiddle so you want to guesstimate get your knife as close to the center a\nlittle bit off center as you can slice straight down rotate and get the other\nside of the mango I like to call these the mango cheeks then I come back and\njust trim off any extra mango on each side of the pit if you notice there's\nany additional mango meat around the pit just slice it off and let that be a chef\nsnack once I have all the mango meat off the mango then I'm just gonna cut it\ninto slices take it around and chop it up next we\nhave two cups of red grapes and for these I just like to slice them right in\nhalf the red grapes add a great pop and a great texture to the fruit salad next\nup we have two cups of chopped up strawberries so to prep the strawberries\nI just slice off the green top then lay that flat down slice it in half then\ninto quarters and across again next I have two cups of fresh pineapple now a\nfun tip if you want to ensure that your pineapple is nice and ripe just tug at\nthe leaves and the leaves on top should come out very easily that's how you know\nyour pineapple is nice and ripe also it will smell super sweet so those are the\ntwo giveaways now my absolute favorite way to cut a pineapple is to trim off\nthe top and the bottom stand it up slice it in half lengthwise\nand then you're gonna see that there's a core that runs right down the center and\nthis court can be a little tough and a little bit fibrous so what I do is I\ntake a knife and I come down in and add an angle on each side of that core and\nit's gonna pop right out sometimes if the core is not super tough I'll save it\nas a snack for myself and as the kids but I don't like to put it in the fruit\nsalad then once we have the core out I'm just gonna take this half slice it into\nquarters and then run my knife right through the center of one quarter rotate\nchop into bite-sized pieces and then right here where the skin meets the\nflesh or the meat of the pineapple you want to get your knife as close as you\ncan and just slice in and around and you're gonna see that these pineapple\nwedges will fall right out and there's very little waste this is hands-down the\neasiest way I've discovered to date on how to cut a pineapple next up I have\ntwo cups of chopped up Kiwis and my favorite way to prep the Kiwi is to trim\noff the top and the bottom and then again just use a potato peeler to peel\noff this fuzzy skin then I just slice the Kiwi in half lengthwise\nlay it down coming to quarters rotate and chop it up super super easy and it\nadds such great flavor to the fruit salad and then the last fruit that I\nlike to add to this fruit salad is one cup of big fat plump blueberries now you\ncould of course take this as an opportunity to mix up your fruit salads\nand enjoy but if you really want to elevate the flavors of what I like to do\nis eyes esthe one lime with a zester get that into a bowl then add the juice from\nthat line as well it's gonna be somewhere between two and three\ntablespoons of lime juice and then add a tablespoon of honey whisk that all\ntogether and the bright flavors from the lime and that sweetness from the

Oh.", "kDZDYgaonjo": "hello this is chef john from food wishes\ndot-com with the ultimate berry crumble that's right unlike some of my peers I\ndon't just tack on the word ultimate to a recipe name just to try to get extra\nviews no when you see the word ultimate here you know that it's been carefully\nresearched and then submitted for official designation which I'm very\nhappy to announce was granted and if you're wondering what exactly makes this\nthe ultimate berry crumble besides the name well it's so many things which I'm\nabout to show you so with that let's go ahead get started with a couple cups of\nall-purpose flour to which we will add a touch of salt as well as a touch of\nbaking powder and a touch of sugar and then what we'll do is take a whisk and\ngive this a mix until we think all that's been thoroughly combined and I\nshould mention even though I'm not using it here if you have self rising flour\nyou could use that instead along with the sugar and just skip the baking\npowder in salt but anyway we'll give those dry\ningredients a mix at which point we're gonna grate in one and a half sticks of\nice-cold butter alright so before you start this recipe make sure you put your\nbutter in the freezer which makes it very very easy to grate in one tip here\nis we do this every like quarter stick or so just give this mixture a toss with\nthe fork so that all those little particles of butter get coated and don't\nstart sticking to each other is this warms up and by the way if you want to\ncut your butter in using one of those wire pastry blenders go ahead but I\nthink this is actually faster and easier so this is my preferred method plus if\nsomeone walks in the kitchen as you're doing this do you have any idea how cool\nlooks to be grating butter but anyway like I said we'll go ahead and grate in\none and a half sticks making sure all those shards are nicely coated in the\nflour alright so that technique is one reason\nwe're calling this a ultimate crumble and once that's been accomplished we'll\nmove on to more reasons so at this point let's go ahead and drizzle in a little\nbit of pure vanilla extract as well as two large egg yolks and for the record\nmost recipes just call for one but we're using two which according to my\ncalculations is twice as good and what we'll do is take a fork and mix this for\na couple minutes until that flour sort of absorbs a very small amount of wet\ningredients and after a few minutes of forking your mixture should look\nsomething like this and it will have almost but not quite\nmoisture to hold this together in clumps which is why we're gonna stop and add\nthe last ingredient a teaspoon or two of apple cider vinegar and what we'll do is\ngive that a very brief mixing with the fork maybe 30 seconds or so before\nswitching to our hands where we're gonna finish mixing this by rubbing it between\nour fingers all right so get in there and get in deep and just keep rubbing\nthat stuff between your fingertips until it seems like everything's been combined\nbut more importantly if you squeeze some of this in your hand\nit will form a clump that stays together and once we've reached that point\ncongratulations our crumble is done so yes it's a\nshockingly small amount of moisture that makes this happen which reminds me if\nyours is not clumping you can add another teaspoon of vinegar or a\nteaspoon of water until it just starts to clump together and then what we'll do\nonce our crumble mixture is complete is set that aside and move on to the second\ncomponent which will be our fresh mixed berries and today I'm going to be using\nthree varieties including blueberries raspberries or raspberries if you want\nto be that person and then last but not least we'll do some blackberries and\nthen we'll go ahead and flavor these up with a little bit of lemon in two forms\nwe'll do some freshly grated zest as well as a couple teaspoons of the juice\nand then even though it's in the crumble we're also going to need a little touch\nof sugar here as well I have some cornstarch which is what's gonna help\nthicken up all those beautiful berry juices and then last but not least we'll\nsprinkle in a little bit of no it's not cinnamon but that was a good guess that\nwas Cayenne but anyway once all that's in there we'll take a spoon and give it\na mix oh and I should mention when it comes to the cornstarch how much you add\ndepends on how tight or runny you want your fruit filling or if you're going\nfor something like a pie filling like I'm doing here you're gonna want to use\nas much as I did but if you want something looser and juicier and more\nrunny then you'll simply cut the amount of cornstarch down or leave it out all\ntogether and I will definitely touch on this in\nthe blog post and I should mention that sugars gonna dry out a lot of liquid so\nI generally like to do this step right before I'm about to assemble this which\nnow that that's all mixed up I'm ready to do and how that's going to start is\nby transferring about half of our crumble mixture into the bottom of our\nbaking dish which can be any shape but it should be\nat least 2 or 3 inches deep and be able to fit about 2 quarts of contents and\nwhat we'll do after transferring in about half of our crumble mixture is go\nahead and press it down using something flat like this measuring cup and we'll\nwant to go around and make sure that's compacted very well and since I am\nhoping for my fruit mixture to come out like a pie filling this is gonna act\nlike a bottom crust which is yet another thing that makes us the ultimate crumble\nso we'll go ahead and place and press 1/2 our mixture at which point we can\ntransfer in our berries and we will even those out and distribute them the best\nwe can and then what we'll do once our bottoms been buried now that was a\nquality accidental double entendre pardon my french but anyway once our\nberries are in we will apply the rest of the mixture to the top and what I'll do\nis place one big handful down as is and nice small fine crumbs but as I work my\nway through the rest I transition to a technique called the old squeeze clump\nand crumble which means when you grab a handful of mixture squeeze it tight to\nform a clump and then we break up that clump which we refer to in the business\nas the mother clump into smaller irregular jagged pieces\nalright so simply squeeze it in your hand where it will compress together\nwhich way you can break it up into as large or small pieces as you want and\nobviously how fine or coarse you make your services up to you I mean you guys\nare after all the Forrest Gump's of crumbling clumps but I would advise not\nto make your crumbles too small in uniform alright I really think it's\ngoing to have a better texture and appearance if we have a wide variety of\ncrumble sizes so dude how you want but what you see here is what I consider\nideal and basically that's it once we've completed our crumble scaping this is\nready to transfer into the center of a 375 degree oven for about 45 minutes or\nso or until the top is beautifully browned and hopefully looking a little\nsomething like this and above and beyond our browning\nanother sign you're done is that the berry syrup that forms as this bakes\nwill sort of bubble up here and there through the surface that's another great\nindication it's baked long enough at this point if you want you could serve\nbut personally I recommend you let it cool down a little bit at least until\nit's just warm or my personal preference room temperature\nso as impossible as it was I did lie mindset for about a half hour before\nserving some up which I am definitely gonna accessorize with some vanilla ice\ncream which if applied properly supposed to have a beautifully smooth seductive\nsurface but since mind int I had no choice but to add another scoop on top\nand I went ahead and finished that off with a sprig of chocolate mint which is\nwhy that's so dark and gorgeous and yes in case you're wondering it does smell\nand taste a little bit like chocolate and that's it what I'm totally\naccurately calling the ultimate berry crumble is done so let me grab a fork\nand dig in and we'll get to the amazing taste in a minute but first I want to\nbrag about the absolutely perfect ratio between the fruit and the crumble\nalright personally I'm a crumble guy well we do need a certain amount of\nfruit here since I'm not trying to eat a cake but on the other hand I don't want\nto be eating a bowl of fruit with a little bit of crumble on top so for me\nthe proportions between those two things here we're absolutely spot-on and as far\nas the taste goes if there's a better bite than sweet tangy berries creamy\nvanilla ice cream and a crispy buttery crumble I'm not sure what that would be\nbut if you know please share because I would really like to eat that so I\nreally was beyond thrilled with how this came out and for something that's so\neasy to put together and relatively inexpensive this very well may be my\nfavorite summer dessert and if you're going to one of those gatherings where\nyou're supposed to bring something this is probably what you should bring just\nbe sure to call ahead to make sure there's going to be some vanilla ice\ncream but either way whether you're making this for others or to selfishly\nenjoy by yourself which is certainly nothing to be ashamed of I really do\nhope you give this amazing fresh berry crumble a try soon so head over to food\nwishes calm for all the ingredient amounts of more info as usual and as\nalways enjoy you you", "XFXXWLz4Vps": "hey guys welcome to my channel what's cooking with a petha for baby cake I have

welcome back to az2 ozarks as i promised in my rye bread video i am now providing you with the recipe for my sugar-free jams now why have sugar-free jams well personally i don't like how sweet most store-bought jams are they just are so sugar-ridden and i don't like my kids to have all that sugar so i began to seek out recipes and work with ideas for making a jam where the bright flavors of the fruit shines through so that they are the star of the show instead of just simply sweetness i use a sweetener i use both erythritol and monk fruit for sweetening however it's just not overpowering now it's important to know that the sugar and jams are regulated the quantity of sugar each state has regulations because sugar is a preservative and oftentimes you will only find recipes for sugar-free jams that are refrigerator they are not canned or shelf-stable so i provided the jams at the farmers market in lake havasu city arizona and i wanted to be able to have shelf stable jams but in order to do that i had to submit both my recipe and samples of my jams to the university of arizona for lab testing to make sure they were safe and all of my jams passed of course i would not be sharing this with you if they were not safe so know that i have tested these recipes and they are considered safe now they are shelf stable for up to one year so make sure you write your dates on your jars and once you open them and keep them in the refrigerator they are safe for up to a month of course you can probably have them for longer but that is the regulations and you want to make sure you follow those food guidelines let's go ahead and get started as you are preparing to make your jam get a deep pot full of hot water and place your jars in so that the jars are covered over the top with water you're going to bring this pot to a full boil for several minutes in order to make sure that your jars are nice and clean and sterilized i leave it boiling for about 10 minutes or more but either way you just let it boil until you are ready to fill the jars with the jam because we have super hard water here i like to give a little splash of vinegar into my water and this isn't going to be in your jam or anything all this does is keep your jars from building up that white sediment on the outsides you don't want you know it's just one more thing to have to clean up so splashing in a little bit of vinegar will help get rid of that all together and your jars will come out crystal clear and beautiful in another large pot on the stove you will place five cups of raspberries and these can be frozen or fresh i'm using frozen because we don't have any raspberries in season and you'll want to have low to low medium heat and keep checking and stirring frequently because you do not want these to burn to the bottom of the pan in a separate bowl you will combine your sweeteners i am using one cup of erythritol and you'll notice that this is not nearly as much sweetener as you would have in a regular jam regular sugar jam they usually have quite a bit of sugar in them but we are making it sugar-free so we have erythritol which has no glycemic index and it doesn't have any of that harmful stuff like sucralose or aspartame and then we are going to mix it with pure monk fruit extract and this pure monk fruit extract is 200 times sweeter than sugar and so we're going to use one teaspoon it's a powder and we will mix it into the erythritol i do get the monk fruit extract at azure standard you can purchase it there and i've been very happy with the quality of it and it mixes in so nicely with erythritol now you can also purchase a product by uh i think it's called lecanto and they have an erythritol monk fruit mix already so we mix these together because this powder will clump if you put it right into the berries without first mixing it in here this keeps it from clumping up into little pockets of super sweetness as your berries begin to warm you can use a potato masher to mash them down to the consistency you would like now raspberries are very delicate berries and they really don't need much convincing to break apart this is more necessary if you're going to make the varieties with blackberries strawberries or blueberries and i will include the ingredients necessary for those other three varieties in the description down below and so that you can make any of these varieties the instructions are the same it's just a slight difference in the ingredients once the jam begins to simmer add in your sweetener blend and give it a stir in now you want to be very careful to keep the berries from burning so you'll want to stir frequently you will want to let this mixture simmer for about 10 minutes that way the sweetener melts down and becomes well incorporated after simmering for 10 minutes add 4 tablespoons of lemon juice you will want to use store-bought lemon juice because if you use fresh lemons the acidity really can vary and because we are canning this and it is an issue of safety you want to make sure that you're using a lemon juice that has a consistent acidity mix this around next we will add a half cup of chia seeds i purchased these in bulk from azure standard again that will link will be down in the description below so stir in a half cup of your black chia seeds your jam will appear quite thin at this point but as it cools and as there's more time with the chia seeds in the berries it will thicken chia seeds are an excellent thickening agent and we use them because pectin doesn't work without the sugar so pectin wouldn't react well so we need a different thickener and the chia seeds work out wonderfully for that as well as they increase your fiber and make it an even lower glycemic index for people who are watching that sort of thing as soon as you have stirred in your chia seeds let's get the jars out of the boiling water and ready for filling make sure to have your lids and your rings on standby [Music] now that your jars are filled to within a half inch of the top you will use a wet paper towel to clear the top and make sure it's perfectly clean you don't want any chunks of seeds or berries to affect the seal of your jars these are very hot so be careful when handling them and next i take my lids and very briefly insert them into the hot water using the magnetic lid remover pull them out of the hot water and place them on top of the jars gently place the rings on the jars and you'll want to screw them on but not tight so you can see it's just barely finger tight not even fastened down next we will place them back into our pot of hot water to resume boiling this is where the water bath begins cover the pot and allow it to boil for 13 minutes at a rapid boil if you have a little bit left over in your pot that didn't fit into your jars feel free to place it in a little dish that you can keep in the refrigerator or you can just eat it for lunch that day so this will set up just nicely right in the refrigerator after 13 minutes in the water bath remove your jars carefully and place them onto a towel or a drying mat so that they may cool as they cool they will suck down the lids and they will seal what is left but a taste test i can assure you that all of these jams are super delicious make sure to check the um description box below for the recipe for each of the other three flavors and of course my taste tester here this jam is perfect to have on sandwiches but you can also have it on plain yogurt you can eat it however you like to have your jam so some people like to have it on cottage cheese too so i hope you enjoyed this video if you did give us a thumbs up and subscribe for more recipes in the future", "F5LhDkAfxA8": "hey guys and welcome back to through time Cracker Jacks today I'm gonna show you how to make small batch strawberry jam this is super simple only requires three ingredients there's no need for any pectin there's no need for any gelatin there's no need for any candy thermometers there's no special tools no special equipment for this and it only makes just over a pint of finished jam so without further ado let's get started so obviously the first thing you need that I need is fresh strawberries here I've got two pounds of fresh berries that I've gone ahead and washed rinsed off and using a melon baller I'm just gonna top and chop these berries basically all I do is scoop the top the leafy part out of the strawberry and then using the melon baller part I just kind of chop the roughly chop the berries into pieces you throw them into a bowl now this recipe only uses two pounds of strawberries like I said in the beginning it only makes just over a pint of finished jam I know there's tons of recipes for strawberry jam out there in internet land but most of them require you know tons and tons of berries puts up way more strawberry jam than most people you know ever even really use in a year so that's the nice thing about this recipe you only need two pounds now once you get all of your strawberries topped and chopped you're gonna add some lemon juice I'm using fresh lemon juice here so I'm using a large lemon you're not going to need half of that so I'm going to go ahead and cut this in half and only juice half of it into my strawberries if you are using a bottled lemon juice or ready to use lemon juice you're only going to need about a tablespoon here but using a fork I'm going to juice this lemon into my strawberries and I wasn't thinking at the time so I got lemon seeds into my strawberries no big deal it's going to go ahead and fish them out here in a minute and then you want to add in two cups of granulated sugar this is just plain old white sugar using a spatula you want to toss this so all of your strawberries get coated in that sugar basically what we're gonna do here is macerate our strawberries the sugar is just going to help release all of the water and moisture in the berries it's gonna actually cut down the time that we need to cook this but just go ahead and make sure that all your strawberries are completely coated in that sugar it's also going to help kind of dissolve the sugar and process you want to leave this on your counter to let macerate for about an hour or so you can even do these overnight if you wanted to cover them and putting them in the refrigerator that's perfectly fine but an hour is usually sufficient on the countertop and that for about an hour you can see our fully macerated strawberries how much juice this sugar has allowed this these strawberries to release it's really soupy it's really juicy it's pure deliciousness at this point but you want to transfer this to a large pan because we're going to cook this down now now as far as pan size I'm using a four quart pan you want to use at least a four quart pan for this because this is going to kind of bubble up and thumb up you want to make sure that your pain is big enough that none of that's gonna overflow the top of your pan because it's just gonna make a sticky mess so make sure that you use at least a four quart pan for this recipe and over medium-high heat we want to bring this up to a boil stirring constantly now throughout this entire process you're going to need to stir constantly this is not something that you can just put on your stove and walk away from you need to baby it since we're not using pectin we're not using gelatin we're not using any of the fancy stuff it's just sugar and berries and lemon juice you're basically making a strawberry candy here we're gonna have to cook this down until it is the proper consistency now you can see here my berry mixture has started to come up to a boil and this is really the time that you want to you know adjust your heat if it starts sticking on the bottom you're gonna need to take it off and lower the heat once it starts sticking and burning on the bottom game over there's no wiggle room there so turn your heat down between medium and medium-high again stirring constantly I cannot stress that enough just stir constantly during this process you can see how it starts to foam up quite a bit as you're stirring it if it starts to get up to the very top of your pan just go ahead and lift your pan up off the heat and again continue stirring and that'll help kind of the foam we're track down a little bit and here we are after we have cooked this for about 20 minutes or so we're about halfway through now you're still going to need to continue to stir this constantly but you can see the foam the color of the foam has darkened up quite a bit the mixture has thickened up a little but we're still going to need to cut this down so again with the heat between medium and medium-high I'm going to continue stirring and continue reducing this mixture now you're probably wondering you know without a candy thermometer how do I know that this is done well there's a couple things that you can check for it the first is the foam of the strawberry mixture when this is done cooking and it is at the proper temperature the foam on top you will actually be able to stir it in and you won't have any more foam on the top that's one way that you know that it will be done second way that you know that it'll be done is the the sound of the boiling is gonna change on you it's no longer no sound just like boiling water it's gonna sound like it's boiling something thick and it sounds identical to if you were making if you've ever made pudding from scratch or custard or even just gravy it's gonna sound really thick and the bubbles popping is you'll know it when you hear it so as you can see here as I'm stirring this the foam has gone away the bubbling has kind of ceased a little bit so I know now that my jam is done but if you want to take one more measure and make sure that your jam is done what you're gonna want to do is take a plate at the beginning of this process and put it in your freezer once you think that your jam is done you want to take a spoonful of that and put it on to the plate that has just been taken out of the freezer you want this nice and frozen cold just spread out a spoonful of your jam on the plate and run your finger straight through it and when you tip that plate up on its side if it stays put and that line that you drew in with your finger stays put you know that your jam is done now don't worry about that jam being extra high putting it on the frozen plate cools it almost instantaneously now I am NOT going to be processing this GM and I know most people don't have the equipment to process this I understand that it's a small batch so all I'm gonna do is transfer this mixture into jars because that Jam is so hot and it's essentially a liquid candy you want to make sure that your jars are also hot so put some boiling water into your jars let them sit for a good ten minutes or so and let them come up to temperature so they're nice and hot and then you can add your hot GM to the hot jars and I'm just using a canning funnel here to do this and a little ladle like I said in the beginning of the video this makes just over a pint of finished GM so I've got three half pint jars here each half pint is eight ounces but just go ahead and top those off and then you can add lids and bands to these and again because we're not processing these you're going to need to store them in the refrigerator now even though we didn't process these these are still gonna last right around six months or so in the refrigerator there's two go ahead and make sure that you write on the top with a magic marker or put a piece of tape or something on it and right on that the date that you cook this but then go ahead and sort this in the refrigerator and then you can use it for whatever you prefer to use GM on most commonly I have mine on buttermilk biscuits or on a piece of toast as you can see here and you can see you know without using pectin without using a candy thermometer no special equipment this is perfect consistency JME and i know people are gonna ask this in the comments you know can I use other berries besides strawberries yes you can this works just the same with all the berries I've successfully made this using just blueberries just raspberries using a mixture of blackberries raspberries and blueberries using strawberries and blueberries together any combination of berries that you want or any single berry that you want this all works the same for so there you go I hope you guys enjoy learning how to make strawberry jam small batch style without any special tools equipment or ingredients if you liked this video be sure to give it a thumbs up I would greatly appreciate it subscribe for more

addition to so many dishes. Even without a dehydrator,\nit is remarkably simple to dry fruit in your\nown oven for a perfect, healthful snack or topping\nfor days and weeks to come. Space the cooking racks evenly apart and preheat your oven to\n200 degrees Fahrenheit. If your oven allows it,\n140 to 160 degrees is best, but 200 will work. Consider opening the oven door a crack at the higher temperature. To prep your fruit,\nit's important to select ripe or just overly\nripe fruit and berries. Wash in cold water, remove\nthe pits and stones, and remove any stems. Cut and slice the fruit evenly,\nso they will dry evenly. Particular fruits, like\npeaches, mangoes, and apples dry better if the skin has been removed. To keep your dried fruit attractive, and reduce discoloration, soak it in lemon juice and\nwater for about 10 minutes, then drain and blot dry. Cover a few baking sheets\nwith parchment paper and spread your fruit\nevenly in a single layer. Different thicknesses of fruit\nhave varied cooking times. Thinly sliced apples take\nless than two hours to dry, while thicker cuts, like\npeaches and apricots, take longer. Keep your slices relatively thin, and flip your fruit\nevery 30 minutes or so. When it's ready, remove the\ndried fruit from the oven and place in a glass or\nplastic container to cure. Leave the container open\nfor four to five days so that any moisture left\nfrom the drying process can evaporate. Give the containers a shake once a day to move the fruit around. After five days, seal,\nstore, and enjoy it well. There you have it. Preservative free, but tasting like candy, and perfect on granola, pancakes, or just straight\nfrom your hand to your mouth.

I'm Tess and today I got a great deal on blueberries and I'm\nmaking homemade blueberry crumble bars. A great snack or dessert that everyone\nwill love.       This morning I went to the farmers\nmarket and got a great deal on fresh blueberries. These blueberry crumble bars\nare real easy to make and make a nice bright refreshing snack. This is a great\nrecipe to make for parties and get-togethers. Most people love them! In my bowl I have three cups of all-purpose flour and I'm adding in one\ncup of sugar, one teaspoon of baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a half a\nteaspoon of cinnamon. Giving that a good mix to incorporate. Just a reminder that I will leave the\nrecipe and the list of ingredients for these blueberry crumble bars below this\nvideo. Also remember to like and subscribe if you enjoyed this video\nrecipe and click the bell to make sure you receive notification of all my\nfuture video recipes.   Now that everything is mixed well I'm\ngoing to incorporate some fat. You can use shortening or butter or a\ncombination of both and I'm using both. The shortening and butter should be at\nroom temperature and I'm using a pastry cutter to cut the fat into the flour. You\ncan also use a fork to do this. Continue cutting until you see pea-sized or\nsmaller crumbles. Something like this. Next, I have one large room temperature\negg that I will do the same thing and this will take a minute to incorporate.   Here I have four cups of fresh\nblueberries that I rinsed and drained. I'm adding a half a cup of sugar and\nfour teaspoons of cornstarch. Giving that a good gentle mix so all the blueberries\nare coated. The cornstarch will help hold the blueberries together and thicken the\nblueberry juices as they cook. For a little POP of brightness I'm adding in the\njuices of half a lemon. Again giving everything a gentle mix. I have my oven preheating to 375 degrees\nFahrenheit. I have a 9 by 13 pan that I greased and I also put in a parchment\nliner so the bars will be easier to lift out. I'm placing half of my flour crumb\nmixture on the bottom, spreading out and gently tamping down. This is going to\nmake a nice firm base for the blueberry crumble bars. Now the blueberries and\nleveling out. They are so beautiful!       The other half of the flour crumb mixture\nI'm sprinkling evenly over the top.       I like to add some\nsliced almonds on the top for a little crunch. This is going into a 375 degrees\nFahrenheit oven for 45 minutes or until golden brown on top.       The kitchen smells so good. I'm letting this completely cool before cutting. In the meantime, I'm making a simple\nicing to drizzle over the top. This is about a half a cup of powdered sugar or\nconfectioner sugar and a little orange juice. You could also use milk. Just\nputting in a teaspoon of the orange juice and giving it a stir. You just want\nto add a little at a time. And this is the consistency that you're looking for.   You can put on as much or as little of the icing that you like.     This recipe\nmakes 12 nice blueberry crumble bars. Of course I love the blueberries! The\ncrumble topping and sliced almonds add a nice crunch and texture and the simple\nicing gives it a pop of sweetness. This blueberry crumble bar recipe is easy and\ndelicious.

I get a lot of requests asking to show you\nsnack ideas, something a little bit lighter than what we normally do. So I thought, why don\u2019t I show you what\nI snack on, which are frozen yogurt pops. They are full of natural sugars, high in protein,\nand best of all, they satisfy your hunger. So let\u2019s get started. Ok so I don\u2019t know about you, everyone is\ndifferent but when I realize I\u2019m hungry, I have to eat like right now and I will eat\nanything there is around me, even junk food. So I came up with these frozen yogurt pops\nso I can always have them in the freezer and ready for me to grab. The thing about it is, I don\u2019t even like\njunk food anyway but I will eat it when I\u2019m hungry so these are a great option for me. I put together a few of my favorite flavors\nof pops and we\u2019re going to start out with a zesty blueberry and lemon. So I make my frozen yogurt pops in my food\nprocessor but if you have a blender, that works just as well. So the base for our pops is yogurt. Now I like to use nonfat greek yogurt but\nyou can always use any type of yogurt you like, even actually dairy free yogurt works\nreally well. I like greek yogurt because it has higher\nprotein than other yogurt and also it is really filling, which is what you want from a snack. On top of our yogurt, we are going to add\nin our blueberries. Now I like to use frozen blueberries when\nwe\u2019re not quite yet in berry season but you can use fresh, that\u2019s not a problem. Just do me a favor and look on the back of\nthe pack and try not to buy berries that are berries and sugar. It\u2019s totally not needed, you just want berries\nin there by themselves. For our zesty flavor for these pops, I\u2019m\ngoing to put in a little bit of grated lemon zest. Blueberries and lemon are just delicious together. They have a lovely fresh flavor. Like I mentioned before, these pops are full\nof lovely natural sugars and one of those sugars is honey. If you don\u2019t eat honey you can also use\nagave or actually even maple syrup. That will work really well too. And that\u2019s it, a handful of ingredients\nand that\u2019s going to make a lovely treat. So pop on the lid, and now we\u2019re just going\nto pulse it until it\u2019s nice and fine and everything is pureed well. The flavors that I\u2019m doing are just suggestions,\nyou can add in any fruit you like or even add in flavors like vanilla, cinnamon, whatever\ntakes your fancy. And there you go, that\u2019s it. Probably took, say around 30 seconds to a\nminute. Oh my gosh, look at this gorgeous color, a\nlovely purple. Lemon and blueberries work so well together,\nI think it\u2019s just because they both have a lovely fresh kind of a flavor. Okie dokie, this is ready to be frozen so\nwe\u2019re going to put it into our containers. To freeze our frozen yogurt pops, I like to\nuse these. They\u2019re just like gogurt packets. They\u2019re really inexpensive and I\u2019m going\nto put a link for where I got these on my website, www.biggerbolderbaking.com. If you don\u2019t have one of these, don\u2019t\nworry about it. Because you always can use a little disposable\ncup and you can put a little lollipop stick in there so you can get it out easily. Put your yogurt into a little jug because\nit makes it much easier to get it into your pack. And then just go ahead and pour it right in. Just fill your yogurt all the way to the top,\nor up to the little line that\u2019s on the pack. Then give it a little squeeze on top, and\nthere you have it. Your frozen yogurt pop is ready for the freezer. A few ingredients, a few minutes, and it\u2019s\nready to go. They take only around 4 hours to freeze and\nthey will last in your freezer for up to 6 weeks. Our next frozen yogurt pop is a great one\nbecause you nearly always have the ingredients for it in the house. It\u2019s banana and honey. Just like before, we\u2019re going to add our\nyogurt into our food processor. To our yogurt, we\u2019re going to add in our\nbanana and you can use fresh, but I actually have frozen banana because I had too many\nbananas in my house so I sliced them up and froze them. So they work really well for recipes like\nthis. To our bananas, we\u2019re going to add in our\nhoney. That\u2019s it, just those three ingredients. On with our lid, and we\u2019re going to blend\nit up until it\u2019s nice and smooth. Ok lovely, only a few seconds. Let\u2019s have a little look see. I love when you blend up bananas because it\ngets really nice and thick and kind of starchy. It really makes you feel like you\u2019re eating\nsomething. Just like before, I\u2019ve got my yogurt mix\nin a jug which makes it easier to pour in. And then just fill up your pack. Lovely! Seal up the top, and there you have it. Another delicious flavor ready for the freezer. When it comes to fast food, this is what I\u2019m\ntalking about. You\u2019ve probably noticed from my recipes\nbut I adore tropical fruit. So our next flavor is mango and strawberry. They are two flavors that work really well\ntogether. Add your yogurt into your food processor. To our yogurt, we\u2019re going to add in our\nmango and then add your honey in. We\u2019re going to add in our strawberry at\nthe end. First, we\u2019re going to blend up all the mango\nand the rest of the ingredients. I get asked a lot what do I eat for breakfast\nand I actually eat these because they\u2019re kind of like a frozen smoothie. They\u2019re really filling and they tie me over\nuntil about lunch time. And I\u2019m actually going to put the nutritional\nvalue and the calorie count on my website. Ok so all of our mango is nice and blended. So just lastly I\u2019m going to add in the strawberry\nbecause I want there to be like little bits. I don\u2019t want it to be totally blended. And we\u2019re just going to give this a little\nbit of a juge. Oh look at that color. Look how beautiful that is. Put your yogurt into your jug and then into\nyour packages. Now seal it up nice and tight. Now this little guy is ready for the freezer. Now if you don\u2019t want to miss out on any\nof my upcoming videos and you like this recipe, then don\u2019t forget to subscribe to my channel. Now, on to the next flavor. This next flavor is really lovely because\nit\u2019s both sweet and creamy at the same time. It is peach and raspberry. Into your food processor, add in your yogurt. Into our yogurt, we\u2019re going to add in our\nfruit, which is peach and then raspberries. Ok to this, we\u2019re going to sweeten it up\na little bit with our honey. Everything is in there, on with our lid and\nthen blend up. I\u2019ve used frozen fruit for my pop so you\ncan see it\u2019s lovely and thick. Oh my gosh, yum yum yum yum yum. Fill your packs with your yogurt mix until\nit\u2019s all gone. Seal it up and you are ready to go. And remember you actually don\u2019t have to\nfreeze these. You can eat them as is. And they work really well in lunchboxes. Now that we\u2019re done with this one, we\u2019re\ngoing to move on to our next flavor that is more like a chocolatey decadent dessert. For all you bold bakers out there, a jar of\nnutella should be a staple in your cupboard because we use it quite often. It\u2019s going to come in really handy for our\nnext recipe which is a nutella frozen yogurt pop. This recipe is even easier than the others\nbecause it just requires two ingredients, your yogurt, and of course yummy nutella. Now if you can\u2019t buy nutella, I\u2019ve got\na recipe on my channel of how to make your own homemade one so you can use either or. And that\u2019s it, could not be simpler. On with our lid and we\u2019re going to give\nit a juge juge. Ok and that\u2019s it, it\u2019s done. This takes even less time than the others\nbecause it\u2019s just so smooth. Oh yummy yummy, chocolate and yogurt are one\nof my favorite treats, I\u2019ll tell you why. Because it\u2019s not normally as sweet as a\nchocolate bar would be, and it has a little bit of acidity that works really well with\nchocolate. I just love that sort of balance of flavors. This is going to be absolutely delicious. Pour your yogurt nutella mix into a jug and\nthen fill up your packs just like before. Our snack is ready in no time, our nutella\npops are ready for the freezer. In just a few hours, your yogurt pops are\nready to enjoy. No matter what your taste, there is a flavor\nhere for everyone. For me, my snack food has to be filling, full\nof good ingredients and taste good and that\u2019s exactly what these are. I really hope you try them because I know\nyou\u2019re going to love them no matter flavor you make. Make sure you check out my playlist for lots\nof other frozen treat ideas. Thank you so much for watching and I\u2019ll\nsee you back here next Thursday for more Bigger Bolder Baking. I\u2019ve eaten half of it. I don\u2019t know how it happened, it just kind\nof disappeared in my mouth.", "k38Pj2De2Ec": "hi I'm Stephanie Gosk of joy baking calm st. Simons Island has these beautiful salt marshes that we like to come to to walk or just to sit and enjoy the view and of course I have to bring along a snack and today I brought these delicious fruit and nut bars so that is what we're going to make I'll meet you back of the kitchen so this is what our fruit and nut bars look like as you can see they are full of lots of different types of nuts dried fruits and I even put in some mini chocolate chips so the first thing you need to do is pre-heat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit which is 165 degrees Celsius and you will need an 8-inch square baking pan that's 20 centimeters and I like to line the pan with foil and then have the foil come over the sides so we can lift once we bake our squares we can lift it the foil up and it's really easy to get them out of the pan now if you're going to line your pan with foil I'll just quickly show you how to do that just take a piece of foil and just form it over the back of your pan and crease the sides like so so that you have the shape and then it's a lot easier to fit it into your pan doesn't tend to rip so which is good so now these are you know most of the work involved with making fruit nut bars is to chop up our nuts and her fruit other than that it's a really easy recipe so the first thing we need is a large bowl and you will need one-and-a-half cups which is 175 grams of chopped nuts now you could use one type of nut like examples are pecans walnuts almonds hazelnuts pistachios and but I like to use a variety because you know it adds visual plus it adds a lot of flavor so what I've used here is some hazelnuts the Stasi owes and almonds three of my favorites and like the almonds and the hazelnuts if you wanted to toast the nuts first because that tends to bring out their flavor just put them into the oven for about eight to ten minutes just until you start to smell them and then let them cool completely and then coarsely chop like I've done here and then we will need two cups which is 270 grams of dried fruits again you can you know use whatever type you personally like I like to mix it up I mean you could use one type but I like a real variety not only for the flavor difference but visually and I particularly like having the orange and that could be apricots are a good choice for that mangos and papaya I'm using mango today and just coarsely chop that and then I also have a mixture of dried cranberries and dried cherries raisins would also be and I also have some prunes and that I've chopped up coarsely and figs and when you use dried figs it usually has that little tip on the end just cut that off and or dates I mean there's so many just whatever you can find make sure you're buying good quality dried fruits and always check the expiry date because if they're old they kind of get dry and they don't taste as good and the other thing is dried fruit and you have to look on the label whether there's sulfur dioxide used like for example the the mango here has when I checked it does have sulfur dioxide used in the drying process and they use that for a few reasons one is it maintains the color and especially with this the bright orange you want that so and it also keeps the sulfur dioxide keeps your dried fruits nice and moist if you don't want to use that sometimes in your regular grocery store I have found most of the dried fruit has sulfur dioxide so I tend to go like for my prunes and my figs I went to a like a health food store health market and typically they're they they're dried fruits do not have that so just keep that in mind and then I also added a third of a cop 55 grams of the little mini chocolate chips because I like chocolate if you don't want to use chocolate chips then you could substitute with more nuts or dried free so just into there and all we're going to do is kind of mix that together with a third of a cup 45 grams of all-purpose flour and then we're going to add some sugar third of a cup about 65 grams of firmly packed light brown sugar and you know just quarter of a teaspoon of salt and just a little bit of 1/8 of a teaspoon of baking soda and then I really want it you can use your hands or a spatula I really want to mix spit the flour and all the things together and the flour would the good thing is what you can do is is in there with your hands is to separate your your fruit because you know when you cut it especially some dried fruits that are really moist they will stick together so you can use the flour to kind of separate that and that's it for that and so there is no butter or oil in this that's what makes them so and I mean they're so healthy for us is all we're going to do I am in a separate Bowl here is we're going to beat one large egg and heavier a get room temperature because it will beat up a lot better in a room-temperature egg along with 1/2 a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract if you don't want vanilla you can just leave that out or you could add another type of extract and I'm just going to beat this on high speed you know probably taking a cut to three minutes or you can use I'm using that a hand mixer you could just use a wire whisk and I'm just going to beat it on high speed until it's really thick and very light-colored okay it's good so this is what you're looking for see it's very nice and light and fluffy and very thick so and now we're just going to add that to a fruit nuts see it's really an easy recipe it's just all that chopping that I found takes the time otherwise it's a really easy recipe so now and then what we're going to do is just mix it all together you want to make sure everything is moistened so just keep stirring this you want to get your hands in there by all means okay looks pretty good I know it's hard to believe that all you need is an egg to bind all this together but it does work okay I'm happy with that just make sure all that flour has been moistened and all the fruit so now we're just now I didn't bother a buttering or even spraying my foil I find I don't need to but you know if you want to take that extra step just as a precaution the mile means you could do that and then we're just going to even this out and then press it down so it's it's compacted in your pan isn't that look gorgeous all those colors the textures oh and they're good for us so kind of the perfect bar okay it looks pretty good so make sure it's really pressed down so now we're going to bake this somewhere between 35 and say 40 minutes and you can tell they're done because the the top will turn a really nice golden-brown and they will start just around the edges you'll notice it's starting the squares will start to pull away from the foil okay our fruit and nut bars are now done nice golden brown on top and it's just starting to separate from the sides so what I'm going to do is let this cool you know ten fifteen minutes and then I'll show you how to take it over the pan so now to take our squares over bars over the pan just flip the foil like so see enough and then you just peel back your foil when these are still like a little warm and then you can I mean cut them into you know any shape any size I usually cut it down the center and then each half I do in two thirds so do that and then just then I typically turn it and then just cut it into thirds so I have like little bars now what's great about these you could store them at room temperature for ten days two weeks or I always store them in the fridge and I find you know if they last that long though you know maybe up to a month and then just peel it off mine are still a little warm so I'm going to try one I made yesterday except they they're better if you store them overnight and this is the top if you turn them over that's how I like to serve them and we'll just try some Oh wonderful salt they're soft chewy the fruit not so good you know pack them on a picnic put them in the kids lunch boxes or just happen for breakfast with some yogurt so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm", "ASK3pF5wQ5s": "DeFazio I'm a registered dietician with a master's in nutritional science today I'm going to show you how to make a gourmet berry smoothie at home so with all smoothies make sure you have your blender out and I'm going to show you some different ways that you can also do this what I love about this smoothie is we're using a variety of berries I always use frozen fruit in my smoothies because the fruit lasts longer it's going to be cheaper and it's gonna make a nice thick smoothie so here we have a combination of raspberries blueberries and strawberries as you see here that you can get them at all the major markets they come frozen and again they're really affordable you also want to throw in your liquid first for this recipe I'm using some low-fat milk you can also use soy milk or almond milk throw in about 1/2 cup of that if you like it thinner add more milk throw in our nice concoction of berries it's gonna be a really nice colorful smoothie and again berries are so healthy for you loaded with antioxidants and vitamin C potassium so healthy will shake there ok not a good idea to wear yellow probably while you're mixing blueberries but you know buy a new one ok and yogurt so the reason why we're gonna use yogurt is that it's gonna make the smoothie a lot thicker and it is going to add some good protein so because we're on a berry theme here with this smoothie I chose a blueberry yogurt you can also use raspberry or a mixed berry yogurt you can of course use any type of yogurt I choose Greek yogurt because it's gonna have a lot more of the protein and C in there too it's gonna have the blueberries already mixed in so all about berry flavoring here on this recipe so if you love berries it's a really good one I like the tartness also that Greek yogurt adds to smoothies so we have our berries our milk and we're gonna add in a little bit of ice because we're using frozen fruit you have to use as much ice but again a little bit of extra ice is going to make the smoothie a little thicker and colder and that's it so remember always add your liquid first so the ice doesn't get jammed down in the bottom of the blender throw on your top make sure it's nice and secure and we are going to blend that looks good get a nice tall glass for that okay yeah look at that beautiful color Wow see how thick it is it's because of that Greek yogurt we threw in there along with the frozen fruit so let's taste how berrylicious this is mmm god I love the tartness from the Greek yogurt along with the sweetness of the berries this is nice because it's not overly sweet sometimes smoothies are just way too sweet but really tart and

of people don't know what to do with their frozen berries so today I'm sharing with you three of my very favorite crazy easy very simple ways to enjoy my frozen berries idea number one blueberry almond and cacao nib cereal you're going to take a half a cup of frozen blueberries top that with a tablespoon of sliver almonds and a tablespoon of cacao nibs pour in your almond milk or whatever milk you prefer and enjoy this is a great way to curb a sweet tooth and it's a delicious snack as the weather starts to heat up idea number two cottage cheese and frozen raspberries now just for the record you could also do this with Greek yogurt into my bowl goes 1/2 a cup of frozen raspberries 3/4 of a cup of low-fat cottage cheese and just a dash of cinnamon stir that all together and you will have a rich creamy cheesecake like snack and guys I gotta tell you using the frozen berries instead of fresh berries makes this snack even more delicious because the berries just melt in your mouth and they add a little extra texture as well and my third and final crazy easy way to enjoy your frozen berries is my banana strawberry nice cream into my food processor goes 1/2 a cup of frozen strawberries one frozen banana chopped into small chunks and about 3 tablespoons of almond milk or whatever milk you prefer pop on your lid and pulse this on and off on and off on and off until it starts to come together and you have a beautiful rich creamy banana berry ice now if you haven't jumped on an ice-cream wagon yet I highly recommend you do you will be amazed at just how much it tastes like the real deal and of course any of these berries are interchangeable for all of these snack ideas really you could use any type of frozen fruit you want I mean are these easier what I told you they were crazy easy before we got started so now I want to hear from you which of these three might you try first or which one have you already tried or and how do you like to eat your frozen berries come on down into the comments below and let me know and remember guys if you want to stay connected and inspired all week long when I'm not here on the youtubes then be sure to follow me on Facebook and Instagram as well because I tend to be there most every day of the week thanks so much for watching guys I'm Dani Spears and I'll see you back here next time with some more clean and deliciousness Cheers hey guys it's Dani and OOP hey guys it's Dani and now boom sorry if you haven't jumped on the nice cream boo what I call it an ice cream wagon here we go and whoop",

strawberry and raspberry frozen mixture I bought at the store just frozen berries and of course I pour them in my blender here you're going to need a blender for this for sure and then I'm going to add one cup of whole milk after all it is a milkshake okay so we're gonna add our whole milk there oh you have him oh yeah and then I want you to get one tablespoon a plain sugar if you got some other kind of shirt you really like using okay but just use one tablespoon a plain white sugar right here and then once you get that into the blender I want you to put your lid on that bebut and we're going to blend her up because that's all there is to it that's all it takes I told you is fast and I wasn't telling you a fib it was delicious now lid on and then we're going to do a little blend in here Thunder up by here we go was that about 10 seconds making me tear down 10 seconds now I got to tell you my bulbous arm actually got into this shot and watch when I started making this poor I completely ruined the shot okay so you now that's what you get i hat you didn't want to look at my arm I promise you but after it's blended up there for however many seconds that was folks you can add your straw here give it a little stir so I did and there you go a milkshake that's better truly than what you can buy at a something or king or you know quack quack or whatever you know right making it home fresh no preservatives no garbage awesome have a good day", "Pg3eiGimJ9A": "hey guys welcome back to Kumar's kitchen today we're gonna be making a very berry pie let's get started the first thing you want to do for berry pie is place 24 ounces of mixed berries in a 2 quart saucepan and cook them over medium heat until they reduce and thicken after about 15 minutes your fruit should be boiling you want to reduce the heat to low and you're gonna stir in a mixture of 1 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup cornstarch you want to gradually mix in the sugar and cornstarch mixture a little bit at a time and then stir and incorporate a little bit more and stir again and continue in this fashion until all of the sugar and cornstarch is incorporated into the berry mixture once you've finished mixing in your sugar and cornstarch you want to cover and let this continue cooking for another 5 to 10 minutes after 10 minutes you want to turn off your heat and you'll see that your berries have thickened up into almost a jam like consistency at this point you're gonna take half a lemon and you're gonna stab it a bunch of times with a fork then you're gonna squeeze that on top of your berries and mix that lemon juice in now we're ready to move over to our pie crust I have two pie crusts here both are store-bought they were frozen and I've completely fought them to room temperature one will be the bottom crust with it we put our berries in and the other will end up being the top crust this one and you can see I've already started to peel away from the pan that it came in because that will need to be pulled out and placed over the other one you're going to take your berries and carefully pour them into your bottom crust then you're gonna take the other pie crust and carefully peel it out of its shell now I'm putting the floured side up because the underside is a little moist which will help it stick to the other crust carefully drape it over your pie then you just want to pinch the edges together to crimp them you can do this in a fancy manner you can do it with a fork you just want to make sure that the crusts are see together then you want to take a knife and just cut a few slits in the top you can do this in a fancy pattern or however you want this just lets some of the steam escape as the pie is cooking so that you don't have pie explode all over your oven this is gonna go in a 350 degree oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until the top is a nice golden brown color and you can see some of the filling bubbling up through these little slits that you made it's been about 45 minutes and you can see the top of our pie crust is nicely golden brown not too much bubbled up through the top but that's because right here I did not seal this edge very well and so a lot of it bubbled off the side here but other than that the pie looks beautiful you do want to let it cool 30 minutes to an hour before you cut into it otherwise the filling is just going to run all over the place then you can top it with whipped cream or ice cream if you want and you'll have a delicious dessert for any night of the week thanks so much for watching today's video if you enjoy leveling up your cooking skill today don't forget to like share and subscribe so you never miss another recipe we'll see you next time in Kimora's kitchen", "r5fLQJ623Z0": "hello everybody and welcome to cooking the books in this episode I'm going to show you how to make a delicious triple berry compote let's get to it alright for our berry compote we're going to be working in a saucepan like this start heating it up and to the saucepan you can add a cup of fresh chopped up strawberries and a cup of blackberries and two cups of blueberries not I'd give it another kick of sweetness we're going to also add four tablespoons of brown sugar and then we're going to add the juice of one lemon I've got put in here just to add that in and then a teaspoon of vanilla it's an awesome flavor to have in that very compote and just let it cook down it's going to cook for at least half an hour and you'll notice as it cooks that the amount of fresh fruit inside is just reducing and it's going to kind of concentrate into this awesome awesome compote so as you can see the berries have released a lot of their moisture content into our compote and you just want to continue cooking this down it's only been about five minutes now you want to cook it for at least half an hour before you end up using this so here's our berry compote it's introducing for about half an hour now and you can see that the fruit that was in it is kind of all getting all disintegrated and turning into that awesome liquid sauce so this is about where it is finished and as it cools down it'll thicken up even more and you want to be very careful with this because it does have the melted sugar in it so you don't want to get any of this on you and be very careful also hot and that's how you make a really simple really delicious berry compote this would go amazingly well on top of any kind of dessert any kind of cake and just let them let it chill out first before you put it on top so how does it taste you can really taste all the different berries in there as well a little bit of vanilla in the background it's a really really sweet really really nice sauce so if you enjoyed this episode don't forget to check out my others and I have another episode featuring this sauce coming up very soon see you later [Music] [Music]", "ZDeBNYQlKm4": "I'm Jones and today we're gonna find out what's the best tasting fruit snack to bald guys eat stuff and talk about it today is a very special day why is it special because it's an Lee's birthday how old are you turning so there's lots of different fruit snacks at the county market seven different brands that I got that are just normal fruit snacks and so we wound though is there any really taste difference and so today we're gonna do a taste test we're gonna rank up on a scale of one to ten right know how good they taste and we'll see which one's the best-tasting which one do you think will win and not to overdo it but we're only gonna have a couple of each one right all right so these are the fruit medley you get a red one set your favorite piece I'll do a green one like when they're chewy they're a lot of food flavor pretty citrusy hmm so would you do that Charlotte in I'm gonna give it a seven give it a seven all right that one's got curious we're gonna go again we're only gonna eat two pieces a red one so these are definitely harder to chew they are very chewy mmm pretty gummy their ever get stuck in your teeth so not a lot of fruit flavor would you give that 1 out of 10 a 7 I'm gonna give that one a pie that's too chewy for me let's pick up daddy's teeth those are fruit gushers a really super chewy whoa that's your stuff on the inside mm-hmm so these are almost as chewy as the one we just have quite a bit of flavor to them with a little clear what's the taste like you know sometimes a sex program like those are you gonna give those out of Tim seven does everything gonna be a seven I want to give those six Stephen look this pretty chewy it did have the gushy stuff on the inside so these are organic go organically fruit stacks they're also gluten free just too could you eat fruit snacks all day mmm definitely got a bounce to them off the teeth it's time hard to get through is that fun you enjoy chewing them I had two different for me since I don't have fruit snacks all the time I don't happen since I was your age very good taste though a lot of juicy flavor would you get those out of tin so there's everything running into 7-nothing get an 8 9 or 10 so the muffins have tens I'm gonna give it eight for those I like the flavor of those those are pretty good no you're gonna do it ain't now okay now I'll do Welch's like these best oh yeah we'll see okay for you two for me two for you two

really like those we're gonna get them oh you give a 9 you're just copying everything I do next up this month Papa : friends oh wow the texture is a lot different with those they're not super chewy you can really push through them in one bite huh mmm so the fruit flavor not on a high scale but still there I really like a texture to those though a lot better than the other ones hmm would you get that one Nate I'm gonna get fun I'm gonna copy you on that one I give it a date - those are pretty good yeah you start working Star Wars daddy's a little bias since he's seen new Star Wars movie twice now if he likes Yoda who's on this know who Yoda is a little green guy all right now flavor disease we like the texture but there's something a little bit missing from it I'm gonna give that one a seven seven to the power two legs now trying seven different brands we have a winner and the winner is well system called Welch's so I really liked the flavor and the texture this one I had a really good snack right this is a fruit snack which is what you wanted what's your favorite flavor foots next do you like the strawberry the orange a blueberry you like to strawberry one's the best let us know in the comments which fruit snack you like the best to you just want the puppies hey you just like the puppy sheep so sometimes those kids it may not be the taste or the texture maybe just the shape or how much fun they are to eat that's okay bye bye see ya two bald guys eat stuff and talk about it", "bQ7XcdwVTe8": "hello all city candy fans welcome back i'm nicole and today we are going to be trying the sour frunias so right away looking a look at it well here's the packaging it instantly reminds me of a now and later so it's just a little different version but this is a sour one we're gonna give it a try so as we pop it open take a look it's got a nice blue color to it this is perfect if you got like birthday parties or like even like gender reveals this will add a little fun to it and it's a nice light blue color perfect for that baby theme and it's got a little flecks in there you can take a look and see and if you like sour we're gonna go ahead and give this a shot oh it's very good it's actually very soft so you know how noun layers they start off hard and then get softer as you go this is soft very instantly and i actually personally like that the flavor is instant

Jason they were a dollar thirty nine each and he bought them at Harris Teeter Harris Teeter is a store brand these look like they're gonna be like a nature grain bar and Jason knows that we like new terrain bars so he picked them up for us you get these are the strawberry and you get eight balls in each box they have a little tab at the top to open them and the boxes there are the same size of the Nutri mark so it says naturally flavored with other natural flavors strawberry cereal marks contains eight whole grains per serving look like a big thing like it contains eight grams of whole grains I know I said that wrong eight grams of whole grain they are 120 calories so I'm pretty sure a new trend bar is also 120 calories they've always nikkor and all of the  out big Newton to me hello big Newton that's so good I want to rest of it but we're gonna be having full three more I think I think Newton is drier so those are a much moister it's awful that's a good Pleasant summer I like it a lot I like I like the softness of it the texture there's no toughness to it I'm surprised to you because it has almost on bushy texture and you don't like a mushy texture foods it's firm enough like a like a wheat bread or something you know it's firm enough to where it's it's not it's not it's not like a squished ham yeah nothing like a softer texture I like the amount of strawberry in there oh yeah good good enough it's not overpowering strawberry but you know it's there if you were blonde called list you would know that strawberry so this is the blueberry and it is also 20 they're all in our employee calorie bars so like I said I'm thinking nutured race at 120 or 130 they've changed it over the years they and that much flavor is not as strong as strawberry very long I don't even know that I would be able to identify no I don't think I would even if you were if you were to just give me that in st. Robyn's what is you don't be like there's some fruit in there I don't know what it is now but though you just don't know yeah that's very very like one yeah I would never I would not guess that to be I wouldn't gets it to be blueberry I wouldn't give us it to be strawberry or raspberry anything like that little berry I just wouldn't know that wants to I don't know I don't think it's not bad it's not that bad or they have something that's a strong one you can yeah so this is mixed berry got pictures of strawberries raspberries Oh that has more water the raspberries run Tyson hmm it is I mean I wonder if they make a raspberry one mmm that's good it's gonna stronger it's it's I think it's the strongest of the three persons labor of the strawberry is just a better flavor no the strawberry I like it I think I would like it more if it was just raspberry yeah if they need jasmine rice bran didn't have any strawberries we're very in it at all I think I would have liked it better if anything like that but I mean that there's still good bar there's still very good bars and and these have tons more than that blueberry apple cinnamon what I'm impressed with is not filling they all have you're not going dad yeah you thought that boy berry would have had a lot more flavor never mind the apple butter mm-hmm that's good but it's still not my strong point yeah they didn't they didn't go heavy on the cinnamon which I'm right about I really am I'm glad I didn't go heavy on the cinnamon you taste mainly apple and which is what you want to taste in a fruit bar I think if they've gone too heavy on the cinnamon kids probably wouldn't eat these these are great to know they'll good they don't want to I think I would skip is the blueberry one that's because the white flavor right I like them I like them enough to eat them like to finish this box but if I were to like shop at Harris Teeter yes I would not buy the blueberry just because they just don't have any plates like the wiring what's the point neat and if you can't taste it you know you want to be able to taste it the one that I would buy all the time would be the strawberry um either the stronger than Apple because I knew Kevin I would like the Apple I welcome yeah well like honestly they're all good yeah it's just that the blueberry had no didn't have a blood patch my only problem is is I would eat be incredibly fast because they're solved yes and that's why I go through spars about Nature Valley bar are $90 nutrigrain bars and I'll buy a box and then it reminds me once I start eating on why I don't bomb very often and that is the reason no put a piece of cake yes it's because you eat them so quickly that really you need to you need to to satisfy a satisfying and craving yeah they're just they're just very small they're very small they go very quickly I like them a lot but you need to really you need to take one with you that way you're not tempted to get another one so it makes it these are good you wouldn't want to eat just this for breakfast you would want to eat this it's like a mid-morning snack like about 10 o'clock before a lunch done or about three o'clock to get you through to dinner that's really when you would want to eat these this would not be a meal because they're there they just don't last that long but but they're very good bars and thank you to Jason for sending them I'll have a picture for you all at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "Cp-Dy2agoN4": "you know all those people who say they don't bake in the summer because they don't want to get their kitchens hot well they don't have to watch this video but I love baking in the summer because of all the great summer fruit today I'm taking some great summer fruit blueberries and making a crumble you may or may not remember when I made my peach crumble this recipe is very similar to that but I'm using blueberries instead six cups of blueberries 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar and a half teaspoon of coarse salt and to that add some lemon juice tablespoon or so would be good I usually do about a 1/2 a lemon depending on how juicy they are and then you need some kind of thickener I like to use cornstarch as a thickener for most of my summer fruit pies and cobblers and crumbles and crisps because the liquid thickens very clear flour can be a little bit cloudy so I choose cornstarch or tapioca for situations like this you're going to need a tablespoon plus two teaspoons otherwise known as 5 teaspoons stir together if you want to make this out of season you can use frozen I like to make it in season because well that's when the fruit is really really fantastic and that's when I get really excited about it and I love to go fruit picking so then you come home with barrels of fantastic perfectly ripe fruit and don't know what to do with it after you make all your jam make one of these this is an 8x8 baking dish basically like two and a half quarts set this aside for a sec on a baking sheet if you're going to bake it in the oven on a sheet in my mixer I have six tablespoons of room temp butter and to that I'm adding a quarter cup of light brown sugar packs you want a more intense flavor you can use dark brown sugar if you want a less intense flavor I guess you can use granulated sugar if your butter is super room temp because it's 100 degrees like it is in here today you will find that this happens SuperDuper quickly you can turn it off for just a sec at a 1/2 teaspoon of coarse salt and a cup of all-purpose flour I probably should have added the flower first and then the salsas now I feel like the salt is going to be sticking to the butter and sugar get everything combined then take it off of your mixer if you are using mixer you can also do this by hand give it a stir just to make sure everything is fully combined when there's small recipes sometimes butter or sugar sticks on the bottom of the bowl and you don't want that then you can top your crumble I like to sort of crumble evenly over the top and then take some pieces and sort of squish it together because I like to eat larger clumps of topping and I don't like it to all lose into the filling the filling already has a thickener in there so you don't want too much of this flowery stuff going in there even though it will help a little bit with thickening so this is a slightly lower ratio of thickener in the fruit itself because of the flour in the topping okay oak now you can get this into the oven and bake it at 375 loosely with foil and the bake until it's bubbling in the center and golden brown on top about 10 to 20 more minutes always looks good crumbles and crisps always going to be super popular with me you do need to let it cool just a little bit for the juices to thicken otherwise it'll be soup crumbles and crisps tend to be a little soupy ER than pie anyway that's why I like to serve it in a bowl with some ice cream of course that's perfectly tempered and just like that you've got the best summer dessert you're gonna have all year long go blueberry picking make this recipe today you you"}
