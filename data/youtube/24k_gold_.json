{"ahveldlcTpg": "what's up YouTube I'm going to talk about jewelry and 24 karat gold specifically if it's too soft if you can wear it and the real reason while jewelers say they don't sell 24 karat gold or 24 karat gold is too soft you can't wear it it's too soft that I hear that all the time so I'm going to tell you right now the real deal and the reason why they say that so let's look at some stuff this block it's called a block chain it's Chinese block chain and it's it right here and I'm gonna put some close-ups on it at the end of this video so you can see that actually that this is real okay as you can see okay as you can see this is very very durable I've had this for 15 years okay it's heavy I'll tell you it's like 150 grams it does not it does not bounce it's not soft it has a heavy weight on it okay on it and just it's it's it's a little bit uncomfortable to wear at night because I wear this thing and I'm just like dude this thing is like it's like a weight you know and you can see how close it is you look at closely and I'm gonna have some pictures with this microscopic camera I took of the end this is how you open it what you would do is you would just bend this forward and you would slide it out it's long enough the chin is about 24 22 or 24 inches so it's long enough where it just slides over my head but how if I you know if I had a bigger head I would just kind of just slide this out and just unhook it and put it back but and it has it has stamped on here Oh point nine nine nine nine nine nine which is 24 which is 24 karat gold it's the purest form of gold my rings also have that as well and I'm gonna show you the ring and then also going to show you 18 karat gold so the reason why jewelers will say 24 karat gold is too soft and as you can see this is not soft I'll try to I'll try to bend it right here I'll try to open it I can't it's freaking it's really hard it hurts cuz it's skinny and it's solid this piece of solid if it was hollow it would it would ease I could easily move this forward you don't want to get hollow pieces the reason why they tell you 24 karat gold is too soft to wear is because they lose money the pure the gold the more it costs them for the material that's the reason it also takes a certain amount of skill to do that if you need a good jeweler and you're in Boca Boca Raton Florida area you can find I can recommend you just go leave a comment below and I'll recommend you one who's he's a he's a casting guy you might pay some money to make it but it's fine it's will definitely worth it you're not gonna pay prices like what you would pay at Macy's or you what you would pay at you know sales or you know any other big big jewelry store they sell 10 karat gold now which is it's the weakest I'm gonna show you okay let me let me just show you what I'm talking about and take off my piece right here this is 18 karat gold okay alright you see the difference you see how how 18 karat gold is lighter and you see how the 24 karat gold is a lot darker I love jewelry okay and this is this is especially gold I love gold I have I have another Figaro or for Garo however the hell I want to you know you want to call it but I have another piece that's 24 karat gold that I had made because I literally could not find a Figaro that was 24 karat gold so I had one mate it's really long but it's uncomfortable the figural my piece is is the same size as this but same size as my as my bracelet kind of matches but it's uncomfortable aware man because it's  heavy it's really heavy you know it's solid pieces you want to make sure you get solid pieces because solid pieces are gonna last now I'm gonna show you the ring okay so this is the ring right here and I'm gonna try to bend it okay we're gonna bend it right oh this is so soft you can't you can't wear 24 karat gold cuz it's too soft right I'm doing all my my strength to friggin bend it and it's not bending why cuz it's solid it's about 30 grams of weight I don't have a scale I might do another video with me but it does have a little you know has a little scuff marks okay okay and if anybody thinking about you know I got that right here for protection anybody thinking about robbing but I'm going to show you a bullet on a 357 Magnum and the reason why I'm going to show you the bullet is because bullets have led in them and lead as far as the weight and the far is the softness of a lead bullet is the same thing is the same density pretty much the same density as 24 karat gold okay so you see how you see how like lead you could maybe write with it or what not you can't write on a piece of paper with 24 karat gold I mean it's just you know I'll take this ring and I try writing what you know writing on a piece of paper it's not gonna work okay so it's not that soft so don't believe the height I'm gonna here to set the record straight haters and haters can go ahead and hate this is the real deal stuff okay I'm telling you it is very very hard okay here I'm hitting it right there okay is it gonna leave a dent no is it gonna Bend no I'm sitting here hitting it now I got a marble you know I don't want to break my marble table but you know yeah I mean you're not it's not that soft where it's too soft to where that's complete the only reason they're telling you this is because they will not make us much money when they go ahead and sell you a 24 karat gold piece of jewelry and it's harder to make okay it's harder to make so don't believe that don't believe that I'm here to set the record straight if you have any questions you need a good jeweler in the book or tone area I can recommend you one he will make you a good piece you but you bring them the gold I had my piece made either give them a lot of gold because it that's another thing too if you let me just say this if you want to make a piece like this okay this is maybe got this piece probably weighs about 60 or 70 grams and if I want to make a piece like this in 24 karat gold that I've got to give them like oh maybe like double that as far as 24 karat gold late because because it's so dense and the more dense it is the one you know in order to get the same size it's gonna be a lot smaller I've got a I've got a up I've got up it so you know this that's that's the real deal thanks for watching guys and hopefully this educated you you can wear 24 karat gold pieces get another jeweler who says that you can", "dbNscL9cYx8": "hello welcome on back to my channel the other day in my last video i posted i had asked you all if you preferred i used proper models for these tutorials or if you preferred i use everyday people like you and i as models for these tutorials and most of the feedback i had gotten was to really just switch it up a bit every once in a while and i really appreciate that feedback because it allows me to create the best content as possible for you guys to enjoy so with me today i have a model by the name of andea she's absolutely stunning she's la based and i just created a really flawless golden look on her because i didn't want the makeup to take away from her natural beauty so if you want to learn how i created this look right here then keep on watching so to begin i'm using the fresh deep rose hydration face cream to prep the skin and i'm applying this with my beauty blender it's important to apply your moisturizer or primer everywhere where you'll be applying your foundation so not only the face itself but also the ears and under the jawline down the neck and of course the chest as well as you can see our model already has impeccable skin which is something i noticed too when i was going through her photos on instagram before we work together you'll have to check out her work i'll link her ig down below she is so gorgeous for foundation i'm using the giorgio armani luminous silk foundation and i chose to go with shade 10 because if you'll notice our model's skin complexion the perimeter of her face and neck is a bit deeper in tone than the center of her face and chest so when picking a shade i tried to meet somewhere in the middle so you'll notice that the shade is a little lighter than the jawline and forehead but a little darker than the under eye area and this will all balance out once i add the contour shade and for contour i'm actually going to use the same luminous silk foundation from giorgio armani but this is going to be in the shade 13.5 so this will help balance out the depth and her natural contours for this look as i said in my intro i really just wanted to emphasize on our model's natural beauty so i didn't want to go in with an extremely full coverage cream for contour and highlight like i usually would i'm sticking to using foundation for the contours because we can sheer it out a bit and make it appear like skin my main goal here is just to bring her natural tones back to life if i had only used that first foundation shade everything would read flat and plus that shade was too light for her full face especially for tan or deeper skin tone something to keep in mind is that there's usually more than one tone involved so just know that it's completely okay and normal to have to use more than one shade when applying your foundation and once i've applied that deeper foundation with a brush i'm going back to my beauty blender to blend it out also because of just different formulas most foundations set much quicker than a standard oil-based cream contour so it may help you to work in sections which is what i kind of did here i waited till i had blended out the perimeter of the face to apply the nose contour once we have everything blended out pretty much the way we like i'm going to begin highlighting to do so i'm using the too faced born this way concealer and this is in the shade butterscotch something our model india and i both saw eye to eye on is that we both love a bright under eye so we're doing just that now i'm not cheating on my other concealer from kevin aquan because you already know how much i love that one but i just wanted something a bit lighter in coverage for this look i'm applying this directly under the eyes with my concealer brush starting from the inner corner and fanning it outwards towards the temples what i love about highlighting with makeup is that i get to kind of create my own light source i'm creating the illusion that there's a bright soft light right in front of her which there kind of is but this is just complementing it and really amplifying it which is why i bring this up onto the center of the forehead and i shape the top of her brows with it and i bring it down the center of the nose cupid's bow and chin i even add a little bit directly under our cheek contour to sharpen it up a bit then with my beauty blender i start blending this out i really take my time with the blending process because while i want the highlight to be diffused and soft i don't want it to be so diffused that everything starts looking flat again and then we're just back to square one you know what i mean so i'm using a really soft touch with a blend here so i don't lose the structure of our placement alrighty so we have most of that concealer blended out and i'm bringing this up onto the eyelids to act as a primer for later on when we add shadows i like how everything blended out but i feel like i lost a little too much of that depth around the perimeter of her face specifically on the forehead but we'll deepen that up again once i pull out the bronzer but before we go into any kind of bronzer we need to set the face so i'm using the setting powder from anastasia beverly hills in the shade deep peach and with my powder puff i'm going to set the complete face with it per usual i pour that powder into the palm of my hand saturate my powder puff with it and then shake off the excess powder before pressing it onto the face a lot of you guys ask where i get my powder puffs from and they're really pretty basic i buy them in bulk at a beauty store here in los angeles called namies but you can find tons of options online or even through amazon okay so i know some of this footage can be a bit lengthy for some of you watching but i'm trying to keep the process as thorough as possible so i don't set unrealistic expectations of how long each step takes especially with the skin you want to put some time into it some some love some soul because skin is the most important step to me and usually the longest once we finish up the skin it'll all be uphill and quick from here i promise especially since we're doing a pretty subtle eye look but before we finish up i'm going to really focus on pressing the powder into the skin of the under eye area and i'm making sure to bring this powder up onto the sides of the nose right against that contour and this will help give the appearance of a super snatched nose which of course i love too to bronze i'm using the mocha mommy bronzer from fenty beauty and with a really diffused face brush i'm going to softly begin buffing this product into the skin concentrating it in the areas that i really want to be bronzed up like i had said a minute ago after i blended out the highlight i lost more depth in the perimeter of the face than i would have liked so i'm really relying on this bronzer to balance everything out again [Music] okay so once i've bronzed up the face i'm going to use the same bronzer on the eyelid with an eyeshadow blending brush i did say this eye look was going to be pretty simple so it really is going to be after i run that bronzer through the crease and connected to the nose contour i'm going to go in with my eye pencil from pat mcgrath labs in the shade black coffee and apply this onto the lash line and i'm being sure to wing this up and out just a little bit i love this deep brown shade pencil because it's much softer than a black pencil which is perfect for the vibe i'm going for i'm bringing this pencil all the way from the wing to the inner corner of the eye and then i bring it down to the lower lash line i'm only applying this to the outer corner of the bottom lash line though because i do end up diffusing it out with a blending brush then with a deep brown eyeshadow and a precise eyeshadow blending brush i'm running this through the crease to give it a little bit more depth and to open up the eye a little bit i don't quite remember which palette it was that i used the shadow from but really any standard deep brown eyeshadow you already own will do just fine next with my glitter drops from cover fx i'm applying this onto the back of my hand saturating my eyeshadow brush with it and then applying it onto the lid mainly in the center and the inner corner this is the perfect shade of golden reflect that i needed to complement indea's skin tone and that golden vibe that i'm trying to go for here and then with this urban decay eye pen i'm going to line her top lid once more this isn't totally necessary but i guess i was just trying to be extra i don't know but really i just wanted to make sure the band of the eyelash i ended up using looks a little bit more blended than it would without the black liner but as you can see i'm only using the smallest amount of this product okay so for brows i'm using a brow pomade from anastasia beverly hills in the shade dark brown and i'm lightly outlining the brow shape i want to create on our model with an angled liner brush i slowly start filling in that shape i created really focusing most of the pomade towards the outer half of the brow because i like a natural looking brow i'm going to ombre the front of the brow by taking a clean blending brush and buffing forward any of that dark brown pomade and this will give us a really beautiful gradient ombre effect and then with another angled liner brush i'm just running black eyeshadow through the ends of the brow to deepen the shade and to set the pomade not gonna lie the brows took me the longest here but i'm really happy with how they turned out and lastly i'm placing a little amount of our too faced concealer right under the brow to sharpen and clean it up for blush i'm using a blush highlight from sephora in the shade hot flush which is this really beautiful orangey copper shade that has some gorgeous reflect in it and i'm applying this onto the apples of the cheeks you'll notice i did the other brow off camera along with applied the lashes and mascara because well you know it's a pretty basic step so i did that off camera to save us a bit of time and now that we have the blush applied let's move on to highlighter to highlight i'm actually going back to the same golden highlighter from cover effects that i had used on the eyelids and i'm working this into the high point of the cheekbone this liquid highlighter looks so good in unison with that blush i used it's given me all that golden glow that i needed once i have that buffed into the cheeks i'm going to bring it down the center of the nose the cupid's bow and chin right before we started filming the outro shots i applied this highlighter as well onto her collarbones and shoulders to give her skin that ultra glow okay for lips this is going to be so so easy as i'm really trying to stick with a theme of simplicity with this look so to line the lips i'm going back to the foundation we had used to contour i love using the same contour shade i used on someone to create the perfect nude lip liner whenever you're in doubt of what's the perfect nude lip liner for you just use your contour you can't go wrong with that and plus i'm really trying to show you the diversity and products you already have without needing to go out and spend all those casual products to give you results you could have already achieved with products you already own [Music] to brighten up the center of the lip i'm dipping back into the concealer we had used to highlight our model's face and that's going to give us the perfect contrast all while creating the perfect nude lip now of course it wouldn't be my style of makeup if this lip wasn't glossy so i'm taking my kkw beauty lip gloss in the shade proud of you and i'm running this on the bottom and top lips this peachy gloss will really brighten up the lip while also making them super shiny and luscious [Music] and for the very last step i'm using the hooded beauty glow coco hydrating mist to set the face and that's how we turned our naturally stunning model into a 24 karat bar of gold [Music] there we have it kids i hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to hit that like button and subscribe to the channel you can also check out more from my work on my instagram at painted by spencer and until next time i'll see you soon", "U5V1jr7K1zs": "hey everybody welcome back to tech Odyssey so I'm back with another video and this time it's a look at something really interesting and if you've seen the title the thumbnail you're probably here to see this a gold-plated lightning charging cable so 24 karat gold actually anchor told me that they were making this a little while back and it was on the hush-hush level but they said they were gonna send me one and they didn't say they'd actually shipped it though so I went out to the mailbox today and lo and behold I had this so really cool really interesting it's the power line plus three cable so it's one of the normal cables with all the bells and whistles but this time plated in 24 karat gold so let's take a look at it that's pretty cool I think so before we do that though I do want to say if this is your first time stopping by the channel I appreciate you being here if you enjoy the video please hit the like and the subscribe button and little notification bell if you want updates on the latest videos now let's check out this cable [Music] [Applause] all right so here we are with the anchor 24 carats Lightning charging cable so yeah I never in my wildest dreams would have ever thought that anchor would put something together like this but they did and you can pick one up if you're interested for $99 but it's the same as a regular power line series cable it's got the braided nylon cord on it I mean it looks nice it's built well six foot long it's got this 24 karat gold plating and this box is really cool it opens up kind of like a clamshell design and here it says you're now a part of charging royalty I guess maybe you are I mean if there were such a thing as a crown in the charging cable world this one would have to be it and you know where with pride I guess because I mean not everyone on the street is rolling around with the 24 karat gold-plated charging cable but it looks really really nice I mean just taking this out of the box like this you can see it looks really good and it catches the light look sharp and let's go ahead and take this out of the box so we get a closer look at it but I was totally just enamored with this whenever I opened the boxes I just really couldn't believe my eyes like I said I knew they were making it and they told me but I wasn't expecting it to show up and the mail so it was a really really nice surprise and you can see it's got the anchor name on there you can see it on both of the ends of the cable so what you see here is you've got a USBC on one side and then the Lightning charging on the other so this is really designed to use with one of their charging cables are their their power bricks because they make the 18 watt power delivery bricks that have power delivery all that good stuff so also on here you've got this little leather a little strap thing so it's got the button that it fastens on to and that keeps it you know tied up and nice and neat if you want to roll it up it does have the twisty ties on there of course I would recommend taking them off but very pliable very easy to use and it's certified for thirty five thousand bins so you can bend the same to your heart's desire and it'll be perfectly fine and it comes with this leather carrying pouch as well so 100% total package gold looking braided nylon gold-plated ends on the charging cable it's just I mean it basically it's just the bee's knees I mean like I said I never would have imagined that they would have made something like this but it's totally cool and of course my kids are all trying to steal it from me because they saw that I have this gold-plated cable which I mean it doesn't charge any faster than a regular cable it's just that it it's just I mean I guess it's kind of sad a simple thing I mean Yolo if you really want one alright and here we are with the 24 karat charging cable so Lightning charging cable the USBC to go to the power brick and then you've got your Lightning charging port plugged there so six foot cable which is really nice I kind of would have been a little irritated if it was a three foot cable but this should reach pretty much whatever you need it to and it's got the nice braided nylon with the gold and the black mixed in together this is really nice this is some serious class and sophistication and yeah it's gonna cost you a pretty penny like I said it's $99 totally unnecessary I mean this is not something that you're just gonna go out and casually buy so you can have a fancy charging cable I mean if you want to if you really want to flex on somebody with the charging cable I guess you can do it with this but it's really nice too it also doubles as a gold bracelet so there we go so if you really don't want to charge your phone or just want to wear it around its like that then you can go that route as well but it's really neat I mean it's a nice novelty so if you just want something cool like this to have as a conversation piece on your desk or if it just really helps you sleep better at night knowing that you have a 24 karat charging cable plugging into your iPhone then I mean you can roll that way but seriously impressive I guess that you know anchor has been around a little while now they're really well known when it comes to making power charging accessories so I guess they just wanted to you know flex on the rest of the power cable market and they totally did I mean it soon as I heard about this I was like what you're making it 24 karat plated charging cable gold so there we have it so tada so anyway that's all I've got if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them down in the comment section I'll get back with you if you enjoy the video please hit the like and the subscribe button in

guys so today we'll be looking at gold oh well going neck like that is not home care gold 24-karat no metal mixed in this this is pure gold this is what it looks like it may look tiny but it really is it so then we're gonna lay it down and see the length let it set to zero we're gonna show you the grams how many grams of gold pure gold necklaces 320 that's a little over 10 ounces it's not like a normal going necklace it has block solid block they're not hollow and this is what you see it's a cool design it's a clasp and this is how big it is right now look big on camera but yeah that's definitely a lot bigger in person I'm gonna try to get this full shot the camera doesn't do it justice but trust me this is a very lengthy necklace look at the shine on that and just for comparison you know a lot of gold's that you get out there at Kay Jewelers and whatnot is 14-karat gold and it's a it's not as yellow and look at my bracelet right here this is 18k also my ring is 18k okay we don't get anything under 18 K this is 4 K it's just awful 14k is just we don't do it it's not really a good investment this this is this is a good investment right here this is about 17 grand tall 17 grand just necklace is worth about 17 grand with labor and you know this as gold is right now about 1500 per ounce 14k is really not worth anything when you go and try to get your return investment on it you you do you lose a lot of money I mean it's worth you know yeah next not really what you've spent for it and you're paying for labor really with it just to show you see that this is a quarter right here just to show you like just the clasp alone okay this is the size of a quarter look at these blocks look at these links this is unbelievable if you were to feel this right now this is a very heavy very heavy necklace let me just turn this on and just show you again show you again just look at this detail we're just gonna let that reset okay you could put it on the scale there you go 320 grams the good thing about this is gold as of definitely the past few years has been going up consistently so you're getting not only a money back but more with every year that goes by it's it's a gamble like most investments but we just wanted to show you what 24 karat gold pure gold looks like and again in comparison to 18k look at the color on that the difference okay the links close up just to show that chime the craftsmanship on this like I said before these blocks and this necklace are solid solid just thought not even Hollow look at this beautiful necklace this was actually around $17,000 yeah and we even add it if it was a little short but then we added some wings which was about some a lot of money but you know I don't so that's it we hope you enjoyed the video and if you

silver bars and in points and coins yep so yeah make sure you subscribe and like this video bye", "7Em9xJ2r2J0": "hey what's up guys so in this video I'm gonna be showing guys some different types of gold I don't have white gold this I don't really own one oh Jesus I just dropped my ring and also I don't have one of my favorite piece which is a solid gold chain that I have because I can't find it anywhere I've no idea where it went but I will find it soon so let me show you what I have bye hopefully I'll show you my solid gold ring hopefully in the next video if I find it runs about three thousand dollars is a beautiful change it's beautiful so um this one actually bent a little bit from from dropping I have to get that fixed up but yeah first thing we look at is one of these now I have no idea where these came from but the color is slightly gold got that golden hue right now I don't know what kind of gold it is it's fairly light but on movies as a comparison so here is actually here's a 14 karat bracelet I guess and it is 14k it also comes in a set with with one of these so we use this one as a comparison now you look at the color I'd say they're fairly similar but this one just seems a little bit darker do you guys see it like especially at the bottom right here the one on the right is a little bit more gold if I look at it like this it might be more coming right and so I know for sure that this one's a 14-karat gold and this one has to be either it's a gold-plated ring with some sort of filler metal in the middle or it's just some kind of some different type of a metal brass or something brass also has a golden color some of those some of the brass instruments are quite beautiful in color but here is the 14-karat now we'll take a look at 18 karat by the way this one's also let's see what this one says this one is also 14 karat so we'll look at the colors of the two 14 karats together and I say they're almost identical it's what I would say they are in fact almost identical so here is an 18 karat ring this is actually my father's wedding ring and the reason I know it's 18 karat besides from I allegedly him telling me that it's 18 karat it's the fact that it actually has 18 karat marking on it so know for sure that this is an 18 karat gold and I bought it from a he bought it from a trusted seller or dealer whatever and so if you look at the color you might notice that the one on the right is slightly more yellow it's a little bit the classic gold color if you look at the inside this one's a little bit darker and we're yellow now this is not a real diamond right now it used to be but my mom actually replaces it with the with some kind of glass or something and then she made a necklace out of it but we'll ignore that for now but at the bottom you can clearly see that this one is more yellow we'll get it in sides I might have to fix the lighting a little bit there you go so if you look at the inside it's hard to tell but if you look at the outside this one's clear they got more gold in it and so I know for sure that this one has to be 14 karat because I know it's real gold and even though it doesn't say besides that thing you have no idea what that says now look at 24 karat gold you notice something it's really gold it's more gold than you think it is like it's really yellow if you look at it from far you look at just look at the inside part look how awake and keep in mind that this is this ring is probably around 50 years old it's older than I am it's older than my parents it's actually owned by my grandfather who gave it to me because I mean he's quite old and he just told me like well I'm pretty I'm conscious in mobile I'm gonna give it to you in case I can't later so he gave it to me and the reason I know it's pure gold is that if you look in there it actually says 999 there let's see there are these two characters on the left and then three 9s following that and I mean this thing is really old you can see how scratched up it is from just everyday use even at the bottom but like even the inside imagine if this was not old like this like if this was new compared to the 18 gold care which is you know still quite a bit of gold you can clearly see the color difference I mean this one's just so much more resilient I don't have a 22 karat gold to compare with wait I might have it but I just couldn't find it we'll see hold on actually might I might show you that with the gold chain later and if you compare it to the 14-karat you can see that this one almost looks like a toy and if you compare it to the cheap kind all right this one doesn't even look gold right it almost looks like it's silver but it actually if I take this out of the picture you can clearly see that it has a gold hue but compared to this not even close so that's what a gold a pure gold looks like it's not in the power form but you can clearly see that it's more yellow than people think it is and we'll just put three rings side-by-side Oh see so pure gold 18 karat 14-karat they're all quite beautiful but um oops see how heavy this is is front heavy is crazy I might even do like one of these so you can see the color difference so pure gold 18k 14k 14k a carat is a lot more silver than 18 karat and 18 karat even though it's pretty close to 24 karat is still less gold than this and then like this so I hope you guys enjoyed this little video and yeah this was another 14 karat piece quite heavy and next video I promise you I'll show you my gold chain it's I really like that piece that thing has three times as much gold as this and this would run me about a thousand dollars around not exactly sure how much it is but the material itself is at least like a 500 to 700 so you know this was running about a thousand this not even close let me just look at the color difference yeah see you guys on the next video with my gold chain see you later", "Y6u2_0UmVJo": "Hey before we began today episode

I'm not hurt", "ah07nvtxxvo": "welcome back to our videos and this video we're going to talk about what's the difference between 10 karat 14-karat 18-karat 22 karat and 24 karat gold and how to test for each one what's the most accurate way and what are all the ways to test for if your build is real fake rhodium plated stainless steel whatever it is I'm gonna teach you how to test for so what is 10 karat 10-karat is 41.7% pure gold 14 karat is 58.5% pure gold and 18 karat is 75% pure gold 22 karat is 91.6% pure gold and pure gold is 99.999% pure gold which is 24 karat that's what everybody wants but almost nothing is manufactured in 24 karat because of how fragile is if you wanna Cuban link in 24 care we could probably do it that's no problem 22 karat humanly we can do it no problem anything else and 22 to 24 karat gets really hard to deal with but special occasions if you really want something for the right price you can make the most commercial gold or ten care and fourteen care that's what most people buy a few people buy 18 karats or if you want to be an exclusive class you get 18 care now how to test the dip TennCare 14-karat 18-karat 22 karat we currently use thermo scientific I taught myself to x-ray analyzer thus analyzer is to analyze gold so putting on the piece of gold this is the most accurate way to test gold everywhere so people who use and then it tells you it's 14 care this is fourteen point three two carat and fifty nine point six nine percent of gold so this piece right here is a little over the fifty eight point five percent of gold that has to be same thing will be with 10 karat so 10 karat chain this was coming out a loving care so as stamp ten carats coming out of loving care which is forty five point eight nine percent gold anything above and better it's a little less what I would say if your piece of gold once you tested with the x-ray machine if it's nine point nine zero or nine point eight five it's still passable s 10 karat well we try and do everything above so if it's 10 ish if it's 10 karat it should be 1001 or 10:02 should go above should never be less but it could happen it's all about the mixture and where you're testing it let's say you test it right here it could give 1025 so you test it over here you could give 995 and it's all how long you put it on there so if you put it on with the x-ray machine you put it on 10 seconds to do a 10-second test on it on a pave finger [Music] on an 11-second test they gave 41.5% nine point nine seven percent so it's point two off of ten care I mean if you test it anywhere else it will give the 10k and right there gave 41.96 so this is the most accurate way to test it it tells you exactly what it is now a lot of jewelers still use acid and rock method where you stretch a piece of jewelry before a little bit of acid on and it's got 10 karat 14-karat 18-karat gold acid and the if it goes away it's not girls at all if it smokes a little bit it's a little under care or it still could be the carrot with the acid you never know acid is the least accurate way to test a piece of jewelry sometimes they even throw the acid on top of the jewelry and if the jewelry even has a gold plating on it they'll be like oh it's not real and not true because every piece of doing is go play it if you see this piece right here has a completely different color than this this one's they're both solid gold which I just proved to you is completely different color than this but this one before I left the factory they play today this one is not plated listen they're not plated and there's also the gel pen method where it's like you put a little tablet you put gel on it and you press a button and it should type it as 10 or 14 karat sounds a little more accurate than the current acid method which everyone uses the reason people use if the rock and acid method is because it's cheapest way this is the most expensive way there's a way I recommend you get your jewelry tested if you have a Cuban link or any other piece of jewelry be it a $100 item to a $10,000 get it tough do it the next year machine somebody in your town has to have an x-ray machine they're not everywhere just yet because they still are expensive pieces they run about 20 to 25,000 dollars depending on the model that you get there's a thermo scientific there's olympus you can look them up online but check check your jewelry out if you have if your I know we got videos of other jewelry stores in the local area they they bring their jewelry over here to get it tested but they don't want to their cut their customers bring their jewelry over here to get a tested and it usually goes down to about 12 carat and is 14 we even have a video of one that's stamped 14 carat then it came out of levy care so yeah beware when you buy jewelry busts do it from somebody you trust somebody that can respond to any of the problems because if you spend money for a 14-karat piece and you get a 10 karat piece it's not nice or if you get a 12 carat piece it's not nice because you did pay that extra money for the 14-karat they'll be aware when you buy make sure it's everything's 100% guaranteed if not you can return it and get your money back I know a lot of jewelers started to knock it so stay tuned give us a like share and subscribe and let us know what you think [Music]", "cNFhN5DojWE":

relationships are important because i was having a vision i was watching youtube and i was watching people walking through the gold souks of dubai or going through like the diamond and jewelry districts of asia and seeing all this beautiful rich lustrous 22 and 24 karat gold jewelry some looks super regal and i'm like who wears that where would you ever see that here and how does that look and feel so luckily based on the relationships that i've built with different jewelry brands daniel jewelry and being one of them i reached out to them and i had i had the video concept and it was like i'll make it happen i have on hand some beautiful really exotic not super masculine pieces but rich in 22 and 24 karat gold let's roll my  music so i can put you on to this cause it's crazy [Music] i'm kind of a big deal i don't want to make this video too long i just want to give you guys perspective on 22 and 24 carat pure gold jewelry now this is not something that's super common at least here on the east coast you generally see people rocking the 18 max but mostly 14 karat and some 10 carat gold now these are a few pieces that are slightly femme but it's all about the gold content and looking at that rich lustrous color and for comparison's sake i got my 14 carat gold bracelet on deck so we can hold some items side by side so you can see how drastic 24 karat gold is versus 14 carat gold let me show you some of these wild items this is definitely something out of a bollywood movie or maybe a middle eastern wedding because this is wild look how rich in 24k this is just look at the beauty of this piece and the detail in it now this is somewhere between 22 and 24 karat gold i don't believe this has a stamping on it not one that i can see but you can clearly tell by the tone of it it's definitely over 22 karat gold but just look at just that color tone this can either be some sort of necklace like if you're singing at the wedding of coming to america [Music] or it could be like a head garb and this could be some fire that a hipster in brooklyn be wearing be like yo what's poppin b now this one is 22 carat for sure and this is more this channel speed i don't know what type of link this is this looks like something i would call maybe like a dragon link this looks like 22 karat gold more towards the japanese or chinese or asian market which middle eastern is asian also but you know what the i'm saying get this rich 22 karat gold color versus 14k 14 carat 22 carat [Music] 14 22. jesus and i know a lot of people be thrown off by that rng color because it's not something that we're accustomed to and just like we're not accustomed to this in dubai they see 14 karat gold they're like peasant now look at these chains with the asian flow on it fan [Music] this has like a gold leaf type pamp on it i'm assuming this is the year of the wrap because there's a rat on it i don't know if you guys can see but i could definitely do neck profile with these joints for sure let's see how this 22 plus carrot joint look on that neck neck profile [Music] this is actually a fly piece again this high concentration of that solid rich lusty gold color is not one that i would normally rock because i can't afford it somebody could get used to this type of show i'm feeling type regal right now i'm about to throw on some silk threaded robes and right on the back of camels and while i'm at it let me throw this piece on too oh feeling feeling like royalty let's see what else we got this is just another feminine piece but it's more about the intricacy and the detail this is literally very fragile gold leaf on each one i don't know if you can see the details with the lens i apologize in advance but look at the detail on this gold leaf it's pretty incredible and i'm assuming this might be another head wrap type thing like the 24 karat gold rambo or maybe a choker yeah no we're not doing that the detail in the beauty and the person who buys 24 karat gold in this type with all the detail and intricacies that it really has in between like i wish you guys can really see the crazy detail that's on this and the way that this gold feathers out it's just gorgeous it's definitely  beautiful and there's some kind of stamping here let me see what this says but there the detail work is remarkable now this is not made by daniel jewelry inc to my knowledge this is just something that he had in that he's going to be making another piece as far as trading is concerned i believe but he was gracious enough to take my credit card as a deposit to hold on to all this and i need to get those funds released immediately so i just wanted to show you guys a different perspective on really really crazy beautiful rich 22 plus carat gold and just show you how depressing sometimes this rich color looks versus like anything under 18k i could do what my wallet could do but just giving you some comparison i'm feeling  rigor and who knows maybe one day

bars 24k from gold scraps sometimes you may want to make some extra money by refining your own gold at home or you may be a jeweler who wants to refined gold in-house there are multiple ways to refine gold on a small scale as long as you take appropriate safety measures this article will teach you to refine gold using the aqua regia method start by reducing the size of gold to smaller melt gold pour gold while melting through a two millimeters sieve into the water reducing the size of gold to smaller will help in the process of aqua regia to make gold into the solution more quickly [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] aqua regia is composed of two chemical substances one nitric acid three hydrochloric acid mixed together ratio between gold alloy and acid aqua regia gold alloy 50 grams using acid aqua regia 200 milliliters from my experiment when gold alloy was made into a solution at a temperature of 90 Celsius to reach saturation point fit should neutralize easy to make gold precipitation operational safety wear the protective clothing could include gloves protective eyewear a mask a long-sleeved shirt and long pants take precautions to avoid exposure by the principle roots that is contact with skin and ice in elation and ingestion proper ventilation is required this precipitant has a very strong pungent as an odor and is corrosive [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you sodium metabisulfite precipitate gold out of a aqua regia solution you will get gold sludge powder looks like mud sodium metabisulfite also known as sodium bisulfite is an affordable and effective selective precipitant for gold this chemical can recover up to 99.95% of pure gold when the precipitated gold is thoroughly rinsed it works well even at room temperature I will show you the strange change of gold mud use sodium mixed with water slowly added to the gold solution you will see the formation of gold mud [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] precipitated gold particles vary in size but tend to be small and flow easily in the rinse water for this reason special care must be taken to avoid accidentally pouring off gold with the rent water use hot water to clean the sludge powder looks

to be eating this slice of pizza today but before I just dive in and eat the world's first 24 karat gold slice of pizza I need to go out into this world and see if I can buy one so I set off on the internet to search for restaurants that will sell me this gold pizza the first thing I came across was the Hard Rock Cafe selling a gold burger now this thing just had a little bit on the patty and they were charging 75 dollars for it it wasn't what I was looking for so I kept searching then mr. beast posted a video about a seventy thousand dollar golden pizza and I thought he found it but as I look closely there really wasn't that much gold on the pizza and I came to the conclusion I'm gonna have to do this myself so I ordered hundreds of dollars worth of gold off the internet and here is what I got I got it in a few different forms I got some gold flakes I got a bunch of gold leaf and I got gold dust I got it basically in every kind of form all of the gold that I bought is 24 karat so of course cuz this was not a cheap supplier at all and I got a lot of it so you guys get a better understanding of exactly how this pizzas gonna work let me unbox some of this gold see you guys you can see exactly what it looks like it's pretty cool stuff I got my fancy white gloves so I can handle the expensive gold so here's one of the smallest jars right here this is 24 karat pure gold leaf in here so let's open this up and be very careful with this stuff check this out guys this is 24 karat pure gold in there so every little piece definitely counts so we don't want to waste any of it even the stuff that got stuck to the lid so I got some of those I also got some larger pieces this is the large sheets of gold leaf again this is 24 karat gold as well and it's also edible gold is edible believe it or not even though it's a pure metal it's completely nonreactive with your body so it just passes right through you so in here it looks like a little sticky pad like notepad but in fact there is gold inside here look that is a full sheet of gold guys and so we're going to be using these gold sheets and also the gold leaf in all the different ways to cover this entire slice of pizza and also make a few other things as well alright guys I think the pizza is here perfect timing alright pizza all right here's your pizza great thank you yeah have a good day you got all the pizza that we need let's go upstairs and the let's do this thing alright I got the pizza well is what are you doing here what are you doing I'm making the world's first 24 karat gold pizza and so I ordered a bunch of pizza I got Domino's and Pizza Hut ern\u00f5 Domino's and Papa John's so we have a bunch of different pizzas to choose from some of these will just be our simple $1 sites but also we are going to select one of these slices maybe this one to turn into our 24 karat gold slice I don't know we should pick a piece a bigger piece or a smaller piece baby so which one of these looks worthy enough to be turned into gold this one this one that seems so big I said look that one's more pretty okay this one let's be able my pizza looks like another one we got it make sure this is a very important selection because we're gonna literally oh that one looks clean a lot of surface area this one this one this one we have a lot of ones to choose from but we have to choose very carefully I will pull it out let's see be very careful this is gonna be gold it's really literally it's like the Midas touch you touch it it turns to gold that one you're gonna turn that one to gol you think alright was we picked our slice of pizza and now we are going to turn it into the 24 karat gold pizza by covering it with these gold flakes I think the best way is gonna be starting with the gold leaf and we're gonna need the little tongs for this Luis so they're like little chopsticks oh you're gonna be very careful with this stuff oh my gosh this is a disaster oh I have like little pieces of gold on my finger that's probably like $10 so far so good good we have a pretty actually it came out pretty well did a covered a lot of the pizza so liz is now trying one where she's very carefully taking a sheet of 24 karat gold and she is going to try to cover the pizza with it this is so much pressure isn't it hard careful careful go for the tip a little bit very gentle oh my gosh I don't know how much each of these pieces of gold is worth but gold is not cheap guys so good to be very careful and we're already getting some crumbs and scraps all over the place all right careful I mean this is actually working quite well you're getting it like double thick on some of these pieces I know that looks so cool you got to do the crust no I also came across to the whole thing yeah of course so we also got these smaller ones too this is also 24 karat gold 99.99% pure gold look at how intricate where did you get all this stuff you can get anything you want on the internet here guys Liz with another piece of gold that looks pretty good oh good ones are thicker there we go got it beautiful so the gold leaf doesn't stick to the crust as well because it's just dry it doesn't have like any moisture on it or anything that's like sticky but the gold leaf needs something sticky for it to stick so we're gonna try brushing on a little bit of honey all under the crust to see if that's gonna be like I mean this is a very expensive slice of pizza so this is all this is gonna work really well all right so we got a little bit of gold on this side of the crust this is when I grab another piece rich [Music] yeah and so guys as I was saying the reason why gold is edible if it's pure gold like this is because it doesn't react with anything your body so it passes straight through you in your mouth but also out the other end and so once this pizza is done it's gonna be a very expensive number two so guys this is the world's first completely covered in 24 karat gold pizza we have enough gold to make a bunch other stuffs I think we should do another slice and we should do some dessert pieces as well and also make some 24 karat gold water [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] now that we got our gold slice of pizza and breadsticks and dessert it's now time for our last step wishes some a 24 karat gold water because there's no way I'm eating gold pizza without gold water so I'm gonna pour myself a couple of glasses so that here's how I plan on making the gold water I'm just gonna add gold to water and hopefully it mixes if it doesn't I think I'm gonna try putting in a blender and see if we can blend the gold into there to make like sparkly gold water I've never seen this before so it may or may not work so here we have the 24 karat pure gold leaf and we're just gonna do I think an entire bottle for one glass we're gonna go crazy this is gonna be very expensive but let's do that Oh interesting look how it sticks to the water whoa it like I don't mind you know hydro did wow that's so cool maybe that's pretty interesting it like doesn't want to get wet that's a lot of gold I use the entire bottle of this thing we're gonna take these two gold waters gonna put this water in the blender and blend it and see if you can get something a little bit better okay for karat gold oh my gosh that looks so cool already okay let's try it oh that was one little touch oh my gosh it looks like a snow globe this is gold water which I blend it more oh this is kind of ridiculous I mean it's literally gold water that's literally 24 karat gold water right there probably the most expensive water in the world it's basically liquid gold look at how good this looks I could eat it right now and it actually kind of evolved to us making a lot more than a single piece of pizza we do over 1 dollar piece of pizza and we also have our 24 karat gold ones we also have a few other things as well so I'm gonna go down and grab stove and we're gonna eat this together and we're gonna see how it tastes and also get his reaction cuz he doesn't know what we're doing up here so let's go down and let's go grab stove I am hungry actually well perfect I've been working on a meal for us to try okay let me let me see what's going on I mean you've been up there for a while I've been yeah I've been up there Liz's up there working hard unfortunately Liz's vegan so she can't eat any of this delicious food Oh food yeah this is a full meal so I mean just a fight like we have a full meal Fiat ride oh boy to get your reaction all right so I introduce you okay to my very own restaurant yeah 24 karat gold restaurant let's go Oh hold on 24 karat gold now you here I'm not yours apart tough real quick oh oh no you didn't though oh my goodness this is actual gold everything you see here is a real 24 karat gold even the water even though oh we got gold everything Oh everything else that's gold is so and it's also edible because it's pure gold pure gold and we got would have really liked more flakes to season it if you're feeling you know rich taste if I'm feeling I think I'm gonna have to sprinkle a bit more is looking a little too too cheap for me it doesn't look edible are you sure 100% edible I had to do my research because this was just too good to be true but we did it we pulled off and now it is time for us to eat it so let's get started with the $1 Pizza versus 24 karat gold pieces do it do it all right so thank you for coming to the 24 karat gold restaurant Liz and I worked very hard making all these things so now guys we are going to officially do the $1 pizza slice versus the 24 karat gold pizza slices we have a lot of different gold things to tries to stove we're gonna start by taking a bite of the $1 visas or $1 Domino's Pizza [Music] something though I couldn't imagine what [Laughter] I mean it would be better made those microwaves or something there's something yeah okay well anyway just $1 Pizza guys it is actually pretty good but we're moving on to the big boy the 24 karat gold guys like I said this is all 100% real 24 karat gold on all of the stuff that we use including the water I think before we dig into the pizza we should start with the appetizers that's right so we got these guys so Liz made these these are little bread bites with gold on half of it so you're able to grab it the gold is that smart so this is it guys we're gonna try our first ever gold coated food 24 karat gold bread balls earth this might be the first breadsticks yeah I think it's probably the first and most expensive breadstick in the world let's try it ready 3 2 1 mmm whoa I can feel the texture of it I mean this one I will say it's got you can take those like the metallic taste I have gold flakes on your teeth good and on your lip yeah I mean I I've always wanted a gold grill so yes because soon as it hit my tongue it felt like there was like something wrapping around the food that was like a bag yeah yeah these are also just breadsticks but there's more gold on these ones than the last okay no you're getting gold and we're getting gold on our fingers so let's try this one and try our second gold experience mmm taste of gold you take the bowl I mean it's like I've ever bitten an aluminum foil she doesn't mean I don't and you're not supposed to but kind of reminds me of that can I have in this light and the slightest kind of way but I gotta say all this food is quite salty so I need to quench my thirst I'm gonna stir it a little bit just love to taste the gold in my mouth it it's like it is kind of like the aluminum foil a little bit so we're gonna wash it down with some more gold yeah Cheers excuse no I'm sure if I could taste it I can taste the high-quality it is a five times filtered water I put some good water in here but uh the amount of gold I put in this is like I don't want to know how many dollars it is person all right so guys Ryan's coming in for this last breadstick just pick it up and go it's literally 24 karat I have to ask does the gold add any flavor to it do you think I want you I want you to tell us because Oh a little bit of gold in your lips already if you lick your lips it's like 20 bucks oh you have a little piece of yours don't what yeah you gotta save it yeah let that last anybody's worth it well then I got your fingers you got gold

totally different I never did anything like this and I loved it and let me know if we should put this gold on other foods or other things because this was a lot of fun and I'm getting better handling the gold - comment down below what you think we'll see you guys on the next vlog bye [Music]", "1ZNLtJSaEig": "so we're gonna be talking about gold purity with these 22 karat gold chains okay so first and foremost let's look at these chains these are very rare chains because they're all 22 karat I ordered them personally does not that many in the industry that I like that and this is the last of it I don't think there's any 22 karat like it around so if anybody wants that I'm gonna make a special offer on these particular chains what is 22 karat mean alright we're gonna really define that exactly what it means because it's gold purity it's gram weight it's a variety of different economic factors associated with it I'm gonna clear everything up for anybody who's really interested in understanding and they're gonna understand it with a comparison between 10 karat and 14 karat and so on so forth first and foremost 24 karat let's look at this simple gold purity chart 24 karat is twenty four out of twenty four parts pure gold that's a hundred percent 22 karat is twenty two at a twenty four parts pure gold that's ninety one point sixty six percent pure gold okay ninety-one point sixty six percent alright that's is 22 karat 22 out of 24 alright it's a very very simple math okay you divide 22 by 24 you're gonna get ninety one point sixty six and that is the purity of the chain 14 karat alright fourteen parts pure gold at a twenty four so it's fourteen divided by 24 is gonna be 58 point 33 pure that's about 50 percent 10 karat gold is under 50 percent around 46 from what I remember 46 percent pure gold would they have to double check that it might be forty five or forty two I'm not sure so I like the 22 carat of pure gold because it's a lot of gold per gram in the chain it's very very powerful it's a very very deep deep yellow it has a lot of factors to it we're gonna discuss all those factors I'm gonna explain it first and foremost let's take a look at three chains one of these chains is 22-karat a 14-carat and a 10-carat so let's take a close look and see if you guys can use your eyes to deduce by the color let me spread them up a bit so you guys can take a look so where's the 22 carat chain is it on the right side the left side of the centre where's the 10 carat is on the left side the right side use your eyes because when you're using your eyes you're gonna be able to remember that and you're gonna be able to identify it later on in life okay so let's take a second look and I'll identify it for you this time okay 10 carat right here this is the 10 22 in the center 14 on the right these are all exactly the same change this is called a Franco link it's a semi hollow link all right the gold is solid so you gotta understand you hear the word Hollow and see some people get confused there's nothing to be confused about the gold is solid the link is a little bit hollow on the inside semi-hollow so it gives it a little bit more volume alright because the solid franco's are gonna be tighter it's gonna be super heavy you're not gonna get a lot of volume so there's nothing to do with the value of it begin then we're gonna describe exactly how that works first and foremost let's take a look at the 10 carat remember these are all the exact same length is about 32 inches or 34 inches and 5 millimeter Franco chains okay so let's weigh them out and let's see what's going on on the inside let's turn on the scale let's start with the 10 carat okay throw it on the scale 30 7.56 55 grams okay so what is the exact same chain weigh in 14k okay in 14k it weighs 42 point 32 five grams heavier five grams heavier but what's the gold purity increase it's five grams heavier in the total weight all right well we have to think about that and now we have the same chain in 22 K let's take a look at this one 66 so that's even 20 grams heavier alright that's a more tougher link this is a more tougher link it's an Italian link it's manufactured an extremely uh really elite way out of a really powerful expensive machines and then you have to order a couple of kilos in order to get 22 K that's why nobody really orders it I put place the order and this is what's left of but now let's discuss the purity of it okay so we have this 14 karat gold chain right here same one that was a roughly 40 grams and this one is 66 grams same exact thing okay but what's the gold purity here well how do we get the gold purity alright so we have 66 grams times the purity of the the the metal point nine one six six is going to equal sixty grams of pure gold here from the sixty six that of the total weight alright alright so so so keep that in mind that's the ninety one percent it's almost pure now 14k 14k okay 14k is gonna be 58 point 33 that's way this one more time forty two point thirty three times point five 833 the gold weight the pure gold weight is twenty four point sixty eight that's the pure gold weight okay so you got 60 grams of pure gold here twenty four of pure gold here okay that's the difference that's a big big difference and it's a big big difference in price but I'm going to offer a special special price on these for people that are watching this video because the people are watching this video of my friends now if you're watching this video in 2022 that offers not available okay I don't know what the price of gold is gonna be there but there ain't gonna be what I'm gonna be offering I'm gonna be offering sixty five dollars a gram because I bought these not a lower price if you watch the videos you understand what I'm talking about I can melt them and I could turn a profit now I was about to do that in order a bunch of 10k 14k but I decided not to and I wanted to make a video about purity and offer to you guys cuz you're my friends right they're my friends because you watch it you comment your you're being enlightened you understanding what it is and I want to share that information with you guys I want you to you know be enlightened consumers because there's a lot of consumers here that don't know what's going on and they're their get duped and I don't like that and I don't like doing business like that okay one thing comes into mind I just want to share an experience with you young man came over to the jewelry shop couple years back he had $300 to spend and you really really wanted something and he was looking at a pair of earrings that cost me $325 I said you know what man is good guy twenty-five dollars out of my pocket whatever take it for the three hundred you know you can have it he's like uh-uh whatever he left he didn't buy it I'm like uh thank you thank you for not uh you know not buying it cuz you know whatever I didn't want to lose it twenty-five but I said you can have it if you want it he comes back like a couple hours later I don't know why he came back but he I'm like so would you buy would you purchase he went to the jewelry store the rappers rap about that it did it did it did it did it that there's all that [ __ ] and he came back with a plastic bracelet on a rope okay that cost ten dollars that's what he spent his $300 on and I'm like yo man you're a real [ __ ] I'm thinking in my head I'm sitting here willing to lose money but you went to go get it because they did it well you know what if you're in one of those people stop watching the video unsubscribe unfollow whatever it is and get the [ __ ] out of here because I don't got time for that dumb mentality when someone's willing to do something for you and do fair business and you go with the dumb [ __ ] somewhere because he's telling you some stupid [ __ ] and you want to feel like you're jay-z and get the [ __ ] away from me okay alright that's a little rhyme for you so that's that so now you have four going back to the chains okay so so you'd understand the purity and I'm telling you what's going on 60 grams of pure gold here 24 here alright this is the link that I personally owned I wear it on my wrist because I like to travel with it and I like to have my pure gold with me at any time if I'm ever in a situation I have my 14-karat okay I have my 18 karat as well and I collect links but I really like my 22-karat it's a puffed-up link it's the right weight and if I ever need to liquidate cache if my lost my wallet and I'm somewhere I'll be able to find the jewelry store or a pawn shop or a refinery I don't care if I'm in Brazil or wherever the hell I'm at and be able to get cash and get the hell out of the situation and with the more purity I don't have to wear a monster-sized chain okay to get the the gram weight that I want all right the pure gold gram weight that I want I can have it in 91% nice and light on my wrist okay in 14k the same amount the purity would probably be a hundred grams or something like that you know it's not the same so that is why these I'm offering these chains there's only a few left I'm going to show you some of these exotic links that are available here all right so this is a very very rare link some of these this is a solid link right here okay this is a beautiful solid link it's a half Miami chain half Franco chain okay so it's half flat it's like a rectangular this is like a modified Figaro rope chain there's a couple of them if you want to purchase any of them you would have to call the number that I'm providing all right this is going to be a specific representative that works at the firm they're gonna be able to get you any one of these chains sixty-five dollars a gram I'm gonna get rid of them and that's it they're very rare very expensive never gonna get them again gold prices fluctuating a lot is happening here is your gold purity chart okay remember there's labor involved in these chains there's a lot of other factors involved in these chains that I could make you guys aware of but my job is to give you the best information that I can and offer you an enlightened way of purchasing is there a profit margin on this yes you know in order to pay this light bill I have to turn a profit but it's the cheapest possible rock-bottom price I could do and you wouldn't be able to even get the same price from the manufacturers that have the factories in Italy because they don't sell one change so that's where you're at I'm giving you the best possible price on anything I can't Rex when I see calm that's a change right now I'm in the mezzanine in the 64 Exchange our shop is right out there if you want to visit you could come out we'll come over here I'm personally inviting you we're gonna have these chains on deck all right if you want to get the 22 K or I want to shop around for that and that's pretty much it so I appreciate you guys I'm reading the comments we're going to be enlightening more 22 karat gold a really great investment you know how to calculate your gold purity if you watched all of my videos you could combine all that information and you could know a lot but I'm leaving that up to you I can't spell out everything in ABCs and one two threes for everybody alright I'm strategically deploying information to consumers so for specific reasons alright I could tell you even more information I could tell you about the diamond district a lot of different things and maybe one day I will but right now I'm telling you this so keep an eye out do me a favor tag your friends that don't know [ __ ] about anything so they could learn a little bit about something and you know I appreciate you guys and hope you found it informative",

Chandler they subscribe Schulman where is it so MIT they subscribe yeah do it", "Yb7j0kXCCx4": "hello there YouTube thought I would do a quick video on my customer experience with the company called many they offer 24 karat jewelry both gold and platinum I have yet to buy any platinum from them but yeah you know after my experience with them I just might so this is the product that I got which is the men a classic flat band this is a size 12 of the classic flat band so as you can see I've already unboxed it I've actually had this for mm-hmm about a month now I've worn it so if you see any scratches dings or dents that would be the product of daily 24/7 wear since the date that it was delivered to me I love it it's it's frankly beautiful it's a very nice looking piece I have yet to take this to my local coin shop to have them XRF gun test this or x-ray gun it but from what I've read on many posts they stand up to that test I might still do that just for my own mentality peace of mind sake but I you know you don't get to be a publicly traded company by selling tungsten or anything fake so I imagine that this is 24 karat you can see on the back that it does say men a to 4 K however there was a little bit of information that I was not able to find online a lot not many people will report what their products were listed to weight and what they actually weighed when they got them or you know when they ordered the product how long it took for it to process ship and receive so I'm going to give you guys all that and nation long story short I'll go over the basics for mine I was ordered late Sunday night on 5:10 and it arrived five days later 4 p.m. by FedEx it shipped two days before that you get free two-day shipping with orders over 100 200 something like that I was listed as 12.5 to grams but it actually weighed twelve point three grams the certificate that they gave me says twelve point three seven so maybe my scale is optimistic or maybe there's this pessimistic but I paid a was a value of nine hundred and seventy one dollars and sixty cents that I paid via Bitcoin though so I paid point one one four three two two Bitcoin and that was what it was at eight point five K we are currently at nine point four K for bitcoins so I could have held out a bit longer but a lot of that Bitcoin I had purchased below six point five K so really almost all the premium of this gold was covered by simply the appreciation of the Bitcoin that I bought that ends up being worth that much troy ounces and that much is a gold content of 688 fifty-eight over all pros and cons of the ring itself I took the liberty of writing this down because I don't think enough people mention this or there's not many videos I think there's only one of another person reviewing a men a ring but the cons it is not wedding band quality this is not designed I don't think it was meant to be a wedding band quality ring when you're working with 24 karat jewelry you know it's gonna Bend you know it's gonna warp why would you spend that much time my goodness you can hear that you can why would you spend the time making a ring be perfect shape perfect dimensions when because it's 24 karat gold it is gonna bend and warp a bit throughout time so I understand why they might not put that much effort into the you know presentation or the overall product I guess but I don't know if the camera shows it it is quite literally thinner in some places and thicker and others and when it's thinner it is thicker width wise and when it's thicker height wise it's thinner width wise so a little bit inconsistent you know there's places on the ring where it is it's wider just and then on the other side of the ring it's thinner so no yeah you know take what you can get and you're paying not that much of a premium you know jewelry has especially in the US for us jewelry the premium on gold is often much much more than then many offers and that's one of my pros they're decently low premium for for us jewelry another Pro you're obviously getting pure gold another Pro for me I was able to pay with Bitcoin that's big that's big for me cons in consistent thickness not that I don't still love the product and I still happy to have 24 karat gold and that's ultimately why I bought this so if you're looking for a flawless wedding band I recommend getting something that's maybe 22 maybe 18 karat gold that's designed to be a wedding band I don't know if these are really quite that category the logo is not what it looks like in the picture on the website in the picture on the website it's this big fat many accent over the e to 4 K font and it just does not like that in real life here not that that's a huge deal at all but I'm surprised that a website doesn't include at least one picture of what the actual ring looks like in person almost all of the pictures on men a appear to be very very nice high-resolution renderings graphic artist renderings of what the ring or product would look like in real life and they're not pictures of what is gonna get shipped to you in the mail and I find that strange so that is my overall experience with them I also did a quick a quick calculation for if you were to have a ring of this shape a cylindrical shape with a cylindrical cutout in the middle easy to calculate because that's simply the volume of a cylinder minus the volume of the internal cylinder so after a bit of metric adjustments four millimeters to centimeters and a little bit of factorization of the formula you get this equation which basically means that you can calculate if you have a ring that many claims is five millimeters of height two millimeters and with a US size 12 ring averages from a bunch of different sources at twenty one point four five millimeters comes out at if the ring were a perfect cylinder shape and the exact density of 19 point three grams per cubic centimeter your ring should weigh fourteen point to one grams now obviously it's not a perfect cylinder it's rounded it's warped it's thinner in some places it's it's probably not a full two millimeters thick and I doubt it's a full five millimeters high because the numbers simply don't support that so men a I appreciate you telling us pretty specifically how much it's gonna weigh because you are within 0.1 to 0.1 five grams of what you said it would which is very little but I mean that's 17 dollars worth of gold right now so good on you for telling us the grams but your specifications do not quite match what the ring should actually weigh if however you slightly round or change those numbers to be a ring size of twenty one point for a width of one point eight millimeters instead of to a height of four point eight millimeters instead of five and a density of nineteen point three grams per cubic centimeters you can make the equation weigh weathering actually ways so what up with that many but overall I would say three and a half four stars on a mini this is the certificate of authenticity that it comes with says twelve point three seven grams the invoice and I blacked out information from of course showing what was paid the box packaging smaller box with the fanciful felt anyways thanks for listening thanks for watching this has been my review of the men a classic flat band 24 karat gold ring huge fan my next go-to might actually be a company called serif I say RRIF haven't seen too many reviews of them so if I do end up buying I will be sure to upload a video of whatever I get from them they also sell 24 karat bands they don't seem to sell any 24 karat flat bands in this style but they do have some 24 well not 24k they have some platinum 950 bands that I'm interested in 950 is about the lost purity of some jewelry that I'll go to anyways thanks for watching", "2V9wJfy1UAI": "hey guys so Stacy I think really interesting and really really cool gold basically gold so um this is a syrup I have ordered of Abaddon basically it's a

today so yes we are checking out a genuine set of 24 karat gold guitar strings we're gonna compare these up against a lowly set of d'addario's and find out if that sweet sweet gold tone is worth it or not now if you guys haven't subscribed to the channel be sure to do so you can click on the bell to be notified when new videos become available other than that let's check these things out now to be completely honest I'm not a fancy string kind of guy this is my jam right here 25 sets of basic Daddario EXL 110s we've got 25 sets of strings in the box so you're never running to the store when you break a string and you know 400 bucks us 25 sets of strings we're talking about 4 bucks a set so really affordable now in contrast we've got the Optima 24 karat gold strings and these guys by the time I got them to my house was about 35 bucks Canadian so somewhere around 30 bucks us now of course if you didn't have to pay shipping and you could find them at your local store probably somewhere around 25 bucks so we're talking about four or five sets of d'addario's versus one set of the gold Optimas but hey I'm willing to take one for the team let's try these things out and see how they compare to the basic d'addario's all right so let's unbox these things find out what all the fuss is about so we've got a set of 10 246 gauge strings just like our d'addario's so that'll make for an interesting comparison let's pull these out and take a look Oh check that out a bright gold looks super cool take a few out and just take a look here now I think the concept behind the gold is that you're never gonna have tarnishing strings let's try one of the thinner strings oh yeah so even the thin strings are gold as well look super cool let's put them on a guitar see what it sounds like alright so we've got our cheap strings we've got our expensive strings and I've got my American professional strat here this is sienna sunburst with the rosewood fingerboard I will link to it in the video description below so what I'm gonna do is record five different clips with this strat and then I'm going to replace the strings do the same five clips so I'm gonna record I'll be back all right you guys I'm back and I just finished recording five short clips with our cheap d'addario strings and I've strung up the strat with our very expensive Optima 24 karat gold strings so I'll take a few shots for you guys so you can really see what they look like because to be honest they are quite beautiful I find it really striking up against the rosewood fingerboard and overall just look very custom and very cool now I think that the whole point of the coating is to resist tarnishing and to add longevity but we can't really test that today in a video what we can test is what the tone is like so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna record five of the same clips with the gold strings and we'll see what the difference is now before I play the clips for you guys I think we ought to do a blind test I don't want you guys seeing these gold strings and forming an opinion one way or the other let's use our ears I'm gonna mix and match the order so you never know which guitar is coming first and just see which set you like the best [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right you guys so that was their neck pickup playing some clean and classic Fender e-type bluestones guitar number one was the cheap strings guitar number two or the gold strings I could definitely hear some differences we'll talk about that when we get to the end of our clips but for now let's try another classic fender tone in position four we'll see how each you know string set handles that classic Fender quack let's take a listen [Music] all right in position for guitar number one was the gold strings and guitar number two were our cheap strings let's go on to position three and play some clean and pristine arpeggios [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so guitar number one where the gold strings and guitar number two where the cheap d'addario's let's go on to position two another classic strat tone here we go [Music] all right you guys guitar number one where the basic d'addario's and guitar number two where the gold strings let's wrap things up in the bridge pickup we're gonna add a little bit of overdrive let's check that out [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so the results for the bridge blind tests were guitar number one where the d'addario's guitar number two or the gold strings all right so here are my final thoughts on these two sets of strings let's start by talking about the tone and then the playability or the feel of each set so when it came to tone I definitely could hear the difference mostly in the high end that d'addario's had more bright lively cutting high end and the optimism or controlled kind of mellow or high end at least that's how I could hear you know the differences between the set that was really the only way I could tell between you know the set they did sound very similar but when it came to the high end the cheap d'addario's definitely had a little bit more cut and the Optima is a little bit more warmth and that's really a hallmark of almost all coated strings whether you know it's coated in 24 karat gold or something else the coded strings tend to have a little bit warmer tone but better longevity in other words this set would probably sound exactly like this you know a month or a month and a half from now whereas you know the dario's might die out in two weeks depending on you know how much you're playing them so that's the advantage of the coated strings they tend to last longer and these ones are tarnish resistant but they do sound a little warmer so I think many of us know how a basic set of strings feel and let's be honest the d'addario's are classics they're pretty much everywhere in fact the Dario makes strings for a bunch of other brands too so even if you haven't bought two Dario's chances are you've probably come across something that they've made now when it comes to coated strings they feel very different oftentimes very very slippery and you don't have the same feel or grip as you do with a basic set well I'm happy to say that the Optimas don't have that slippery coating that 24 karat gold whatever you know how they use it feels like a regular set which is awesome so if the longevity is good and you know the tone stays the same over a long period of time I've got to say the feel is much nicer than you know a regular coated string so the big question is would I buy the Optimas again well I gotta say I don't think I would I think gonna stick with my cheap you know super slinky is daddario is those kind of strings I think those give you the best bang for your buck now when it comes to something specialty or fun or unique I think I would something like this guitar in fact I don't know why I didn't put them on this guitar that's just the natural fit so anyway something like this where it's black and gold I think a gold set of strings would be absolutely killer and you know this is a guitar that I just break out once in a while to play it is very very beautiful so I think something like this I might throw a set of Optimas on just cuz it looks so cool and they'll last a long time so I you know when it comes to regular guitars I don't think I would but for something fun and unique I think they're pretty cool so thanks for watching you can check out this t-shirt in the video description below tab store all the gear I use all that stuff is

ever since middle school science class i just thought it would be so cool to have one of those life-size skeletons i mean i have one another one well i'm an adult now and i make the rules of my world so a life-size skeleton is now on its way to my home now i just have to brainstorm on what this video is for you to justify why the crap that's happening i mean obviously i need one because need one because outrageous but having a regular skeleton isn't outrageous enough it says do not open with knife of course not i don't want to scare him can't wait to meet you dr bones oh this is already creepy i thought i'd be assembling but it turns out i am decapitating okay get your jaw back on okay you know what i'm doing right i mean i have to alas poor yorick i knew him horatio this is cool and totally not a dumb idea oh he's missing a tooth what the heck wait i found it it's a little bit of re-toothing on the canine good as new i'm already having too much fun let's finish building you shall we ah look at him oh you look great i mean i'm sure this is what god felt like when he made me my camera's having trouble figuring out which face to focus on do we look at the talkative one or ally okay high five now how do we level you up into outrageous do i make you fuzzy glow in the dark do i use you to make music what's that oh my god that's a fantastic idea i just have to learn how to guild we got it why just have a life-size skeleton when you can have a 24-karat gold life-size skeleton that you covered in gold leaf yourself all 206 bones i'm going to figure this out obviously you're coming with me hey get your seat belt on sir shut up doing the can't can together go to the gold leaf store which is totally a thing that i knew about hi hi i'm allie i'm larry are you feeling all right you don't even care about him tell me what do you think you want to do well yeah i would like to see um if i could cover every circle with real gold it will take you a lifetime a lifetime you'll probably end up looking like this when you're done we certainly have enough leaf for you to cover this so you have no experience no but but i have always a butt exceptional level of confidence okay are you an artist what's the end game um i think i already got it honestly the video's the end game and you are gold it's a crazy project i gotta say i don't think anybody's ever brought a skeleton in here you're a kidding which we call sizing if you have spraying capabilities do you no no can you take something liquid and transform it and spray it oh no i don't have it what's the engine like really why do you want it in real gold why not be a happier person because you can just spray that's not the end goal of everything so you can be a happier person you can have like a university student and this is for a project for a professor what professor would be like bring me a gold skeleton you're shocked i'm in shock well larry was exceptionally helpful except for the part where he said that my brilliant idea would be extremely difficult and i should reconsider that's not going to be getting through my noggin but i am now much more nervous about being able to pull this off and i should probably start with an area that you wouldn't be looking at as much you know kind of hidden in the back or something definitely figure out how to do it first before i do the face anyway like i said i have an abundance of confidence so this will be fine okay he seems tacky enough ah he's about to get tackier he lost a tooth so i guess we'll be yielding this separately and now for the genuine 24 karat gold leaf oh that is lovely i'll just take you off and turn you into skup oh i'm nervous and i've already blown it i want to move my camera and this happened ah okay let's just get you up on the forehead oh man this is not the perfect square that i was intending oh my goodness well that is satisfying wow yes i'll keep going second square is gonna be way better got some eyebrow tweezers because that's probably gonna help oh man this stuff is delicate no don't breathe oh crap just sticking it on this is definitely gonna be a patch job i'm totally getting better at this [Music] okay now we did say painting it yellow would hide the holes obviously i didn't do that fine there aren't going to be any holes here we go that is a square almost all of the surface area used i am gilding oh my goodness okay i'm not close to done but it is already looking ridiculously cool like way better than i imagined just gotta fill in all these holes that i intentionally left there oh i gotta give you a pov of this because it's pretty satisfying this is what it's like to be a gilder do i need to be doing the back of his skull and behind his teeth i mean it's weird you're asking that question and not do i need to be doing any of this the human skull has so many nooks and crevices and it turns out it takes a whole lot of work and time to get gold into them i started trying to cover all these tiny white spaces two and a half hours ago and it only looks slightly better and finally his brain case is complete oh no wait we need your gold tooth open up let's get in it calm down you're fine here we go oh it looks crazy cool i mean crazy and cool but holy crap that was eight hours for just this tiny little part it's so hard to work with this stuff you can't breathe you can't touch you can't put your hands anywhere near it or just stick to your gilding is rough i'm a little concerned about what this video is going to be now i tried to make a gold skeleton or i successfully made a gold skull okay let's see how he's looking wow super weird okay the human body is about seven heads tall unless you're a superhero or a michelangelo's david so that's one seventh done times the eight hours it took me that's uh you know just a couple more hours anybody wanna give me a hand now that i've sized you up part of the reason this took so long besides the fact that i've never done it before is that i was being super careful not to waste any of the actual 24 karat gold i don't know if that was clear but the suckier you are at this the more you waste although i did accidentally guild my table a little bit i'm pretty proud that i ended with 10 sheets left more than larry thought it would take so clearly i'm a natural but i'm totally prepared for a speed round now where it's just gonna go super fast because i'll be wasteful i'm switching to fake oh yes the skill is 24 karat but the rest of them will not be and if you're mad about that you should consider joining my patreon so that i can do outrageous things to the fullest with your funds and thank you to my current patrons for making the skull happen that's awesome you know i invest your support well you are the reason that there's more outrageous in the world [Music] oh this is impossible to work with okay i was trying to show you the difference between the two calm down and then i screwed up some sheets of the real gold and now i'm gilded on my thumb although this is edible it tastes like i'm loaded don't laughs bags oh my god anyway this per sheet this tiny little thing costs two dollars and eighty cents and then this big old one here of the big stuff this is only nine cents that's why we're switching let me just get this put away for future outrageous now i can just truly go for it giving him the golden touch oh man that is cool i can definitely tell the difference just working with it i mean emotionally i am much less nervous and i feel like the amount of anxiety that goes into an artwork subconsciously shows to the viewer at the end and so that's why using the gold is better and also probably why you all love my youtube channel heck yeah it only took two hours that's like a quarter of a scale and it did still turn out handsomely oh it's gonna be cool watching all the pieces come together hey looking good all right although this is the same as the other one so i feel like i could just do a copy paste hey it worked and totally didn't take me another two hours now i just gotta do this middle section which is probably gonna be the hardest part torso it seems [Music] ugh now i know why larry said i should get a spray gun that was rough i'm sweating and i can't even turn on my ac because i'm concerned about my gold flying away which is a very first world problem super relatable am i right don't you hate when you're a little overheated because you're worried about your gold flakes let me know in the comments looks like i should probably do the section standing which ironically is going to be difficult on my spine it's time to make another opulent mess pretty satisfying putting a whole sheet on kind of like wallpapering in the worst way and if you can't tell this stuff is way easier to work with than 24 karat gold so that's just a tip for all of you following along at home making your own gold skeletons and now my outfit is looking pretty snazzy got a solid mess going on here it's funny that i used his box to catch the flakes uh oh returns will only be accepted in original package yes i can't return them now although it would be funny to send him back to gold i've always wanted to buy a bunch of plain shirts at target and then screen print them with my own stuff and return them like i got them that way anyway back to the emboldening i definitely don't need to fill in all the tiny spots that you probably can't see but if you're gonna be stupid you should be impressively stupid okay so six hours to do this part i would make another pun but i don't want to be corny now we've got left to the legs which i've already done the arms and these are just big stupid arms with no thumbs it is right about this percentage into every one of my projects where i'm like what am i doing well let's finish you're like a paleontologist on a planet where the dirt is made of gold and the animals are also made of gold there's another two hours for the two legs clearly i've gotten faster at this probably because my neatness has disintegrated oh wait i did both legs and i should have copy paste it my full video pallies will get that reference and i guess welcome to everyone who just joined right now because i skipped ahead to see the reveal let's do it i can't believe i spent 20 hours on this and weird that it seemed like only one day maybe i inhabit an alternate universe where time has no meaning and i have an infinite amount just to pursue the ridiculous or maybe i hate picking out more than one outfit per video and i feel intimately acquainted with this guy now i've scrutinized every little surface like did you know how weird a tailbone looks but also elegant am i right coming together i guess i can put this back on now i took it off because i didn't want to accidentally make a gold ring that would be too sensible now for the final piece i don't want to touch it it's weird that i've had a use for the term unbeheading in two separate videos on my channel he is complaint how does he look oh my goodness holy crap you are stupid i mean spectacular wow just wow i don't think i've owned anything ostentatious before give us a little turn how do you feel buddy oh man this is in my house you know that feeling like when you're dead but also with pizzazz like this is the most tasteful nude you've ever seen every part is completely unnecessarily covered i even did the bottom of his feet head to toe soul player someone please tell me you get that joke i can't stop looking at him and touching him which i probably shouldn't be oh hello pleased to meet you in your final form sir i guess you probably need a name i'm gonna go with midas also drop your arm if you want to give them a glamour montage bro no one told me it was going to be a gold party give me a set i just want to fit in with my new roommate what's that oh no i didn't steal you off with a top coat i'm trying to figure out if i keep him conductive and then when i touch him it would cause an electric current and each bone could be a different note and make him a synthesizer i don't know that might happen subscribe if you want to see that and if you enjoyed seeing me make outrageous with a material i've never used before then you'll probably like my cardboard of liberty video the highest execution of stupidity hey best pally i'm ali and i've been saving amazon boxes since the us started our stay-at-home orders this is what i've been living around for three months and since i'm still cardboard", "eAoaWUHYyaA": "oh my god hey we go wake them up that's how little they are might be it can you see that through the bag just a little bit of scale damn it let him up all right guys the moment you've been waiting for we got some crazy fish cake check it out all right so we got this fish this is a really good koi food guys this is amazing but let's see how our fish like it this new coin this is quite gross we're trying to grow out those babies guys so I want to show you guys some of the pond behind us I'm gonna try this and see if our smaller fish grow any more rapidly so I dumped those bags into this container guys check it out we have a ton of extra koi fish so which I may or may not give away to you guys at home or to Blake Paul you know I got a lot of friends out here in the Ross fam check these guys out I want them to grow more rapidly so I bought this food here we go and feeding every day hey bub oh my god sometimes they throw this food so aggressively right back in my face it's hilarious so this food trickles down and feeds the other fear I'm just gonna keep that guy here's a beautiful fish and I don't want to see him get eaten or terrorized or spins ripped off by some giant whale of a catfish and Joey has some whales of a catfish so this guy's gonna be just fine right here this guy's gonna be just fine right here so check this out - look this if you look closely dude all these small fish are cichlids that gave birth to these babies so there is two cichlids to mine invasive species mine cichlids actually beautiful pink and aqua marine fish but they gave birth to these black and white striped babies and there's actually hundreds of them soon with the camera on the surface you see those things look at those you see those things look how many there are there are hundreds and that is just one just actually that other it's crazy it's one family look they're all way to here they're all the way out here there's just hundreds and hundreds of mine cichlids now in this pond which is ridiculous because we don't have any predatory fish per se aside from the too popular that we have this guy hangs out in the shade check him out over here he damaged the pond really bad to the point that we're gonna have to realign this whole thing hey buddy how you doing and he also has a friend that we put in here wild-caught pop go in here I'm not sure where he might be right here we also put a small wild-caught pocket in here with this pop cause I'm not gonna stress him out but he's in there and he's really pretty has a beautiful red belly but ever since I put that pocket one here this guy's been acting really funny so we're gonna take him out today or while pop who I think is messing around with the pop goo that is actually tank-raised so this coffee Oh his tank and pond raised by Barb's buzzin and Joey caught it in bars buzzing above-ground pond and now gave it to me but that pocket we caught the other day out of here I I don't think he's terrorizing it because pop you usually become friends but this partner whose attitude has changed completely this top bottle pop is just a lot less friendly one before it was coming right up to my hand you could see my tic TOCs this thing is like super friendly here you go look at this you know you like those he likes when I feed him as a mouse but he's a good boy enjoy enjoy my friend he's such a good boy it's ridiculous we're gonna get out a nuisance because that wild PACU just wasn't good for her I thought it was gonna be a good friend for it but it wasn't so come on buddy I don't not sure where the other fish is I know he didn't where is it right here he's actually straight down and but here you see you you can actually see it from this side better this is our chance to see him now yeah if we die so he's right here oh my god and now he's gone see it's gonna be tough he's a fast one all we're doing now this is a wild [ __ ] from the lake right behind us this is a baby from the lake right behind us so releasing him back is technically legal since I called him from that lake so I'm not putting a new fish in there anything he was basically just in a holding pond this is water connect to the lake there's no new water nothing is different I just took that fish put it inside the pond water and I'm putting them back paw who are known to jump oh my god look I caught one of the sickness by accident do this thing blend it take that up that's how little they are you see that thing yeah look at that little thing oh my god Oh with the little net guys check this out he's a beast it's a really really pretty fish but he's not helping he's not helping me up he's not helping me out I'm here buddy come here he's a really pretty fish but he's not helping out with the friendliness of the other [ __ ] cute fish really cool beautiful beautiful red belly on that thing right it's crazy teeth and all but like I said he's not helping out my friends so he's going for the great swim and he's good that's where I called him from you know that's what it is look he's so stressed look at poor baby well you doin dude we're so funny I'm telling you they're like humans that's why I love them so much although there's such aggressive fish in such hard fish to keep with other fish and fish tanks or pawns or anything look at them sideways down there let me go wake them up are you doing them here hey you're not that stress come on get up get up keep it moving keep it moving okay I think now the other popu isn't there but this guy will be a lot more friendly because he was coming up right to my hand and I love them and now he's like all like shy and weird and he wasn't eating yesterday so I decided to just get rid of that fish it was wild caught fish and I think it's the best decision well we were in the backrest this might be a boy on the box so I hope fix it I got this from my friend Fitz up there and I don't know where to hit but call fish 12 G hit me up pure pawn bomb just want to bring both gorgeous let's go on let's go around the corner looks like they're enjoying that food they're chomping on it not like they regularly do but it did rain the other day so I'll give him a couple days but quite gross looks pretty good all right oh my gosh Fox a little heavy but check it out Wow Wow the colors on that now these guys have to acclimate what they are literally glowing can you see that through the bag I know it's gonna be tough but we're gonna get them out soon these guys right now look incredible incredible and they're a lot bigger than I thought I thought they were only gonna be like 10 inches but I guess they actually are 12 to 14 all right come on keep your eyes closed okay I have my mom here am I gonna keep her eyes closed keep your eyes closed right here but I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the koi and put them in here they're all acclimated but I don't want to mix the water tip look at these guys see see how the koi is so active right now so you know the acclimated they're good to go what I'm gonna do now keep your eyes closed mom I'm just gonna open up his bag I'll leave them in there just like that but you guys get to see it first right before long here Hey keep your eyes closed no you guys closed okay check this out so okay don't look get MA hey okay Wow okay you can open your eyes now look at the things oh my gosh you're good - yes look at that legitimately silver and gold like real like I was looking for these for a long time here's one I use what's wrong no no is no no no I'm just saying no no oh it's a nicer gold - dude this eyes later how cool is this look at these things looks like you got a little bit of damage right behind his fin over here little boo-boo boy it's okay we're gonna put them in a semi quarantine pond that's gonna be over there with the other court check the check these guys out these are choco genuine koi I believe if they don't quote me on that I'm pretty sure that chocolate in Rin which is one of the friendliest koi that you can buy so these guys should be really friendly at like tickling like be nice to yourself these guys now what we're gonna do is take them up hold them for just a moment and put them in that other pond now I'm actually not gonna put them in that big pond cuz I do not want the pop guru to tear them up regardless of how friendly that fish is and we did get rid of the wild PACU so that's another good thing hopefully our PACU is really nice now because before he was so friendly that wild bog who made him act different so yeah we got to watch out who you hang out with cuz who you hang out with is who you become so what we're gonna do we're gonna take this empty up some of the water come on come one ladies gentlemen okay drink it just gonna grind right here turn on the ring look at mr. puck there's other boy now like I said they're gonna be semi quarantined here so check this out Wow look at those Judas are you good it's not going anymore hey check this out place all right gin rin boy in the con wow that's pretty okay here's the other one so her now we got to check this out zoom into there looks like it's just a little bit of scale damage and he should be good but he is on the thinner side so hopefully fans up really quick Butthead and one you're gonna bring all very the back is just insane so these guys are in here they should be happy this koi is really a really good fish right here I'll get on together he's seen EPSA come on this side you might be with seeing water put it look at me you're fighting the glare right now but we're gonna head back that way they're taking each other out all super shiny super cool guys I hope you enjoyed this episode you never know some of the koi that we have in there could look like this when they grow up you had we have no absolutely no idea you have no freaking clue but yeah guys these koi are like such a cool adventure that I would remember um and you guys at home guys so stay tuned for the next episode I love these fish they're super super cool hopefully they grow into like a silver and gold kind of combo and you never know they might breed I'm not sure what their genders are but I know they can breed with other koi and we can definitely give it a try guys so stay tuned for the next episode mom we're right there with me and catch them all", "50BURirVI_8": "[Music] do [Music] everybody welcome back to lyrics kitchen if this is your first time here thank you so much for joining me make sure you hit that subscribe button so you can join the family so today i'm going to be showing you how to make these 24 karat gold wings yes you can eat goat and i'm going to show you how so just keep watching so you're going to start off with clean chicken wings i'm using about eight chicken wings for this recipe and i'm just going to sprinkle some garlic salt on top of it just to give it a little taste so now that we have our chicken season we're just gonna fry them naked we're just going to keep it like this and you're just going to drop them in the fryer we're going to fry these wings for about 10 to 12 minutes i like my wings on the crispy side so i'll probably do that for 12 minutes all right so now it's time to take our wings out and you see they are nice and crispy just how i like them and now while our wings are draining from the grease we're going to work on our sauce so i'm going to be using this sweet golden mustard barbecue sauce from sweet baby raise this sauce is going to give a nice golden look under the gold so we're going to put the sauce in the pot and we're going to get it nice and hot so now that our sauce is nice and hot nice and bubbly we're going to add in our chicken wings we're going to keep our chicken wings in there until the sauce is nicely coated and sticky onto the wings and that should take about about three to five minutes so make sure you stir your wings make sure all the sauce is fully coated on them and then we're just going to let them you know simmer in a pot so now they are all nice and sticky we're going to put them on a plate and now we're going to sprinkle our gold on top of them so the gold i'm going to be using is from lux cake i think that's what it is i'm going to put it um a link in the description box of it directly this is gold that's that's used for like for cake decoration um so it's completely edible um we're just putting them on chicken wings so so it's completely edible it's fine to eat we're just putting them on chicken wings so as you see here i'm putting the goat dust all over the chicken wings so making sure they are fully fully coated make sure they're super super golden look at them just look at it just look it just looks so it just looks so good like who would think you could eat gold chicken wings like who would who like who came up with this [Music] and i'm just making sure they are all over the wings every inch of these wings has gold on them you can see they they start to get sticky on my fingers but that's okay these chicken wings look beautiful super super beautiful super super beautiful so this is the end result of my 24 carat gold chicken wings look at that they look magnificent if you want to see how my reaction was to these wings i'm going to put a link down to the facebook live that i did um when i cut these wings so you can see that so make sure you like comment subscribe share with a friend and thank you guys so much for watching my video and i'll see you in the next one bye [Music]", "7McPhrLUfkU": "[Music] and we are not done for maximum safety we are going to drill the big bar [Music] [Music] [Music] good if it was all white on the inside we would know it was filled with tungsten and it was no good I haven't had any issues with the one ounce bars that weren't able to be identified via the x-ray fluorescence spectrometer but if you don't have an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer and you really want to go for absolute maximum safety you may choose to drill the smaller bars as well I choose to drill the bars above 1 ounce here's what we just drilled out the big bar pure gold on the inside as well as the outside the drill bit can actually affect the purity a little bit rub off a little bit of metal from the drill bit which will stick to the gold so that's how we verify 24k gold bars are true and real and lastly to get your a for today I've got your quiz question your quiz question is 30 divided by 1/2 plus 10 is what if your answer is 70 you get a 4 today", "RikVBiSJGO8": "another day in the fish room mostly going to be moving some fish around today and focusing on the 24 karat gold guppies trying to get those guys set up again so i can really start cranking them out and we'll see what else we get into i have the 24 karat gold guppy spread out within four different tanks just because i don't want to risk losing this line at all these are my breeding adults here we have the one of my best males from the previous generation with the nice pectoral fins he did have a nice tail he didn't have red in the tail uh up until like a week or two ago which i think is weird that a fish that old would develop red which is something i don't want in this line so i have to find another breeder male and get these guys going they did have camellaris redworm at least some of them did so they were taken out of the 40 gallon put in here dewormed and now they're all good i also have some growing out in this tank over here we also have some of the new ones that we got a couple weeks ago that have been in quarantine and i'm going to select breeders from this group these guys have been in quarantine extra long i just want to make sure that they're parasite free and they're not going to bring any disease into my line with the 24 karat golds i find them originally to be a very weak line but i've mixed genetics in this will be the fourth time that i've done that from different sources so this this strain looks really good i kept them in here extra long because i wanted to make sure that none of the males started developing any red and it looks like this one male right here developed red you could see it in his dorsal fin there so i don't want to use him as a breeder uh it's something that can happen in this line i think it looks cool but i want the line to stay gold also with this line looking at some of the males they have some green in the body you can see kind of by the tail just a couple of them do so i'm going to take probably the best male in here and introduce him to some of my females and maybe use one of my older males as well i moved four females and one male into this 40 gallon and i'm hoping that they'll drop some fry soon and not eat them this strain is notorious for eating their fry so the plants i have are covering all the way up to the top here ideally this water sprite would be taller but that's alright we got time and we do have one female here in this 10 gallon and she's one female that was raised in a 20 gallon with some white cloud minnows she was a leftover fry that i didn't see and she grew up in the tank being the only guppy in the tank so she's never been hit by a male before so that's a really good opportunity when you have that to get your best male and mix it with a virgin female and then you know that 100 of those genetics of that really good male are going to her so that's what i'm gonna do with her um and she's also a good backup to have i'm trying to repeat that in this tank this is my uh yellow shrimp tank and i do have two fry of the 24 karat gold you can see one back there and there's another one that is hiding in the back i'm hoping that i could sex those early one of those or both ideally would be a female and we could have a similar situation like we do over there i'm finally going to move these pearl scale platinum angelfish into the 75 they've caught up in growth with the angelfish that are in there so i feel comfortable now putting them in in the tank you can see we have one blue daisies rice fish there that jumped uh over from the other tank i did learn the hard way that these guys are jumpers so i have to make sure i always have the lid on for the uh daisy's rice fish but i'll be able to put that guy back but luckily he made it to the other tank um twice before i've seen them on the floor dried up which is unfortunate so make sure you got a lid if you have these guys these guys are still getting used to their new tank but i'm sure they'll appreciate the room i'm excited to have some platinums in here because the altums that i have in here the peruvian altums i can't really see them that well on the ecocomplete but the platinum stand out really well and i think they'll all look really good when they're full size and we can finally get some breeding pairs going of those did a big water change on this tank took out all the pearl weed with all that algae on it pearl weed for me doesn't do well on the top row tanks because it's such high light and i don't fertilize on schedule i just randomly do it so i'm gonna pick a different plant for here that does well for me uh the blue neon gobies are still in here you saw one just scurry by they love uh hanging out in between the cereal stone here but i don't know what's gonna go and go in here yet but i'll figure it out at some point i'm sure last fish to be moved today or this drop of panda guppies they're definitely big enough now to be with the adult females without getting eaten you also see we have mixed in here some orange lemay rice fish this was a originally uh meant for the orange lemays but the spawn for some reason was very very small i think i have like four or five in here i don't know why i'm struggling with the uh this strain of rice fish they're one of my favorites these are the adults here and there's no java moss in here because i just moved a bunch of it over to a new tank to try to get these guys some fry from them unfortunately they're just i'm getting fried but i'm not getting a lot and i think i'm going to deworm these guys a little bit they don't look sick they don't look like they have parasites they eat really well all the other rice fish setups here are set up the exact same and i'm getting fry from every strain except this one so i have to figure that out this tank looks nice and full now with the adults and the fry mixed in i'm surprised to see these females go after these fry after i dump them in being the size that they're at they're still trying to go after them so i'll make sure to feed these guys extra heavy the drop we have here on the hang on breeder box is doing really well there's a lot in there so i'm glad that these guys are really prolific and doing well for me because these are really pretty stream i'm so lucky to have gotten them that was another day in the fish room thank you guys so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one", "z6UDlQaedEk": "hey what's going on everybody hope you having a great day today looking forward to sharing with you a product that has been working for me I'm really excited these are collagen eye patches the company had contacted me to review them and try them out I thought hey let's give them a shot because I do have bags that are under my eyes it is what it is but I've tried other products haven't worked and I thought hey let's give it a shot so looking forward to sharing with you today as I'm going to demonstrate put them on you'll see a difference between my eyes before and after because every time I've used them it really amazes me the results that I've seen so I could tell you right off the bat that it's working for me and it should work for you as well but you know I will again show you the results at the end of what they look like on my eyes using them today and I will also show you photos of when I first started using them to where I am just a few days ago and so a meantime I will put a link where you get more information you could read reviews and of course order them very affordable you get 20 pairs you don't have to use them every day but you're going to need to use them on a regular basis it does say here one to two times a week the first time you're going to use them you do three days in a row and then it says one to two times a week the company says that it's okay to use them too two to three times a week and when I first tried them I didn't really see the results I reached back and they said put them in the refrigerator so that's what I do and that helps now these are 24k golden collagen eye patches it is helps with dark circles puffiness fine lines and wrinkles cows feet and aging skin a couple other things about the patches is that a soft hydrogel patch that nourishes the delicate skin under the eyes and helps reduce the appearance of fine lines wrinkles dark circles and crow's feet to achieve a firmer revitalized and younger looking eyes I mean who wouldn't want that so so that's pretty much what they are I'll put other information in the description but let me show you how to put them on again you could see my eyes and the before of today so I'm gonna put them on you know 20 to 40 minutes and then I will come back and take them off and show you so these are a little slippery there's some liquid in there so first we'll take this one out of the package and one of the things you want to do and I usually do these at night after I'm sorry in the morning after I've showered so you want to make sure to clean your face so you'll see it almost has a little swoosh so this part here goes on the outer part of your eye underneath and you just lay it there like this I think I think I can see that and then that's it they do it sticks to your face feels good it feels cold and I kind of feel like when these are on looks like Rocky Balboa gooey dude and have a rocky look like when he was getting beaten in that fight so I'm one of the early earlier Rocky movies so here we go let me put the other one on and again the thinner side goes on the inner part of the eye and it goes outward like this and I should have brought my nerve here we'll do the best I can I'll check it after I'm letting it sit just to make sure it's on my eyes properly and then that's it you just let it sit and let it do they let it do its job wait I need to put this up a little bit just looking at the screen and there you go so you just put them on your eyes let them sit and then after about you know when you're ready to take them off or during while they're on there and you treat you could just Pat into your eyes so you make sure that these patches the ingredients that are in there get onto the skin and I look forward to sharing with you after about twenty to forty minutes of the results and I think you'll like what you see as I've been impressed every time in the meantime while we're waiting I'm going to show you now of what I look like before I start using them to where I am just a few days ago so here we go and I look being back after these have been sitting on face for a little while okay so now I'm going to show you the photos of when I started to just a few days ago I've saved the photos in the album some of the photos I've taken with the treatment on and then after but I'll show you as we go so we're going to start here this was December 26 this was what my eyes were like and you can see I've got some swelling in the eyes and this is when I did my first treatment and this is the results of the first treatment then on December 27th what the treatment the results after this is December 28th and you can see starting to see a little bit of a difference this is after on the 30th so I waited a couple of days so I did it a little bit more in the beginning and you could really start seeing a difference here then and I purposely didn't smile and I took the patches off my eyes but this was before now this mark here on my my face has nothing to do with the patches I had some sunspots removed from my face so that's why I've got that there and then you could see here on January 3rd the results they're after and then on January 8th so you can really see quite a bit of a difference from before and after so again let me go back up here this is the first day before I started the treatment and then this is after the last room in January 8th and now today I'm doing another treatment which I will show you here in just a couple minutes of having these patches on my eyes for the you know past 20 to 40 minutes so okay the moment of truth is here it's been a little over 30 minutes I set my timer so I'm right in that 20 to 40 minute range and I'm gonna take them off I've got my mirror with me so let's see here we go and then what they suggest is just to you know dab just last time and you can even you know I do that even during the treatment and then all you do is just peel it off like that and that is the right eye and now the left eye and there you go and then all you do is just rinse off and then you're good to go and you can just dispose of that and just have these in the refrigerator ready to go whether you do it the next day or every other day so that you could do it three days a week and then you can really help smooth your eyes out and keep that puffiness down making you look younger Hey just turn 50 hey 50 is the new 40 and will help me continue so look at my best all right everybody all right everybody have a great day thanks so much for watching let me know what you think click on the link where you get the information I do appreciate you supporting me by clicking on the link and if you start using it let me know how the results are working for you but it's definitely affordable worth getting these collagen eye patches all right take care thanks for watching see you on the next video and I hope you enjoyed it", "4hvP1wwqZ6U": "[Music] gained a character booked up nature biscarrat gold by Jared gold at recurrent gold or soda karat gold in kibarim

got the black adult thing have been definitely there is it real gold gets resolved really late again I saw the fleet on the back of this one this is million dollar gray car yeah it'll maybe think it might be it really doesn't stretch you know that's a lot of money because I had a couple of bills to push but not like anyway so anyway down I keep I keep looking and I see more gold in just different places like the lats for the doors the wheelie bars yeah roll golf but Phil's a local golf lighting but we put any rice sticks I love it I don't even come up to more of a show car versus kind of all of this how to tell you this week and now you're showing that it runs yeah well that's the whole thing again that's at around it not too hard to put a million dollars into a race car but half of that much in gold and they think makes you get there pretty quick yeah how much does it cost to coat all the stuff on this car not as much as I you'd think to see how much is there but all right guys this preparation work the guys behind it too they awesome so what are the main components are gold plate here they keep seeing more and more comments on the trade Pulis of wall wall I think it is 52 gold in it now whatever cannot handle the bolt they kept the golden whatever not we put a specially because it you have to keep it maintained to keep it looking like that in America giving a talk to paint the point that is going to come before and I love that both of these cars have engines that weren't supposed to be in pathetic I know that we like we're a custom shop that wants to be different you know and we have to be different than you know this how many passes are on the beer this is mainly for had yesterday half of our we've had a couple of I've given it a couple of times we go an order we were filled in a fill it auto for now so I think you're weak it's all we've done a hood auto setup we miss our strain on the time we see what is in making these a pretty good eye with the manual with all these having clutch or more clutch problems but we're not getting now with they try to perfect some I get it down the truck we will have been each day's got a business to run it's really hot the ER than I got well thanks for showing us agario I smack the luckiest we gimmick [Music] [Music] Wow [Applause] Phil driving holy crap probably the best I've I've MSA holy crap holy you think you had a halfway through that honey like a little really hard speech I think we're still on the controller there I think it was a bit faster maybe in a little deeper you know good Roland installing the brake pedal too if you apply to break through hard that upset them even more you know by now it's going to be a real gentle on the brake in that - giving of course you know enough to just raise it's not fast enough - to shoot some strike their normal - like as early as we swing towards the wall huh it what's the clear exist first wrong haven't gone anywhere brilliant looks like the coverage any issues with it like that that'll be a spread pop on a new Chevy shut up in another so we've got to look at the dot O'Neill and see what the shops are doing but I don't know if the track will do with a day and I think no one's living getting down yeah it looked good to have track hi there we all got really snotty Peter - goodness - Trevor man hell it's crazy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "BMVP2s1E7Kw": "how'dya previous video i make gold solution you can see here this is a gold solution here today we are going to get gold metal from this gold solution okay so we need sodium sulfide now you can see sodium sulfite here okay first I am going to add some gold solution please big okay okay yeah it is a gold solution mmm you must slow be careful when you handle with this gold solution because this gold solutions are very toxic quad and okay now I am going to add sodium sulphide it is my sodium sulfate sodium sulfide okay now you can see here the got color solution turns to colorless solution after few minutes we can see here the gold particles precipitate out now you can see here the color is changing now the solution like doc no Bravo color one so actually this is gold particles you must do this experiment if you do if you want to do this experiment you must do this experiment in outdoor or in a fumehood because this reaction gives sulfur dioxide gas sulfur dioxide is a toxic gas okay now we have to wait here to win the all the gold will precipitate out we can collect the gold and do the rest okay okay now you can see here the gold is precipitated out the reaction is mostly complete so these black precipitate is our gold and now you can see here the solution is like blue color because we start with this reaction 22 karat gold 22 karat gold have to with 22 parts of gold and two parts of copper because of this copper the there is some copper two-plus ions so copper two-plus is blue color so that's why this solution is light blue okay now I am going to do is collect this all gold powder and heat this gold powder and get a nice shiny gold bead okay okay I was the precipitate and put this precipitate here now you can see gold precipitate here my crucible is broken so I use this steel container and I'm going to heed this gold precipitate by this blowpipe and after that we can see a nice shiny color gold okay okay now the recall the reaction is done so now you can see here nice color gold crystal here before the heat I add some borax to this gold precipitate itself to melt down this gold in low temperature so now I am going to add this gold bead to water okay okay now you can see here you can see here this is so good okay now you can see here this is our final product 24 karat gold we start with 22 karat gold so finally in this video with 24 gr and this is the end of this video thanks for watching", "GlDnrsqbrpw": "[Music] what y'all trying to do [Music] don't look too hard might hurt yourself", "HPBJypQ804o": "[Music] you [Music] hello beautiful people it's sherry Moulton back with another video happy Sunday I am doing something that two people requested my cousin I'm doing one of these but I'm doing it in gold and rose gold I had somebody request on my page to do one with gold so this is the extreme sheen 24 karat gold sorry guys and this one is a folk art they're both folk art folk art brushed metal this one is called brushed rose gold I was so upset I don't know if you can still see it is still it took four coats of paint on either side both of them so I started the video caster day and I got discouraged so it was like any whoodles so I thought I'd pick it up where it's already painted and that would be that so the colors that I did like I said were the two artists left are um oh ones deco art and ones Fokker deco art extreme sheen 24 karat gold the other one is folk art it is brushed rose gold and I'm using my two-part epoxy resin it is enviro light tech and I am also using some glitters this is I found this one at Walmart it is champagne so I'm hoping it will go nice it's kind of like a pinky and I'm using Martha Stewart love her glitters this one is the fine glitter it's smoky quartz and this one is the chunky glitter and it is or a Florentine gold and for my glass I am using the decorative filler that I get from Michaels I call it broken glass like me it's broken glass that is what it is and this one is gold so with that I will proceed I just want to put the lid on this so when I do shake it out it isn't gonna be everywhere alright so we are going to I had mistakenly I don't know if you can see there's a piece there I didn't do it quite half so I'm gonna go below the gold line with my resin and you don't want to go right to the edge because you do not want the resin dripping off of the canvas and I've had other people ask me if they can use other things other than resin to adhere this you could take the time and use three three six thousand six thousand but you know what you're gonna have to place each piece individually so it's whatever you would like to do I'm a quick let's get her down you kind of girl so I tend to like to find the quickest things pretty right in front of my eyes there you go do a quick little knot like I really need to do it at the month alright so again remember I'm gonna go blow just bring it to the edge and I'm bringing it down more because I didn't quite do that evenly when it came to the painting all right so get a nice even base and again remember don't go all the way to the edge you don't want it to go off now I usually just go up and down don't want a blob there so and I get some times where you want it to stay even I get going fast and then it goes off-kilter and I like to do quite a bit draggy in the middle down and I'm gonna rub the edge because I do not want it off rub that edge and you judge if you want it to come down further then you can make it come down further but I think I'm just gonna tilt it my way just a sec I think that looks good to me where I would like it to be so it's that I am gonna get out my glass and just start I go heavy down the center and this I'll have to pull out the other colors to show you but when it comes to this um the gold the color that it's so big it almost looks like you know how when your your car window breaks or something is huge so yes my cousin Susan wants this this is from just playing around so you do not have to feel obligated but I had you in mind when I was doing it and again this some of this is gonna shake off so I'm going heavy but I have shares of this with the different glitters in the glass that I have shaken off [Music] [Applause] [Music] I added glass and glitter to my poor I will show you it tomorrow when I reveal this after I leave it set overnight but I did my my swipe the other day and it was I did this on top so I was trying to combine the two so that might be another video again I just want to make sure those glass on the top so I like I said it doesn't come off but I want to make sure that there's nothing on there I'd rather have do it once then not happen and I'm just gonna have to give it a little bit of a a push I'm hoping there's not a definite line because they're a little more in here up there courtesy where I've got the resin on the gold there we go that looks good for now do some of this champagne glitter oh my goodness is not open let me just pop them there whoops holy moly that was heard there we go you know it doesn't come out like crazy okay here we go it's hard to I try not to get like one blob but it's hard sometimes it's okay do an even little shake go over and because there is quite a transition I'm gonna do a little bit of a heavier right on that little bit of a line so you don't see the difference here you go kind of covers up some of the holes above that whoo I love the glitter but it's everywhere and here we go with the goal to find and this I'm gonna I guess I'm gonna go this way I have to get a big bottle of the recollections glitter in the gold because I I really don't do much with gold I'm a silver person so it's nice to put the glitter on the correspondent like have the gold glitter down here so you can see a little bit better there we go and I think I'll do some chunky and then we are finished until tomorrow the reveal and again any of these are for sale if you want to give me an email my email is s Moulton 1267 at gmail.com I'm pretty sure I haven't I don't use that email very often but that's the one link to my my page so I will put it in the description box so if you do are interested you're getting anything that I make I am willing for a price joke joke of course alright so with that I'm gonna leave it set overnight I will give it a shake a-shake in the morning I usually brush it off with a little a fine brush and I'll do a little show-and-tell with my other painting that I did yesterday turned out amazing so alright with that I'll see you tomorrow hello good morning we're back let's shake this off my friends I'm just gonna bring it back it's pretty big that falls off just give it a little shake and just use a cheapy old brush try and get you and I usually try and brush down into the I love this I send this glitter glass is here I'm gonna bring you up for this process [Applause] and that's all I do this is why I like the resin just give it a few good shakes and then all the stuff that's left here I pick up like oh my goodness I can't believe how chunky this is look at this piece can you see I don't know if you can see it where did it go like look how far up that no I just fell off that's crazy that is crazy see I don't want you to get my face in there cuz I'm not Beauty ready today that is beautiful beautiful I'm gonna bring you back down now as I was saying so that is beautiful so there you go Susan Boudreau if you want to let me know my lovely cousin now see what this I'm just gonna shake it all up put it in my container and then I'll have this to use next time so I had did my let me just grab the other one I did a couple of swipes I think that is my last video that I have is the the aqua colored swipe so this is the one this one is the 16-inch and it's got one coat of varnish which is nice I don't have a lot of varnish left so I don't want to coat anything but in my head I'm like oh my goodness why would I not combine so this is what I did with another one I was like let me bring you I don't know why this is so is that not gorgeous so you can hang it this way or you can hang it the traditional way but I did the broken glass down the center where I did the balloon smash amazing then I wanted to try something else so I did this one it is a swipe I did silver on the top like I normally would do with the other ones but the bottom half I did a a swipe now the other swipe when I poured my paints I did him randomly there all over now this one I specifically wanted stripes so I took the time and put all my colors straight in line and then did my swipe so cuz I wanted to be yeah so that's kind of cool I was impressed very cool it's just so glittery anyways so there you go hope you enjoyed if you have not

everybody at silver seeker and today we are talking about gold we are actually talking about the difference in value and purity of all the primary carats of gold some 10 14 and 18 and what I mean by that guys as in gold jewelry generally it's going to be either 10 14 or 18 karat now also in this video we're gonna teach you how to calculate the value of each one of these as well as figure out the value for any carrot of gold whether it's 22 or 8 or any of the other carats out there all the way down to even 1 and additionally after this video is over you're gonna know exactly how to tell how much the goal than anything is worth as long as you know exactly what the carat is it's actually pretty darn simple so let's get into it and guys really quickly before we get started I do want to say if you like this video and you want to see more like this make sure you subscribe so you don't miss out in the future okay so in front of us guys we have 10 14 and 18 karat gold this is a gold and these are gold wedding bands right here and this is a pair of 18 karat gold earrings so to figure out what exactly the carrot of gold value is is actually pretty darn simple because all you have to actually know is that 24 karat is pure gold and I think most people that know anything about gold know that 24 karat is pure that's as pure as it gets and because of that it's actually really simple to find out the value of any other carat of gold so what we did is we actually got the calculator here and we're gonna show you very very simply so if we know that 24 karat is pure we can use one to represent a whole or in other words a 24 karat piece now if we divide this number by 24 you will see that each karat is point zero four one six six six six six percent pure or in other words point zero four one seven percent pure so now that we know that we can say okay well I have a 10 carat ring so this number times 10 there is the purity of 10 karat gold 0.41 7 do you see what I'm saying very very simple or we can take this number we'll take 1 divided by 24 again and then we can multiply it by 14 for 14-karat and now we know that 14-karat is 0.58 3% P R or in other words 50 8.33% peer and we can do the same for 18 karat and actually 18 karats pretty simple math but if you take one divided by 24 and then multiply it by 18 you can see that 18 carat is 75% pure which makes sense if you were to say you know divide 24 into four parts 18 carat would be three of those parts so you get the idea is 75% so knowing that you can actually calculate how much gold is in anything so if we take 1 divided by 24 let's say we have an 8 carat ring so we'll multiply that number by 8 we know that 8 carat is 33.33% pure now knowing that math makes it very very simple to find out the value of gold so all we have to do now is get a scale so we're gonna get our scale out we're going to turn it on so we're gonna go ahead and start with this 10 carat gold ring right here this is actually my own wedding ring and it is 10 karat gold and the reason I have a 10 carat gold wedding ring is because you know I work with my hands sometimes and I wanted something strong and since 10 carat gold there's only 41.7% pure as we now know it must be filled with other metals that are much more strong than gold is so it can resist a little bit more damage a little bit more wear and tear so knowing the math that we have we're gonna go ahead and put this on the scale and we can see that this ring weighs 0.26 ounces Troy so we'll go ahead and clear out our calculator and now let's do the math and figure out what the value of this ring is so today gold is sitting at 17 hundred and thirty dollars an ounce now ten karat gold is 41 point seven percent pure so we just take 17 30 and we multiply it by 0.4 one seven and that tells us that 10 karat gold is worth seven hundred and twenty one dollars and forty-one cents per troy ounce now we can simply multiply that by 0.26 because we have 0.26 ounces and as you can see our ring is worth one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and 57 cents now you might be curious how that relates in grams since jewelry as we know is generally winning grams and so I'm gonna show you that the math is actually the same it just takes an extra step so we'll go ahead and switch our scale mode to grams and as you can see the ring weighs 8.1 so to get this number it's actually just as easy you just need one extra step we know that a gram there it takes 30 1.1 grams to get one ounce a troy so all we have to do is take r1 and then we're gonna divide it by 24 and then we're gonna multiply that by 10 for 10 karat now we're gonna multiply that by spot so 1700 and 30 and we get to our 720 dollars and eighty three cents now we just divide that number by 31 point one and now we know that 10 karat gold melts for twenty three dollars and almost 18 cents per gram now we just multiply that by eight point one and as you can see again we have one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and this time 74 cents it's slightly more precise because it's weight on grams instead of ounces troy and other than that it's the same it's within cents of the other way of doing it so this math can be applied to anything so without getting into the ten and fourteen carat ring here let's go ahead we'll get our scale back on because it's shut off for being timeout let's imagine that this ring is 14 karat gold well the math can be applied the same way so we're gonna take 1 divided by 24 we're going to multiply that by 14 now we're gonna multiply that by spot so 1700 and 30 and now we know that 14-karat gold melts for one thousand and nine dollars and seventeen cents now we just divide that by 31 point one and then we multiply that by what it weighs in grams eight point one and as you can see two hundred and sixty two dollars and eighty three cents so in 10 carat this ring is worth one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and fourteen carat it's worth two hundred and sixty two dollars because 14-karat obviously is more pure so the beauty of doing the math is that it can be applied to literally any care to gold so knowing simply that 24 karat gold is pure and if you divide one by 24 and then multiply it by the carat you get the exact percentage purity of gold you can literally use this math for anything in fact let's do one more example will say that our ring is now eight carat so and United States something you may or may not know in the United States for something to be marketed as gold jewelry it has to be at least 40 percent pure so 10 karat is the minimum basically for us gold marketed as jewelry 9 karat goes below 40 percent so 10 karat is basically the number it has to be in the United States for it to be marketed as gold jewelry but let's say we have a European 8 karat gold ring those things do exist so let's go ahead and do the math again so we're going to it's very simple we're gonna take 1 divided by 24 BAM point four one six times eight multiply that by spot seventeen hundred and thirty now we're gonna take that number divided by thirty one point one we're gonna multiply that number by eight point one very quickly we know at eight carat this is 150 dollars and nineteen cents worth of gold so as you can see it can be applied to any gold ring if you know the carat you can easily figure out what the value is with very very simple math so 10 carat 14-karat 18-karat eight carat 22 carat 24 carat it doesn't really matter this method right here makes it very very simple to figure out the value of any carrot of gold so guys that is what I had for you today and as the scale just said it's set by and I will say buy as well but I do want to say thank you very much for watching the video and we hope to see you next time

towards the side and then lift so let's put these eye masks on so you definitely want to look in a mirror when you apply these you put the small end in the corner of the eye big end on this side lightly tap it down to make sure it's smooth and then we could the other eye now it's recommended that you leave this on for 15 to 20 minutes what I always like to leave it on for the full 20 to get maximum benefit available so it has been 20 minutes let me take these off and once I do that we'll just lightly with your ring finger tap in any essence left on your skin tap tap tap tap it in well as

here, back with another video And today, I've got something hot for you Something you've probably seen nowhere else In front of me today is a 24 karat, gold plated, Nintendo remake. NES system From a company called Analogue That sounds crazy on its own, But how about the fact, that it also retails for about 5000 bucks This is for the person that has everything This is for the person that has a pet tiger Talking to you. Now. I did do a video on the original Analogue. This is the system over here as you can see, this is the aluminium version of it It's kind of like a modernized version of a classic Nintendo Using those components, to create a system that can output to a flat-panel display Old school games, New school life 24 karat gold, for all you maniacs Let's see what this thing's all about. Wohohoho! First things first There are white gloves in here! Oh my goodness, this is why i got in to this business Holy smokes, I feel like a surgeon right now Say goodnight to this fingerprints I feel like super Mario Or maybe better yet, Luigi 'You know that's Lewis in Italian right?' Oh! This is legit gold plated Ohh! Comes with a gold Legend of Zelda cartridge! Am i yelling? Maybe the most classic cartridge, ever to be released The Legend of Zelda, made in Japan Ohhh my! What a special day in Unbox Therapy history Jack, get that in all it's glory Oh my goodness. This might be the fanciest thing i've ever handled I'm not sure what to say! It's a bad mofo right there It's like it belongs in a museum If I show you the back here You're gonna see all the I/O So you've got a power switch in this location right here You've got an HDMI port, that's the big one NES, to HDMI, in one unit They've also got some analog outputs as well, couple of switches, and a power port Now I just noticed something On the bottom of this guy. Ohh You can see the actual circuit board here Some of the ribbon cables Jack, you need to check that out My understanding here is that they're using all original components Reworked into this layout. It's a piece of art, that's the bottom line Nobody tells you how much a Mona Lisa should cost! At least you can play this, what are you gonna do with a Mona Lisa? You're just gonna scare people Off course, four ports for you controllers on the front And everything just glistens, oh my goodness Look at this bad boy. So first up in the accessory departement Is an HDMI cable. It's actually kind of cool, it's like a flat-style cable Standard powerbrick, not huge. That's good, plugs in to the back, you know the drill What a love about it is the way it kind of displays you game there, out in front. Of course you can watch the original video wich I will link down in the description I Think I play some double dragon, I played some blades of steel, God knows what i do. Moments like this is what Unbox Therapy was made for. Incredibly special things that exist on this planet And you get to see them here in all there glory. And I get to wear white gloves. A Gesture guide Ahhh!", "1xNSq8o2NiE": "i love my viewers to death my dms be lit typically with questions like yokuba does 14k look like 10k does 14 look like 18 does 18 look like 10 and rarely do i get asked anything over 18 karat gold because you gotta have some deep pockets and typically they don't watch me so i've touched on this topic previously in another video but this time i'm gonna show you up to 22 carats in my favorite piece of jewelry the miami cuban link let's roll my music so i can put you on to these beautiful gold tones from 10 to 22. [Music] i'm kind of a big deal my beautiful peoples you know who it is this year boys today first i want to give a shout out to james otto for these joints because these is crazy look at these talk about affordable super well constructed and the flex game is real these shits are sold out and every time they get on the website they're sold out so if you're interested in a fly ass pair of shades i'll put a link in the description below so y'all can get on the waiting list because the shit's long now thanks to daniel jewellery inc i was able to get my hands on of course the different gold tones that i was looking for to present to you guys to help you guys make your decision on what gold tone you're looking to go for like if you're on a tight budget but you still want an authentic non-gold plated joint but you want to go 10k but you're just worried that the gold tone is gonna be too off this video is for you if you are on 14 karat gold and i'm thinking of upgrading to 18 karat but just want to know how does that 18 carat luster looks this video is for you now if you own 18 carat gold and looking to upgrade to 22 carry because your pockets is thick because you were selling 700 bottles of hand sanitizer during the pandemic you piece of this video is also for you so let's get right into the  shall we i'm going to start with 22 carrots and work my way down to 10 carrots so i'm gonna start with almost pure gold miami cuban link and this is lusty check it let me put on my butler gloves first just so y'all can really see the tones in action look how rich this looks so this is what almost 92 pure gold looks like in a miami cuban link form  beautiful the shine is incredible and even so with the lusty beautiful orange golden glow this should still don't look cheddar cheesy it's pretty stunning man it's pretty incredible it's an incredible piece now this particular chain is let's see this is slightly over an eight millimeter and in length uh i'm going to say this is about a 22 inch the weight of this joint is approximately 131.5 grams so this is a beautiful beautiful piece and i know what everybody wants to see and i'll be more than happy to provide it to you neck profile big money talk this is not cheap you've seen how gold prices are although they've taken a little bit of a dip and hopefully they'll take a little bit more of a dip you get to see what a 22 carat miami cuban link made by hand looks like now let's move down to 18 carat now the 18 carat that i have is in a bracelet in a beautiful nine and a half millimeter eight inch 18 karat gold miami cuban link of course with the box lock and it is stamped let me show y'all that color cannot be denied 18 karat gold over i believe 74 percent pure gold up in this and then the wrecks are mixed with alloys etc etc i don't know but i know what y'all want to see wrist profile again very stunning piece beautiful bracelet this is a perfect daily wear size for most people who've been asking what a 9.5 millimeter looks like on wrist here you go it gives you a nice perspective this is an 8 inch so it's a little bit big for me i can fit a whole finger through it because i'm a seven and a half generally so but you guys get the idea beautiful gold luster looks crazy and when you put them next to each other you can see what 22 and 18 look like now let's move to 14. you all seen 14 carat a thousand times on my channel i personally own a 14 carat but this one is a beautiful 14 karat gold also like mine with the diamond button only this one is eight millimeter 24 inches long [Music] now with the 18 carat gold bracelet off i'll show you 14 and 18 side by side you can definitely see more of a luster in the 18 karat gold than the 14 karat gold these are pretty much freshly polished so you can get a nice visual appeal of the brightness and the shininess so it's not taken away the gold tone in 18 karat is definitely more present than 14 and you can just tell even from this distance when i twist it there is definitely a nice difference between the two i mean they're both beautiful beautiful pieces but you can see that the 18 carat gold definitely is bumped up now when you go from 14 to 22 i'm sure i don't have to tell you 14 22. it's a big difference very big difference like it's crazy this is just rich this is incredible it's a huge huge huge difference beautiful piece is obviously well constructed but tone wise this is different i'm gonna put the 14 carat gold eight millimeter on neck because y'all seen 14 karat gold a thousand times but there are some people in the market just looking for different sizes and just wants to know what a eight millimeter may want to look like on the neck so of course i'm here to give you the neck profile and lastly we got the 10 carat 24 inch this one is about a nine and a half millimeter miami cuban link now i'll show y'all 10 carat versus 22. yee it's not even in the same planet this is just blows this joint out of the water but when you put it with 14 14 10 it's not that far off it's actually quite close you could definitely see the 14 has obviously a little bit more gold tone but really once this polish starts to fade out and just go into evenly it's going to be hard to tell 10 to 14 to be honest with you now i'll show you 10 to 18. 18. definitely noticeable now let me go ahead and show y'all 10 14 18 22 10 14 18 22 and it wouldn't be a cabana video unless i hit you with the ultimate net profile oh i hope you found this video slightly informative at least you were able to see the perspective from 10k all the way up to 22k aka from the moderately affordable to the oh knobby i love y'all  from the heart let me know if this video was popping by giving it a huge thumbs up the ass and i'll see y'all next time you know what is the biggest in the might not want to give these back [Applause] [Music] smooches [Music] is", "hB4aehYKqns": "I feel like some sort of princess or queen using such a luxurious facial mask good morning everyone for vlogmas day 7 I have decided to do a review instead of my normal blogs because I think to do in red emoji watch me so casually so today I'm going to be reviewing it's right here my husband in my last vlog the new Thomas rod or a three-point play for karat gold mask pure luxury legitimate I've seen a lot of the girls on Instagram trying this footage powder makeup and [Applause] now let's try it out and I'm going to review it do it first impressions review and ask the question is the important die so here is the jar [Music] with dick let's read the directions it says apply a very generous non transparent layer to clean skin thoroughly coming thoroughly covering entire face allowed to remain on for 10 5 10 minutes rinse thoroughly with warm water use 2 to 3 times a week or as desired so first impressions does really have like a really strong smell and it's super thick like like jelly baby like this me turning it upside down nothing's coming out that's nice that's a good sign and always enjoy things products so let's put this in my face oh wow super thick okay I think that's women enough too much on this is like $80 and you know what he used all of it it's like you log on right now that this is all I'm gonna finish I'm gonna list it for 500 that's for 10 minutes cuz it's five to ten well let it sit for ten minutes and I will be back okay so I let the bad songs for like longer than two minutes and I've been like 15 16 minutes but and I wash it off it kind of was a little difficult to wash off because it was just so thick I just use warm water like it says the directions and I use a like a washing ball to like make sure it got off it off gets a lot coming off with just water and it hopefully just okay after that I just put on my I just finish up my skin routine I used to dermatology kids and she's the toner moisturizer eye cream and here we are I felt like okay I felt like after I washed it off my skin was tighter I felt it was smoother I just feel like very refreshed but as far as like my skin being more hello glowy I don't know about all that I did feel like it was like fresh stuff but it's like it's supposed to make it glue really good get any of that but I did like it a lot I do think that I will use it two three times a week I've what hurts just a lot of face masks in the past and now that we're even close to $8 but none of them were really like this exactly this is just like it's just so luxurious it's so thick it's like and I feel like this is just a first impression so I could really see that much of a difference but I haven't never used a face mask I was like this and I thought like a lot face mask like a lot but I bought a lot I've made a lot and no no this one just has um even even for like my first use it's just like shown it's a lot of stuff that said we do um so yeah is it worth it is it worth $80 mmm maybe maybe not $80 but I think the only reason it's $80 is because the goal that's up right now is this worth ADL is I'm gonna go I'm gonna say like a hesitant yes because I've never used a mass that was like this um it feels really nice on my skin and I didn't feel like sometimes I use face masks it just feels like it dries on my skin even though it did like make my skin firmer make it smoother I didn't feel like it was dry still feel like after I wash the mask off and I'm still like a softness to it but I will keep using this for like a week or two and then I'll come back and give you like a more different answer if right now I'm going to say hesitant yes this was worth the $80 I paid for it so yeah alright so that's all for this video sorry I wasn't in love but whatever absolutely I want if you did enjoy this or if this helped you and your purchasing of this go ahead give this video a thumbs up and of course subscribe and I will see you in my next video [Music]", "Y3bR7zSUTZ0": "hey what's up you guys it's Judy here with my life st guy on this channel I created videos on product reviews makeup tutorials and lifestyle advice with the aim to entertain educate and enrich the lives of others so if you're new here consider subscribing today's video is going to be a review and demo of the black pearl 24 karat gold cleopatra mask made by kid macaws medic's if you're not aware of Cadmus cosmetics cap macaws medic's is actually formally known as jericho cosmetics a brand which all of you know if you have watched any of my videos is very very familiar to me on my channel I talk about their products a lot I use their products every day in my skincare routine so Ken Mel Cosmetics was originally known as Jericho cosmetics but they have recently gone through a rebranding and repackaging of all of their products because of ripoffs being manufactured and distributed being sold as Jericho cosmetics so that is why they've gone through a complete rebranding and repackaging of all of their products but the formulation is still the same so if you hear me talking about Ken ma cosmetic from now on I'm still using Jericho cosmetics it's the exact same thing just with a different label and a different name if you do want to know a little bit about Ken Mel cosmetics I will insert right here a clip of their channel trailer telling you all about Ken MCOs metics how they originated how they operate and where other products are inspired from so I will insert that here right now our story goes way back in time to Cleopatra a queen who redefined Beauty a woman who discovered the treasures that revive and rejuvenate the body and spirit Dead Sea

this face mask that I am going to be reviewing and demoing for you today okay so this is the black pearl 24 karat gold Cleopatra mask and it's for all skin types this mineral-rich mask combined with trace elements a 24 karat gold makes your skin look and feel smoother radiant and younger than ever the 24 karat gold contained in the mask stimulates the cellular growth of the epidermis regenerating firm skin cells gold also locks in moisture maintains collagen in the skin and prevents the breakdown of elastin if your skin is exposed to the Sun the gold base mask lightens the appearance of sun and age spots additional active ingredients increased blood flow which frequently nourishes the skin cells resulting in a revitalized soft and healthy skin this mask is enriched with antioxidants vitamins c e and a that help prevent dehydration and premature skin aging for noticeably younger revitalize and more refined looking skin they also include collagen and Omega 3 which effectively restores youth softness and elasticity to the skin so that's what the black pearl 24 karat gold Cleopatra mask claims to do for your skin and that's what we will be testing out today now as far as price goes for this mask it is a whopping 1200 Australian dollars in the u.s. that is close to 900 US dollars for anyone in Australia purchasing this it is a one-point $2,000 now before we all go jumping down my throat about how much money I spent on skincare yes I do spend a lot of money on skincare but not this much one so periodically through the year Jericho cosmetics aka Kid mock cosmetics come to my local shopping center and they have a stall there for a few weeks periodically throughout the year and I am a returning customer to this stall so I was having a chat with the store manager and you know with you we were just sort of catching up and I was talking on some of my other skincare and we got to talking about my channel and I said I would love to review some of the products for you guys and you know try out some of the more expensive things that most people wouldn't really know what to think because it's so expensive not many people will be trying it and put her reviews out for it so I didn't purchase this one myself this is actually on loan to me overnight so that's what I'm going to be doing with this mask today I picked it up this afternoon I'm filming this night and then I'm returning it tomorrow so this is what the bottle looks like it has already been used because this is the sample product that they had on their stove at the end of this video I'm going to show you exactly what my skin looks like and give you my final thoughts about this product now I already know that I'm gonna love it because I love Jericho's aka Ken mo cosmetic I'm gonna have to get used to kool-aid can buy cosmetics because I've talked about Jericho so much I already know that I'm going to love it because I love Jericho's products so much and for something with this price tag you're gonna have to love it and for something this is expensive I better look like her Royal Highness Cleopatra herself alright so I'm going to take off this makeup I'm going to scoot you in Nice close and personal we're going to apply this mask and then we'll see what happens from there okay now I'm back now let's get to applying this mask I'm going to read the directions because for something in this pricy I probably should read the directions so it says directions for you to apply an even layer to cleanse the facial skin using gentle circular motions taking care to avoid the eye area leave on for approximately 7 minutes wrap the mineral stone so this is how you remove it wrap the mineral stone in a soft tissue and gently rub over the skin and back and forth motions until the mask is removed using cotton wool and a small amount of facial cleanser remove the remaining oily layer and rinse off with lukewarm water gently Pat the skin dry with a soft towel recommended use once - twice weekly Wow well if you are using this twice weekly there is 50 mils in this container if you're using this twice weekly you would go through it very very quickly yeah I'm not sure if this is something you would want to use twice weekly honestly if I lit something like this I would use it for special occasions but anyway let's get to applying this I am so lucky actually to have being given a loan of this so I guess all the hundreds of dollars that I've spent at that stall has paid off hey okay so there is the spatula provided with it but I'm going to use my own one and not use the one that came with it now I don't know exactly what the box or the packaging looks like simply because this is the sample that they had at the stall and it's just given to me on loan so I don't know exactly what the box looks like but looking at other videos online I'm assuming that they do provide the spatula with it and the other one that I've seen the spatula is a gold one so I think if you were spending $1,200 then you would be given a golden spatula and a nice box as well I'm going to use my spatula this one is nice and clean and I'm just going to go in and apply the mask okay so I've probably got about $80 worth on right now okay I think I have enough of that product on my face now I'm going to use my clean fingertips to rub that into the skin okay so the texture of it is very similar to my black pearl gravity black mud mask this one I also bought from Jericho cosmetics and this one I think was $600 but I didn't spend that much on it yeah the texture of it is very similar to this one and you remove it the same way with a magnetic stone as well okay so I probably have about $100 worth of this thing on my face right now now that I have that evenly spread over my face it says to leave it on for approximately 7 minutes so I'm going to do that and I'll be I'll be right back but this mask has now been on my face for about seven to ten minutes now I am now going to take it there little gold bar that comes with the mask it says wrap the mineral stone in soft tissue and gently rub over the skin and back and forth motions until the mask is removed and I'm going to come up close so you guys can see exactly what this is doing it's got my earring let's take these earrings off shall we so that's the little black particles there and it's leaving the gold of my skin and it feels quite oily and hydrating so those are the bits that have come off my face and the stuff that's left on my face I feel like is the gold hydrating oils and minerals I have got 24 karat gold on my face right now am i beautiful yet do I look like Cleopatra I kind of just want to leave this gold layer on now because like it's too expensive to remove this is probably by far the most luxurious item I have ever had on my face okay now instead of using cotton wool and a small amount of facial cleanser remove their remaining oily layer or rinse with lukewarm water I think I'm going to use cotton wool so that it'll rub it a little bit better into my skin and I was taking my jericho cosmetics gentle milk cleanser I'm gonna take some of that on a cotton pad and remove the rest of this oily film of my face but before I do that I'm gonna try and make the most of this mask and massage this into my skin I have got actual gold on my face right now and now going in with the cleanser alright I'm just gonna go rinse my face with some warm water and I will be right back okay so I have just rinsed my face off with some warm water and Pat dried it with a clean towel now I don't know if you guys can see in the video but my skin does feel a whole lot smoother and more hydrated than it was before when I started my skin feels so soft and firm and plump like oh my goodness I still do have a lot of the texture and the colors that I started out with in my face but I can see how continual use of this sort of product will help with evening the skin tone moisturizing rejuvenating my skin looks really glowy and shiny and young so I can understand how the continual use of this sort of product will do exactly everything that it claims to do I don't know if it's because I've just washed my face and my face is still sort of moisturize and damp from the treatment but I do see a lot of the wrinkles and fine lines and texture around my mouth and on my forehead diminished so I can understand how continual use of this sort of product will help with the rejuvenation and brightening of the skin and I must say gold is extremely effective in firming plumping and rejuvenating the skin now only has the loan of this mask overnight otherwise I would do another mask again for you tomorrow and show you the results of that mask as well but I can already see a change and result in my skin like this part of my skin before was patchy and now it's just sort of smooth and soft and feels really cleansing hydrated I'm not being biased I know I have really plugged Jericho Ted macaws medics on my channel before but I really believe in this company I really believe in their products everything that I have used from Cadmus cosmetics so far has worked out for me I have no complaints about any of the products that they've put out and that I use on a daily basis so yeah this video is not sponsored I just absolutely believe in Kent macaws metics I love their products and honestly if I had the money then I would buy it but do you need to spend $1200 to have a good skin I don't think so but if you wanted to splurge if you wanted to maybe even spoil yourself for a special event for your holiday for an anniversary then I would recommend getting this product because it is so good and this technology is tried and true so yeah if you wanted to go spend $1,200 on a gold face mask then I would recommend spending it on this one but I don't believe that you need to spend that amount of money to have good skin because I don't if I had the money I would so yeah I want to say a huge thank you to Asher from Cadwell cosmetics for giving me the loan of this product overnight so I could make this video for you guys I will leave their website and any information that you might want to know about this product in the description box down below so yeah I guess that's it that's my thoughts on this product I don't think there is very much else for me to say I kind of feel like I need to say more simply because of the luxuriousness of this item but I think that's all I have to say about it if you guys are still watching to the end of this video thank you so much for being here if you

but I will say they're from the very moment you put this on your scalp it feels so amazing I will say this make sure you do not like place this on your head and then go out and I put a scarf on and stuff like that yes I'm doing this on the video but keep in mind I have a whole lot of time in between you didn't notice it but I like split it up I actually left and like walked around the house you want to let it absorb into your scalp if you go and put a scarf or something like that one right away then it will not absorb it directly into your scalp girl it's gonna absorb directly into whatever you put on okay so yeah keep that in mind now I'm just putting a second coat on I just want to do that disclaimer because with the camera yeah so you guys make sure you are already subscribed here to my channel and click that Bell notification because really release soon you guys will see the full video on these clip-in extensions as well as you know the company and all of that jazz I'm so so so in love with this hair you guys so stay tuned for that coming up really soon but you will not get that information in this video okay okay yes okay so now I'm blending everything I want to do a disclaimer these clips do not hurt at all whatsoever you guys I really really really want you guys to do your research on HS I'm not like oh yeah I use the weave and now I don't got no edges you know that's not the case you guys already made a video about it took about that so yes okay yes but and now I am using this edge control and it is infused with CBD and 24 karat gold okay and we're gonna talk a little bit more about that in a second you guys but I just want to say this sometimes we think we have to go use gel or use mousse and things of that nature but keep in mind that gel and mousse have a very very very high water content now edge control does have water in it as well but depending on the product line that percentage of water isn't high enough to make your hair revert back and whatever they do here with that formulation honey okay it is working it works footless okay okay because it is a knots of reverting back I'm even gonna do a little test for you guys because a lot of times once you put your scarf on then it'll just take everything that you just did out like if you familiar with Jam even though that's a very bad example or olive oil air control most of the time when you put your scarf on you take your scarf off it's like nothing happened well in a second you'll get to see you know how things really really go down with this edge Rochelle but as you can see it was perfect and my edges are not moving and it made the blending process for this hair so easy oh my god Rogers Lloyd baby this is control is a knife like my edges aren't just did you sleep like it I'm not even gonna lie at first it scared me a little bit like is this good oh well let's get into this ash control really really quick regrowth strengthen repair plus a 48-hour hold with the CBD and 24k a gold edge grow okay there's a premium CBD with the fatty acids hemp seed oil can improve blood circulation in the scalp thereby stimulating new hair growth real 24 karat gold honey slows down the collagen depletion increasing the skins elasticity and it lightens the skin's complexion stimulates the cells making the skin firm improves blood circulation and prevents premature aging the miracle mineral and pearl vinegar protects strengthens moisturizes at the skin okay and they have a whole lot of before and after repair pictures you guys make sure you check the link in the description box below because I made the video that I'm linking way before you know they ever ever contacted me so this is so amazing because I just made a video teaching you guys about how hair really grows from an internal level your hair growth it does not start on the scalp or once your hair is on top of your head once it's you know above the skin it's the hair shaft the growing process like it's already done that's hair that's already there you just need to take care of that hair but when it comes to hair growth honey it starts under the skin so make sure that everything that you are using is putting in nutrients to your hair okay and I'm I'm for this okay for this because at the time that I'm doing this voice over I've been using it for about three or four days now and when I tell y'all this feels so good and normally for the spot on the side of my head it takes me about four and a half to five months to get the regrowth process started because I have to get back deep in there from you know where I had the spot in my head which cause you know the hair to fall out so it takes a while before I can feel anything as it pertains to like tingling or anything in that area because of the cells in that area but honey when I put this oil on there and even the edge control I can feel it tingling in that spot instantly so I'm not just saying that because they're sponsoring this video and get you some of this girl because yes you could get this pizza work sir you give me what but it's tough to even you're gonna stab me over some pizza gonna kill me over some pizza yes when he put that knife up to his neck but it was turned the other way oh girl I thought I was I thought that was it hit me so I'm just so SuperDuper in love with this edge control and I think it's a one meat over for sure simply because not only does it have amazing hold but it's it's actually nourishing your hair like what an amazing combination if you are somebody who wears protective styles all the time this is great you have the oil to make sure you're applying your scalp and you know to one thing and then you have edge control to make sure everything goes okay but I want you guys to remember that you have to cleanse your scalp before you apply a product like this and that's why I taught you guys how to make your own rose water because a rose water is a natural antiseptic so what I like to do I would take my wig off and put a little bit of rose water on a cotton ball and go in between my braids cleansing my scalp and then apply this but I have a video on that coming really soon so leave me some comments below and let me know if whether or not you got anything at all out of this video if you want to try out the products make sure you click the links in the description box below subscribe to my website follow me on Instagram all that stuff and subscribe now my website my Instagram all that mm-hmm information below I love y'all subscribe yes [Music] [Music]", "xgwokvQUV38": "[Music] ok guys welcome back I'm just going straight on with from that previous pour this one the pearl mixture is slightly thinner than it was last time let me just grab a cup you might have to watch the previous video if you're not quite sure what I'm talking about with this one I'm gonna get straight into it some on tanks have all been mixed two parts flat all to one part liquitex basics this one is cadmium yellow deep and then there's just a little splash of water a previous video I had two splashes of water and the mix the gold mix was just equal parts of the supreme machine and the floater all this time I've got one and a half parts float roll to one part extreme machine so it's a little bit thinner so this is thicker that's phenomenal what see what happens and this time I'm going to go with the yellow in the middle half yellow half the red Oh mmm no I should get done man what if one gets them out oops third of the black doesn't need a lot of black it takes over I'd rather do three layers of the black I find that works better the rest of the yellow yeah I don't know why I think the paint's down like I tried it like that last week and I just did not like it I thought maybe there's I did the puddle you see I did the puddle in the middle this last time I painted all the edges with gold so I thought maybe that was different but not you can't have these colors too thin it just doesn't look nice they're muddy too much and when the pearls pop up they don't hold their nice shape and color they kind of just get muddy and get wonky so best to leave this a little bit on the side no pickle porch I'm go though some black just a little bit of black and then the rest of the orange and then the black it doesn't matter if you have a lot of black on your top layer because it's gonna get poured out first and it's going to become your your outside so it doesn't matter it's gonna get most of it's gonna get chipped off anyway so you can have a little bit of extra black on the outside the orange was cadmium orange hue and the red is cadmium deep cadmium red deep hue yes now the black is out of loft black 30 grams of artists loft 30 grams of flour tall and just 5 grams of water it's a thinner paint than the liquitex basic so it doesn't need as much water per amount of paint under my colors have 30 grams of float roll 15 grams of paint that's 2 to 1 and then 5 grams of water okay let's do the puddle with this one and then I'll do the wrinkle into the puddle so this is the bit thinner this time so the one where I did that heard the pink pearls that one had the thinner metallic and it had the thinner of this and I wasn't that happy the previous one to this this was thinner this was thicker now I'm turning them around that's thinner this is thicker so hopefully I'll be happy with one of these I don't wring pour in the center here we go I'm gonna do relatively be the circles today so that I can just get this paint out nice and quick so it doesn't muddy too much longer it's left in there spinning around like this turning churning churning churning somebody or yes and hopefully you can see already that it's slightly thicker that my rings are a better shape if you saw that last video with these sand colors did you notice can you tell that these are slightly better shape see the edges makes a big difference when this mix is just that little bit thicker and you can see how is talking about the goal the black bear on the outside it's just going to tipped off anyway so let's get the paint moving I want this paint to roll over the top of the gold well just go slower this time I always go so fast we'll just go slower so hopefully the gold is underneath now and I'm going to come back so let's see what happens if I take my time a little bit more and go to each corner but not quite over yet now the sides have gone over but try not to have the corners go over just yet they're got enough paint that I can do that and hopefully the gold is still on the canvas somewhere hasn't all gone yet see it's busy it's rolled over it's underneath now I might just go for this corner since I'm here back or something in there because I'm taking my time the pearls are popping up already which isn't really a good thing I don't like them to pop up just yet because they're gonna lose their their pretty shape but those ones are gone anyway do these ones have all popped up so maybe that's not a good idea going to each corner and then coming back and then having to go to the corner again because these are all going to go now but anyway we'll see what happens it's anyway we know isn't it by learning by trying these things out and back I put the gold stool under there but the colors are much more bright this time aren't they with my mic's abit picker you can actually see that the mix is is brighter okay off we go that's everything covered can't really tilt a lot more because these have already popped up so if I keep tilting those are going to get over stretch so I'm going to do is I'm just going to do very very gently just see if I can move the paint without disturbing those pills I'm gonna turn it around actually I really like this one this coloring makes a big difference when the mix is so much thicker well not so much they go of it's 5 grams of water it's not a lot of difference is it so go put it that way so they popped up faster than the previous one okay let's watch still got the pearls around the side there obviously I see around the sides the paint gets push it off too much faster I should get some square canvases let's see if that's better because a rectangle canvas now I'm pushing the paint off the edges on the two long sides pretty quickly it's going you want to torch too much because you'll burn the top of the page and the film honor you know make it skinny over the top I think I won't even come through it all so mister my team go through the middle pop any bubbles okay show you this one you want a group on top of that one but look at the color and the rings see the difference this one looks a bit more muddy doesn't it the rings are a little bit more wobbly it's not as bright because this mix with spinner much more volcanic I decided that I would do two rather than just do one and then scrape that one and then I'll pick which one I like and scrape the other one because I can keep these all these canvases so just come all right and you just touch up the corners and it is 3:30 in the afternoon so it's coffee o'clock so I'll put you on pause vanilla well I'll go and make a cup and then I'll come back see if this is done I can already see that there's more pearls popping up and the reason why I thought to so that maybe you guys want to actually see the cogs churning in my head why I'm doing this some of you like to something you couldn't care less if you do cops eternity yeah I just wanted to see also need some darker color they what would happen with the slightly thinner gold whether it would be able to may because it's thinner maybe it could come up through the other layers easier I don't know that was kind of my thoughts we shall see okay she's quite symbolic because we've just had bushfires up here on the Sunshine Coast a lot a lot of damage and on TV they were showing ember storms how the little it was it was nighttime was dark so you could really see the embers and they were just like flying everywhere because if it was so windy and the embers would just be picked up and turned around and it was you know that reddish orangish look against the dark night and just a little flecks of burning embers that's this is what it reminds me of those gold pearls around the edges yeah quite symbolic damn alright I'll um I'll pause it there and I'll make a couple I'll come back to you soon okay okay I am back it's been about has been longer than half an hour I got distracted doing things so there you go pretty poor I like the yellow in the middle lost the yellow in the previous one so starts having the yellow in this one let's take you down requests up climb down my letter yeah let's see if you're gonna focus there we go so the pills have gone down the sides don't see any big canvas so that's a good sign look at them just floating there in the red so pretty and the lines the Rings they're really pretty in this one because yeah I had that slightly thicker mix this time around sorry I'm trying to focus doesn't know what to focus on and I'll zoom out of it maybe it's just having trouble getting so close I'm really picking up the the shimmer let me see if I can pick it up that way it's really hard to pick up metallic shines yes I'm happy with this one there's the other corner you can to see the bit of the shimmer there in the gold get those lines up there pretty and then I got these little little cells trying to pop through that's just from the density of the paint doing that and the floater I mean float roll will give yourselves regardless whether you want them or not you're going to get cells with vert roll it's a plant conditioner so it's probably got some kind of oil in it because they use it to thin paints to go in spray guns so it is a conditioner so it's any kind of conditioner like a hair conditioner it's gonna have oils in it I hope to make things flow easier so there you go that's a really pretty one isn't it I hope you like that one there she is all that looks a bit bright turn you down oh my gosh oh dear trying to use the cameras are a bit of a challenge sometimes I them I just use my phone actually all right I love that corner the most those floating little pearls they're so pretty okay thanks for watching yet again please like and subscribe and hit the little bell if you want to get notifications when I

now guys they are amazing phenomenal like no exaggeration they're amazing so this is what the product looks like when you take it out of the box it's this pretty gold and white container and guys also just because this is a sponsorship does not mean that I have to come on here and lie to y'all fYI I'm going to keep it all the way real and I would never come out here and just be like oh my god they're so good oh my god guys go buy them and they're straight trash never-ever 24k gold I know that's like the big trend right now in the beauty industry a lot of brands are using 24k gold inside of their products and as masks and a whole bunch of like that 24 karat gold is supposed to be really really really good for the skin so basically what these are supposed to help with is help with firmness under your eyes the eye is a very sensitive area so you always want to make sure you have a little bit of extra help or make make sure you're just keeping it very hydrated and under there because you can get dark spots bags crow's feet wrinkles fine lines all that good and it's just very hard to maintain that area if you just let it go so you pop it on your eye for 10 minutes you can use it at any time of the day I like to use it in the morning and in the night sometimes before I'm applying my makeup stuff like that and basically it says that it helps with firming the appearance of delicate eye areas in just 10 minutes and lavish and pampering eye treatments help to reduce the look of fine lines wrinkles and crows feet and to help reveal firmer radiant revitalized and youthful looking under eyes there's also caffeine in this product with which helps to reduce the appearance of puffiness so I just wanted to show you really quick how I apply them I am gonna be doing a makeup video since I have not done one in forever I'm gonna be doing a makeup video after this and I'm just gonna go start by applying a tease so I just want to show you how I do that really quick it comes with this little spatula first of all this little spoon because the patches are very delicate and they're all like stuck together in this serum in here this is what they look like as you can tell I'm gonna using these things up so basically you just pop in here guys I'm obsessed with this product I'm obsessed I've been making sure that I do not forget this part of my regime because guys this is so bomb like Peter Thomas Roth you guys really did your thing and like I said I would not just come on here and be like oh my god this is so good oh my god this is so amazing oh my god go get it if that's not the case because I want you guys to be able to trust me and know that if I am promoting something to you guys or putting out onto something whether it's paid whether it's not that it's legit and honestly I mean a lot of people do talk about sponsorships and just you know whether or not influencers are lying or whatever the case may be but I feel like you gotta kind of just weigh it out and know you're know the person that you're taking advice from or you're being recommended something from if their person is you know just gonna promote anything for a check that's probably not the person you wanna you know you're gonna believe what they're telling you if something is good but if is somebody like me I like to make sure that I'm staring people in the right direction so I'm like I said guys you saw how easy that was I almost got carried away here and like chatting and all this but they're literally on they feel so good I also enjoy putting these in the fridge really I like to put any of my skincare and beauty products in the fridge or the freezer just because I love the cooling sensation and cooling is very good on the skin also like it's good to Isis and stuff like that cloud products are good for your skin these hydrogel patches are bomb AF this was the other sponsorship that I did with Peter Thomas Roth and this was their water drench hyaluronic cloud cream hydrating moisturizer if you guys follow me on instagram you saw that I posted this like a month ago or something like that so that was the first sponsorship that I did with them this is also a very good cream if you like water based creams and don't make anything too heavy but yeah guys make sure you go check this out and if you aren't following me on Instagram make sure you go do that and yeah thank you so much for watching oh my god okay this is the only thing about this is that these slip around so much [Music]", "ptlJVT7NZwQ": "[Applause] greetings members one in all of the salivation nation we have an unboxing here from MANET that's right this was an order that I placed after the stachy nerd made a very cool discovery about a way to save $100 using Monnaie and I was already a customer but I found the way to do it was thinking about doing it under a different account but it kind of wasn't quite sure if I should or could but with the prompting of the stacking nerd I went ahead and took a chance and did it and it went through and it occurred and so we're gonna take a look and see what it is inside here so let's see if we can make this happen and try to do it because I know they usually have in there and their packages here decorative box and I don't want to mess that deck or the box up here so we are going to attempt to do this in a way that is OK going to be fragile and let's see here see if we can make this happen here there we go alright very good right we got some paperwork here I just want to review this off screen here and see what this is Foreman a and make sure they didn't put me a lump of coal in there nope no lump of coal very good and let's see okay very good so I took that's the receipt there and we've have product right there it comes all the money packages come in this cool box which is really neat in blue stuffing paper and there's a bag that comes with it which is nice if this packaging is really quite something else and I really like what they do with the packaging and the reason why it should there's several reasons why I chose this particular thing that I'm gonna show you here I've got a certificate of authenticity that tells of the size and and I'm gonna be a little bit critical of the name because they they pride themselves in transparency however upon the brief overview of this here they're not quite as transparent as I think they should be about some of the some of the things but there's a good savings I got this for a little over spot and it is a ring yes another ring you may remember the platinum ring I got from Monnet almost a half an ounce well this time we've got ourselves another ring it is the ring of power indeed it is these little bags are hard to open and this is my first criticism of Monnaie and then I with for the Rings I think they should put in a you know ring case a typical ring case a little clamshell you you shut instead of these boxes that they that they do I think that'd be much better than then these bags is it so hard to get it out of the bag man that's hard to get out there we go there it is the Ring of Power look at that 24 karat gold band very cool and aged nice and shiny and it's just neatest got that weight to it so let's take a look at it closer they're interesting the inside is kind of brushed a bit and but it is a very very nice I'm gonna actually weigh the thing let's see here troy ounces it weighs 0.37 troy ounces if you can see that there point three seven troy ounces which is let's go into the grams eleven point six grams alright now this is my first criticism of monnet 11.6 grams alright that's how they weigh it so on the receipt it says eleven point six six grams which is which is fine so that's good when the certificate of authenticity it says eleven point five two grams so which is it I don't know does it mean that it's eleven point five two grams of pure gold because others people were saying that with 24 karat gold can be marked as such and it's not if it's assayed it can still be twenty three point something care so I don't know how they how they do that but as you can see here on the inside of this if I could zoom in on it it says Minh a 24k and I'm hoping that 24 karat means that it's it's 999 fine but it may be 9 9 9 8 or 9 9 8 fine so I don't know there I think in the jewelry industry it's a little bit there's a little bit more leeway there for it so that is a little bit strange now the other thing too is they the other criticism I've have of monnet as well is they do have a transparent pricing model which tells you the price you pay above spot which is good but the spot price only changes it changes very little so if the prices go down that may change like you know once like a couple of times a day maybe at the most it does not change often in fact I've seen it where we're going was the whole day without changing and so there's one criticism of another criticism of them but other than that I think it's nice and it was a great deal I went ahead and splurged to get this at just over spot for a decent price over with $100 off there also would've been like uh it would have been a hundred and I basically paid about $40 over spot for this with the coupon which is a good price for jewelry for sure and 24 karat jewelry now the other reason why I bought this bandit is I think if you you have to spend over $75 a thing to get free shipping and wanting to get the free shipping and there was no tax on it either which is nice so that worked out really well now the other thing the other reason why I got this is because I have a problem people I've got a real problem everywhere I go chicks just just come on you know they're just all over me you know asking me you know hey you know you're good-looking you know and because of that I've got to I figured I better put this on to keep the chicks away oh yeah so this will now keep the chicks away what do you think all right now they won't badger me anymore of course I'm just totally kidding I'm totally kidding I'm not that narcissistic but I think in a way it's kind of neat to have this band because it reminds me of the Lord of the Rings the Ring of Power hmm my precious and now I have it in pure gold precious yes pure 24-karat gold so I like it so that's kind of and you know if awared if I do wear this thing like you know I could wear it around I'll never be poor and most by the way most bands are gold in the United States in Western nations is about between 10 14 and 18 karat gold so this is 24 karat gold the boy you can really tell by the weight of it and so it's nice to have something but I wanted to thank especially the stacking there for finding this just amazing to find this deal out there on this particular on and I could have paid a hundred and some odd dollars for a small little charm or something like that but have been very very tiny and probably would have gotten gotten it for like you know sixteen bucks or whatever and saved a lot that way but you know what I figured you know I'm gonna go and get something big save on shipping no taxes and have something that I don't know I might wear this thing I don't know what do you think you know what I mean I could I'm married to the community people all right very good so I'm gonna just slap that right on there but I do wish they would have I really do wish they would have put it in a clamshell cuz this thing it's an empty box within a box and in this little bag which is pretty cool but this is how they always ship their stuff it'd be nice if it came in a clamshell you know a regular ring case I might have to get one of those to store it look at that the art of the ring very nice so what do you think folks you like it thanks again to the stacking nerd for the for the the great tip on how to save and to get yourself some real gold wearable wealth right there alright very good so post your thoughts below thanks again the statute nerd I'll post a link to her channel in the description below check her channel out for great deals almost every day she's posting these works hard at it some great deals and this is just another case where is able to take advantage of it a multitude of gratitude to you all for watching and would encourage you to please rate comment share and subscribe [Music] you [Music]",

"DgqHjF_HFbw": "today I'm gonna show you how to make real 24 karat gold dice at least suspended in resin and this process will work for pretty much any nice so sit back relax while I show you how to make some equality is that a freaking one on my first roll these dice suck this mold-making process is going to be very similar to the ones we've done before except we're using a different type of silicon mold we're using slow 15 this makes a little bit harder of their mold and a little bit more durable of one so you can be rough with it and it's just a little bit more forgiving we're gonna do the same technique that we've done before and I just want to go over this process again and a little bit clearer picture and show you some new steps that I found that make it a little bit easier so we're gonna take two sets of dice one full set of seven RPG dice and one set of small d6 ones we're gonna hot glue the d6 ones to the RPG dice now when I say hot glue these use a tiny tiny amount of glue zooming in here you can see how little it is we really want there to be not a lot at all so that it's easy to clip off later a lot of people have said they've had problems trying to do this I think it might be that you're using too much hot glue because when you make a mold of this that's gonna all turn into rezident that's really hard to cut through now the purpose of gluing two of these together is the small D sixes are gonna act like a funnel you could really use anything you want anything that you don't really care about like a marble or something we're going to glue these to the bottom of some disposable cups which will actually be the top of our molds because no silicone will be able to get to where we're gluing is you can see there's a lot of empty space there now I'm gonna glue a bunch of these down so that they're all in those cups and now we need to make the silicone that will go around these to actually make the mold again we're using slow 15 it just makes a harder mold and I like it better you can still use the other one this one just makes the mold a little bit more reusable I fill up three of these small disposable cups and fill them into a larger mixing Cup because we're gonna turn this into silicone I'm not where about using my silverware on this it will peel right off of your cups and or your silicone so three cups of one part and three cups of the other part I can't just weigh these out because it's by volume a lot of people ask that the way these are done is by volume so you need to make sure that you put three equal volume parts of this stuff and mix this and when I say mix this mix it until your arms are sore it has to be one even color a lot of people have problems with their mold having failures it's because you didn't mix it enough 99% of the time pouring the silicone is actually just as important as mixing the way you pour can induce bubble into your molds I try and pour to the edge of it so that it can fill up like rising water in a bath II try and pour it on top you're just asking for bubbles to happen so I'm gonna zoom in here so you can see a little better about what I'm talking about if you pour on one side it tends to pull up from the bottom rather than from the top down where air can't escape so try and do it to one side and that should help remove any bubbles if you are experiencing that specific problem go ahead and fill up the rest of them and try and tap any air out that you can by just smacking it on the table now we get to my favorite part which is dealing with real gold I got these little jars of 24 karat gold that's really thin when we went up to the mountain on vacation recently and this is as much as what comes out of one single jar so I struggled to get it all out of there and I have quite a few jars full of this stuff and I thought that was gonna be enough but that is not enough gold that's not enough gold even fill one dice that I want so I ordered some extra that 24 karat edible gold on Amazon I figured I could use this for multiple purposes so it was pretty cheap I got enough to where I could just take it and rip it apart it's super thin so that works for pouring the resin it works for everything that I want it to so I just grabbed some extra sheets of this it was like ten dollars for this box and it says it's 24 karat gold you can see it blow just from my breath I assume it's thin enough that it is actual gold I could be very wrong here I very aware of that but it is super pretty and I was told it's 24 karat gold so I am telling you that it's 24 karat gold baby now I don't know what happened to the footage of me cutting the dice open but you know what that's okay I can do a dramatization so with the straw mat ization I take a knife I cut around the silicon and out pops the dice that as a big money dramatization right there I spend all the money on gold you can't blame me for it either way you can check out the shotgun dice video if you want to see how I do it but I just take an exacto knife and run it around the edge of the mold from that the dice pops right out now I use tape now instead of rubberband to kind of cinch these things up and I pinch the edges so it's as tight as it can be rubber bands seem to deform my molds and I didn't like that back to working with the gold we're gonna use the same resin that we used last time which is art and glow resin it doesn't actually glow that's just the name of it I let it sit in an extremely hot sink water bath so that the resin becomes extremely flowy and falls into the molds a lot easier it's actually pretty thick stuff so if it doesn't pour out like water like this I would really recommend you going and letting it sit in a hot water bath it just makes the whole process easier it falls into the molds cracks so much better doing this again is another mix until your arm falls off kind of day that you have to do the same way with the silicone now we go ahead and pour it in with the gold and there's so little gold because it's very thin this actually won't weigh your dice down so it's gonna be a pretty well-balanced dice at least it was when I tested it at the end mix this up for a good minute or so we want to make sure that there's no piece of gold without any resin on it and now we can begin filling the molds if you have a long disposable squeeze bottle this is really great and an easy way to fill these things up I use these little pipettes and now I've found an even better way to use them in my opinion I fill the top little funnel part and if your resin flows right in there great the gold kind of prevented it from doing that in mind I fill the top funnel part and then I actually sucked the air out of the mold with my little pipette it creates this kind of suction effect where it pulls the resin down into the mold while at the same time taking the air out of the mold so I get less failures in my dice because I'm pulling the air out of them and by the time that it fills all the way up to the top and no more resin goes down I know that I've got a pretty good set of dice and you can see when I open this one up here this is a pretty good d6 there's not a lot of air bubbles in this so I was really happy with how these turned out I like this mold and now we're gonna kind of show you how to do a bit of the cleanup but before we do the cleanup you can see that this is a perfectly reusable mold I'll probably do this on the next few sets that I make I use a set really sharp flat-bottomed model shears I use them for my miniatures they're designed to cut plastic they work great here I lay the flat part right up against the dies and cut tiny bits out of where it's connected this will give me a perfectly angled edge to the dice which is fantastic don't force it take off little bits at a time or else you're going to cut parts that you don't want to now you can hand sand it I have a dremel so I'm gonna use the Dremel any bits that are sticking out like this either with a hand sander or your shears if you're confident in it go ahead and just sand it down until you get some smooth surface that looks just like the other edges of the dice now you're gonna get some rough parts on there but that's okay there's a really easy way to fix this without having to go get plastic polish and have it to spend a ton of time making it super shiny if you're a little embarrassed by this you're gonna have to get over it because this is a dollar at the dollar store and it's essentially resin this is top base coat for nail polish I was going through the dollar store and I saw this and I thought man that would be an easy solution for this so as you take this out just kind of wipe the nail polish off so using just a extremely small amount and it will fill in those resin gaps for you it's completely clear and it lasts just as long as regular resin cuz that's essentially what it is and you can see as I'm applying it to this d6 here it just disappears once it dries you've got your dice ready to go and you didn't have to spend hours or minutes really polishing I decided to go with white for the numbers because it didn't detract from the gold and it also kind of stood out against the gold to do this you just completely fill in where the numbers are with paint over fill it don't use too little or else it won't look right over fill it with paint and then wipe it off with a paper towel you can also use your thumb to get any excess off and you have a completely filled number it's not complicated you don't have to be an amazing artist I took the rest of them fill them in and bam we've got our completed set of 24 karat gold dice this is by far my favorite set of dice that I've made I love how because the gold is so light it actually floats in the resin and doesn't all sink to the bottom so the whole thing is filled with gold it just looks so pretty I love the D 12th the numbers are so big on it they just pop on all angles really really happy with how these came out I'm sorry I've had a bit of a content drought sometimes life just comes at you fast and you just got to deal with stuff but I've noticed that we're so close to

how the famous hundred dollar golden donut gets made so the golden donut it came out after our first DJ and donut event I made a white IPA donut and it had the gold dust on it and then for New Year's I wanted to give a gift kind of to my staff and to celebrate the family and so I made a this cold doughnut and then I posted it on Instagram and and it turns out people wanted to buy it so so there wasn't like one moment where you realize that you wanted to make a gold leaf a freestyle doughnut there there was that one moment where I was actually sitting with a new bed donut a regular move a doughnut the purple one and I was just drinking champagne and I was like oh this really goes great together so I decided to put that together and then I was trying to figure out how to make it really outrageous and we put the gold on but the gold doesn't add anything to the flavor it could add some excitement and everything and we eat with our eyes right but it's really the the flavor of crystal just works so well with Ruby if we wanted to make an expensive doughnut I could have used ace of spades but it doesn't taste as good as crystal and eBay is like a common vegetable and the feta penis it's yeah it is a common it's something that's used all over the place for desserts and everything so can you walk me through the process of how this becomes this right the the doughnut at its base most basic form is just a regular cruller style doughnut with a gold doughnut we fill it with an ube mousse and a champagne gel and then we we dust it with 24 karat gold and then we put the so what is $100 golden and Castel donut tastes like let you figure that one out [Music] Wow do you think it's amazing it's I know that a lot of people think oh it's just a gimmicky it's just be expensive but really it's what we do here at the restaurant it's more than glitz and glamour it is really about the food and the people yeah you know that's I think we've achieved it with that thank you so what

today we're at a really cool spa called lake powell located in utah and today we're here for a little rescue mission today we're going to be scuba diving and searching for a missing Apple watch now this isn't just a typical Apple watch this is actually one of three gold Apple watches that's been created in the entire world a guy named Jerry rigged everything made a custom gold Apple watch for his wife Casey nice that and a guy named Dan from the channel what's inside so Dan was out here and join his day with his family him and his daughter jumped off this little cliff side and long story short lost his gold Apple watch for what he thought was forever I messaged umm I was like hey man I'd love to get out here and try to find it for you and he took me up on it so we're out here I'm gonna scoop it up and see if I can find this missing gold Apple watch is not only probably pretty expensive but it's also really sentimental because one of his best friends Jerry rigged everything made that for him so for him to lose that it just hits hard you know so we're out here I'm gonna try my very best hopefully we get lucky if you enjoy this video leave a like make sure you guys are subscribed to my youtube channel but with that said I'm gonna get my scuba gear and jump in the water and start metal detecting for this missing gold Apple watch so this is my buddy Dan from the channel what's inside dan can you tell us a little bit about your YouTube channel and also how you lost a special watch first of all I can't believe that you came all the way out here to do this this is amazing so we have YouTube channel where we cut things open and see what's inside of them it's me and my son has started with the 2nd grade science project and then it turned into us cutting things open and then we also have a family channel where we show our unique experiences and we come to this place Lake Powell all the time and this is like a nice cliff jumping place and I had this special watch that only three people in the world had Casey nice tat my friend Zach from Jerry read everything his wife and then me and then I didn't realize it was on my wrist and it comes off so easily and it's in there somewhere so it's it's a watched it's like a gift from a really really good friend so I obviously know it's not gonna work anymore but I want to have this thing because it's kind of rude of me to just not even to just throw it in a lake and forget about it so if I can have this thing and like put it on the wall and have it it'd be amazing so I really preciate you coming all the way I think we're trading like good adventures you know I'm gonna try to find his Apple watch for him but also like just experience right here is a treasure in itself I just can't believe I'm here man this place is so beautiful and like I've told you before it just feels like we're on the surface of Mars like it really is and this is a very popular place for people to jump in and it's like secluded most of the lake is - 300 400 feet deep where you wouldn't go scuba diving for things but I would bet that you're gonna find not just my watch but you're gonna find a lot of stuff down here so I'm hoping hopefully even if it's just the watch that but if it's more stuff there's gonna be fun experience I'm so excited man so hopefully you ever get lucky and that we didn't come out here in vain but give me a shot man let's do it so this is Dan in London all right right there okay that was one of the first time you look there's a crack wait is that that same crack yeah that's that same crack right there oh yeah oh yeah because the water was flowing in and out of here looks like you're a holding your nose man of course do not hold your nose so based off this video I can have the precise location where he jumped and basically that's where I'm gonna start searching once I start searching the waters gonna get super murky and then I'm just gonna go by Phil and what I hear with the metal detector but I think off of this footage we're gonna have a little bit of a jump to know where this Apple watch is that well yeah man you gotta work on your style I'm a little nervous we flew all the way out here from Atlanta we drove two hours to get here it was an hour boat ride so everything is lining up the funnest gold Apple watch I'm gonna be a little disappointed if I don't find it I'm gonna try my absolute best so we can bring it home for him but got the metal detector got my scuba gear let's jump on the water and see if we can find it all right guys so I've got like one shot into this water super murky hopefully we can find it here we go alright so we just made it to spot we walked from the far side upon so we didn't get this spot super murky as we're walking underwater let me turn the metal detector on what we're listening for is a high-pitched noise and once we locate on something like that I've got my metal scooper we're gonna scoop into the sand and hopefully find this gold Apple watch humpers that we're finding it for sure really I'm gonna say 70% just because there might be a lot of dirt on top of where it felt it's been a few months but if it's there he'll find it negative 10 to be clear Steve is the one that stupid last time so he's very competitive and if somebody else finds it and feels like they did his job I just found something with a metal detector and I'm filling it with my hands I can't see it but it feels like a watch I see what it is all right I found some cool things so far I haven't found you watch it but don't see what I thought all right so we've been metal detecting for like 30 minutes it's so beautiful down there physic you're on another like different role I mean this is a different world but like that's pretty cool too yeah but I found a couple cool things okay cool first fine I did find a watch no way cuz it's just so murky yeah I found that funny how did that one come off as velcro on and everything that's it I mean that's stronger than man okay so there is a watch we have hope did that in the middle yeah that'll take you picked it up and what's crazy it's like I couldn't see when I found this someone going like this and I moved all this stuff around the mic no oh my gosh that is awesome I did not expect that you're a good actor he doesn't think he's had a good actor but I thought for sure he didn't have it okay so how long did it take you to find this thing I found it out probably within 15 minutes okay zero percent they were sure to ask me even Joe was asking me he's like did you really lose the watch down here are you sure you lost it yes I lost it here is the proof guys and thank you for your help bringing us out here thank you I can't believe you found it that's cool how long has it been looks really cool since July 4th of July it has this interesting little you see the outer layer of that like the water got in it usually doesn't have that on the screen so it's definitely got quite a bit of water in there I'm gonna charge that bad boy up though let's see what happens I don't know like I feel like you know Zach he's the one that gave it to me he fixes things he takes things apart and sees him from the inside I wondered before we even take it apart all right before we even try to power it up maybe he just like takes it apart and drains it and stuff and then because I know if you turn it on with any water it's probably just be toasted does that it that's pretty cool I can't believe you found one of the things I loved about your videos is that and you guys would probably you know you watch these videos all the time but it's like when you're diving and you find something you're like yeah it's like this high pitched like squeal noise you're happy like even when you find like a little fish what do you call it the fish the little flute don't like the learners learn here did you make any noise this is so good I feel like I need to pay you for like an IV here dude this is like this is the payment like coming out like look I'm gonna just do a 360 around like check out this place you guys it's just so beautiful we're the only people on this lake right now and we're just enjoying ourselves and I'm so happy I was able to get that back today so we need to at least take you surfing and see if you have you surf behind the boat Steve will give you a payment on that one have like a little syllabic about it I can't breathe either it was so much fun man it's cool I can't believe you found it you believe that so we just showed everyone the Apple watch everyone's freaking out but check it out one more time I honestly can't believe I got lucky enough to find it I feel super super lucky and we're gonna be giving us back to Dan but I do want to say before I do that I want to let you guys know if you lose anything doesn't matter what it is iPhones GoPros watches like this anything feel free to email me and I'm gonna have a specific email in the description box below don't email me anything else because that might take away an opportunity for me to find someone else's stuff for free so with that said feel free to email me and tell me what you lost when he lost it how you lost it and maybe I'll go up there and make a video and try to find it for free but now we're gonna be handing over to Dan you go bud this is amazing thank you for coming all the way out here I don't know how to repay you like this is it this is the the reward like this place is a treasure in itself and now what we're gonna do is hop on the boat and I think he said we're gonna go surfing how good are you you I know you're gonna scuba diving how good are you surfing I'm alright I'm not like the best but I could be fun alright [Music] right I that's our no way to die wait

"kwfCuV1066g": "guys house everyone do it out there I am super pumped and super excited I got something really cool to show you today I'm gonna open this box guys and I want to welcome you to my unicorn let's see what it is and there it is guys the 24 karat gold Desert Eagle of one of these for one of these for a lot of years guys now this is not to be confused with the titanium gold which is a totally and absolutely different finish it's a dull gold that they use to coat drill bits in for people that do construction work and even though the pictures shows the titanium gold is a bright color I guarantee you and assure you it is not bright at all this is the one and only guys very hard to find even on the internet I think the only ones I found on the internet was a 357 magnum on gun broker other than that guys these are not that easy to come by so let's talk about this I got this on the used market let's just go ahead and go over the details and guys this thing is like brand new I was told it was never fired cannot verify that don't care I'm just looking at the condition it's in and you know just the way everything is still has the tag I want it and there it is guys I just got this not long ago and I had been waiting and waiting just to get the time to do this to do a video for you guys oh look at Ted it's so bright it's like making my camera go crazy guys the 24 karat Eagle Oh first of all let me go ahead and tell you too that this example is in 44 Magnum now I know a lot of people say that you know desert Eagles should only be in 50 and this and that the other thing well I was okay with this being in 44 Magnum because some of you may or may not know I already have a brushed chrome in 50 caliber so while I do prefer the 50 and a desert eagle and if you're going to get one I always say get the 50 or get the 50 first it was okay for me to have the 44 Magnum because the 44 Magnum will shoot very well through these and I love the 44 Magnum round so instead of having to 50s I think it's cool to have a 50 and a 44 Magnum anyway so now both of mine I bought this brand new had it ordered to the gun store cut the plastic on the box this was in 2008 this is Israeli weapon industries iwi made in Israel and it's got the older style two slots on top this is a little bit newer but this is not the car arms buyout this is still as you can see right there Israeli or Israel weapons industries iwi made in Israel so for me I really like that that it still has that on there and it's still marked like that and guys I'm gonna tell you I'm not gonna clear this on camera I know it's not loaded and you have to have the hammer back anyway to fire it for your first round there's no way to fire it right now but yeah guys I'm gonna give you some close-ups here in a little bit so let's talk about this let me give you a backstory on this okay now I know somebody whose uncle owned this gun and from what I was told and I hope they don't mind me saying and I'm probably pretty sure they won't because I will never tell the names or anything like that of who this is but his uncle is well off with money his uncle owns two businesses I'm not gonna say what the businesses are but the businesses are both very good so the guy is definitely not hurting for any kind of money he buys what he wants he pays cash whenever he wants well I was told that there was something going on and for whatever reason he was staying somewhere out of town and he had a bottle of whiskey and he was drinking whiskey looking around on the internet and when he woke up in the morning he had an email from gun broker that said congratulations on your purchase of a 24 karat gold Desert Eagle and I guess from what I'm told he had no idea that while he was indulging in alcohol late the night before that this is what he purchased so anyway he had received this gun this has to be pre 2012 because like I said it's not a car arms and he says he just basically looked at it put it in a safe and that's that's about it so now I have it I have about twelve hundred dollars into this so that's not too bad and I'm just I'm really happy with it guys it's it was a funny thing is is I did dry fire this a couple of times and the funny thing is is the trigger feels a little bit better than on my then on my brushed chrome one why why that is I don't know but the trigger just seemed to feel just a little bit just a little bit better but it was just where the wall is where the brake is this was just a little bit crisper on the trigger pool this is not bad either you guys desert eagles are really really an accurate gun and I'm going to tell you a couple of reasons why now go ahead and pull this back one of the reasons why as guys this boat is similar to a 308 rifle see the lugs and how they lock in here and it's gas piston run so when this when this bolt closes this barrel never moves it's stationary so when you shoot this round and you're using this lug locked up into here like a 308 rifle would be or a smaller version would be looking at like an AR that is one of the reasons why this gun is so accurate when I was younger I used to think man is it just me this this desert eagle seems I've had him in the past I haven't shot this one that much but I said these desert Eagles seem really accurate to me I couldn't figure it out then as I got to know more and learn more about this platform and how this moves the barrel stationary you have a non-moving barrel okay there's no rotating barrel all that accounts for things the lug the way it locks in here holds the bullets so securely when it's locked into the chamber they're all that just lends itself to the awesome accuracy of the Desert Eagle okay guys so let me go ahead and pick up my unicorn I'm gonna give you some close-ups right now and let you look at it nice and up-close all right guys here we go let's take some nice close-up shots just see the loveliness of the 24k gold Desert Eagle now this is a finish that you have to be careful with and you have to watch this gun can be fired some people think that it can't it can be fired you have to be careful with it and you have to be careful with how you clean the finish on these 24 karat gold desert eagles one of the reasons that makes them so rare and that is it that is one of the reasons now the brushed chrome is much more forgiving my other one and what I like too is like how they did like they made this on that gold here this is a matte gold and where your grip is here where you would hold it a lot and down here where you would enter the magazine they like a flat gold and all the 24 karat gold is up higher on these parts so underneath here they left this a more durable finish right there yes you can shoot these there's guys that shoot them there is a couple of videos of a 24 karat gold desert eagle on YouTube there it is guys I just had to show you let me know what you think it's not for the man that has no gun I've got a collection of guns so you know I know there's gonna be people that says you know why would you want that or it's a novelty or this and that the other thing guys I collect guns I have several firearms I can go out and do whatever I want with so it's always nice to have a collection where you have a couple of stunners like this you can pull out every once in a while look at the other thing is - this will never degrade in price it will only go higher especially - because it's from the old company these will probably never ever be made in Israel again and there are people that like these ones they're Israel Israeli made so they also left the front the more matte gold color the muzzle end and in between your rail sections up here I'm definitely a desert eagle fan alright guys there it is let me know what you think I love this baby I'm gonna put her back to sleep and the safe alright guys until next time this is d o F and I am", "RJLipjyKmwI": "hello in a sauna come everyone welcome

welcome back to my channel and today's video so the Swedish word of the day is gold which is the Swedish good eater good a lot of you guys have been complaining about the fact that you haven't seen Sega in a while so here yes usually when I record he is in my lap yeah so he is with me you just cannot see him he didn't agree ball in today's video I'm going to compare the Natasha turn on a gold palette to the w7 24 carats Oh gold rush palette so I found this in store you guys know I love my Natasha de Nonna palette I'm just gonna show it to you in case you haven't seen it so this is what the nutrition on a gold palette looks like I think I'm gonna show it to you guys later on as well and then this is the w7 palette which is obviously a dupe for the gold palette from Natasha de Nonna and the price is pretty different I'm actually wearing both palettes but on different eyes so let me know which side you think is the W center side I'm gonna close my eyes you can see so yeah let me know which side do you think is the W sign outside so what I'm going to do is that I am going to show you guys how I got this look and then I'm going to talk about what I thought about the palette and if it's worth it or not I'm not gonna swatch the palette i'm actually gonna swatch it right now off camera and then i'm gonna show you the comparison so like i'm gonna swatch them right next to each other so we can kind of see how they are okay great so before I start off applying eyeshadow to my ice I'm gonna show you guys both of the palettes so first and foremost this is did Natasha you know Nepal let this has been very very used by me so don't worry about it looking your messy because I use this a lot and this is the w7 24 carats gold and I haven't even swatched this so this so this is what it looks like so I'm going to start off taking this color from the initial anona palette I don't know what it's called Dashon and I'm actually gonna take this on my bad eye this is my bad eye this is the good I just so the w7 palette doesn't get any like so it's not unfair so I'm just gonna take it right here I don't know if you have seen me use the nitrogen owner palette that much I have done some Instagram videos with it and I talked about it a lot and I have told you guys that I do really like it so I thought that I would just mainly kind of focus on what I think about the performance of the w7 palette I'm very very interested in likes watching them and seeing how how they work okay so this deshaun color is a little bit more of like a musty shade and now that I'm looking at this palette the W Sun I wanna see that this is their will shade that we're gonna have to use this is the shake millions and this is definitely not the same sort of color but maybe it will show up like that on the eye so I just used my little w7 color switch cleaned it off and now I'm gonna take the shade millions it has some kick up but the Natasha didn't know no problems has kicked up as well so let's see and we're using this in my crease Wow it was way better than I thought I was so scared of the color being completely off so this is actually a little bit more mustardy than this color is which it's really surprising but hey let's keep it going so what I'm gonna do now is that I'm actually gonna take this color right here from the nutrition and ona palette this is a blue color but it is one of her thing to powder formula I'm not a huge fan of it but I think that it it works and it's okay and I'm actually just gonna pack it all over my lid and I'm gonna go over it with another color leader so this is really really easy to kind of just pack on so sit it's like a cream to powder formula I feel like it's super easy to get very very evenly sometimes when you pack on mats on top of your lid if you have some form of lines or something you know if you aren't 15 anymore you have some lines or if you have hooded eyes like me some sheets can actually kind of not realistic and it can look kind of patchy but I feel like with her cream to powder formula it definitely doesn't do that since it is a cream to powder formula I'm just gonna packing this all the way up here so I'm just gonna end it right here I'm obviously gonna put this out later on but I wanted to pack it on on this eye as well and just for reference we're gonna use the shade filthy-rich which is this one and as you can see right off the bat it's not an ice opaque just didn't interested in on are on but hopefully we can kind of like build it up and just work with it a little bit more which it seems to be doing quite well oh my god you guys my feet hurt like a mother effer I've bought some new shoes that I've showed you guys on my Instagram and one of the heels is a little bit higher than I would have liked them to be just like a centimeter or two or three and my feet hurt so I have to look kind of like every time it takes it out for a walk I have to put them on so that I will learn my foot to deal with them but they're so nice I've never been a shoe gal I've always like I've always liked my sneakers not always but I like my sneakers the past couple of years you know air mass air force and all of those like just adidas in general or naik or whatever it is now I'm all about the boots and like the heels and fashion and yeah I'm really spend a lot more money on like fashion and you know new jackets new shoes new whatever so let me know if you would like me to do like an updated little wardrobe style video fashion whatever video for y'all plus-sized women and cows women and boys okay anyway let's look at this situation right here isn't it beautiful it was way more work which you could see but it actually is a pretty spot-on dupe this is a little bit more patchy in some places and I didn't build this up as much as I build it this one up but I'm going to cover this center with another shade and I thought that I wouldn't like focus too much on it becoming even because that's not gonna matter later on anyway so it was a little bit more work but you can't right this is the hardest part for me because I feel like I don't really have a shade that I can blend out the the blue so I think I'm going to have to take that dishon color and this is just like a BH Cosmetics brush I got this on sale and let me tell you everyone it's like all sake mother/son great use my code I must take my affiliate affiliate fit I'm Sigma affiliate I've talked about this before I'm like the worst person with codes and such I've talked about the codes that I have in my description box like if you want to shop through Beauty Bay or Urban Decay or look fantastic or whatever please use that but I'm so bad at like oh use this code however Sigma they have amazing brushes and really love them but honestly BH Cosmetics they have also some amazing amazing brushes and I've bought some of their brush kits and they're the vegan line that they have is incredible this little brush kit it's really really nice there's a few brushes that I'm not using but it's because of the shape of the brush and I specifically like the that the brush is bad and I've had them for quite a while now and I feel like they yeah they're really really good just talking about brushes like in general because on this channel and especially if you watch this video not everyone wants to spend this amount of money on a palette or I'm just gonna take my brush that I had but not everyone wants to spend $20 on one eyeshadow brush or a foundation brush or whatever it is so I just wanted to recommend that so that you could go out and buy BH Cosmetics brushes if you want to get like a good deal because they are really good if I lost all of my makeup and all my makeup brushes I would probably buy two sets from BH Cosmetics and just start off with two different sets not the same set but two different sets so you have like a variety of brushes I'm just gonna take a little bit more of this cream to powder formula from Natasha and hack on so the Metropole is palette actually just came to Sweden and I'm like should I buy it but then I saw that it's way more expensive than her normal palettes and it's not actually supposed to be that so I was like Sephora are you playing me are you playing us they are but I'm not gonna buy that I have the colour-pop no I have the morphe 35n palette boss mode palette which i think is a good dupe for that and I don't use that one enough so what it really is the Dutch adenomas thought but much made the mark oh my god speaking about support I I've been meaning to say this for so long so I just want to say before I start off blending this out what I actually did with the this palette is that I actually took the shade deshaun and then I added in a little bit of this or it kind of just tucked up top and then one two taps in that one and blended it out so it adds a little bit of glitter to it but it blended out pretty decently in my opinion I think I'm gonna do the same on this eye which is then the shade millions and the shade dirty cash Takashi but Sephora anyway like I see so many people in America being like oh I got this for free at Sephora and whatnot so Sephora in Sweden has a buy two of fenty products and you will get one Fanta beauty sample of her foundation get it while it's hot baby I mean I was like are you serious so you get a sample I could get get a sample for free if I go into a store I could be like hey I want to try this foundation but I don't know if I'm gonna like it could you please give me a sample of this so I can try it at home and they would be like yes yes yes of course here take it and on their website it's like you know by 250 products and get a sample of the foundation they're playing us they're totally playing us I actually think that this blend it out a little bit better sure it looks patcher on the eyelid but I think it blended out better so going back to the nono palette this is the shade lime chrome I'm going to take which is one of my personal favorites I'm just gonna take this in the center how do I like that I'm going to take the shade which is this is my favorite combination ever I'm gonna take this and then I'm gonna take this on top so I know I've already gone in with a little bit but I'm basically just gonna cover this up so there we go and now I'm taking the chroma shade the first shade that I took and just going to go on top of this taking a little bit more of that cream to powder shade at the blue shade just in the edges this is what I'm really really nervous about and like real really excited about because the masks they have been good I'm so insecure if they have really captured the essence like the beautifulness and the sparkle and everything that Natasha rinona has to those shimmers so golden boy and so solid which are these two these two are the ones that we're gonna use today so here they are hope your Enfocus definitely not bad wow it has a lot of dimension a sparkle to it let me start off with the shade golden boy in the center so this seems to be a bit more pigmented and it has way more fallout going in with the shades so solid on top of this well Wow I'm gonna finish up the rest of my makeup I'm just gonna keep it super easy under the eyes to just take the the blue shade and then blend it out with the shade the mustardy shade and then I'll be back to tell you guys my final thoughts so here we have this watch yes I should have done this better actually but I just wanted to say on the top is the natasha de Nonna on the bottom is the w7 one thing to note is that the natasha de Nonna palette contains 15 shapes versus the w7 that contains a 14 shades which means that they have not tried and duped one shade which is this one right here I wish actually that they had a dupe this instead of duping both of these shades that you can see right here one thing as well is that I have layered these shadows the natasha rinona shadows only needed one swipe versus the w7 one that needed more swipes I'll just show you a little close-up I feel like I'm going away more and more but here it can anyways see most of the shades so whilst watching I actually took my blazer off so I'm just gonna show you this this is the w7 and this is the Natasha de Nonna one and then Natasha de no one looks paler towards the w7 one that looks way more vibrant because I swatch with my fingers and I use like a baby wipe when I you know when i swatched with my fingers I wiped off and then I go into the next so one of the mats in the w7 palette got hard pan and I don't know if it is because maybe my finger was a little bit wet I wipe it off my pants just so like I get off like all of the excess water so to speak or like the liquid but it did get hard upon anyway so I don't know if it was the shadow or if it was me but I have to kind of go in with my nail and you know remove a lot of shadow which meant that I got like a lot of loose shadow here so this is why it's a little bit more vibrant I would say laser is on so let's continue with the review just very very briefly talking about the Natasha de Nona palette I wanted to say that this is one of my most used palettes this year if not the palette that I've used the most I love this palette but what I wanted to say is that I did not buy this palette because of the mattes I bought it because of the shimmers it is so many different formulas in this palette you have shimmer you have glitter you have dual chrome so you have toppers you have a cream to powder sort of shimmer you have foils you have a bunch of different textures and formulas which you know I'm obsessed with that I love it that it's not just normal shimmers so to me that is like the best thing ever so for me I was like you know what if the mattes in this palette the w7 palette works then I will be very very surprised or I will be very very curious to see if they have captured the shimmer essence like Natasha de Nona has and they have and they have not so let me just explain a little bit they have the knock down like a cream to powder formula or looking at this palette you know the textures kind of look almost the same when you look at the shimmer shadows I'm sorry mine got a little bit beat up when I was watching it so to me I thought that they would never ever fix it but going in with the mattes you know just looking at them as you could see in the review I was not sure if they were going to keep up with the og palette but they actually did I only used to mattes but I feel like the blue shadow was good but you kind of had to build it up now that's not a problem because it's not like it's a unpigmented shadow because it's definitely not it just means that you might need to go in one two or three extra times which is very very common when it comes to drugstore palettes in my personal opinion and I can I feel like sometimes that's good as well because sometimes if you are unexperienced or if you maybe just want a little bit of like that blue in your outer corner for instance maybe it's a good thing that it doesn't pack a punch because then it will be kind of harder to blend away versus here you can just go in with a little bit more shadow if you need to and then the shimmers mind-blown swatching them side to side they must have bought the Metatrader Nona palette the original gold palette and made an effort to try and do each and every shadow because they did it and they would not have been able to do it if they were just sitting at home and watching videos on swatch picture I feel like they really took the time to look at each and every color because just just this glitter shadow for instance this glitter shadow contains like it has a white base but then it contains like a gold reflex to where like it contains small small gold shimmer particles to it you cannot see it on camera but it is very very efficient in real life I feel like they definitely try to do this shade as well I think that this shade is like the worst shade which is sort of like the topper shade it's not a bad shade but it doesn't have like a that same like punch like the Natasha to know Nepal it has this shadow however beautiful which is the one that I have on my lid with this on top they captured it they real really did and I am so surprised because I I would never have expected this palette which is like $10 ish it's not the exact price but you guys know what I mean versus this one hundred and $29 palette this obviously is just the first impression but I feel like they did a fantastic job that's it so if you did like this video like it if you didn't not like this video dislike it and I'll see you my next video", "sk_kw3yCajw": "[Music] hey guys what's up and welcome back to my channel as you can see today I have very bare skin I have nothing in my face and that's because I'm going to review a product for you it's called the energy beauty bar which is right here it looks like this little thing I got it from a volume and winter skincare company so basically I when I saw this I was like yep I need that it's like a anti-aging remedy and it also stimulates your skin prevents acne break except there prevents it also prevents acne breakouts and everything like that so I'm going to give it a go I'm gonna review it it's really cool vibrates which is very interesting I don't know if you guys can hear that it's actually really strong like a very strong vibrate the guy's basically this works by vibrating and what you do is you just drag it across your face and you drain out the fluid that's in there it's really good for deep huffing as well so your eyes first of all I'm going to go ahead and apply my autumn daily protect moisturizer I'm gonna put this on my face before I use the beauty ball I pretty much just like washed my face and I'm just gonna pop this stuff on and this is going to help the beauty bar to glide along my face a bit easier as well and also really work the products into my skin now this is very optional guys but I'm okay now this is very optional I'm gonna apply at my rosehip oil I apply this to my skin honestly every day I think I've already told you guys this but I applies to my skin every day without fail I apply it in the morning and at that time as well it just pretty much gives me a brighter skin and it helps to get rid of like any blemishes that I do have on my skin as well okay so that's all on alright so I'm gonna go straight into it I'm going to show you guys how to sort of do this I'm just gonna start off from here and just work my way down and this is supposed to drain all of the fluid out of your skin it like feels really um it might kinda tickles around the neck area so I'm just gonna drag this across yeah hit the pressure point on to my cheek barn and drag it up like that it also really helps with blood circulation is wrong and you're supposed to drag it out just up your face along your face muscles sounds really good pressure points under your eyes and if you had those pressure points that's supposed to reduce the puffiness from your eye socket so one two three and here as well just right where you would put your eye cream at that time how's it go from here just up above your eyebrows and this is supposed to train all of that puffy fluid all right so after using the bar I actually really really do like this the reasons being is because I can still feel tingly ninis on my face like it still feels like there's like a little vibration going through it I know it sounds really weird but you have to try it to like know where I'm coming from but also I will say that looking at my skin now it does look that a little bit firmer yeah I'm all about promoting skin circulation like I'm all about that especially when it comes to my face I love looking after my skin I'm always down for a cheap good remedy to help me out so yeah I actually really really do like this and especially for the price I mean lack what are you going to lose really um so yeah I really really like that and I look forward to using it and massaging my serums in my night time serums my morning serums it actually generally feels really really nice on my skin as well I really really do like it and I'm gonna keep using it but yeah that's that's my honest opinion guys so yeah I really hope you enjoyed that um if you guys have any questions or anything please leave a comment below and I'll get back to you and then that I quote I literally bought this from a volume it's just like this online skincare company so yeah make sure you head over I'm gonna leave the link below also guys make sure you subscribe to my channel and I'll see you guys soon", "1xI7HE6EIKM": "foreign [Music] the", "typiQaelXD4": "it says apply generously over clean face it's it's avoiding eye contact like don't look at yourself you're not gonna like how you look avoid eye contact don't do it in front of a mirror today we're trying to 24 karat face masks I've got a few face masks in my day done some magnet stuff done some normal soap stuff but certainly never put gold on my face I love all things skincare also love naturally occurring minerals so I feel like this is gonna be a fantastic combo I think it's gonna be pure gold like in my mind it's just somehow like hot liquid gold going on my face but it's probably just like speckled gold in a white I'm super excited I am the kind of person that doesn't really spend money so I'll probably never experienced anything like this outside of this room it's in a gold box I love the box me me new zone I don't know if it's actually French I just feel like when something's this fancy have to say it with a French accent I was told there were instructions there right I don't know what to do whoo it's been proven to improve skin's elasticity texture and tone and peptides whatever those are this mask apparently helps with radiance and anti-wrinkle inge and it renews yourselves there's like five paragraphs of information what this gold will do it face who cares put it on my skin let's get gorgeous apply the corrected anti wrinkling mask and massaged into the skin it smells like hotel soap very soon it smells like rose and like smoke or something on top of the mask gently put a gold leaf one for each cheek cut the leaf with scissors put half over the forehead half over the chin is leave the gold on your face for 10 minutes important do not touch with your hands directly on the gold leaf touch only the soap paper this is very there's some weird reason I'm like okay they're sheets of gold I can't touch them not really sure how I'm supposed to peel them off oh my god feels so weird it's so war wouldn't feel like the energy of the gold oh wow wow oh my god okay that side very seamless don't know what I did there you know I feel kind of ridiculous but I think that's a pretty common feeling here at BuzzFeed you asked me like would I do this again I would probably say no cuz I'm not quite sure what's happening I'm gonna eat some of this gold this girl is just gonna go to waste doesn't want to stick to my skin but you can eat gold so now that it's been on my face long enough it's time to say goodbye to the gold take off the mask wet your fingers and with a circulant massage the gold into the skin I can feel my skin getting tighter the longer I wear it I feel like this is gonna like de-age me when I take this off I'm gonna be a 14 again just kidding that would be awful [Music] cut out a little gold bits oh wow it just melts away feel so soft under the water like I expected it to kind of like feel really rough it's gonna make my face like sparkle I feel like a golden like zebra or something like my skin is showing through the class well this doesn't look as good as I imagined it did it just kind of looks like this dirty gold all over my face you tell me who I liked hotter do I look more rich they look more expensive I definitely would say that I feel refreshed I also feel like my skin feels more elastic than it did when I came in here and also has a nice shine feels like my face is really soft and moisturized beauty is all about making yourself feel good and that gold made me feel great [Music] sure", "erMqrPXtyzs": "hello everyone so the other day I got a hold of this 24 karat gold peel-off mask which is a pure luxury gold mask I will give you refresh and intensive repairs to your skin and so I wanted to try it out on camera and see if it works at all and if it helps my skin so yeah let's get to the video all right so so the instructions say clean face and dry it then apply the mask to desired area avoid eye and eyebrow and lips okay oh it kind of burns your eyes looks really shiny I didn't think he was going to I don't think putting it on your hand was a good idea so I recommend putting it directly on your face oh it's dripping so the part where I get more acne in my face is in my nose so I am trying to put more product on it okay I have my whole face covered and now the next step is leave it for 20 to 25 minutes till completely dried though I'm gonna let it dry and I'll be back okay so I'm back and this is fully dry I can't really move my face I can barely talk I hope you can understand another thing the instructions say to peel it off starting from the bottom ASMR so shiny so I was thinking this was gonna hurt and it doesn't really hurt at all never mind out oh oh it's an eyebrow the last step is to gently massage your face and cleanse with warm water so let's go do that so now I'm just gonna rinse my face and wash it okay okay so that was the 24 karat gold pilaf mask and overall it did help on these areas of my skin on the goals I don't really see a difference as of now maybe I'll try it again and maybe I'll make another video it definitely helped with some of the blackheads so my first impression it isn't the best thing in the world maybe possibly if I try it more and more times over time it will heal and help more but I don't know if you want to try it go ahead it's not a bad product it's actually really cool that it's gold and it has like actual gold I think yeah colloidal gold which is I think fragments of gold in the thing but anyways if you enjoyed this video and want to see more maybe trying some more products reviewing

you through step-by-step on how to achieve a 24 karat gold candy apple let's get into it so today we'll be using a base white candy apple now you can use whatever color you like this video will not go over how to dip or clean candy apples if you need that information please reference to my previous candy apple videos so you can get caught up on how to make candy apples but today we're just gonna paint them gold so here I have my white candy apples and the things you'll need is gold luster dust hey I use a shot glass a small cup you're going to need food grade alcohol and a paintbrush so you are going to pour a small amount of the luster dust into your cup a little bit does go a long way I didn't have many apples to make so I didn't use a whole canister of the luster dust and then you're gonna add in the food great alcohol by the cap full because you do not want your solution to be running whatsoever that will cause your apples to remain sticky and the alcohol will not dissolve so yes we want a very thick paste like consistency when you pick up your brush it should not drip if your brush is dripping that means that your consistency is a little bit runny and you just need to go in and add a little more luster don't worry the alcohol content does dissolve once the apples try so your apples will not taste like liquor at all and if you do not feel comfortable using full great alcohol you can use lemon extract so see here my consistency is nice and thick and there is no drip \u00e4j-- so once you get the desired consistency you are just going to paint your apples just like so now for the base of this recipe or not recipe for the base of painting candy apples you can have any color candy apple and I promise you guys the color of your candy apple will not show through your candy I know most people say that you can dip it yellow and then it's better to dip it yellow and paint it gold but that's not necessarily true you can have whatever color candy apple you need so let's say for example you have an order for 50 candy apples but they only want 25 of them paint it go you can go ahead and dip all of the apples in one shot and then you can go ahead and paint the others the other 25 instead of making multiple batches for candy apples so it does not matter what color your apples are underneath the goal because as you'll see here in a moment it won't show through so you're going to go ahead and paint the entire Apple I do not paint bottoms and then you just want to make sure that you're painting in one direction so that it's a uniformed you know finish so you can paint up you can paint down but it is wise to paint in one direction so that all of your brushstrokes are uniformed and I'll go around the bottom rim of the Apple where the leftover candy has kind of spread out a little bit and I make sure that's painted you do not have to paint the bottom of your candy apple especially if you're bagging them because the bottom has a hard time drying if you're going to bag them up and then it's going to make your bag sticky and that won't be good for presentation purposes so I just stick to paint in the top of the Apple and then if you have any candy on your stick you need to go ahead and paint that gold as well another disclaimer that I wanted to mention when you sell any client anything pain at goal whether it's candy apples or anything that they're going to consume you need to let them know that the gold luster dust is not FDA approved I recommend this for presentation purposes only so you should disclaim to your customers that this is non-toxic but it's not technically edible so will anything tragic happen to them while eating it no but you just want to make sure that you issue that disclaimer a lot of clients purchase these apples you know to kind of make their sweets table pop or just for the look of a royal sweets table so please make sure that you guys are educating your customers and you are not getting fined by the government so in this particular Apple you see that I had like a small little hole that was from a bubble so if this happens do not panic more than likely you'll be able to sell one cover it up with the bow but you just take a smaller paintbrush and then you're gonna paint the inside as well so it blends and it's less noticeable and then if you have leftover paint strokes you just very very gently brush them down and they'll blend in with the rest of the paint so as you guys can see this method is very simple they are beautiful and it really does not take much at all to achieve this look [Music] so I have painted all of my apples and I sit them out in open air for about 15 to 20 minutes and I let them dry and as you can see I have no gold on my hand and this I'll test them if they're ready to be bagged I just take my finger and I run it across as smoothly to see if any of the gold comes out so I want to thank you guys for supporting another video hopefully you guys find this helpful and I can't wait to see you achieve your very own 24 karat gold candy apples I will see you guys on the next video thank you [Music] you", "2SbYGxN1ZZQ": "I attended college Commission urban

of videos using the natasha that owner got palette recently so you probably noticed by now that i recently purchased it and i'm trying to play around with it and as soon as i received it i started hunting for dupes online and i already found a couple but i'm not gonna stop searching if i find any more i'm gonna come back and update you so far i have the one from today's video which is the w7 24k palette i also have a palette that's not a do but more like an alternative from a very well-known and very well-loved brand so i'm quite excited to share that with you as well and i have a dupe from the brand called alter ego that was a little bit hard for me to get hold of because they're a us-based brand and i actually had to purchase it from a person from the us but i have it so i'm gonna have the artery go goddess palette coming up very soon as well but back to today's video i've got the w7 24k gold rush palette here today which is an absolutely gorgeous dupe of the natasha denona pollet and this one radius for 6.95 was the natasha denona palette is 111 pounds so this is a really really good palette for a fraction of the price so i'm very very excited to share this with you guys as you guys know the brand w7 is a uk based brand first they started out with dupes of the urban decay naked palettes which were the best quality so i wasn't really interested in buying anything from them but then they started duping the anastasia beverly hills palettes and i started doing comparison videos for you guys with those palettes comparing them to the original ones and some of them really weren't so bad and recently they came out with bullets like the socialite palette which was the huda beauty new nude palette dupe which were absolutely amazing so i feel like they are getting better and better this palette is a little bit older than the socialite so my expectations are kind of on par with what i expect from the anastasia beverly hills dupes they put out it also has the same layout as the anastasia beverly hills palettes did so obviously this one has 14 shades the natasha denona palette has 15 so one shade is missing here but other than that all of the shades are exact dupes of the shades that natasha denona has in her palette these ones are kinda put in order by how dark the shades are and like i said one shade is missing but the shade that's missing is actually one of these medium brown shades which we have quite a few of so i feel like you will be able to create whatever look you want using this palette following tutorials of the gold palette so yeah it's a really really promising one and like i said the price point is super just like all other w7 palettes and almost all the doof palace that are available this palette was made in the people's republic of china it has 18 months shelf life and it contains 11.2 grams of product which is significantly less than what you get in the natasha denona palette but as i mentioned before i feel like these large pan natasha denona palettes are a bit oversized you really don't need this much of product so i think 11.2 grams of product is still on the smaller side but it's not unreasonably small the natasha deluna palette contains 37.5 grams of product so like i said it's huge it was made in italy just like all other of her eyeshadow palettes it has 24 months shelf life and yes it's a 111 pounds or 125 us dollars which is really really expensive as i mentioned before i feel like her smaller palace that she's selling for 65 pounds are a lot more reasonably sized and priced i think that's roughly where her palettes should sit because they are really good quality a lot better quality than huda beauty shades for example but 111 pounds is not justified so i'm very eager to find dupes for this eyeshadow palette just like for the sunset palette because i know a lot of people do want to have these shades the color themes of her palettes are absolutely gorgeous and these are really really hyped up palettes so of course they're quite sold after but 111 pounds is a lot of money and it's not necessarily worth the money for me personally i don't think it is but of course that's your own choice i will do my best to give you cheaper options in the upcoming videos i'm sure you have seen this a million times already but this is how the gold palette looks like i love the colors in this palette they are so gorgeous and they really really suit my skin tone it's a quite cool toned palette not as cool toned as the lila palette but these are really neutral beautiful shades the blue and green shades are really muted and i feel like this palette is just really really elegant and gorgeous i could totally imagine people wearing this on the red carpet or even for occasions like weddings and things like that it's absolutely beautiful it's also very versatile because you have a lot of different shimmery shades and basically whichever you pop in the center or the corner of the look it will completely transform the whole look this yellow gold shade is absolutely amazing it's one of the best quality shimmery shades i have seen natasha denona do and also this duochrome greenish blue shade here is just absolutely gorgeous so i do really love this palette just not the price point i feel like if this was 65 pounds i would be completely okay with that but 111 pounds just a bit too much i think none of us would mind if she comes out with half-sized pens and just gives us half of the product for 65 pounds that would be completely fine by me because 37.5 grams of product you're basically gonna spend the rest of your life hitting the pan on all of these so yeah i think she overdone it a bit with the sizes but it's a gorgeous product i'm gonna very quickly insert these swatches for you that i've done already as you can see most of the shades are super super similar not exactly the same some of them are less shimmery have a slightly different texture than the natasha de luna shades by the way the natasha delano shades are on the bottom and the w7 shades are on the top so they are slightly different at times but overall i would say they are super super similar the one shade that's missing from the dupe palette is this shade which is a bit of a bummer i'm not gonna lie because this one is slightly darker than these two brown shades and i do really like to create a transition using this color when i'm using these brown shades i wish they just got rid of one of these instead because having this is actually quite handy but overall it really doesn't matter because you can work your way around it i just feel like they missed an opportunity there because these two shades are really really similar and this one is slightly darker than them so like always one of my eye makeup looks was created using the dew palette today and the dupe side is this one i don't know if you can tell i feel like it looks slightly less shiny on the camera in person they look super super similar maybe the dark shade is slightly less dark but oh my god for 6.95 if you go into tk max or bndm or you go online you can actually get it for about four pounds which is super for that price point having such a good natasha denona dupe is great so i do really love this palette i'm going to quickly show you the footage of how i created this eye makeup look as well as always i started on the nottosha the nona side each time first i took the shade sandstone and i applied it all over the crease to really set the concealer and just put down a base shade in the w7 palette this shade is called high life and i repeated the same thing on that side as well then i went off camera and i prepared my cut crease using the too faced born this way concealer in the shade snow once the cut crease was done i started darkening up the inner and outer corner using the shade log which is the darkest brown shade in the palette in the w7 palette this shade is called wealthy and as i said before it's probably slightly lighter it applies a bit less opaque but luckily you can build this shade up i had a bit of a problem with the shade high life the shade i initially put on my crease because as i said it before with basically all of these do palette videos these shades really tend to grab to the bare skin and not really be a lot nicely on top of themselves you normally cannot create lighter and darker areas using these matte shades and i had that issue with the shade high life but i feel like the shade wealthy didn't give me an issue i have lighter and darker areas the way i wanted to once i was done with that i took some of the shade sandstone again and i applied it to the edge of this dark shade kind of trying to create a transition from the dark shade to the shimmery shade that i'm going to apply after this once again this is the shade high life in the w7 palette of course here because i was applying it in a small area i had no issue with building it up or anything like that i actually wanted it to grab to the bare skin so that wasn't a problem here once i was done with this i went to the shade brush which is of course the highlight of today's eye makeup look and i applied it all over the concealer in the center of the eye and this shade is called golden boy in the w7 palette i feel like the performance of this shade is really really similar to the original one maybe the natasha denona one is slightly shinier and more opaque but you would expect that from a high-end palette and once i was done with all of that i went off camera i applied my foundation concealer blush highlighter all of that and then i took the shade brush again i added it all over my lower lash line like i said in dw7 palette this shade is called golden boy and once i was done with that i did my eye eyeliner mascara all of that and then i took the shade sparks which is the white shade in the palette and i added it to my inner corner in the w7 palette that shade is called goldy and i actually found goldie to be more opaque and more easy to work with than sparks because sparks is just like a topper shade i always try to use it in my inner corner but the only reason you can tell is there is because i'm sitting in front of the light and it kind of reflects on that shimmery shade but other than that it's a quite underwhelming experience to use that color so i was quite happy that in the w7 palette they made that shade more opaque other than that most of these shades have the same texture as they do in the original palette i would just say that the matte shades have more of a sateen finish they're not as smart as the natasha denona shades so they have a different texture to them probably different ingredients something cheaper to make which is quite understandable you are going to try to cut corners when you are making a dupe palette because you are trying to make it as cheap as possible so nevertheless my eye makeup look is extremely similar i had a really pleasant experience using this do palette i think no one could tell that i used two different eyeshadow palettes on the two eyes and definitely no one could tell that this one was more than a hundred pounds cheaper than the other palette so if you always wanted to have this natasha denona gold palette but you just can't justify spending 111 pounds on it which believe me i completely understand i would highly suggest you consider picking up this w7 24k palette because it's gorgeous it basically gives you the opportunity to create all of the same looks you would using the natural palette and it's more than 100 pounds cheaper so you're gonna save a lot of money that's it for today guys i hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful if you did please don't forget to give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel if you haven't already because i would love to have you here check out my previous videos because i have a tons of different do previews just like this one and until

products we apply to our face as possible right so imagine a foundation primer that thinks it's a skincare product there's a new gold standard in foundation primers 24 karat gold firming foundation primer this primer doesn't just prep the skin for foundation and extend its where it does so much more what you probably can't help but notice and it definitely was the first thing that caught my eye is that it contains real gold and while I love all things gold they're not just there for the appearance they're actually there to help energize the skin and restore its youthful radiance now I have had people ask me if the gold flakes are visible on the skin after application and the answer is no as you massage the product into the skin the gold flakes are broken down and absorbed into the skin so that they can begin energizing the complexion and the benefits for your skin don't stop there this primer also firms the skin as you apply this primer you may notice a subtle tensor effect or firming sensation and we can thank an ingredient called film --excel film exil is a game-changer because it also increases skin's natural radiance protects against pollutants with a breathable barrier and extends foundation wear this primer is also powered by a neo dermal which is an award-winning and patented copper peptide that is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of wrinkles EPS and volume so I mentioned that this primer thinks it's a skin care product and that even though this primer is packed with some very effective skincare benefits you're still going to apply this in the same way you would any foundation primer you'll want to apply it to the skin that has already been prepped with you know cleanse toned and moisturize and from there you'll apply a little bit of that primer all over your face before you follow up though with your foundation or concealer you want to let this primer dry completely which doesn't take very long at all so I am going to show you guys on the back of my hand how to apply this to the face I want you to see the difference it makes just on my hand as well you guys are gonna be blown away so I'm just gonna take one pump on the back of my hand and gently spread this into my skin it's extremely lightweight what I notice immediately when using this primer is that it really does smooth and plump the skin in preparation for a foundation it gives it that perfect canvas to really give that smooth surface so your foundation and anything you put on top of it just goes on so beautifully and gives you that radiant complexion we all absolutely love anyone who Prime's their skin before foundation knows what a difference it makes and not only how your foundation looks but definitely how it wears this is a step I personally never miss on myself or when I'm doing my clients makeup so as I massage this into the skin I couple things I notice right off the bat is how smooth it actually feels as you're going on so there's no grab or grit to it it literally smooths all over the skin do you see the natural radiance and even just my hand which we know how try hands are but as it dries down there's no kind of film there's no sticky feeling it's very very lightweight to the skin so it's not going to add an extra layer of heaviness so that's why it's really great for a lot of different skin types because it is so lightweight and it just goes on so beautiful and seamless and literally it's taking seconds to dry and it is so lightweight with no kind of after feel if that makes sense so no stickiness nothing to feel like you have extra on your skin so I absolutely love this primer I think it's gonna be a perfect addition into your skin care slash makeup routine so please go out to your nearest Merle Norman studio try this new 24 karat gold firming and I'll see the next one [Music]", "FDL93PE5gno": "oh my god are you talking about my ex-girlfriend Kari Tosh sexy can I say humble what I thought you know but it was stuck

people coming in and out at one point the party had 800 people in costumes gathered in one place in the middle of a farm a field where there's just so much land so much space not a lot of people outside the party to witness anything she doesn't have her phone on her she has no ride home and she vanishes how do you even start this investigation leave it in the comments what would you do like what would be your first step didn't even hear the sirens real loud okay this all starts in a small rural area in Michigan and it all starts with a woman by the name of Chelsea she's actually 22 at the time I believe this happened in 2014 and she's always kind of lived in the countryside like she's always been kind of a country girl she grew up in a place a town a tiny little town called maybe Michigan literally maybe Michigan it may be Michigan it may not be okay maybe it's mabeline maybe it's Michigan when she moved to this new city where everything took place like this city if you look at it and you're from I don't know even if you're from Atlanta Georgia which is where I'm originally from you would look at this town and be like damn that's the rural areas of the Midwest you would never be like oh that's like a pop in place right not that anything's wrong with that but since she moved from maybe Michigan to that place she was like man there's so much action going on so you can really only imagine how much of a kind of a country girl that she is out of her right everybody loved her everybody said she was a free spirit she was she was the hostess or a server at a local restaurant she was just having a blast with life like she was very adventurous and one of her co-workers by the name of Becky works at the restaurant with her mm-hmm and this story kind of starts in June of that summer and they're working and they realize oh my god have you heard there's gonna be a giant party in October for Halloween right they start talking about it in the summer they're like what are you gonna wear what's your costume this is literally like the social event of the season [Music] it's my fingerprint in gold easier Wow yeah she is so freaking excited she decides I have the perfect idea I'm gonna be poison ivy Batman's villain she even made hand sewed hand made her dress pertinent to the story it was the poison ivy dress with these fake artificial poison ivy leaves hand sewn all across she bought this perfect maroon wig because poison ivy has like this fire red hair right she was wearing these red leather slots and she's so excited so her and Becky they all get dressed up and they get their friend penny now penny is a lot older right she's actually a decade older than both of them she's in her 30s she has four kids and she decided hey listen I'm always a mom I deserve one night out it's Halloween why don't I didn't hang out with the young ends right so she gets dressed up all three of them head over to the party now this party was being held on a farm partner Soperton at this young this farm I'm talking the fields its expansive okay it's not just like this tiny little little you know homegrown local table farm it's like a massive agricultural piece of land and the person who owned that land is a person by the name of Big Mike yes that'd be his name okay and Big Mike was known for throwing some crazy parties at that like it's a mother's fun so no known for his parties he always throws crazy parties and they're all involving heavy heavy metal rock bands okay that's his favorite kind of music super loud super dark at the place once they arrived they literally have like a parking lot for the party like I'm talking hella people they get there they have this fire pit this is the only source of light at the time because it's in the middle of the fields excuse me he had set up these huge two tents and people were in and out of those people are hanging out near the fire pit this fire pit is probably the size of like my apartment like its massive he just has this fire pit every year he'll just throw stuff in there and light it all on fire and throw these massive bonfires because I mean again you own so much of the land and so this is exactly the setup that Halloween night now Chelsea and her poison ivy costume walks in with her friends they start having a blast they start drinking they start giggling and they didn't actually drive because they had planned to drink and so they were trying to be responsible and Penny's sister was gonna pick them up and drop them off at home that's probably know who burn their home mm-hmm hmm really good mm-hmm which one do you like the most okay don't taste like go yeah they don't want to anyways hmm hmm you can go all over your face it's kind of sexy if the goats get stuck on your throat should I give you CPR this will be the bougie-ass story of CPR my fiancee started choking on gold gold chain pops out you fight so then she shows up they're having a blast they're getting drunk and then suddenly this is kind of like the pivotal point in the night she's walking with just her friend penny right Becky is off talking to other people because this entire town in the neighboring towns and the town's friends and everybody was just hyped to go to Big Mike's party so literally this was the party of the century so they end up going and she walks into a tent pole so she's drunk it's really dark pertinent okay it's so dark at this party and she walks straight in nose first into a tent pole that was holding one of the tents up right and so she kind of starts bleeding not I don't know if you guys have ever hit your nose but it's like this really uncomfortable sharp pain and so she was feeling that immediately penny the one who's like almost 10 years older than her she's there she's saying oh my god are you okay and they're kind of giggling at her because it's so funny you know it's not like she's seriously hurt and like you're gonna be okay Chelsea you're gonna be okay bit and so she's like no I want to go home and then he's like go home yeah and Penny's like oh my gosh don't be silly like it hurts right now we're gonna clean up the blood put trust you're gonna be flying your nose is not broken and so she kind of finesses her into staying because they all have to leave at the same time because Penny's sister is there right and so she's like okay I mean you're right you're right it doesn't hurt as much anymore so they start drinking some more and at this point penny and Chelsea kind of split up so they get lost and they lose sight of each other but here's the crazy part Chelsea she didn't have pockets in her hand like homemade poison ivy costume so she actually gave her phone to Becky to hold on you so imagine Chelsea in a wig in a poison ivy costume alone at this party with 800 plus people forgot her forgot that she didn't have her phone mm-hmm that's so crazy nowadays that today if I mmm if you didn't have your cell phone on you uh-huh it's so scary because I feel like you could just be gone mm-hmm you see what I'm saying we're still depend on these phones now if I walk out with you - mwah then you have your phone oh my gosh I'm never gonna find her that's so true imagine like that's what I heard that parents give their kids phones early these days you're trying to get in contact with mm-hmm she doesn't have her phone now Penny's sister arrives with the party to pick them up calls penny and says hey you need to hurry up because this is middle of the night I'm doing you a favor it's gonna take me time to drop everybody off to go back home to shower to get in bed and I have work early in the morning tomorrow so let's go let's go let's go I'm outside right people are honking at me come on you know that pressure when you gotta leave a party and it gotta be quick and your friends are drugged and you gotta get them in the car and you just feel like a preschool teacher you know like it you know and then you're drunk so you're like wait which means the exit and you're like in a one-bedroom apartment okay it gets really complicated and so she's trying to find Becky she calls Becky finds Becky she calls Chelsey Becky's like wait I have her phone oh my gosh right so they look for her more penny sister keeps calling her pressuring her and so they go okay listen the last time I saw chest Chelsea she was actually talking to one of our mutual friends it seems like right it seems like she knows the people well and I mean this is our small town community we're talking about I'm sure she can just get a ride from someone else so they leave her at the party I've just 800 people I don't think so you were never the your friend like I feel like in college everybody probably has done it before yeah you guys all go to party together and one person just they're off in the party you probably just gonna go I would never leave my friend without her phone and getting a verbal okay if we came together we leave together my feeling is girl code maybe guys is different no girls it's like you come together you'll leave together unless you say hey listen I promise this guy's not a serial killer and he's gonna take me home even then you're like I don't think so bass get in the car so then do any of that they end up leaving now penny and Becky say that this is one of the biggest regrets of their entire life because after they left some bad stuff starts happening so at this point Chelsea ax has at the last place that she's seen is by a couple people who say they saw her either by the fire pit or either by this station crying right because saying something along the lines of she has no friends nobody loves her and so I mean to be abandoned at a party pretty scary without your phone really scary or she couldn't borrow somebody phone call number so she buy up a bunch of people's phones actually kept calling her friends she never called her family never called her sister or her mom I don't know maybe she didn't remember their numbers I don't know she ends up calling penny know at this point penny has arrived home penny picks up the phone and she says hey listen how could you just leave me at the party do you mind coming back pick me up because nobody is willing to take me home I don't feel safe here and penny says listen I am in no place to be driving right now I'm drunk and I just thought home so no I can't come pick you up and they hang up the phone Wow so they're not really close friends yeah the other friends it seemed like Becky didn't get a call and the next morning Becky and Penny both wake up Penny's having a blast she even told her dad you know I had so much fun finally getting out for once at that party it was so much fun it was great right Becky's saying hey listen I got a call Chelsea's mom and let her know hey let me know when Chelsea gets home because I have her phone do you want me to drop it off should she pick it up what's going on right calls my mom Chelsea's mom is like oh she's not home yet and she's like okay well let me know when she gets home this is the next morning by the way and then all of a sudden during the middle of the day the next day Chelsea gets a face not Chelsea I'm sorry Becky gets a Facebook message from Chelsea's younger sister saying wait a second Chelsea's not home right where is she she hasn't been home all day like this is weird for her she's not picking up her phone and Becky is like well I have her phone probably she's sleeping it off somewhere I mean we got pretty much last night so she's probably drunk at a friend's place and so then this assyrians like I don't know this is weird now the day after it had been Sunday so this party was Saturday night Sunday yeah and then on Monday she's still not home but then here is where Chelsea's mom is would really my MVP of this entire story she springs into action she's knocking on people's doors saying hey listen I'm doing a search party you better join me because my daughter goddamn missing okay so she's rounding up people she goes over to Big Mike's and she says listen Big Mike you gonna look in your fields for my daughter so he's like okay sure he takes his big-ass dog they go through the fields they walk for miles and miles and miles no sign of Chelsea and then finally his dog gets stuck on a fox trap that they had set up and gets injured so they make it back to like his actual farm house right and outside is Chelsea's mom she's being very cold very aggressive and she decides that she's gonna set up her home base her control center in the middle of his field so they set up a tent they brought in a porta potti literally brought because this was the last place she was seen and his field was miles and miles there's hopefully these fields the police were in on it and they were trying to search the fields too they were trying to search neighboring fields neighboring areas but there was just so much land and it was just so complicated to search you know so people are just like holy this is getting intense they set up a command center in his farm without even asking for his permission he ends up calling an attorney and the attorney is like well what can you do biz so then he's like okay whatever right the entire time the entire town is just in hysterics they have posters of her and they have to have so many pictures of her they needed her regular picture they need her poison-ivy picture it was just complicated now here is where the tips start flowing in and this is not good for the police overall I think in the entire case they had well over 650 tips that they had to go and follow which is a lot of tips and you when you get it like a tip I heard that police can't just be like yeah they have to follow it know what are the tips do you actually have something so first tip young man comes in does hey listen I saw her with this guy this nerdy looking guy he had glasses on he had this weird haircut they get in a composite sketch ah he's sketching the face and he goes it looks like they knew each other I saw her and I remember thinking huh she's poison ivy I'm deathly allergic to ivy right but poison ivy and so he's just staring at her sees this guy they're talking as if they know each other and that is the last person at the party who saw her allegedly so the police are like okay they put out the sketch to the press and they get phone call after phone they get flooded then the police take a step back because they're too close to this right now they take a step back and realize they themselves know about 150 people who look like that so some really basic drawing yeah just the basic dude with just basic glasses literally just they said you could walk into a bar and you'll see ten guys who look pretty much like that sketch they're not really leading us anywhere then the next tip comes from just police instinct they think you know what I mean this is his party Big Mike right he's got to know something about what's going on in his party so they start questioning him and at first he seems very cooperative like he wants to help find Chelsea but at the same time when they asked hey do you think I could search her place just to make sure ain't nothing going weird here right he says I don't think so sir so the police are like I mean you seem like you really wanted to help us find Chelsea but suddenly we can't search her place right he goes nope so they literally SWAT at his house they got a search warrant and six SWAT team officers showed up and he was like you got a search warrant and they're like dude we'll kick in the door or you let us in so he'd let them and they searched the place yeah the main place that they wanted to search on his property was the fire pit because it was a huge fire pit you could burn a body in there and to the sergeant searched and searched and searched nothing so it's like okay maybe it's not Big Mike but they wanted to keep him close to the radar but now they're back to square one and they're gonna keep coming back to square one because it's a shitshow the next thing that happens is there's a guy I believe his his last name is bird so we're just gonna call him bird okay to make it easier bird comes in and he's very forthcoming he's like guys I didn't have to show up here but I did it because I want to help find Chelsea I actually saw her in the parking lot where all the cars were parked with these two buff guys right and these buff guys were like um like bumping in around hurting him her I'm sorry hurry her yeah just kind of assaulting her and so he steps in he interferes they walk away and she's kind of bleeding a little bit and so then she's he's like okay sit down sit down right and he ends up sitting in an open car seat which wasn't his car so it was just like a red board right and then he said okay you wait here and his plan was to go back into the party and see if anybody knew Chelsea because he's like I don't know this girl I'm not taking her home you know and so then he goes into the party comes back 15 minutes later nobody knows her and she's gone from the parking lot so he tells the police this right but then he even said oh and then she like her nose was bleeding right so I got a little bit of like a lot of my shoulder huh sounds like made this may be credible but they start questioning him and then it just his story didn't add up right at one point he was saying oh maybe it wasn't his nose maybe it was a her face I don't know her nose was bleeding I don't know I saw the blood after oh we wash my shirts oh my the Bloods not there anymore it was just confusing so then the police went from thinking okay maybe this guy came forward to tell us about this because he wants to cover up the real crime that he did which is murder her but then it slowly turned into why are you even here dude right and then he admits to the police after hours of interrogation okay I made up the entire story so that I could look cool so that I could tell people that I beat up these two dudes who are trying to hurt Chelsea and so the police arrested him for lying to the police and now they're back to square one next tip that they get they see oh my god this sounds really credible a woman by the name of Carrie comes in and she says I had a scary encounter with a man this man was my ex-boyfriend he stopped me in the middle of a parking lot and pulled a knife on me because we have been fighting we had just broken up it was it was a tense part in our relationship he's highly abusive he put this knife to my throat and says this is the knife that I used on Chelsea don't make me use it on you and I was so scared I was so scared now police officers you have to promise me something I'm only coming forward with this because you either don't do anything about this or you make sure you arrest him because he lives down the street from me and I know that if you question him and you tell him that I said any of this he's gonna come kill me with that knife that he probably killed Chelsea with and so then what did the police do they immediately call him in and is like hey listen we done heard that you don't pulled your knife out on some you know so then he goes oh my god are you talking about my ex-girlfriend Carrie she real crazy guys I'm pretty sure a thousand percent sure like I had nothing to do with Chelsea but also Carrie she's a Looney tune ok she's doing this because she wants to get back at me because we had a shitty breakup so they're like are you serious so then they're bringing Carrie again finally after hours of interrogation she goes yeah I just wanted to see him in jail what kind of town is this everybody just using this case - yes further their own little relationship and personal vendetta police they are a scary lying to the police ok and now they're back to square one finally tip number 623 sure they went through 623 tips and went back to square one back to square one back to square one 623 times and at this time this happened in October it was finally spring now during springtime spring cleaning is very big in this little rural town ok they don't just clean their house but they clean their fields and stuff yeah so it's very intense a woman by the name of Cheryl she's not anywhere near their age which is it's it's a very good sign right because it seems like ok she wasn't at the party she's not I mean you know you probably expect older people to have their together a little bit more right so then Cheryl calls and says listen my house and my field kind of place near the highway it's a pretty big road and I always do spring cleaning so she's always picking up weird things and it's almost like a running joke in their family her husband is always like would you find this year because sometimes she'll find literally radio boxes cameras with the SD card still inside and weird pictures on side you know just like really creepy stuff right and so every year she goes and just cleans the side next to the road and she always finds weird things now her husband comes home one day and she had pretty much trashed everything because nothing was that interesting and she's just laying in bed and he's like hey honey how was spring cleaning would you find this year and she goes I just found wrappers and litter and a shoe and that's about it right he's like a shoe and she's like yeah I threw it in the trash is just one shoe he goes what kind of shoe no and then she's like I don't know like this just red leather shoe and you goes another shoe and he was do you think she goes oh my god they immediately call the police the police come they pick it up they take a picture they send it to Chelsea's mom and she confirmed that is Chelsea pretty good whew like it's pretty common to find shoes okay but you know wow okay no the saddest part about all of this you know is that during this entire time Chelsea's mom had the biggest search party she thought her daughter was coming back yeah when they found the shoe like people were saying you could see her energy diminish so then the next tip that they get is really piecing things together and man by the name of Eric says he does metal scrapping which means he goes into abandoned buildings tries to find any sort of metal melted down and sell it right so he goes to this abandoned building once and he finds a pile of leaves now he eats all these leaves and it stood out to him because they don't look like real leaves they look like artificial leaves right hidden under a wooden plank he flips it open and sure enough he finds a maroon wick and so he touches the leaves to be like oh it is fake right because you usually do that when you see a plant that looks fake I don't know why humans feel the need to verify what their touch if it's real or fake and then his friend is like okay there's no metal here let's go so they just kind of leave because it's so creepy he goes back to work and he sees a poster for her in a poison ivy costume and goes holy she was wearing that exact wig that I found at that abandoned building now the reason that he didn't immediately call police allegedly so according to Eric is the fact that he had touched everything he's around the same age as Chelsey he didn't go to the party but he just felt like maybe it could be pinned on him the police really had no other leads so maybe they were gonna take it and run with it so he didn't call the police a week after he found all of this he goes to his sister's house tells her what happened and she goes you have to talk right so he calls the police he gets questioned they think maybe it's him they go to the leaf pile and they find it and it's just so weird okay it had been ripped at her private area so it seemed like there were obviously signs of assault and at this point now they're looking for her body now a couple weeks after that they get another call about ten miles away from the party and this was an older man who has a giant property he wanted to mow it down to either build it flat or do something when suddenly his big mowing truck got stuck on something he rushes out to the back to see what stopped it and sure enough he found a decomposing body so he calls the police they show up face was unrecognizable ran dental records and it was the body of Chelsey is this case solved or mm-hmm No before they found their body though they have a main suspect because when they went to the abandoned building to see where the costume was it was literally right across the street from Byrd's house the guy who said he made up the story where he interfered with the two guys in the parking lot and so they go oh my god maybe he was covering up a murder they questioned him again again nothing comes of it the body is found the the body doesn't even tell them much other than the fact that she was killed by blunt force trauma but there is no way to tie it to any of the 800 people at the damn party right and to another even more confused than ever but they finally after scoping out the entire we're having lighting problems Joe went out okay so after scoping the entire area they find the pair of leggings that she was wearing that night and they find DNA evidence on it so they run that through the big database and they weren't expecting a hit but they got one to daniel clay he has a long-ass criminal just crazy record so they bring him on him and he says you know what I actually know Chelsea I picked her up at that party and we did it in the back of my truck and they go okay so you were involved in her death and he goes well to tell you the truth I couldn't tell you guys this because of my criminal background but as we were doing it I mean this girl's really weird she was like hey baby choke me and so I started choking her for like 20 seconds and she died oh my god she probably drank a little too much and I got scared because I have a criminal background no one's gonna believe me and I was drunk and so I just drove around and then dumped her body okay and sue the police they're like what right so obviously they arrest him they go to trial now the prosecutor is saying that's not the truth Daniel clay is a liar because the truth is there's no signs of a success fixie ation which means she choked there's only signs of massive blunt-force trauma to her head now they're debating during trial should he be in trouble for concealing a dead body or should it be first-degree murder was it murder or was it just disposing of a body right because it was an accident manslaughter versus murder right this is like your entire life in jail this might be 20 years in jail so it's like huge right going to trial he's saying no she told me to choke her blah blah blah blah blah it was an accident yada yada yeah jury decides you know what we were thinking maybe manslaughter but after listening to his side of the story guilty why was it what do you mean his size two stories just what the hell right cuz then they brought in these people like these doctors who are like honestly even if she was super drunk wasted which all the witnesses who allegedly saw her at the party afterwards they said she was emotional but she was not worth it but even if she were wasted in her healthy condition it would have taken you minutes to kill her by choking it wouldn't have been twenty thirty seconds like you say okay nobody is that weak and so they're saying that doesn't make sense also why would you if you just said this if she choked and I dumped her body why did she have so much blunt-force trauma like you were like oh well now she's dead so might as well just do it you know it just doesn't make sense so they convicted him guilty for murder he's spending the rest of his life in jail and the judge even after the jury convicted him said Daniel clay you are a rapist you are a liar and you are just a horrible person he had a girlfriend at the time it was so weird and he was calling his girlfriend from jail saying it was just an accident and the craziest part is he was dressed as Batman at the party and she was poison ivy and so people are like maybe he's like this sick twisted guy who just really wanted to play into thank you for soundcloud for sponsoring today's video and also leave it in the comments what you guys think of this case because I mean this one was just a doozy for me it was just so sad but it was also just so many wrong tips why would these people use this it's just weird right I love you guys would you guys ever eat 24 karat gold bleep burgers also leave that in the comments and I love you guys and I'll see you guys tomorrow bye", "Sr1bXJWKLf4": "[Music] in this video I'm making gold plating solution together with electricity the solution can apply a thin coat of pure gold over some metallic objects traditionally such a solutions prepared using literally poisonous sodium or potassium cyanide however my solution will be prepared using relatively non poisonous chemicals but be aware these chemicals are only harmless if used appropriately under the wrong conditions it may release extremely poisonous hydrogen cyanide gas for this reason I don't recommend to repeat this process [Music] to make gold plating solution I will need next items gold chloride that I made in my previous video here I have half a gram dissolved in 100 milliliters of distilled water potassium ferrocyanide will serve as a relatively non-toxic alternative to potassium cyanide however sodium derivatives can be used instead attached in carbonate as a solution basic fire and distilled water now I prepared three grams of potassium ferrocyanide I'm going to make a solution by dissolving it in 100 milliliters of distilled water and bring the solution to boil before I began I attached a digital pH meter to monitor the solution acidity is the factor that can trigger the decomposition of ferrocyanide to hydrogen cyanide however this is very unlikely to happen as it requires strong acid to stay on the safe side I will ensure to keep the pH at above 7 during the process the solution of gold chloride is acidic and will acidify the ferrocyanide for that reason I adjusted the pH to above 10 with a little potassium carbonate as you can see with the addition of gold chloride to potassium ferrocyanide solution it changes the color to red it happens because insoluble iron hydroxide and iron oxide precipitate out of the solution at this point the solution becomes very poisonous and safety must be taken seriously after the addition of gold chloride I added 2 grams of potassium carbonate to make the solution strongly alkaline and I left to boil for 20 minutes it may look like not much had happened when I mixed gold chloride with potassium ferrocyanide however the addition activates the chain of complex chemical reactions unfortunately there isn't much information available regarding this particular electroplating method therefore I don't understand the chemistry of this approach well enough to give a brief explanation however I believe all the links that were useful in making this video in the video description anyway back to the process after 20 minutes of boiling around 25 milliliters of water was evaporated to compensate I topped as a solution back to 200 milliliters mark this distilled water the solution was left to cool down to room temperature and insoluble red crystals precipitate at the bottom of the beaker this precipitate is the mixture of iron hydroxide and iron oxide it happens as iron initially replaced by the gold in the cyanide ligands it means once you mix gold chloride this potassium ferrocyanide the solution becomes very poisonous you see iron is the element that prevents toxic effects in cyanide compounds therefore the solution must be handled as highly toxic substance during the process under no circumstances the solution can be mixed with acids and disposed of down the drain [Music] as a last step the solution needs to be filtered to separate the insoluble solids after the filtration the electrolyte is ready to be used to demonstrate how the solution works I will try to resurrect this old gold plated silver spoon to its original looks before the plating the surface of the metal needs a preparation the step one is to remove old cochin by scraping it off the small piece of steel wool seems to be working well it's only taking me a few minutes to remove the old coaching completely from the spoon after the scraping I am wiping the spoon with isopropanol to remove any grease that may remain on the surface the oily residue will prevent the deposition of gold on the surface of metal for the best results surface must be as smooth as possible for this reason I'm polishing the surface using red powder of iron oxide and for the last step before electroplating I am wiping the surface with very dilute nitric acid it will remove any remaining oxides from the metal now the spoon is ready for the deposition of gold the deposition happens during the electrolysis therefore I need a source of electricity my old phone charger will work just fine as it puts out 5 volts and point 7 and pairs of current so I remove the phone connector part and strip the wire the positive end I attached to the stainless steel fork and the negative end to stainless steel wire the deposition of gold occurs at the negative electrode the 4 spoon is attached to the stainless steel wire and both electrodes are submerged into the solution it is important to ensure the electrons are not touching before supplying the electricity even though the phone charger works well I don't recommend to use your household power for the electrolysis as it may damage the circuit instead the 9-volt battery can be used with the excellent results [Music] [Music] [Music]", "qgM56nHE6SI": "even better than that was so family welcome back to my channel you can click Subscribe join my family today I'm going to be making 24 karat gold barbecue wings scrolling through Instagram and I came across this picture and I was like is this real or is it Photoshop like what is it I did some research and apparently they're selling leagues in New York for a thousand dollars some like a thousand dollars we could just we could just make these at home but before I get started I know everyone wants to know the are these wings edible and how are they edible well the thing is they use edible gold dust the first thing you're going to need to make these chicken wings is of course chicken wings oil make sure you're able to fry these wings these wings are going to be negative we're not gonna be grating therefore this wing recipe I'm going to go with honey barbecue sauce I think you're gonna need is gold done so now that we have the ingredients let's go ahead and get started so right here I have my chicken you're going to want to wash the chicken first you should be washing your chicken before cooking about to go ahead and watch my chicken wait did you think I was gonna wash my chicken with dish detergent daddy so I'm not going to do that my chicken is already washed now the next thing we're gonna do is season our chicken um the Goldust doesn't taste like anything from what I know I can't wait to try it at the end but I'm pretty sure it's not going to have any flavor to it so we're gonna go ahead and season our chicken because that's what we supposed to do he says I'm going to be adding barbecue sauce I'm not going to rely on the seasoning to really take over the chicken so I'm using garlic powder I'm using this Cajun Creole seasoning that already has thought included I don't like just pouring salt in I like to add in seasonings that have salt included I'm also adding four Preetha whatever you're dealing with chicken you want to make sure you have one hand that's clean so after you're done seasoning your chicken you're gonna want to make sure to go over to your oil [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the water wings are cooking I'm going to do the sauce pour it on me so now I'm gonna pour this in and just so y'all can oh wow well okay that's true well that's very pretty just [Music] till y'all can get a close-up [Music] so what I'm going to do I'm going to dip it it really looks just like what they did [Music] so far so good I hope you guys are enjoying this video make sure to give me a like if u hungry right now this is idiot it is looking good do then go ahead and like this video before I ain't trying I don't wanna say

feel right never attended [Music] I can't pretend it [Music] [Music] see here oh my gosh oh wow this is crazy hi I can't pretend dad this is some bougie stuff they know what I'm kind of boos you so this is perfect honestly y'all I don't know if I'm gonna eat all these wings cuz I'm a little bit scared if you are a little bit hesitant with using a whole lot of gold dust then I would just

continual [Music] [Music]", "pcY6tGQ2Kgk": "you read the title right this is not a drill this is not clickbait every single one of you guys watching at home can get a free piece of gold bullion shipped directly to your door no strings attached and I'm going to show you how to do it [Music] hello everybody silver picker here and welcome to the silver picker squad now today's video is going to be an interesting one because it is about one of the absolute most unique products I have ever featured on this channel this is going to be about a bullion product that well actually calling a bullion product is even a little bit of a misnomer because it is so much more than that what we're going to be talking about today is the gold back Gold backs are a brand new revolutionary gold-based currency produced in the state of Utah for a trade in commerce now what does that mean what we're talking about is this bill over here yes this is a flexible bill just like a dollar bill but instead of being backed by gold like the old gold standard bills in the United States and other countries where the dollar bill was actually a representation of gold held in some federal safe this cuts out the middleman this is a spendable bill made out of real 24 karat 999 pure gold well now before we dive into all the different ins and outs of the gold back I want to talk a little bit about the history that led up to its creation well you may be sitting there and sort of scratching your head and thinking to yourself gold back gold back gold back I know that term well you're probably thinking over the gold backing of currency during the time of the gold standard the gold standard was a monetary system in the US and in many other places where a paper dollar bill was actually a representation of physical gold sitting in government coffers meaning you could actually take your worthless dollar bill bring it to the bank and exchange valuable physical gold well of course that system has been abolished long ago and we it has been replaced by what is called fiat currency which is what we have today Fiat which is another term for edict or decree is basically a system in which the money is worth something by decree of government the government says that this is worth something and therefore it is well you can imagine that there are a lot of people who are skeptical of the government and rightly so I mean there have been hundreds if not thousands of governments over the course of humanity and civilization that have collapsed due to economic issues we've even had of course serious economic disasters in our own lifetime well I'm not certainly one of these people that is really all about the doom and gloom of the American system I think the American financial system is quite strong and will be for many many years to come well just because I have faith in the United States government in the United States financial system doesn't mean that that will always be true and it doesn't mean that we will always be safe from economic collapse so of course even though I have plenty of my savings in good old-fashioned greenbacks I also have plenty of silver I am the Silver picker after all plenty of silver and other investments and other alternatives to being stuck in a situation where the United States currency drops dramatically and that brings us to the gold back now the gold back is the creation of a company in Utah that believed that we need a true alternative to the United States dollar bill now you could say well we already have gold bullion we already have silver bullion but that is not a true alternative because bullying is not really spendable in commerce well you could talk all you want about how gold and silver are real money and you can scream it from the rooftops but the reality is you can't just go to the grocery store with your American Silver Eagle or a piece of gold bullion and buy your groceries it just doesn't work that way and to be totally Frank I don't think you'd want it to I mean do you really want to carry around a satchel full of heavy gold and silver coins ever you go no I mean you go to the mall to buy a pair of shoes or you're out of ball game you want a hot dog you're gonna carry around this heavy satchel full of gold coins it just doesn't make sense it's not how things are done and to be frank we've moved beyond that but that's kind of the benefit in the brilliance of the gold bag the gold bag while it is a totally good means of preserving wealth in the form of gold bullion I mean if you want to buy a stack of these and put them in your safe as a means of buying bullion perfectly fine they're perfectly good at that but the real intention and the real benefit of these is that they are really intended to be a replacement or an alternative for this a small denomination way to spend gold in regular ordinary everyday Commerce I mean never before have you been able to buy a small ticket item like a jug of milk or a pair of shoes with gold because frankly technology didn't allow it there was no way to have a practical form of gold that you could also spend on small ticket items but valorum the company that produces these gold backs for gold back Inc has a patented technology that allowed them to do just that and that is what's so cool about that you can actually spend these for real goods and services but that's not just some highfalutin pie-in-the-sky thing that came down from on high from gold backing saying yeah someday in the future we're gonna be able to spend these in stores and buy whatever you want know that sign that's going on today right now in the state of Utah there are literally hundreds of stores that accept gold bags as a form of payment I'm dead serious you can I'm not just talking about the small independent guys either I'm talking about law firms dental practices even automobile dealerships are accepting gold backs in the form of payment yes you can get your teeth cleaned or you can have a contract done or you can even buy a car using gold bags and it's not just in Utah it's also spread to other states and even other countries I actually discovered gold backs on reddit because I saw a guy I don't remember what state he was in but he actually bought a pie of pizza' using gold bags and when I saw that I was like floored I was like this is revolutionary I got to find out more about this I actually ended up reaching out to gold back Inc and trying to do some kind of video with them and that's exactly what you're watching and gold back was excited to do it they actually sent me this awesome gold back branded wallet along with a bunch of free gold backs which is awesome of them thank you very much gold back so they're the sponsor of this video but it's not just for youtubers like me they're actually offering a free gold back to anybody watching literally anybody that wants a free gold back yes you heard me right that is a free piece of gold literally one one thousandth of an ounce of gold for free for anybody who wants and I've never heard of a deal like that in my life so I'm gonna show you how to get your gold back for free but before we go into that why don't we take a look at them let's actually look at the beauty the artistry and talk a little bit about some of the security features as well before we get into that so let's take a look because these things are awesome so here we have the gold backs and all their glory and they are indeed glorious they are absolutely beautiful so we're gonna take a look at each of them individually but before we do that why don't we take a look at the different make up of all the different bills and what they look like is a set so as you can see each one has a different denomination and they're a different size and this the denominations go 1 5 10 25 and 50 and each of those corresponds to a different amount of gold that's contained within each of these bills so for example the basis which is the 1 gold back is one one thousandth of a try ounce of gold and you go up to one one 200 1/100 140th all the way up to one twentieth of a try ounce of gold and this is a good enough time to sort of explain how these gold backs are created the way that valorum does this which is the company that produces these for gold back is there's a thin layer of polymer a little piece of plastic where they're able to spray gold literally one atom at a time and build it up on that plastic substrate and then seal that whole thing up with another layer of plastic which protects the gold so it can't get rubbed off it can't get destroyed in any way it's totally protected between this sandwich of plastic and therefore it can be used and spent you know normally like any other currency and of course the different sizes sort of represent the different values I actually like the fact that they're different sizes many countries outside the US have their bills getting larger progressively as the denomination gets larger and that's in part for blind people actually so that people who can't see the bills can still tell the difference between them so I think this is a really cool setup and I mean you'd pick up this 50s and you can really feel the weightiness of the gold that it contains I mean this is truly one twentieth of an ounce of gold you can really feel it and that's really really awesome so I absolutely love these and I'd love to take a look at all of these individually so you guys can see how beautiful they are so let's start with the one so here we have the one gold back note and of course we have the denomination and the gold content like we discussed earlier but there are a cool a few cool other features that I want to talk about and the first one is that it says one Utah gold back now the interesting thing there is that it says one Utah gold back and right below it it says voluntary local currency the idea here is for that to be a really hyper local currency that you can spend on real goods and services and what the fact that says Utah implies and was confirmed when I spoke with the folks at the company is that there is an intention for this to be bigger than just Utah hopefully someday there will be a local gold back currency for every state and even other countries outside the United States so who knows there could be a California or a Wyoming or a New York gold back coming soon I'd love to see in the comments below if you guys would like to see say which states or countries you'd like to see go back come to next but speaking of Utah one of the really cool features of the gold back is that because it is a local currency the art is super representative of Utah culture now each bill has a different tree it has a different female figure and each one represents a different virtue a different Roman virtue here we have prudent iya or prudence and this is exemplified by a woman in Native American garb and more than that the coolest thing is I was told that there are different symbols that all represent each of the different five major you Native American tribes which I just thought was such an amazing attention to detail and such a really cool way to honor the Native Americans in Utah so really really cool I mean let's take a look at this closer look at that it's gorgeous absolutely gorgeous you can see some of the security features this is government grade security features you may recognize these kind of designs from bills from around the world and that's because they use the same technology that governments use in order to prevent counterfeiting so if you're worried about counterfeiters they have a really really good means of protecting that and the speaking of an e counterfeiting measures the big reveal is I'd like to show you guys the back the back of every single gold back is literally gold backed and you have a negative image which is basically impossible to produce and to copy without this technology that only valorum the producers of this bill has access to and this is so cool because this is where design meets function because aside from it being a gorgeous negative image of everything on the front of the bill it's also an incredibly strong anti counterfeiting measure really really cool so let's still you look at the number five the five denomination so the five has Veritas and you can see sort of a pioneer lady we're moving a little bit along in American history and you can see she has two biblical books Veritas meaning truth and this is again a very very beautiful beautiful bill again you can see on the back we have this gorgeous gold back and anti-counterfeiting measures as well super cool the ten is justiciable we're blind justice beautiful woman in a gorgeous setting with mountains and trees and all sorts of other stuff and it's again just another beautiful bill the 25 which is one of my favorites actually is Victoria which is victory and this is actually a representation of the suffragette movement if you can see here it says votes counting since 1870 I believe in Utah women had the right to vote earlier than almost any other state which is super super interesting and this one is the of course 140th tryouts twenty five really really beautiful you have beautiful american flag in the background and each of these was hand drawn by the same artist look at that negative image super super cool and finally onto the big kahuna the fifty utah gold back note with libertas or of course freedom Liberty she is a gorgeous representation of Liberty we have the beautiful fir tree in the back we have animals that are feet other symbolism and super super cool stuff in fact I'd love to see if you guys can guess what some of the symbolism is if you guys can notice what some of this other stuff means put it in the comments below see who can figure it out first I'm not going to give it away it's just teeming with symbolism and beauty look at that I mean there are people that are buying these literally just a frame as art I'm actually considering framing one of each of these and putting them up on my wall because they are really just that gorgeous I mean I am in love with these things the second they arrived at my door I've just been thumbing through them and looking at them literally every chance I got now that brings us on to how you guys can get them as well right so of course you guys are interested so there are right now three different ways to get yourself the gold back the first is you can buy them on eBay but of course they're gonna be a little bit more expensive because eBay has all these fees but if you're into eBay and you're used to eBay you can find them on eBay as well as getting this awesome branded gold back wallet so you don't bend them up in your normal wallet you can just put them right in there it's specially designed for gold backs really really cool the setting way is actually they are going to be APMEX very shortly if by the time this video airs they may already be there so you will be able to buy these along with your other bullion purchases right on APMEX if you're used to that however the most traditional way as of now is through the united precious metals association or UPM a.org so you go on to you PMA org and you can set up an account and all you have to do is set up an account you don't even have to spend any money and they will send you a free one gold back note that is literally the easiest way to start your gold stack that I have ever heard literally all you have

[Applause] [Music] hello everyone welcome back to another video and if you are new to the channel hello thank you so much for watching today and if you enjoy this video please give it a thumbs up and hit that subscribe button by the time you guys are seeing this video it's actually been a full two weeks that I've used these space massagers every single day they'll be linked in the description box below if you want to check them out for yourself and all you have to do when they come in the mail as just open up the bottom pop in a double-a battery and then it switches on and off at the bottom when it's on it just vibrates but before we continue the video I wanted to go over some of the benefits of massaging your face like this every day so massaging our face promotes oxygen and blood flow and our skin not only does this result in reducing puffiness it also creates a brighter skin tone and appearance and the massage will also increase collagen production which prevents the formation of wrinkles which is my number one goal I'm 28 years old and I'm definitely seeing some wrinkling on my forehead and around my eyes so anything natural I can do to prevent that I am majorly into it but also as I was doing research throughout this process you can use this for lymphatic drainage as well and the function of lymphatic drainage is to remove toxins that accumulate between cells the drainage occurs naturally after each massage and the simulation will decrease any swelling and will improve cellulite appearance lymphatic drainage also improved circulation relaxes the body and combats localized with that so you can do a lymphatic drainage massages all over your body and you can definitely do it in your face as well so you can see my technique throughout the video start to change because I use it to massage my skin wake everything up but I also start doing some lymphatic massage type movements I'll link some videos below so that you guys can watch those for yourself and start incorporating that into your skin routine I know that you don't have to have massagers to do that I think you can just do it with some moisturizer and your fingers so if you don't want to order the massagers then you can just do it at home on your own as well I also made sure to film myself doing this every single day I only skipped a couple days of filming over like a holiday weekend but I still used the product every single day [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so that was my second time using these rollers I know that I'm like doing them in the right direction like on the right parts of my face I just don't know like if this one's only meant for this and this one was just meant for your jawline and like stuff like this but I think they both do like a really good job I know that it also takes like at least a couple weeks to like notice some differences but I know that if you stick with that long term like it does you know help like lift your skin and prevent wrinkles and stuff like that and not sold my ultimate goal for this I have just been using this anti-aging serum that I got off of Amazon I'll link it below along with these right here to get it started then once this kind of dries I just put on my face cream from Lilliana Naturals also on Amazon I'll link that below mixed with my favorite sunscreen ever and the whole world of sunscreen is so good you guys cleanse skin and then I just like keep using these so I will say that after using them like my skin just feels really fresh and awake and tight which is really nice so yeah I'm gonna keep using these for like you know another week or so and keep you guys updated and see if there's any difference at all but really I just want to you know make this a part of my daily routine to keep my skin lifted I have 28 I'm definitely getting wrinkles already and around my eyes and stuff and I just don't want my skin to be super wrinkly and look dull you know I want to keep it lifted and tight and looking useful as long as possible so I'm really excited about these so yeah that was day two I will keep you guys updated and check in with you all tomorrow [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys so I just wanted to go ahead and close out this video and give you all like some final thoughts about the face massagers I'm definitely gonna keep using them they're easy to use and they seem like pretty durable like they're gonna last a long time this video wasn't sponsored the massagers weren't sent to me or anything so this really is my honest review I've used them every single day for two weeks now and I really like them that make me feel awake and tightened and a little bit lifted in the morning they just feel really good and anything natural I can do to give me better skin and prevent wrinkles and aging I'm all about it so yeah overall I would definitely recommend them they will be linked below if you guys want to check them off for yourselves yeah I liked it and I'm gonna keep using them that's about all I can say right now because it's only been two weeks maybe in a couple months I'll do an update and I'm y'all can see for yourselves if you see any difference but overall I really

palette so today's video is gonna be a review video and also i have shown you the swatches and um the demo part and you can just figure it out and you can you know make your own choice so please watch this video till end uh so yeah let's get started with this video so first of all let's talk about its packaging uh so i received the product in this cardboard box from flipkart and this is how it looks so as you can see the product from right here and it is it says mars 24k gold face primer brightens and repairs the skin um two in one makeup fix spray silky smooth texture so yeah and it retails for 4.99 but you can always get this in discount and um yeah the net weight is 30 ml plus 35 maybe the primer um quantity is 30 ml and the makeup fixer quantity is 35 ml and yeah that's how it looks and uh let me just open this box and let me show you so you'll be getting this plastic thing right here and this is how you'll be uh receiving the product so this uh this is a primer and this is in glass bottle so this is the plastic one so this is a makeup pixel yes guys so uh let me talk about the primer first so it comes in a glass bottle with a dropper uh but it doesn't really work because you know droppers um you know uh the reason is primarily consistency you know it is more like a gel form it is same like aloe vera gel in fact it is much more thicker than aloe vera gel so it's obviously what dropper may i guy need to produce i need right because it is very thick so that's the reason you have a dropper you know prescription so that's the one con i don't because i have used so many primers okay now uh like uh blue heaven and uh and my babe nybay is a really good primer you guys because applied i mean it doesn't fill in your pores but it really gives you smooth and soft texture uh skin i mean surface and also the smooth banana foundation face of blender so that's really a good primer so it's more like aloe vera gel that's it i mean it's more like a moisturizer or you know kind of gel um so yeah for that purpose you can use this so next thing is uh i think so it makes your face kind of very dewy and glowy so [Music] yes guys so now let's talk about the makeup fixer and this is how it looks so if this comes in a plastic bottle and it says 24k gold makeup fix spray silky smooth texture and the net weight is 35 ml so and now this is a really good makeup fixer you guys i mean i'm highly impressed with this makeup fixer because makeup fixer [Music] [Music] for nyb primer because that's a really good primer uh a really good primer so yeah that's it guys and uh yeah don't know my fragrance is so that's it for today's video guys and i hope i've got a video challenge please give it a big thumbs up and please subscribe my channel and please please share this video with your loved ones and um so yeah ugly video bye take care guys [Music] yes [Music] yes [Music] you", "69v-cXf4VOA": "alright so in this video I want to be showing you the Kim boo khempo technique which is adding gold to your silver and it's actually pretty simple to do and all you really need is everything you see right here alright just start off you're gonna need a hot plate so here's my hot plate you're also going to need something to put on it this is just a piece of brass that I have so I can place that on there and it just makes it easier to work with this is a weird textured surface and if you get one that's not just flat like this this is really gonna help you're going to need two different types of burnishers and the reason why you need two of these is one is going to hold your piece down because it's gonna be extremely hot and the other one is going to be putting on your gold so you can use two agate ones if you want to it doesn't really matter what the holding one is but I have a steel one and an agate one and links to everything I'll be talking about will be in the description you're going to need some tweezers and these are going to be used to deal with placing your gold you're going to need a fiberglass scratch brush for pressing your gold into your silver you're gonna want a brass brush and you're going to need gold foil for kambou and I'm also going to be trying this with a little bit of a thinner foil method actually what's in here that is made for enameling of like pins and stuff like that so it's not as thick as the kambou one but not as thin as gold leaf so I've already tested this out and it does work so we're good to go on that you're also going to need a torch of some sort you can use something like that or something a little bit bigger or even a butane little torch if you have that just something so you can heat your work because before we do anything with putting stuff on we have to eat this in a certain way to make it so the outside of this basically turns into fine silver because this is 95 which is sterling silver and it contains copper and we need to burn off the outer layer of copper and I'm gonna show you how to do that now all right so I have my piece on my tripod and my ventilation setup so the thing is with this whole technique is if there is any type of oxidation you will not get good results and the gold will not bond with the silver that's why we're going to heat this and then pickle it to remove any of the oxidation and then heat it and pickle it and eat it and pickle it over and over again until it just stops oxidizing because it removed all the copper off the surface and it just leaves pure silver weird how that works but it that's how it works and then once we do that we can put it onto our hot plate and start attaching our gold so this is all done already and as you can see I've textured some of the back the back of this is kind of matted and pretty much to where I want it to be don't bother polishing this and polishing isn't going to be the best thing for this technique because once we put gold on it I'm also going to patina this to black to contrast also we can't keep this again once we put gold onto it so you're gonna want it pretty much done that's why I've done all my soldering and put all my pieces together so this is pretty much done just needs the gold added onto the moon part here and then the rest of it will be the teen in black so keep that in mind try to get it to the point where you're done because once you heat it again it'll burn off your copper you're out for your gold so I'm just going to gently heat this I don't want to get too much where I melts any of my soldering just to the point where it starts to change colors and then I'm going to throw it into my pickling solution to remove all that and by doing this over and over again it just turns off your outer layer of copper [Music] now see how it's kind of rain bowing and go a little bit more until it gets to like a gray looking finish to it and yeah you'll notice it will change a bunch of different colors also wants to do the back of it and you don't want to use any type of flux or anything with this as you're doing it because you want it to actually start to look like this so there we go and they'll go into my hot pickling solution and leave it in there for a couple of minutes take it out and do it again [Music] so you can see how white this is now and it has pretty much a matte finish to it all and that's what we're going for so I'm going to heat it again and see if it's actually ready so how to tell this is ready is when we heat it again it won't have any spots that start changing colors or darkening and that means that all the outside has no copper on it because it's not able to oxidize anymore [Music] so it's just about to the point where it's not really changing anymore still did a little bit in some spots so I'm going to pickle it again heat it again and keep doing this until basically it's just nice and clean so as you can see right out of our pickling solution it's already like really matte looking and this is what we're wanting it to be this weird white matte finish to it I'm gonna heat it one more time to make sure that everything is exactly how I want it because if we build up any oxidation where we're putting our gold down it'll just come off or it just won't stick so I want this moon crest to be as gold as possible I don't know if you can tell on the camera or not but it's not really changing color anymore it does have those weird lines and stuff in it but not at all like how silver normally reacts when you heat it up with no flux on it so this is pretty much good to go so I'm going to pickle it one more time and then we'll put it onto our hot plate and actually start putting gold on it all right so now we're at the hot plate I've already turned it on and it's been warming up as I was doing my work so this whole surface is super hot like hot enough to the point that it will burn you and just staying like this for this long feels like putting your hand over fire so be very careful the ones he's if you're using it as for the heating setting on this I have it set to four and a half on here which I have no idea what temperature that actually is but that's what I found works so you're just gonna take your piece and make sure to clean it if it came directly out of the pickling solution rinse it off and try not to touch it with anything oily with even your fingers really unless you've cleaned it with some sort of alcohol or a degreaser so put that down before I burn myself from keeping my hand over that and we'll let that sit there for a little bit and you'll see it change color I don't know how well it's gonna pick up on the camera but it will start to dull a little bit from the white coloring to a more gray look once it gets to that then we're able to start putting our gold onto it so as that's getting up to temp here is the gold that I'm going to be using make sure not to touch it with your hands for the same reason because you don't want oils to get on to it so basically you'd hold it like this so now that we have this completely up to temp I'm going to start laying tiny pieces of gold onto it so I'm just going to hold everything so the gold is sticking out and then I can grab a piece and then I can place it on the part I want my gold to be and if you get any gold in places you don't want it you can take it off later so once I have it there I'm gonna take my fiberglass scratcher brush and press it down onto the top layers and like I said the even the heat coming off the top of this is really hot so you can't keep your hand over it for too long [Music] and I'm just going to continue that process all the way up the moon [Music] and when you're pressing this on there you don't want to scrub it actually you want to just press down because if you scrub it it will rip and then you'll have holes [Music] all right so that was way more coats than needed but I wanted to get it's the best coverage I can get along the entire moon shape so now I'm going to take my steel furniture and my agate burnisher and I'm going to rub those areas down that I was tapping on so this one just to hold it in place you can also use the tweezers if you really want to and then I'm going to use the agate burnisher to burnish it down [Music] and you'll see it become shiny where you've burnished it down and that's the goal [Music] so now you're just gonna want to let it sit on here and tell that Sheamus becomes dulled also this process is normally done on just flat sheets or different areas so you can place some here if you wanted to and just put different shapes or just different pieces you were bought here and do the same exact process and they will stay there and because it'll fuse to your metal alright so there we go you can see there's a lot of cleanup that I need to do but for the most part that is what I wanted so now I'm going to cool this down so I can actually work with it and take off all the extra gold that I didn't need all right so now that this is actually cooled down enough for me to touch I can take off any of the gold that I didn't want on it originally [Music] and actually at this point it might be easier than me trying to pull everything off with the Flyers I can just use a brass brush since all the places I heated everything and burnished it should be stuck and fuse down and anything else should be loose so what I'm going to do is use the brass brush and some soapy water and gently scrub it off now I'm gonna take a toothbrush and see if I can get some more of that out so that took off the majority of it you can see that there's still some down inside of here and I could just take a [Music] diamond bit and a little really small diamond bits and clean up everything and retexture it a little bit too and a little bit in here too of gold but the most part it's looking exactly how I wanted it to and like I said you can add this to where we wanted so if I wanted this piece up here to be gold I could have put it all over it and did the same process all the way around it or I could have placed it all over in this area and made it have gold spots everywhere but I want the contrast so let me clean up the rest of this real quick so this is just a diamond bit and I'm just gonna go around the inside of this [Music] all right so here we go and you could just leave it like this if you wanted to if you'd like to look of the white and gold but I'm going to tarnish this whole thing using some chemicals alright so I just filled this cup up with some warm water and I'm going to take my piece and put it on a piece of spare copper wire so basically like that and then I'm going to be using some liver of sulfur and then I'm going to take the liver of sulfur and put it into water and then mix it up as you can see I used to copper tongs and it's already tarnished up and it already smells like eggs in here so I'm going to take this and dip it and a swirl it about you can just let it hang there too but this is how I like to do it and the gold will not tarnish because it's 24 karat gold and you just doesn't tarnish in this so it's getting a much darker now so now I'm just gonna let it hang there for a bit and come back in a little bit all right so it's been in there for like maybe ten minutes so let's see here's our back nice and gray black and front there we go so I'm gonna take this out rinse it off and then let it dry all right here it is all dried off and I'm going to take my breath brush and kind of stuff on my uh black areas and the brush happens to be wet still so it's gonna have to dry again but [Music] and I'm just doing this too for that aesthetic of it it kind of shines up black a little bit but it still gives it with like a kind of brush to look yeah here it is pretty much all done there's a little bit of gold stuck down in there but I'm not gonna worry about it because I'd had to re-do all the blackening to this but I liked how it came out with it's kind of rustic look to it and the contrast between the gold and the black so yeah if you want to make something like this or you don't have to do two parts like that you can just make a disc and texture it with something and then add gold and certain spots or you could do a half and half look so one part would be Gold's other part would be textured black and silver and then you can kind of polish up the high points so there's a lot of options for it but that's basically how you apply the gold and do the Khumbu or kambou style of adding the gold foil to silver so if you'd like to see how I made this particular piece I also uploaded a video that just shows me building it and how I put it all together there's no talking or anything it's just kind of a kickback video that I uploaded the same time as this one so feel free to check it out it'll be up here in a while the cards and one of the links at the end of the video so that's about it I actually really like adding this gold accent to stuff and I might be using it more often and there's other ways like plating and just straight up using gold but this is one of the cheaper ways to get into it so that's about it for this video if you have any questions leave a comments I have a full list of all the tools needed to do this in the description and I'll have it in a pin to comment below this video I also have links to basically all the tools I use on my website

next time bye [Music] you", "r2F0t_XRKoY": "so foreign", "-qiHavGuJP8": "[Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] you", "S1pfvbiwdC0": "hey YouTube I'm Keanu you're in Kiana's kitchen of course I just came out real quick because I want to do this little disclaimer before I even start in on my video I just want to let you guys know that the dust that I'm gonna be using in my video is totally edible I have used this dust a number of times in all of my baked goods okay meaning my cakes my cupcakes on my decorative cookies on my cookies I put it in the icing I added it to vanilla extract or like a clear vanilla extract and I kind of got that gold color that I brushed on my cookies guys what I'm saying is that this gold dust is totally edible so before everyone come with the that's not edible that's not this you're not supposed to eat that I have worked with this that's the number of times I'm not new to this I'm true to it again I have used it many many times okay and it's say on the bottle decorations only and what they mean by that is that the decorations that you use on your cakes meaning the icing the frosting in the chocolates or the candy little decorations or whatever that you put on the cake but guys what do people do with that stuff once you give them their order they eat the decorations so again the gold dust that I'm using is edible so please don't come from me in the comments you're not supposed to you're not supposed to eat this you're not supposed to that because I am one of those content creators that will come back for you okay so guys like I said I know what I'm doing I've used this does many many times and it is totally edible and I will let you guys know where I got the dust from as well how much I paid for it etc etc so um again I just wanted to come on and do this little mini you know disclaimer facial video um just letting you guys know what's wet so again all that other stuff guys save it because again I'm not new to I'm true to it so so let's start on our video all right guys first things first in my bowl here I have my chicken that is clean okay yes I am one of those people that watch their chicken you have to um so I got my chicken in here I got my flats and I got my little mini drumsticks legs whatever you want to call them so the only seasoning that I'm going on on my chicken wings with is my house seasoning which is basically seasoned salt onion powder garlic powder and pepper mixed so everybody keeps asking me what's in your seasoning mix I've said this many times and other videos I've even posted it so season salt onion powder garlic powder and pepper is my house seasoning blend okay just the FYI for you guys so I'm gonna go on with this and this may look like a lot but I'm gonna go in with my hand and just kind of swish everything around meaning just get everything mixed and look after you get everything coated you don't even look like you had that much seasoning up in here to begin with just go ahead and just mix everything thoroughly again if you have a seasoning mixed our seasoning or whatever that you use for your chicken just go with what you use we're gonna start going in with our chicken we're gonna go ahead and just get it directly into the oil and remember not to put too many wings into your skillet because you will bring down the temperature of your grease and your chicken is just going to sit in your pan and it's going to fill up with grease and you don't want no reason ship and after I get my drink my mom grease my chicken in here we're gonna go ahead and start on our butter okay one of my sauces one is gonna be go the other is gonna be silver okay and for both I am making like a spicy barbecue sauce so I'm gonna go in with some hot sauce and you don't matter what brand hot sauce you use okay because these are like I said gonna be like kind of borderline hot and spicy barbecue wings so the hot sauce I'm going in with is this right here just some brand that I bought that was cheap okay so I'm gonna go in with about a half a cup okay so now we're gonna go in with the barbecue sauce and I'm using sweet baby Ray's but again you can use whichever brand you want so I'm just gonna go in with a little bit of that I'm gonna go ahead and just give this a good mix pretty much just like that there okay so the gold dust that I'm gonna be using is this right here is five loops cake and this is 24 karat gold dust you guys see right there where it says decoration only that's what I was talking about at the beginning this is for cake decorations like I said the icing conditions take decorations I've seen frosting things of that nature can be whatever this right here is for that don't wanna don't want to clear up again but this right here is what I'm gonna be using here is my goal of sauce guys so I'm not gonna go in with my chicken I already did my silver one sorry out and show you guys how I did those but you guys will see them in just a second so we're gonna go in with the chicken so here we are here I went on ahead and got some of that sauce off of here okay so I went on ahead I got my wings coated in my sauce so now we're gonna go ahead and go on with our gold desk and guys don't think I'm gonna be making these all the time because I have a night I just wanted to go ahead and give these a try because I saw these on Facebook and also saw how it was going around on YouTube here so I just said let me go ahead and just try to give this a try and oh my god they are turn it out to you look at that [Music] [Music] [Music] oh here we are here guys I went on the head and I got both my wings onto my plate here and of course we're gonna go ahead and give this a try look at that these are really really good so I'm gonna go ahead and try a silver one so good these are really really good so like I said if you guys still really doubt as far as what the gold is edible or are not edible or whatever just go ahead check on Amazon that's where I got these from and just look for the edible gold dust where it actually says edible but I promise you guys this gold dust is edible okay so on that is it for my video I hope you guys like what you saw this is really good that sauce that I put together with the Hat on barbecue and the hot sauce you kind of taste that more than you do that on the dust so that is it for my video I hope you guys like what you saw if

the next trip see how on Sunday deuces", "2juJ18nEktE": "everyone and welcome back to my channel as you can see I have a completely bare face because today I'm going to test out a product that I saw on Amazon and I was like yes yes yes I have to try and stop if you know me I am a sucker for like anything skincare related or anything that says like anti-aging and you know more youthful skin so I came across this this is the 24k Beauty bar and it has like a little on/off and if you can hear that and you're basically supposed to hit some points and it's supposed to help drain all that fluid and help deep up your eyes and kind of just help with wrinkles even acne and blood circulations so i thought i'm gonna test this out and what i'm gonna do is i'm only gonna do half of my face because it's supposed to have like instantaneous results I think instantaneous meaning maybe after a few minutes and after you just kind of see it's supposed to look a little firmer it was under 15 bucks I want to say so I'm gonna link that below but first we have to review it to go over what I did on my face prior to this I did wash it completely and then I put on like my moisturizer I put on my eye cream because it says that you should put that all in so that way this can kind of help like further penetrate all of that good stuff and then I went in with my Apple biotic apple cider vinegar pads been using these for a few weeks now and apple cider vinegar in general for skin I've always used it as spot treatment for whenever I cut blemishes pop up it like helps with inflammation and it just takes the redness out and for me I don't know if you guys can tell but like um I just feel like maybe now coz I'm in my mid-30s my skin can get a little bit more red in certain areas like I have one brown spot that's here that I have been targeting religiously with vitamin C cream or serums and I feel like it's finally starting to fade a little bit but overall like I just noticed my think that just might be because in your skin cells elasticity is starting to wear down as you get older and so I just noticed a a bit of redness in certain areas this I've noticed just has been healthy with that a lot so anyways I'm going to just go ahead and do this and I'm going to tell you what I'm doing as I'm doing it this doesn't come with much instruction it came with the lake in a little yellow box which I don't have with me and in this little pouch that you can put it in and you have to put a double-a battery inside of it as well it is not included but the instructions were all in a different language so I didn't know what it was so I looked up exactly how to use this and so basically from the neck down you want to bring all that fluid down and then you basically want to rub everything like push all the fluid out of your skin so if you saw my video on Jade rolling which I did a few months ago it's similar to that similar concept except the reason I like this is cuz it vibrates and so to me whatever it's like something that's moving it's kind of like the Clarisonic it's actually massaging and I feel like it's helping the blood circulate and all that good stuff to just go ahead and start I'm gonna first go down the neck I kind of tickles um it it vibrates it tickles my ear and then I'm gonna push away under and this is the jawline area where a lot of people always want to see firmness so I'm going there and then here what I've seen it actually feels really good I have to say I don't know if it's really working but I like it in terms of the fact that isn't I reading it feels good okay so like what I saw was that you want to take a point like right under your cheek which is like right here and then turn so I was watching some videos and it was kind of like those they're my first and turning and that's supposed to help I guess firm this area right here around the mouth and then hold so you just do that few times and then go all the way out for the under eye turning it this way and holding it like on a pressure point and letting that sit there's like three pressure points under your eyes that you're supposed to help like break up any puffiness and that to me makes sense almost like where you would put your under-eye cream then you just go and 30 to 60 seconds I think is like the average time that you want to spend and I could imagine if you put this in the refrigerator and it's cold and it's vibrating that would be amazing right and then you just take all of that and swish it out like basically all of that excess fluid is going to be drained out of your skin and down down and out this reminds me of a long time ago I remember seeing an infomercial for like an ab roller but it was like it's a belt you just put it on you and it vibrates and it's supposed to help give you a six-pack so this is what this kind of reminds me of although because it's on my face it definitely is still like tingling or vibrating um so I like the idea of that instantly I will say that I do notice it's just a little bit firmer so first impression would I buy this again I think I would because of the fact that it is under $15 I think that's a huge score - I love that it vibrates to me anything that I mean the way I think about it is like you massage your muscles in your body and like sometimes you do the dry brushing because you want to help promote blood circulation so there India a promoting good circulation around the face especially as we're getting older that to me is a huge plus super pretty I love that it's gold and it's easy to use as far as instant results I'm looking up close in mirror I feel like everything is really soft here and I feel like it helped me definitely better absorb the moisturizer so like for instance under my I feel like on this side you can see a little bit of concavity you can see like where the lines were and almost like where I have like where I need to put concealer so it looks more lifted and here I just feel like it does kind of feel more lifted I would say overall I am pleased with this um I am definitely going to add this to my routine because I think it is well worth it so with that said I'm going to leave everything below and that's about it I will keep you guys posted um maybe in another two weeks or so as I'm doing more videos I'll just kind of update you guys on this little guy and let you know what I think about it let me know if you guys want to see more of these kinds of videos or if you have any products that you're like oh my gosh I want to try that and I don't know if it works these are really fun for me to do especially when they deal with skincare because I'm all about that you guys know the drill like share and subscribe and until then I will see all of you beautiful people next time bye", "zWZJ3gU39UA": "another day in the fish room still working on the 24 karat gold guppies breeding more of the long thin white cloud minnows and we'll see what else we get into the 24 karat gold guppies are doing well the females are really fattening up i think some are about to drop and they may have already even with all this cover in this tank we still don't have any fry so my concern is that they're eating them and the way that this tank is set up i can't put a hang on breeder box on either side uh just because there's a tank and i don't want to put it uh on the front of the glass there so i'm gonna do uh the breeder net that i have and put a female in there might put two breeder nets because i do see two females that might drop pretty soon and i want to make sure that i don't miss a drop from one of the females so if we look closely we can actually see that there are fry in here let's zoom in on them there it looks like we got two there hiding in the water sprite here floating up top which was why i kind of let it get out of control here because i wanted the fry to be able to get away the parents really can't get through all the water sprite there so that's good to see i might net these guys out and put them in a different tank just because i don't think that they'll make it long-term with the adults the strain loves to eat fry it's not pretty but i think it'll do we have plenty of cover for newborn fry in there the water sprite i have it floating up top and i try to make sure that the bottom has some hiding places too i probably should add a little bit more but this is good because i have to lift this lid up to feed this tank uh twice a day so i'll be able to peek in and see if there's any fry and only this female will have the ability to eat them versus all the other fish in here and i decided to leave any fry that i had i had like maybe five or six in this tank hiding probably in the back there and we'll see if they get eaten um they're pretty good so far but i also added a auto feeder to this tank just now so that's going to feed three or four times a day in addition to my twice a day feeding of live baby brine so that should help make sure that the adults are full and maybe they don't want to chase those babies as much i think it's time to move these guys out of quarantine they've been in quarantine for about three weeks now a little bit extra time because if you remember we unboxed them and they were in pretty bad shape i think the black pariebas if i'm saying that correctly are definitely ready to go in the 75 with the other fish they're a little bit bigger than the blue marbles there and you can see that they're starting to get the especially this one starting to get the patterns with them uh that they're not just a solid black so i'm happy to see that so i think i'm going to move those to the 75 and this random blue ghost and give these guys an extra week or two with extra food to kind of get them a little bit bigger just because i'm a little concerned with the archer fish in there that he might go after one like that smallest one right there and while we're right here we can look at the blue medaka rice fish fry doing really well in this tank and you can see that there's almost like two different color fry that one in the center is a nice dark color and already showing the blue coloring on the body at oh i don't know maybe three weeks old and you can see they're feeding on the and sifting through this algae and all this detritus on the bottom there this is a perfect tank for a new fry all algae and stuff all microorganisms on the plants on the walls they're eating live baby brine right now but if i were to move these guys out and put a new batch in this would be the perfect environment for them you can see even at this size that they're just looking for food and sifting through everything here are the black parabas mixed in with the other angelfish in the 75 we've got the archer fish in here somewhere there he is so far they're doing good in this tank you can see some of the angelfish are much larger i feel like with angelfish they really jump from quarter size to adult size really fast compared to their growth rate uh when they're fry to dime size to quarter size but everyone's getting along it along in here no one's picking on each other everyone's able to get food and i'm sure they're enjoying the much larger tank setup the snow white guppy fry already getting really big you can see one right there there's about six that made it in the tank and you could see from the last time we checked in on this tank that it's really grown in uh the frog bit is really growing in with the nice roots hanging down perfect for the fry to hide out in from the adults i also went ahead and added this hang on breeder box you can see i put a female in here that i think is about ready to drop her gravid spot in the back there is uh really pronounced so i'm guessing within the next few days and i want to make sure i'm getting a lot of fry with these guys there's another female in here that's probably going to drop pretty soon and i'm confident that they'll make it at least a majority of them the way this this tank is set up this one we can kind of see on the side here with a ton of plants pogo stem and sawdust octopus and the dwarf sagittario on the bottom there really providing enough cover and i'm glad to see that these guys are healthy and finally starting to produce some fry here's where we move the parents of the long fin white clouds you can see that these two tanks are covered in algae and these aren't this light is right up against the glass so that's causing a lot of algae issues i have to run to home depot and get some zip ties to have it up higher but i don't think the fish mined i'm going to clean this up give them some plants and i'm going to do what i did earlier uh you know a couple weeks ago and select the best fish from here and move them over into this tank with some java moss and have them spawn in there just to get another spawn of the long thin white clouds going i've been getting a ton of emails asking about when i'll have them available so i'm just going to go ahead and make more so that i don't run out and people get upset got both tanks cleaned up got the fish moved over so on the right here we have the selected breeders the nicest males and females the males with the longest fins and some of the females that have nice long fins as well and i just put some moss here in this group uh still a nice group but uh i don't think that i'm going to pull this mop i just want to make them feel a little more comfortable we got the floating pogo stem installation put octopus up top and some moss and now they're right up front where i could see them which is nice and we'll probably just do what we did last time with these guys except this time i'm going to pull the moss out instead of the parents after a couple days and then i might just keep cycling through moss and keep them permanently in this tank because it is one of the lower tanks so it does get it's right on the bottom so it gets cooler these guys like it cooler so i don't have to put any heaters on the bottom finally have some activity again in the albino red ear koi guppy tank although they're not really red ear anymore you could see the two big females we have are the only ones left that we have from the original import but they have the nice red ears and look really good interestingly none of the fry have the red ears so i'm curious to see if the next generation might have some red ears but i think i'm definitely going to continue working with this line i like it a lot maybe they'll just be considered the koi guppies which is fine but we did get a drop from that one of the big females and this breeder net here you can see we got a ton of fry in there maybe 30 or so and they actually made it because i was able to see that the female was about to drop and put her in the breeder net wasn't getting any fry for a long time just because all the juveniles were growing up and they love eating fry in this tank even with an auto feeder and live baby brine they really like to taste their own fry and because there's so many juveniles in here they were just chasing them down as soon as they were born i'm assuming it's because i never saw any fry but you could see these females uh that i raised definitely seem old enough to have fry their own so what i'm going to do with this tank is keep that breeder net for right now but i want to move to the hang-on breeder box that i do on most of the guppy tanks you can see in the snow white guppy tank here i do the hang on breeder box i like that a lot better because i could see what's going on in the breeder box more i can't really see what's going on especially with all the plants kind of blocking the view it also takes up a lot of space in the tank and it doesn't really look that good granted that a hang on breeder box doesn't look that great either but i like it better reminds me to specifically feed that that breeder box versus here where i might forget sometimes also with this breeder net the only thing i don't like about it is that it has the holes on the bottom as well so when i put live baby brine in here it makes its way down through the tank to the bottom of the tank so the fry only have a limited amount of time to actually eat the live baby brine and i end up having to feed like akari first bites or really find flake food on the top you can see they're still looking for food at the surface i put a ton of live baby brown in here and it made its way through the bottom the breeder box the hang on breeder box it all stays in there with very little overflow and it's easier for the fry to get the baby brine because it's right in front of them got the tank cleaned up a bit removed some of the excess frog bit so now we can have some light coming through these plants on the bottom here will do a little bit better hopefully and we can actually see the fish you can see all the fry in here a lot more than i thought after i removed everything which is awesome set up the hang on breeder box here and i did put a young female in here this is one of my first generations in my water and she looks like she's old enough to have a couple fry maybe her first drop pretty soon you can see her gravid spot there so we'll see if she drops any fry there's plenty of cover in here and i pass this section of the fish room every day because the live baby brine hatcheries is right over here so it'll definitely be a lot easier for me to to see if there's any frying here quickly check quickly feed and remember to feed because it's out of the tank hard to miss that was another day in the fish room thank you guys so much for watching subscribe if you haven't and we'll see you in the next one", "GLi5A_VGpRM": "what's going on ladies and gentlemen it's a blink be 7:01 come and see you with the weekly update the lady it's almost done you just went okay mother planet looking to rest [Music] marvelous the file colors are

watched my channel when she on like share comment you know something somebody 7:01 on my place love", "qg1f9HHbT7E": "hey everyone welcome back to my channel so today I'm doing another experimental Instagram product video and today I'm focusing on these things right here before I get any further into the video I just want to say no this is not a sponsored video this company doesn't even know that I'm making a YouTube video about these things I just wanted to do an in-depth video because they're pretty interesting and I wanted to see if they actually make a difference so we've got a lip mask and two under eye masks and they are called the 24 karat or 24k gold hydrating collagen lip mask and the 24k gold hydrating collagen eye masks so the eye masks say that they're supposed to refresh brighten and revitalize your under eyes so my dark circles aren't terrible right now but they definitely if you zoom in on my face you'll definitely be able to tell that they're there let's just see if they make a difference and the lip mask is supposed to gently plump moisturize and protect your lips now I have tried every kind of a lip plumper in the book and nothing works on me I don't know why my lips just kind of refused to be plumped in any sort of way I used the things that you like suck on I've used lip plumper glosses and these scrubs DIY home things just to see if anything works but nothing works so what let's go ahead and see if these make any sort of a difference so the instructions on both of these are the same for both packets and it says cleanse and rinse area and share the area is dry apply gently under your eyes and leave for 15 to 20 minutes then you have to gently massage the remaining serum into this so it's fully absorbed my skin is already clean I don't have any makeup on except for a little bit of mascara I'm just gonna take a makeup wipe and wipe off my lips because I did have some chapstick on them and I actually scrubbed my lips on last night because I have to scrub my lips a lot in the winter time just because they get so so dry and so flaky and whenever I scrub them they become very tight and just really even more try so first I'm going to start with the little eye packets just going to rip it open so be careful when you're opening it because it has a bunch of liquid in it so this is what it looks like outside the package it's definitely gold it's really weird so I'm going to pop that on underneath my eyes [Music] [Music] so this is what they look like on and you can't really look down because your feels like your eyeballs are really touching them so it's really already do this but I'm gonna do a little bit one now and gee oh well so freakin few now you have to leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes okay so it's been about 20 minutes I just wanted to take the lip mask off because I cannot talk with it on but they both feel very very cold and very tingly so tingly that it almost kind of feels like it's stinging a little bit my lips don't really feel or look different to me they don't look plumped they could be a little bit moisture eyes they're actually kind of flaking right now but I don't know they don't really look that much different at all to me so let's take off the eye pins you're supposed to rub it serum in after so kind of a little bit red right now because it was pretty tingly so I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about these an individual eye mask and an individual lip mask are two bowls 7.95 so about eight dollars um personally I think that's pretty spendy for an eye and lip mask I know that these are supposed to be a luxury but I really didn't notice any much of a difference with them like as you can see my eyes don't look that much different my lips literally don't look different oh all I really noticed was that they were pretty tingly these are fun to play with don't get me wrong I love them they're really cool to look at and they're kind of just like a cool luxury item if you get them in the package it's something that you can use like once a month if you really want to treat yourself but personally I just don't really think they're worth the money these don't do anything for me like at all even my undereyes don't even look that much different I do think that they're cool though but just not something that I would go out of my way for to buy but anyways I had fun kind of experimenting with these different products I really have been liking and doing these different weird Instagram products and kind of testing them out and seeing if they actually work I think I eventually want to do a redo of the black blackhead mask that I did a while back when I first did a video on it it didn't work very well but then I started doing it over again and kind of experimenting different ways of doing it I found a way that it works so I think I want to redo that video for you guys because a lot of you were saying that I was doing it wrong so I just want to kind of correct myself but yeah if you find any other products that you want me to test out I thought about doing the clear sponge but they're always sold out and literally everyone has been doing reviews on them so I don't think I'm going to do that but if you see any other weird products that you want me to go out and find and try out and I will totally do that for you guys thanks so much for watching I love you guys and I'll catch you my next video bye [Music]", "K9Qqyzha30g": "finally imagine going to a sports bar to watch the big game tonight then ordering yourself 24 karat gold chicken

show this is not good alright 20s is here and leave no it's great I just have to be you know I have to make some decisions alright so at 24 karat gold luxury prism cream I think the word luxury really just sums this up to give you a beautiful opulent glow from the inside out here can be used all over or as a targeted highlighter but remember it's not just a highlighter here you're getting anti-aging benefits in this as well so that blows my mind so this is the 24 karat gold pure luxury lift and firm prism cream what this is is it enhances luminosity it boosts the look of Radiance with 24 karat gold and collodial gold this literally has optical diffusers that like scatters light all over your face so you can use this as a targeted highlighter just like Chantal is doing she's putting this you know above her brows every place that she wants light to be scattered to give her that young youthful looking appearance so she's putting it you know under her brow above her brow on the tops of her cheeks she could do the bridge of her nose you know right above her lip should just give her lip that lifted look you know that youthful look this is gonna give you that flawless targeted highlight but also this has really powerful anti-aging benefits it's going to help firm and tone and even out uneven complexion this is like the best of the best when it comes to highlighting and also treating your skin at the same time and I talked about quick and easy to use I mean oh yeah it's like pop a little on the go glow on it go glow I love that and you know what it really is a case of a little goes a long way so that's it that's all I've put on all right now I'm just gonna do like a little pat pat pat pat pat o-p-s I treating my crow's feet right now they can see that fresh just like Jenga by yourself so you can use this just like Ali stood over top of makeup just to give like that quick extra highlight that extra lift but you're getting you know advanced high-graders here you're getting anti-aging ingredients that are gonna help firm your skin you know lift your skin it just is perfect for targeted highlighting but I want to actually show how you can use this all over your face as like a facial primer just like Christina's doing she's using a little bit she's rubbing it into her skin I want you to notice just how quick and easy she gets a flawless complexion it evens out her fine lines and wrinkles evens out on wrinkled skin tone this is my go-to primer for underneath my eyes when I wake up and I have some darkness under my eyes and I don't have time to treat I don't have time to you know do my 15 minutes with my hydrogel eyepatches I need like quick on-the-go glow I apply this on as a targeted you know it's all over facial primer and then I just powder over top of it where I want to be matte so I want to be matte like my cheek area my chin I want to remain that glow you know on the upper part of my cheeks I want to have that glow on my brow and on the bridge of my nose so i powder where needed and I let the glow shine through where I wanted to and that gives you that beautiful lit from within glow I mean this is so on the go look how gorgeous her skin looks yeah that's amazing and I'm gonna say also Tiffany I like to use liquid foundation a lot of times and I pop my liquid foundation right over this I just use it as a primer fat no problem putting liquid over a liquid window as well I do have a question for you I had written down here that we call this a self adjusting illuminator so what does that mean and how does that even work you as a targeted eliminate anyone else adjusting that adjusting so what that means is that it's for all shade types so this is universal whether you have light fair skin like myself all the way up to the beautiful cocoa skin like my daughter has this is shade sensing it look beautiful on every skin type it adjusts to your skin type and you can use a little all over your face like Christine did to give that beautiful lit from within glow or you can use this as a target a highlight or however you want a little go such a long way this will last you through the spring through the summer you're gonna get so addicted to it you're gonna figure out how to use it in the winter months because this is going to give you that hydration that you need you know the it color corrects underneath the eyes it's 24 karat gold tell me what woman out there does not want 24 karat gold just draped all over their entire face can't name one alright alright so you're getting a nice big size here 1.7 ounces here in

you know it's Girl Talk around here we're like oh my gosh your glow is so amazing and then I hear off from the site I want to glow well we're teaching you how to glow here with Peter Thomas Roth", "fYlhWOKi6PE": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today I'm here talking about faccia skincare this is kind of a follow-up to my last video talking about the brand of the research that I did and what my findings were which weren't much but now that the brand has come forward they have a website they have a social media presence and we're just going to be going over the brand itself talking a little bit more about the owner the brand a couple other things just what people are saying out there so if that is something that you're interested in make sure you keep on watching this video of course and while you're at it hit that subscribe button become part of the wolf pack today now let's get into it [Music] okay so pretty much this topic has gotten a lot more traffic than I thought it would it's not as much as what happened with the story about cosmetics deal because smoky glow and YouTube has talked about it and she's got like a hundred and thirty-some per hundred forty thousand subscribers today gin loves reviews she went on her live chat talking about it dissecting the video I don't know if any of you have seen it I'll try to have her livestream link down below she has two hundred and some thousand subscribers like two hundred and sixty like it's starting to get a lot more attention and the FACA skincare for me on my level has gotten a lot of attention this has been discussed in reddit this has been talked about in the Facebook groups people are selling their product in these said groups the process is arranging anywhere from twenty five dollars shipped down to eight dollars it caused Joe to reach out to me on Instagram and a DM to discuss it so yeah basically I just want to come back to it discuss it further get some feedback on how I'm feeling about the brand in the owner itself so just before we start things let's just begin with the timeline so I posted my video on the fit around 3:00 p.m. so pretty much my research was done than not before because it stayed up really late for it I'm a night person so at that time there wasn't any information available no website no social media presents no nothing around ten o'clock that night is when I got the damn from Joe saying that I've seen your video and I'll be happy to answer any questions that you have about it about ten thirty is when the brand was finally discovered online they finally brought their social media live with Instagram they had a story talking about the brand everything she's saying she's been working on the website and that story was reposted later by boxycharm to their Instagram the next day the ingredients were posted in their Instagram page and the website went love that night now the owner of the brand is Emanuela Arriaga last name before she was married was to Falco and the reason that I know this is because she was featured on a of say yes to the dress I don't know if this was on a the actual TV show on TLC or if it was just the episode on YouTube but we'll have that link down below in the description if you want check it out she is also the owner co-founder CEO of dirty little secret cosmetics it was rumored that her dad gave her the ten thousand dollars to start up the company it's such a good dad and also in that video where she was on say yes to the dress her whole family they seem like they're very very nice people it's a beautiful family and if I'm correct I think they are in Jersey which may be I think she's Italian which that would be watchin the name is skin in Italian so it makes more sense now that I know that so now let's talk about the brand itself the website was found to be made in October of last year now it's not uncommon for brands to go ahead and purchase the domain the website they'll go ahead and build the website but they won't make it live until they're absolutely ready they normally do this well well in advance that way give some time to make all the adjustments to take the photos you know it's a process there's a lot of work that goes into this my concern for this with only being made at the end of October so we're now in the first week of February let's just say it's three and a half months that's really not a long time to get a whole lot done on the website which doesn't really make sense for the timeline this should have been done a long time ago because you have to think that they had time to make the product make the packaging manufacture it get everything together pitch it to brands get accepted by watch charm work out the deals all this stuff get enough of the product together to ship at two boxycharm for them to hold it to get prepared for their LAN coming up because they plan their boxes well in advance and then to get it shipped out and everything like this that process takes a long time and you're telling me that you didn't even start trying to make the website until three and a half months before it's already in the box and the website doesn't go live until people have already received it after we live on Instagram they didn't post the ingredient list in their stories and it was discovered that the claims that they made about the product didn't match what was on the website um so she posted on her website the ingredient list and then said that it was paraben free and cruelty free which reading the reading list it's not paraben free it is in there and then she posted an update saying that it was cruelty free we are how did she word this we are super passionate about this so the website launched and in less than a week and are even changed three times and this time they did have another product coming soon and they have a placeholder for that which is what I wish they had done in the first place um if the issue hadn't have happened with the website not being there honestly my last video wouldn't have really been that you know it wouldn't been much to it because it would have been okay here's a skin care product here it is boom boom boom okay my search would have ended there but because there was nothing out there nothing was live it made me go digging and that is when I found it on different websites like the beauty shop eBay Aliexpress Alibaba people are still reaching out to me with screenshots and websites linking where this similar product can be found there's a lot out there to be honest now the packaging honestly would have been alarmed too much by this because she did say on Instagram that she bought this from a container manufacturer which makes total sense if you're gonna have a product you need to buy your packaging somewhere unless you're making it in-house and I don't see many companies doing that so that I completely understand my issues with with the research that I did I have found a product with not only the exact same packaging but also the exact same type of product it's too coincidental in my opinion it kind of at that point it kind of starts to look like the Beautyblender campaign that they got bashed for when they are saying that other brands were copying their homework that's what it starts to look like and on a side note just to be completely honest I did find a product on Sephora from girl on that has the exact same type of packaging but it's not the same type of material or product now I try not to judge a product by its you know judge a book by its cover but the more that I looked into this and more of research and because we're finding so many other products out there that are so similar to this in my personal opinion I think that this is a private label product if you don't know what that is basically there is a party company that has made the packaging for something made the product has have it already in a nice little package it's not labeled and basically they sell this to other people to individuals so that they can put their name on it and they can sell it it's been rumored that morphe did that for a long time someone even said wet-and-wild did that for a while like different brands have done it it's not an argument over whether products are made in China if they are of worse quality it just comes down to the formulation if you can buy from somewhere else and save a lot more money can you justify charging a hundred dollars for this product while this on Alibaba calm the products of the dupe that I found you can buy 72 pieces of it for one hundred and twenty two dollars shipping Express to the u.s. is three hundred fifty five dollars so you can have 72 pieces of this product for four hundred and seventy seven 90 so under five hundred dollars which for the product itself is only four hundred twenty two dollars you have this product out here that is the exact type of product that sold for a dollar 70 or a dollar forty if you buy over a thousand pieces versus a private-label thing allegedly a private-label thing sell it for a hundred dollars in the US whether or not you want to use this that's completely up to you I encourage everyone to do their own research go out there see what you can find out I would say read the reviews but they're not there except for what's unboxed sheet arm I didn't talk to Joe directly about this and he assured me that all the products are in the Box are completely 100% genuine they are authentic and I'm not arguing this the whole story about story about cosmetics and farce ollie I mean I noticed a couple of differences in the packaging like the color may be slightly off the you know the placement of certain icons and packaging may be off but I'm not questioning how genuine anything is I'm just questioning a brand that you can find it's it's appearing to be private label that's all I've been watching the unboxings online because I've been really paying attention and I think other people are as well because a lot of the smaller channels that are posting these and these unboxings they're getting a lot of views in their videos people are want to see if they're actually using the product some people they get PR from boxycharm I know Brett glam he did an unboxing and he's gotten a lot of views on his video but he didn't try the product he didn't open it and his reason was that he's trying not to be wasteful and he has things that he is already trying to work and go through which makes total sense I'm the same way I don't have a ton of things open just because you get a moisturizer in every box or mascara and every box I'm only gonna open them when I need them or I'm gonna find something to do with it really really soon with this product if you're not really gonna use it a whole lot right away I would actually refrain from opening it because it is probably going to dry out really really soon just because the main two ingredients are water and glycerin I found that a lot of products like that what I've read online is that they dry out really fast so just be mindful from that if you are using it everyone else that I've seen actually opening this and trying it they haven't been wearing on their face they have been doing arm swatches testing out on their skin which I recommend doing anyways if you get any type of skin care you should always make sure that you're not going to have any kind of allergic reaction to it that you're not gonna have any you're not gonna break out you know just be mindful of it and make sure you always do like a patch test the other people I'm still waiting on the unboxings from yari and Suzanne I don't know if they haven't gotten their boxes yet because there are a lot of delays and shipment right now or they have it they were I filmed it and it just hasn't went live yet and so I'm gonna look out for those videos when they do come out honestly I'm curious to see out of those three specifically who's going to use it first make your guesses down below I didn't see that man am you a upload his video today doing the boxycharm regular box versus the PD the premium box I did watch that video he actually tried it he put it on his face and he had he said it was weird and the people who have been testing I have seen them whenever they take the little top off of the jar and they lift it up it is very stringy [Music] I mean I don't I don't know I guess the consistency is really different he said it was really weird and then he also said that the smell it smelled like rich flubber he compared it to likes lon to gak like the stuff that's in the little the little jar and you make it fart he's comparing the smell to that so there's that too so a lot of people may not enjoy the scent now for the girl who is running this brand I know this must be extremely frustrating and stressful she said that she was playing on releasing all the information but I beat her to it we kind of left cat out of the bag before she was ready but and again by launching a new brand it's gonna take you time to figure things out try to get things in order but you have to remember this is a person who it's their first brand she has another brand dirty little secrets so she should already know the process you know or at least she should know more than what's happening now it is rumored that she owns other brands as well I'm Steve Laurent beauty we got this recently in a box she Tarn I should I don't mind this I wished it was a little more creamier but it's okay um it's rumored that she owns sorry my notes are here Luna by Luna and bang beauty personally I wouldn't claim banging whenever that came out in boxycharm everything was dried out and it just it did not go over well I wasn't able to use it for eyeliner it's gel pot eyeliner I wasn't able to use it for that because it was too dried out but I did add some drops to it of the tarte maracuja oil and I was able to use it for my brows for a short period like two weeks and then it was too far gone but basically if you own this many brands these aren't the type of mistakes you should be making and speaking of the bad the bank beauty products I went looking it up after I heard that she owned it and I was just curious to see what people were saying about it and that has it's not got good reviews and it's got a little bit higher than I thought it would but I went through actually reading the comments and a lot of people were saying like this is horrible it's dried out but yet it had five stars or five hearts with charms website so I'm actually questioning people like if you're going to Marsha Tom to write something make sure that your personal experience you are actually grading it appropriately or oh no what's up why there would be so many comments that are horrible and still have five stars it doesn't make any sense bacha already has tons of reviews a lot on there and they're not good and I understand that boxycharm has a set up to where if you review something on their site it has to be something that you actually got in your box I'm not sure if that's still the case or it's still not working anymore because there's a lot on there the last count I think there was like 360 and people just started getting their box like days ago the people who are making comments are people they're saying they haven't even tried it they're just it's they're not even mentioning that they got in their box they're just saying this is crap you know they're things that they're saying are just generic don't trust this brand one-star or don't trust this brand five-star in some cases if you do have this on them and you're enjoying it it's giving you the experience you want make sure you go on there and review it and make sure you're giving it the 5-star rating that you feel or whatever rating you feel it deserves I know whenever I sat down to film this video a lot of just based on how I was feeling about the brand probably people are gonna think that I'm judging them too harshly that I'm being too tough on the brand but it's I'm just sharing what I've been able to find online and all the sources will be linked down below that I that I can link but this is something that is brand new claiming to be a luxury brand the other brands that they own their kind of hit or miss it's not that big of a deal like something from dirty little secrets if it doesn't do that good that's okay it was only like a 14 or 20 dollar item I'm not expecting high-end results from it it would be like judging wet-and-wild 250 it's just not fair but this brand is charging hundred dollars for a moisturizer you are trying to justify the cost for this product and with a hundred dollar price tag you're putting yourself on par with Charlotte Tilbury Estee Lauder the shado who else Bobby Brown these are hundred dollar products you can get hundred dollar moisturizers but these are brands are established their brands in our trust this this other brand is something that's just new Kemal nowhere and I'm finding too many other products out there that are cheap dupes for which either wants a dupe of one or that one's a dupe of this one whichever way it goes and you have something that first two ingredients are water and glycerin now to be honest I cannot compare the ingredients between the two products because all the ones that I found on the other sites like I'll Express in Alibaba not a lot is listed there just their top ingredients I can't compare those against the ones that the faccia is claiming so if anyone has the other they would be able to but I personally can't do that and for what it's worth everyone who has been doing the patch tests or hand swatches the product they seem to be enjoying it they say that it feels very very hydrating it feels good to the skin and that's absorbing into the skin very quickly that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you feel about it and I'm glad that everyone's doing the patch tests as well always do that and I cannot stress that enough me personally I'm not gonna be using it whenever I get it I'm just going to show it on camera it's not gonna go out of the packaging because I don't know what to do with it I'm just gonna send it with my Jaclyn hill Harry lipsticks it's just gonna hang out there till I'm not on there I'll figure out something for it but I don't know at the moment but it's just because it's too similar to what I've seen online to these from these other websites ah personally I'm not comfortable trying it some people out there have been comparing the the launch of this to the launch of a Lamar cosmetics and I think that is completely false I don't think you can compare the two bacio skincare is a brand new brand it wasn't from someone that we already knew like Gabby she was on Instagram every day talking to us hanging out with this playing with makeup for us you know you got to know her on a personal level it felt like your friend and I trusted her and honestly whenever she announced the launch of her brand I was genuinely excited for her and the products by the way spoiler alert they are bummed they are so awesome but this whole thing with Sascha I should Joe whenever we were talking on DM if he could give me some details about it can you tell me about the brand owner how to use it ingredients no can you give me something because the reason this other stuff happened is cause I had nothing to go on is there some information you can give me he declined he he didn't really want to get into it with me because they are going to be doing a feature on the brand throughout the month talking about them after charmers have gotten their boxes and got comfortable with it but honestly I think that's ass backwards I'm sorry I hate to cuss on my channel but it's the wrong way to do it I would have this this company should have had their website they should have had some social media maybe Joe could have introduced them before it's like hey we have a new brand coming to the box it's gonna be here not waiting until afterwards to say something about it it just it seems like there were a lot of opportunities to make this launch go smoother and they just didn't happen um but again if you are using the product you love it again make sure you go to Basha Tom's website and give it some good reviews because right now it is getting beaten it is getting a lot of negative feedback and I don't know if it's from everyone who is who has actually gotten it so I hope if boxycharm is watching this videos will I would definitely check into that to see what's going on and also with some of the other products because if there's something wrong with the site and it's giving something a five-star when it shouldn't that should definitely be addressed but yeah that is everything that I wanted to go over in today's video I'm so sorry this was the long one and I just I don't know this is just me reporting my personal findings whenever I'm whatever I've been told was spawned online it is no personal attack on the owner of the brand she seems like a very lovely girl she just had a baby and congratulations it's just there were a lot of opportunities that's all I'm saying but yeah that is everything that is the video yeah I love you guys comment below what you think of this your feedback and if you've if you've received it I know some people there boxes have been delayed some emails are going out saying they've been pushed back and they should get a tracking bus said the seventeenth I haven't received this email but I haven't gotten tracking either so I don't know but anyways I love you all so much I hope you're having a great night a great day and I'll see you in the next one you", "rxLOeeykIpE": "whatever sweet pizzas your girl Rochelle building coming to you with the live video today today I'm doing a highly requested video of my 24 karat gold marble strawberries what up sweet peach if you're new to my channel don't forget to hit that subscribe button notification the notification bill that you know your girl ro is on and for those that will be rewatching this video this is a live actual time video that was recorded all supplies that I will be using in this live session I will leave it in the description box up under this video just hit that little gray button at the top right corner get a drop-down and you will see the supply links provided for you in that description box hello hello hola hola hola hola to everyone that's joining this live session and I'm gonna get right into it and get started letting you know what I have I have my already cleaned and ready to go strawberries with toothpicks in them chocolate and I have my guitar that I'm going to be using for dipping and my silicone spoon my gold coloring this is a hundred cent edible art to decorate the cake paint my little brush little cup for my paint and my 24 this is my 24 karat lead that I'm going to be using for the strawberries and I'm going to show you how to apply those once the strawberries are done so I'm go ahead and get started I'm gonna melt my candy melts for 30 seconds also for any of the links for training how to dip strawberries or how to milk chocolate properly I believe those links to my previous videos in the description box as well all right hey so I just did the first 30 second intervals and for those that know me I'll mix that those candy melts around and then I'm going to put it back in for another 30 seconds [Music] okay so while that is melting I'm also going to flavor and he melts [Music] okay give that a little stir I got some stubborn mills today and when they melt like this that's when you have to really watch how they go back and forth into the microwave so you have to watch to make sure that they are not overcooked because it will burn so you want to mix this in real good and then I'm going to put this back in for 20 seconds and a lot of times this will happen if you had your candy melts for some time so I'll put that back in for 20 seconds and the flavor that I'm going to use for my candy milk is going to be cake batter one of my favorites and it's by Lauren oils this is actually a 1 ounce 1 ounce okay and now I'm just going to work my candy melts utilizing the chocolate that's chocolate melts it's already melted and the warm warmness of my glass container here it's a process when melting Europe candy melts so you don't want to rush the process you want to if you want a good even coat you want to do the process properly a lot of times a lot of people don't mix and you just throw it back in there and just say hey I'm just gonna melt for another thirty seconds but then that cause grittiness to your mils so just make them yes and then when you do this often times you do not have to put it back in the microwave but if you do you want to cut down the melting time to like 10 to 15 seconds when majority of it is melted like this okay and that also helps with preventing from having that elephant skin or overcooking or reheating your chocolate milks so I'm just working the other stubborn milks that has not melted yet and working work at work okay and if you just don't have it still if if your chocolate or your glass bowl or a coupla cans to cool down and those are not melting then it's okay to pop it in the microwave for about 10 seconds because majority of it is already melted I'm gonna put this back in for 10 seconds [Music] and we are fully melted here make sure you give it a stir to make sure all of them on and now I'm going to just add a few drops of the cake batter to just one to two drops I should have a dropper but can't find it right now but it don't need to be no more than that once or two drops is very strong it's very potent you don't need even if you had a full dram you don't need to add 1/4 DRAM to your candy melts okay you're gonna overpower the flavor of your chocolate melts and then plus it if you do that it'll come out tasting like medicine so you want them to have a flavor and the taste but you don't want them to have it tasting like medicine so be mindful of how you add your flavoring to your candy milk alright so here's the magic to the madness everybody's been waiting for so what you gonna do for the marbleization is you're just gonna take your piping bag let me warm this back up for about 10 seconds sitting [Music] you see over there y'all still with me a little a somebody wants to contact me over sir y'all still here hello hola hola okay all right here we go all right all right so what you're going to do is take the milk chocolate that you have in your piping bag alright and just make some lines going into chocolate and you can do this with any okay checking your strawberry grabbing the leaves with the toothpick alright going straight in and twirling as so and always like this grab my bottle okay and you can continue to dip it's better to have a full cup of chocolate when doing so and just going right in I'm just picking a spot over here where I see some lines that okay you want to focus on that swirl and try to catch as much onto your strawberry and if it you know weakens out or if you don't have any more of the chocolate the milk chocolate then just drizzle more into your into the into the cup okay y'all gonna come out a little differently like I said if you need to add more just more don't add too much because you want to see the lines the marbled if you had too much of one of the opposite color it'll override your main color so one back in like that and Donna's last one here all right that's that okay those going to dry and that is the marble effect now adding the gold the gold line you want to take the edible art paint you want to shake it up really well this is a hundred percent edible okay it's an edible art decorative cake paint and this is in the color this is a metallic color and it's need gold honey gold okay put me a little bit in this cup here okay so what I'm doing is I'm gonna choose like just follow the line you know you can choose a section of the line like right here I'm going to just like this open part here like a V so what I'm going to do is just detail the outline of it and just go along this way don't have to be perfect okay and then I'm just going to find another area and just come along one of the other lines here and then do one at the bottom and I'm gonna let that drive and do one more we said I'm gonna follow this line here and then come over here and then come down this line here now my brushes us a little bit thicker but it's okay it like I said I don't have to be perfect and like if you get one of these that don't have too much of a Marvel you just want to create a line you can do so I'm gonna start back here and for the front and then come along this one just pull off a little bit and I'm just creating oh okay and that's how you do that effect now using the goldleaf these are the 24 karat gold leaves a hundred percent edible okay they're coming these little paper slits here you can take you a brush or you can take you a piece you break it off or you can cut it out and what I'm going to do which is why it just wants who and it don't matter where you lay it just I'm just Oh once in leg once it off it would sorry about that yeah but once this is going to stick so be careful that make sure it stays and the low rapping and I'm just tapping the press well make sure you got a different brush gonna do it with the one you painted with just add that and just take it to another spot separating it and that's how you do your 24k 24 karat in the air my version my version you don't need to add water anything to it because it's going to stick if you have a dry brush use that you don't need to be wet because it's going to stick alright and that's how you make the 24 carat marbles strawberries and adding you go to that that's it he seems likely just like that just these creatives and applying the work of art there you go don't root to do okay any questions before I go on answer five questions so that those is just joining can review the video but

different setting today and if you love it and isolate all my days this is so comfortable I don't know I thought didn't think of this before I am recording on my bed I'm trying to be quiet well I think it's comfortable and basically I got a new ring light that is basically blinding me because I got the wrong oh my god is so bright I got the wrong filter thingie whatever and whether this is a muscle Schwimmer actually I bought a ring like two weeks ago and it was the 18 by 14 one and initially it didn't work so then I bought another one from Amazon this time because the last one from eBay and this one is like this tiny and the finish the thing is for the bigger one so I've got no finish time the light is so pride I think like it's making the difference already put on my interface that I needed something for my face my face is so dry recently and she said no matter how much I exfoliate it's not bringing my face more like my skin back to me so gold file a so it's basically a gold file collagen facial mask so it's a crystal collagen gold powder facial mask and what is it a okay so I'm literally for the read of the answer is it instantly instantly lifts and firms moisturizes and rehydrate rehydrate is that a real word I know when you say were to not system rehydrate I think it's a word okay so it whitens and illuminates all that will fall for a couple couple of total actual balls and overall total a whole total overhaul Allah Allah Allah open basically way selling New Year's makes for all skin types and especially to fatigue and dehydrated skin basically I don't haven't been sleeping at all and my skin just feels so not tight in a good week I in by the way like as in try and like I've I don't know I'm just I'm not speaking as well so I guess that's not helping but I really wanted something to hydrate so the directions on the lens and dry your face thoroughly open this photo package and apply the mask on your face gently press the mark onto your face to create a snug fit apply it any excess bio collagen gel over your marks or better moisturizing effect it may be the other move you guys can see it's got water something like watery in that zone as you can see can you see that just got water anger yeah you can see so it's kept wet you know what the word if we're going to what open up yeah and I'm scared the waters gonna feel all over me open it up fish because that would be look very helpful it's like so and this basically really wet and I put and makeup on my brows but I think also a good idea but anyways everything else is clean and stuff finally put my scarf back over the water for me I'm just going to put it on my face now but I have a mirror for this if slipping down guys is like slipping John hey ladies love mine even the awkward pinky okay cool oh crap great so you have to make sure it's snugly fit I feel like that's not that easy to do because the nose doing it what well not so easy to do and this heart skipped in okay so I'm gonna try and keep em hmm but it's not touching here I'll see if it was like that that would be really good unless I'm going to hold this down mm-hmm like for the rest of the face is pretty strong this plot keeps coming off I know you guys are probably looking at let me know you could have touched it there no God it's not social I just wrap my scarf around it to keep it I'm cheating nothing yeah I think that's the best I'm gonna have to hold it here because this looks like it's not stopped on this latkes didn't look much yes I can't laughs because okay so I'm gonna hold a yard anyways I'll do that then and then what I do is um and basically it says wait a honey would look and it said apply any excess Voyageur sure if only you could sit there like so I actually plan offices so it's all you can do now basically this I'm gonna put on 20 minutes a 60 now um yeah [Music] Oh mm-hmm okay officially welcome you want me good luck Joe how'd you feel good bring it nice children okay I'll see you guys when it's done all right okay so and it feels it does feel fresh like I've still got some of that collagen thinking stuff water stuff and all that will come in for a closer look a which isn't a good idea on my browser still they're not bad but like my face actually feel of cleanses now also one lip style feel as Prime I feel like these things are like to see walls of you know it's just made to believe this when other to I mean kind of cool 24 karat gold but I do I actually feel like my face feels nice if you get one in Turkish feels refreshed I don't actually know if you mean to wash your face after this because it was all wet with that stuff that they had on many left and your skin for like 20 minutes or so whatever it's a 20 to 30 minutes I probably will leave on for 30 minutes if I had the time but my skin actually does feel nice it feels refreshed it feels hydrated if you get one mean so in that sense yeah it's done its job I don't really know like you don't be the judge of it because feeling wise it definitely feels refreshed and hydrated so why would you is our leave our leave like several different links from eBay or Amazon for these collision masks but I bought it off voucher for $6.99 o'clock p.m. T which is about 10 pounds so that you guys can try it and let me know where you guys think did you guys like this mask thing do you feel like it made a difference over here I don't think you'll make an instant different into more skin we're so so soft so basically what it does is once it gets of you when I put it on it was actually quite cold it was really really nice it felt so soothing so once it gets to my body temperature it starts releasing moisturizing and regenerating active ingredients into the skin supporting the skin's natural renewal process for fresh and healthy clothes that basically just means that once you write your face book that long living on it is going to do some good job and which actually I feel lucky has it has it my skin does feel actually quite nice so obviously I just got a I probably will wash wipe away with wipe this remaining smell it's very sweet donie in that kind of if you guys have any thing else I you guys want me to try out for you guys and if you guys like this video then obviously give a thumbs up subscribe and let me know what else you guys want me to do I'll see you guys make", "vSWxVGKOFo4": "hi guys and welcome to yet again another Parker Brothers video behind me now as you can see I've got a spec detailing behind me some of you may know these from supercars in London so I'm quite excited to to introduce you to the guys in a minute bends down pulls down a good friend of mine as well and there's also a new guys that just started working for the company it's actually training today the main point of this video is they're good as a ceramic coat my 24 karat gold wheels so listening guys you're going to learn a lot today [Music] quite enjoy so next now is got been the owner of the company and pull over here so they thought through exactly what you doing today to make private a them of you for those up to put protection on these wonderful wheels what we actually applied is a ceramic coating on each anti-scratch technology products so effectively like another layer of black ones of the vehicle through the whole layers of information on the vehicle yet all the wheels so to speak are the durability Michael's equally quick which will scratch it's a hydrophobic property as well so it's pretty much self-cleaning and you'll notice with these with Google vehicle and cleanliness over guarantee from in the world of catalytic we would like to have a lot easier as well as those functions were very ceramic coated it can be a pilot or anyone that they provide to the surgery don't generally be detailing to finally watch the speed of also I make will follow the guidelines in the books there's well as be hydrophobic being extremely durable and open oil agencies websites particularly tools themselves be 224 parabolic now they're 24 kind of beginning to be more specific more car and you know and so that they're going to hold their lust in a period circle for coming year how long did it last if you like that I mean with with tips that we've been doing I've been doing with this product especially subside it minimum of what year but like a big yes lovely little work so anything or any car or you can get right to it it's about looking after it so it should use some with pre acidic a childhood removal to can we get the car washes and things like which tarnish a lot of plastic submittals the object of this product decreased recently so up to you literally show you later reader ph-neutral will clean up our integrity work performance or there is no switch where it's much equation so clean so he's always important occasion isn't equal so the image exactly themselves so this is the magic bottle your guys benefit you can get this online and rule for the description down below and the website we need what is actually 55 pound plus postage this is what you get you get sort of a couple of microfibers in there and these little parrot suspense focus focus for a little bit more thickness or not growing again I've talked about it was probably last five years of really me in the street that looks or emit code without the curly actually create return a channel for the Hartman Skelton through the knowledge as well as things obviously working to prod daily serve because of the year it'll be always tweeted things going to the application process a lot easier much as fast for anyone was to buy this particular product a lot of stories out there that the durability factor the toughen them when they cure curing times done can be quite quickly quite slow so it is about application and one of the things I've learned over the years is you see a lot of others from it from pleasing sound but block pad and to attach to it it works well to get me wrong we used of that part of the pack but over here we have difficult gifts and with nooks and crannies and we looking for that Sonia our products we played around with application pass right in your safe I'm going to come up and with what were these makeup plasmodium certain accrediting in the box for you anyway but they live free so they work splinter our movie for city does anything little bit was employed using these pads so they're pretty beneficial for us most cheaper they work it's literally not making the difference so that's that would that show that developing or she will get through quite a few people the application if we work till car people knees will stay before we get to a baby boy toasters but it was pretty cheap should automatically they do the job perfectly investigate every little different kind of wish sometimes you institution a movie music lactation book just click on welcome you mention about the heat in the world war yes and Japan very mean trade temperature-wise and we producers we use on it and they actually load up to fourteen hundred and eighty degrees without burning originally originally as toilet was designed before and why NASA back many many moons ago and it's applied to is that the Rockets are subsonic would like and adapted to in they burn up makes a little calling inside the shell as though four hundred eighty degrees and maximum temperature or starts obviously firming off into the period so imagine two assistants searching people Makara geometry and also will be modified completely operations missile systems yet are they willing to go to the best and very expensive to buy a little rough out what you get dirt sometimes very quickly what's applying this product for many and economic conservatives who shop to just to point out that and you can put some metal glides they are anything you want literally watches I've had you know in solar panels virtually anything precious of this fried way to any kind of plastic works extremely well and also he's gotten really highly be protected or me too so it works build Alaska trip not the old console cough suffer quite quite badly we be waiting time support for white color will bring back into recent black and like anything you can restrict it know the calculus between applies regarding to make you clean better than mapped onto the premises where will result using the safe knowledge because you'll be actually totally well they go there's an insight on the product pretty incredible stuff [Music] well I just went around the back of the van and pour actually just showed me this stuff and it's called lit by a Michelin King and it's unbelievable stuff it's actually got gold it's gold flecks in it real gold Fleck in it and it's nearly 600 pound for a pot and if you because I'll get out close to the camera you may be able to see the gold in it there's an insightful yet dull wax unbelievable so the bed is currently enough for said he's going to go get some of my black center caps collar did the discoverer mention earlier than real expensive would there would be gold flaking the work talk us through briefly been on the clear that won't be blackmailed so you said to me you know that this is really pretty boring when environment the world's of gold themselves so what we've done is we've got a protective coating with the ceramic you've cured we've dried up we polished it back just to give it to the glove or an algorithm is applied which you can served on one already it is called glitter by Mitch linking it's a bespoke wax and developed presumably male for us we go to people that collectively as far as product you're only good through rust as well it's called gold flake in association it's probably quite a lot to see in the camera I don't know it's called a gold flake so we've also just applied it to this particular what would you call it will ya happen and it's also curing off for the moment and then give another 5 or 10 minutes will literally buff that up and it will have a nice gloss making it very subtle not in your face [Music] so Ben's gonna quickly go through how to apply that the come in itself it really is idiot proof if I'm honest it really started on this as applying it really is easy then suddenly it just lifts you just put in a few drops as you can see just on to this pad this is pretty literate go anywhere you want just make sure it's generally pre even which split this will with you to do so yourself into a half ball for courses so to speak you don't love to see do too big your area because as you can probably see all ready to start the Cure off so sees you replied on there because it really is easy is that the most important things to make sure you've got a nice clean slot and microfiber cloth and then you can literally just start up and straight away you can see the difference already where it's a little bit misty so this just lightly but you don't press too hard because you need that Mar and scouring the paper you obviously applying and protecting into just a nice gentle bus and then literally within the next five to ten minutes you'll feel it go quite tacky so it is important to you my fingerprints it's gone tacky already so literally is killing very very very quickly so the great thing about the application process has been to see themself is it is generally but improving easy once you know what you're doing in front of the guide knowledge across generally go wrong so just button up now which is done this quarter that would be nicely tacky now and literally mimics five 10 min to start curing itself often of going through the smooth we were showing instructs has been done Hartley [Music] right guys so that's it the wheels are now ceramic-coated I just wanted to shake down and say thank you thanks very much for my fabulous telescreen that's good pleasure means you guys even really nice to me guidance Sonia song enjoy themselves open which is space

This video was pending for a long time. This is the Anker 24K Gold-plated iPhone charging cable. I have another product here from Anker. This is Thunderbolt 3 dock, which I'll get to next. Let's begin the charging cable unboxing. The box is a black and gold cardboard box. Remove the plastic wrap. Sliding the box out of the cardboard, you can see the Anker logo in gold text. Flip open the box easily. Inside, you find the two gold end connectors. In the top portion, you find a leather storage pouch for the cable, with the Anker logo. The leather pouch is secured closed with a gold snap button. You can see just the cable-ends. The rest is tucked away underneath the insert. Finally, let's remove the cable. It's a double-braided cable with 24k gold-plated cable heads. The scratch-resistant stainless steel cable heads are USB-C to Lightning cable. This is the first time, on my channel, I bring you a gold cable. The black-and-gold braiding definitely stands out. The 24k gold-plated cable ends definitely bring a rich look. The double braiding of the cable makes it stiffer and durable. It can withstand 35,000 bends. So do you need a gold cable for everyday use? Of course not. In my opinion, it's just about the looks. Let me know in the comments if you would use this gold cable every day or would you just keep it for the looks. I never thought, in my wildest dreams, of unboxing a gold cable. I've talked about this cable on Instagram. Although this pouch came with the cable, you can use it to carry your phone, this cable, and any adapter. Anker's 24k Gold Cable is priced at $99.99. It's a 2020 special edition product so is available for a limited time. This cable is available in limited numbers, only in the US. If you're interested in buying it, the link is in the description. A gold cable is a fun way to upgrade a traditional cable. Do you need it? No. Does it look good? Yes. If you buy a non-gold traditional braided cable, it will cost you $21.99. A USB-C to Lightning cable from Anker's website will cost you $19.99. All of Anker's cables are Mfi certified so can be used with iPhones. This gold cable comes with a lifetime warranty. The next product is Anker's 13-in-1 Thunderbolt 3 Dock, with 13 ports. Its price is as heavy as its weight. The regular price is $299.99 but it's on sale currently at $249.99. This video will weigh its pros and cons so you can judge if it's worth buying. I've actually been using this dock for about a few weeks. But I've re-boxed it for the sake of this video. This is Anker's PowerExpand Elite 13-in-1 Thunderbolt 3 Dock. The dock's the first thing you see when you unbox. And the product manuals fell... This is a small-but-powerful device. Let's talk more about it. Next, you have a power brick to support the dock. Of course, a 13-ports product will require more power. Your normal USB-C port can't handle such a high-power product, hence, a power brick. Next, you have a Thunderbolt 3 cable. For those that don't know, the newer MacBook Pros after 2015 offer only 2 or 4 USB-C ports. To connect more devices, you would need a dongle or adapters like this Anker 7-in-2 Thunderbolt 3. The video was uploaded recently. If these ports aren't enough, you would need a bigger dock or hub to connect more accessories like ethernet cable. Trust me when I say this: Your mind is about to be BLOWN with the incredibility of this small device. The dock is very sturdy and solid with the Anker logo shining on its body similar to all other Anker products. Let's talk about the ports on the backside of the dock. You have the power port close to the ethernet port. Usually, the Ethernet port cause the device to heat up. That's not the case with this dock. Then you have an HDMI port that supports 4K at 60Hz, 3 USB-A ports supporting a speed of 5bps, and 85W and 15W dual thunderbolt 3 ports. Use the 85W port to charge your laptops or larger devices. The Thunderbolt 3 port supports 5k monitor at 60Hz. If you use USB-C to a dual HDMI splitter, then you can use 3 monitors at once. In the front, you have a power button with a LED indicator, SD and microSD card slots, AUX port, another USB-A port, and 2 USB-C ports. The 18W Power Delivery USB-C port fast charges anything from laptops to phones. You can charge your devices while you work with this high-power high-speed dock. You can use dual monitors at once without any difficulties or power overload. You can transfer files in no time. For example, transfer a 20GB file in 6 seconds. In conclusion, this strong dock is a must-have for creative users who work with a lot of ports. A price of $249.99 is reasonable for such a hefty and useful product. Just a reminder: Anker's products do not ship worldwide and are available only in the US. This 13-in-1 Thunderbolt 3 Dock is a very useful product to have. So we unboxed 2 products, the gold cable and 13-in-1 dock. Let me know your thoughts in the comments on both of these products. Don't forget to like, share, subscribe!

support and i'll see you guys on the next one bye guys yeah yeah yeah yeah coming in yeah i just wonder", "89fpev8dKTw": "it looks a little like marmalade like really glittery marmalade so today I'm gonna be trying out a mask that I found at the drugstore this is the global beauty care 24 karat gold gel face mask although I have to wonder how much gold is actually in this considering I picked this up for only $9.99 so if you're new to my channel I have a ginormous ginormous that sounds a little dirty if you're new here I have a huge playlist of other face masks I tried and the link for that will be in the description box below or you can click right up there if you enjoy masks reviews and you'd like to see more of them don't forget to hit the thumbs up button it helps me out with a crazy YouTube algorithm if you want to know more about this face mask don't go anywhere just keep watching so I have never heard of this brand before I kind of stumbled across the display accidentally and on their website it says global beauty care premium gold gel face mask is a luxurious anti-aging skin treatment infused with gold extract it's no one to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by firming and toning the skin in addition it offers intense hydration to revitalize smooth and soften your skin pamper yourself with the luxury of gold for a flawless luminous and radiant looking complexion ready and on the packaging it pretty much says everything it said on the website it also says that it's pH balanced hypoallergenic not tested on animals and for all skin types and for ingredients we have glycerin which is a skin replenishing and skin restoring ingredient glycerin doesn't really moisturize your face but what it does is it helps hold water up against the skin and that prevents it from dehydrating also in here is retinol which is an anti-aging ingredient also in here is a word that I can't pronounce properly I've been trying for the last 15 minutes but it's another word for vitamin E so I'll put that right there and this is an anti-aging ingredient that helps the three radical damage also in here is ascorbic acid which is another word for vitamin C and this helps with skin brightening and getting rid of any hyperpigmentation you may have on your skin so when I first bought this I was like it's a 24 karat gold mask for ten dollars so how much gold is really in here um the answer to that question is not very much this is the ingredients list you really can't see cuz the packaging is sort of reflected but if I can pull it up online I'll just like post it right there there is gold in here but it's the last ingredient listed so there's like a little sprinkle of it like teeny tiny miniscule amount if you're gonna try this one don't put too much stock into the gold actually doing anything because I mean it's just basically it's all marketing the Google just makes it look pretty and sparkly chances are it's really not gonna do anything for our skin now that I totally like destroyed this mask before I even had the chance to try it let's get into this thing how do we use this thoroughly clean and dry your face dip brush into jar and scoop desired amount spread evenly all over your face avoiding eyes and lips wear mask for 10 to 15 minutes for best results make sure to wash off all the remaining residue immediately after treatment as leaving on longer can cause an allergic reaction alright that's good to know refrain from using if you have sensitive skin or allergic to any ingredients listed on the ingredient panel to my knowledge I don't have a metal allergy or an allergy to any of the ingredients listed so hopefully this doesn't totally break me out I guess we'll find out soon this is the packaging it comes with this fun little spatula peddle to like apply it I already have one of these that I received from another mask but you know you can never have too many of them they're great they make the whole process so much less messy so this doesn't have a scent at all it's because there's no fragrance art which is awesome I know companies like to add fragrance because it's just a marketing tool I find when I have like a mask on my face for a long period of time I mean I'm not sensitive to smells or anything but if I have like a mask that's really strong scented I just I don't know I find it difficult to relax and enjoy myself when I have like something that smells like fabric softener or like right underneath my nose this is what the consistency looks like it looks a little like marmalade like really glittery Martin and yeah it's pretty thick and goopy like yeah it's not going anywhere oh boy that's cold yeah move right in the eyebrow the gel is freezing but it's nice oh I think I might have used too much yeah let's get that quick the gel is really nice and cooling on the skin but because this doesn't dry down I have it everywhere it's super messy thankfully this comes with the spatula because otherwise I would have it everywhere so I'm just gonna zoom you in because I'm not sure it's showing in this light what like the gold looks like but I'll just zoom you went a little bit and show you because I'm looking kind of shiny right now yeah it's like there's you can kind of see that my glitter thing happening up there but it's not like I'm looking like a disco ball or anything there's just a very light sheen in this but again I'm pretty sure it doesn't do anything all right the time is 1112 so I'm gonna go and relax for a bit and then I will check in with you in 10 to 15 minutes already so I've had this on for a little bit more than 10 minutes and a little less than 15 the time is 1126 it's not that it's irritating my face or anything I just have stuff to do so I'm gonna go wash my face and get cleaned up and then I'll be right back with my thoughts on this mask so I'm back face is completely cleaned before we start I just have to point out the obvious I have like a giant like pimple on my forehead that I haven't had one of these in the air all right there and I think when I cleaned up my face I aggravated it and made it mad so it's all like red and inflamed that's not the mask that's just me being an idiot when I washed my face my face was broken up before I put the mask on my face and I probably should have avoided this spot and I didn't anyway now that we got that out of the way so the gold in this mask I mean other than being cute and sparkly and attractive to the eye it just it doesn't do anything in my opinion I'm just gonna leave it at that I'm starting to really get into these gel consistency type masks they never really dried down and because my skin tends to be on the drier side especially this time of year as we're going through season changes they're just a great alternative to a sheet mask and because this never completely dries down it was super easy to clean up afterwards like I just need to lightly splash water on my face it was completely rinsed off so the combination of the retinol and the vitamin E and ascorbic acid I wasn't sure how I felt about that at first because sometimes they can be a little bit irritating if left on the skin too long I didn't really have any skin irritation there was a slight tingling but there was no burning my skin didn't pitch and I don't see any redness at least from my point of view maybe when I do the playback and start to edit this I'll see you differently but know when that thing finally has calmed down a little bit so as far on my skin feels it feels nice I mean looking at my face close-up this thing is definitely loaded up with glycerin because the line across my forehead seems to be like less visible it's obviously headaches a big drink of water and same with like the lines around my eyes but I like this one this is a great mask for skin hydration the gold is really gimmicky but if all that aside I do like this one for skin hydration so I hope you enjoyed this video if you did make sure you give it a thumbs up don't forget to hit that subscribe button before you leave thank you so much for watching and I will see you next time bye [Music]", "Ibk2PeNGxqI": "hey guys so I got this 24 karat gold eye mask treatment I just think masks they're kind of fun to try out but this one is supposed to remove fine lines smooth on skin and hydrate and firm so I already cleanse my face so we can go ahead and get started that's the first step first step is probably opening this but cleanse your face and then this one is a pack of 30s you can see it's a nice little case here and then and it is a little equity in there so be careful when you open it so you don't spill like I just did anyway we're going to pull a mask out and then apply it under our eyes just making sure that I do this right okay so I think this spoon thing is to scoop one out so you don't have to get all the dirty with your hands very slippery but we're going to come in and just put on like so you'll just want to smooth this on the tendency to want to fall so you could probably also use this just to make sure it's on where you want it to be smooth it on and then leave it for 20 minutes it smells really nice it feels I don't know jelly like but we'll leave that on and we'll come back in 20 minutes okay once 20 minutes are up we're gonna pull these off and then just gently rub in anything else that's left so just feels nice and cool now you can kind of see the outline of where it was but just feels nice and cool it did feel like not like staying but maybe stick like you could start to sting a little bit when you first put it on my skin is really dry but not like a lot I don't know how to describe it and I actually felt better the longer it sat on there so like I said just rub in and seems like my eyes are already more hydrated and they're actually a little bit later and they seem less puffy so it's more wide awake I think but super easy to use and then you can just toss these but it is a 30 pack so there's 60 of these total yeah it doesn't say how often to use them but say at least I'd probably do it like once a week at least I like how it makes my eyes look and I feel like the wrinkles are less noticeable but might not be able to see in here so kind of a cool thing really affordable check it out", "AGFbu9dx8Cs": "HELLO HELLO DARLING.[LAUGHTER] HELLO

This is just a stainless steel, buck\nknife I guess you'd call it. We had a customer who tried to plate this side\nand as you see there's some adhesion issues, discoloration, cloudiness issues\nand so he sent it in to us and I said well, we'll take a look at it and we'll\nplate it for you and film it. What we did first is we polished it. This is a critical step. See the luster of the knife? If this is the type of shine and luster\nthat you want when you're done, you have to get it that way before you gold\nplate. You cannot count on gold plating to change that, okay. This is what it will\nlook like if, you know, it's not shiny and it has problems. Now we've polished this wheel on a buffing wheel. We use white compound on one of the buffing wheels and red Rouge on the other. And as you see we got a\nnice shiny finish. So we're going to move forward now and do the plating. First\nthing I want to show you, real quick, is that this is stainless steel and this is\nwhat happened when you put water on to stainless steel. It runs off, it's like it's waxed. The water just beads up and falls off, okay. That's a major\nproblem for electroplating. Now we're going to move right on to the\nplating and show you how the Electro Cleaning solves that problem and gets\nthe piece to what we call wet out. So I'm going to pass it over to Terry now. I'm going to continue narrating and he's going to do the plating. Just go\nahead. We're set at seven and a half volts, maybe eight. Anywhere in there will be fine. We've got our common lead plugged in. Clipped to the knife here. We're doing our work\nover a Tupperware. Okay, go ahead. He's going to Electro Clean. Notice the foaming, lovely. This will make the piece hydrophilic. Phobic is when it's like, when it has a phobia of it. It pushes it away. It's phobic of the water. That's what we saw before, where the water beads up and falls off. The Electro Clean makes it\nhydrophilic, makes it so it accepts it, you know, and it makes it stay wet once\nwe rinse it off. Really makes it so the solutions are available to get to the\nsurface. This is a key step for stainless steel and steel in general. So you really want to do this beyond when you think you're done, just do a couple more seconds of it because really under doing it is more of a problem than overdoing\nit, in fact you really can't overdo it. I'm going to show you spraying it off\nnow that it has been Electro Cleaned. Look at that, see the puddle even on there. There's no water beads, no water breaks. It's staying wet. It is wet out. First step. That's important. If it's not, go back over it again. If you noticed any beads or\nbreaks or anything then go back over it again. Now we're going on to the Woods,\nsame voltage. Quickly go over it with the Woods. This isn't something you want to\nspend a whole lot of time on. This is just a strike. It applies a very thin\nlayer of nickel that you really shouldn't even see. It's more just a\npreparation step some people look for a visible layer of nickel, not important. If\nyou do, you're overdoing it. See how we spent maybe 10 seconds on this blade and just made sure we got everywhere, quickly. That is the second critical step to steel, otherwise gold will not adhere and you'll get that hazy, flaky, look that you\nsee on the other side of the blade. So now we turn our voltage down to the Gold\nvoltage. Which is about anywhere between four to five and a half depends on how\nfast you want the gold to go on, how skillful you are. We're going to go for\nfour and a half. And the gold should immediately start applying within\nseconds, one second. If it's not, either your voltage is low or your preparations not right. See how it just immediately goes and grabs on there. If we were plating the other side, if we could somehow capture the time that the other side was plated. The gold would probably be going on really, really slow like it can take 10\nseconds to even get it to take and then it would probably only be here and there. Well because he didn't activate with Woods. Yeah, and you know, and between the\nElectro Clean and Woods, those two steps make it so the gold goes\non correctly. You can't shortcut it, you can't skip\nsteps, you can't change it. That's just how it has to be done. And there you go\nthat's how you plate a stainless steel knife. How long do you think you would\nrecommend the person spend doing this? You could spend.. you know as you can see, you can stop now. Problem is, the gold is really thin so it really just depends on how thick you want to put it. If this was my knife, I'd plate it for a good five, maybe even ten minutes. I mean you\ncan really just keep caking it on there. If you are doing massive amounts, you\nknow, about every 20 to 30 seconds per square inch is a really thick plate. And this is a hardened 24 karat gold so\nit will last quite a long time. Even if you stopped now, that'd be a pretty dang good job. Okay, we will. All right you want to stop now? Alright, and we'll check it out. This is just such a slick little kit, i mean you set up. Really as you see, it's one-two-three. As long as you use the right preparation chemicals, which we always give the instructions,\nand we'll always provide technical support for, and we always have these\nvideos. I think these videos are very helpful to everybody. See if we can get a good look. Alright, look, you can still see the grain structure where the.. the way they made it. We didn't polish that out. So this goes to show however the\nsurface looks before you gold plate, is how it's going to look after. Now show the other side. Here's what it looks like  when it goes wrong and that's simply from improper preparation. No polishing, not correct use of Electro Clean and\nWoods Nickel Strike, and then you get splotchy, flaky, we peeled that gold off\nwith scotch tape. Alright, well thanks for watching guys! This was just the regular Universal Plater with Electro Clean, Woods Nickel Strike, 24k brush gold. And that's all. Thank you!", "8L7Zx7_m0jE": "that's gonna sell out before I didn't get to it all right now so you want to talk about something I do I think we need a button where it's like I want to order everything

then combine that with these ingredients that have been passed down in South Korea for twenty seven hundred years things like caramel fig extract strawberry lotus flower these are things that women in

gold be sure to LIKE and subscribe so you don't miss a thing anyway that's enough talking it's cake time I'm starting off with two seven inch by three inch high chocolate cakes leveling them off in three even layers [Music] with your simple syrup give the cake layers a good soaking now let stack and fill our cake with ganache in a piping bag create a ring around your first layer of cake filled that with chocolate mousse and place your next layer of cake on top [Music] fill this layer with delicious vanilla Swiss meringue buttercream repeat this process until you've stacked and filled all

coat using your trusty offset spatula smooth on some buttercream pop it in the fridge for another 15 minutes to chill onto our final coat of buttercream we are going for the semi-naked cake finish here so once you have applied your buttercream use your bench scraper or a spatula to smooth and remove excess buttercream off the cake you don't want to take too much off remember it's only semi-naked once you're happy with the final coat pop it in the fridge to chill let's make our white chocolate droops I've popped the ganache in a piping bag but you can use a spoon here as well place it back in the fridge to set before we paint these drips in gold with a steady hand and a thin paintbrush paint your trips cold don't worry too much if you get paint onto the cake it will all tie in with the finished look I pre-made chocolate sales to dress this cake let me know in the comments down below if you want to see a tutorial on how these are made using the same gold paint I'm painting

again for watching guys and let me know in the comments down below what you want to see next on future episodes so who will have the slice see ya [Music] you", "dMB3tofrMNA": "okay what's up YouTube today I'm gonna talk about gold one of my favorite subjects and I did a bit video earlier I wasn't too happy with the results you deserve better I've got more subscribers now and this is all about motivation and travel here so I originally was gonna thinking about getting some money and then just having a table full of money but I figured it's not necessary this is this is about that what might motivate some people so tell about 24 karat gold jewelry I didn't I did an earlier video and when I explained was the reason why jewelers tell you 24 karat gold is too soft well that's not true alright so I'm gonna show you some pieces and like I said I was going to do and I'm gonna show you the difference between 24 karat gold and 18 karat gold the lowest the lowest grade I have is 18 karat gold but I also have 22 karat gold so that's another thing too so here we go on a black shirt right here so you can kind of see and I'm gonna see if I can go ahead and bring that a little bit in a little bit close that is we have an 18 karat gold this is an 18 karat gold chain okay Cuban chain okay 18 karat gold and right you see how like that color that is sorry about the focus it's supposed to supposed to be on automatic focus so I don't know why it's not working so they can get it a little bit better for for ya there we go okay so this is an 18 karat gold 18 karat gold what it looks like all right and you can see how it's more like a mirror alright now this this right here is 22 karat gold okay I'm gonna take this off and this piece is for sale and the thing about gold is gold is a good investment it's a good investment for your children and your children children and your grandchildren so if you want to have a piece to wear that's just absolutely beautiful and I'm gonna get just a regular sized pen so you can kind of just see how thick it is okay this is this is what it is okay so this is 24k as you can see it's a little bit darker and it has it has more of a it has more of a de durability than the 24 karat gold I'm going to show you the 24 karat gold now okay this is an 18 karat gold for Garo piece but this is a 24 karat gold I was gonna show you alright this is from my earlier video I did the 24 karat gold block chain get these pieces of 24 karat gold block chain and this is this is pretty much this is the pure naina it's got the time stamp this is the one I had custom-made okay this one I had custom-made and I the guy just asked for more gold and more gold and more gold because what happens is they when you give them gold to have it made they melt the gold and when they melt the gold they lose they lose a little bit of the gold when they melt it so that's what it is and this is just this is my favorite piece it's very uncomfortable to wear because it's extremely heavy okay we're gonna weigh all these gold pieces here in a minute okay and you can see the difference you see it's got the same thickness as this one okay and you can see the difference you see the difference between 18 karat gold and 24 karat gold so anybody that tells you 24 karat gold is this is too soft they're full of they don't know what they're talking about because this right here is 24 karat gold gentlemen and it's not too soft alright it is not too soft if you look at it closely I'm gonna see if I can get you a close-up look over here you can see that it's got a little indentation it's a gala we've got a little imperfections okay and that's just the way it is that's what 24 karat gold it's it's pitting it pits it's easy to pit because that's the way 24 karat gold is you know it's a softer metal it is a softer metal but it's not too soft to wear people have been wearing 24 karat gold for centuries now we're going to look at the weight okay so and I am I am selling my pieces but not two not two gold buyers that you know because they're not gonna make money off of me so you're looking at a 10,000 up 10 and $40,000 range on up okay I'm going to zero it out you get that and focus here for you okay so we're gonna do this 24 karat gold piece so this is oh I gotta put it on flat surface I forgot put those shirts gotta move the table now it's on a flat surface about 634 grams okay 10 0 so that's 244 grams of gold okay you see that 244 grams alright now I'm going to put the other 24 karat gold on there alright and see what we get with that's 392 grams of solid gold 24 karat gold not to mention this is not just the bulk this is this is jewelry so you're not gonna pay so this this one here is 150 grams right here just just this alone this part this piece right here this is the one that's for sale okay I'm not really selling the other pieces this is the one for sale if you're interested in Maya you can just leave a comment below I'm not destitute where I'm trying to get drugs or anything so I'm not selling it for a really cheap price this one here is 64 grams alright and this is 22 carat gold as you can see it's beautiful it's a beautiful piece it's it is hollow okay on the back alright but that's what makes it so thick because this was solid this is a solid piece this is what I was trying to say earlier if this was a solid piece this would probably be at least 120 to 150 grams of gold because that's just the density the more the more thicker it is the more dense you have to make it okay this is the 18 carat gold this is the lowest grade gold that I will use I refuse to wear anything less than 18 this is 82 grams okay and when I bought this I bought this one gold so let me tell you that was a really good deal this is the 18 karat gold Cuban I don't like the Cubans for something just I just don't you know it's not me 70 grams okay that's 18 karat and this is of course this ring I here is 22 karat gold this is just silver this is not really but I just like lions so I do that but thanks for watching hopefully this educated you a little bit on jewelry and this is following up on my earlier video thanks so much for watching", "Qyr97KoIyHk": "hi beauties welcome back to my channel this is lisa if you're tuning in to watch me for the first time hi i'm a beauty and lifestyle creator and if you're returning to watch me grab a seat you're absolutely welcome back i love you so in this video like i said before i'm going to be featuring this beauty right here this is the mccary 24k rose gold illuminating bodybuild this body lotion replenishes moisture of the skin it helps to soften your skin it helps to get rid of stretch marks and dark spots it also helps to give a vibrant glow when you use this people would ask what you're using they're going to ask you seriously because this is so effective on the skin one of the reasons why i love this is because of the choice of ingredient in this product i love the fact that one of the key ingredient in this is gold flakes and gold flakes is so good for anti-aging gold flakes is so good for the skin it gives a beautiful and youthful glow it helps to increase elasticity of the skin by reducing stretch marks and fine lines on the skin and gold flakes also prevents premature aging and you all know dryness of the skin leads to premature aging which is one of the reasons why i love this lotion because the ingredients in this is so good for the skin an exception of that the rest of the ingredients when you pick it up and go through the ingredients that some of it i can't even pronounce because again i'm no specialist in this i'm just like you i love skincare i take my skin seriously and i always love to go through ingredients when i pick up a product and some of the ingredients here i know and some of it i just read about it the two ingredients here i'm sure you've already heard of one of it is hyaluronic acid it also has salicylic acid hyaluronic acid is what we already have in our body this ingredient helps to reduce um fine lines and wrinkles of the skin salicylic acid here is what helps to remove dirt and bacteria from the skin surface to help clear pores it helps to purify and exfoliate the skin which improves on the health of the skin another ingredient in this is yogurt extract which helps to reduce fine lines and wrinkles it helps to fight acne and blemishes and pigmentation on the skin which is so good i love this and mccary recommend you use this lotion with a glycerin which i have here you could either use this glycerin or the extreme glycerin or any glycerin on your website or the baby oil or you could get an almond oil of your choice before you go in with this lotion you cannot use this lotion all by itself because you would not get the effective results from this so please use it the way is recommended on your website and also you can use this on your face please do not use a body lotion on your face yes i've gotten people tell me i use this lotion on my face it works so good for me i cannot use a body lotion on your if it did good for your face well congratulations but i'm not going to be using a body lotion on my face treat your face with respect don't use a body lotion on your face there's a reason why it's called a body lotion so if you want something for your face go on the website there are several face products for you to use or you could look up any other brand of face products for your skin but this is a body lotion please use this on your body only and you can only use this two to three times a week if you're oily or combination or ethnic prone skin i use this um two to three times a week you breathe just like i'm your oxygen yeah it's so easy when it comes to you cut up in these axes and these [Music] [Music] when you get this lotion please do yourself a favor and get yourself the moisturizing soap like the 24 card moisturizing soap this also has gold flakes in it it would also help nourish and beautify your skin you use this to cleanse your skin before you go in with the body lotion this would help the lotion work better on your skin because you can just use this all by itself without using the soap i mean it's a no-brainer so get this two products together for your body and you would love your skin when you use this lotion please give yourself a three to four months break from this and get yourself a non-brightening lotion to help nourish your skin on the mccary's website they have the hand and body lotion that i have here you can go get this for yourself this is a non-brightening lotion this will just help to nourish your skin while you're getting your skin prep before you go back into the lotion again or any brightening lotion of your choice please don't use this from january to december give yourself that break we all want that glue but you need to give your skin a break and then you continue with the lotion or something else that you so um

one of you if you got a comment be sure and leave it down below love to hear from each and every one of you guys so thanks again guys and God bless", "28qLlkjfVu4": "hey guys welcome back to another video my name is LJ finish my channel new product Allah for Solly drop a new product on us I feel like a lot of people think for Saudi products a very pointless but I actually really liked some of their products I actually really really like most of the products that I've tried and I feel like they're dedicated to certain skin types and today we have the new 24k moisturizing gel cream this is the rose gold elixir the packaging of this product looks similar to this this is the brightening turmeric eye cream the holy eyes I have used up this product like completely as you guys can see like I've used and abused this product because I just love it like I feel like it works really well it works the way it says it should work so today I'm gonna be reviewing and trying out the new moisturizing gel cream you know my skin is always here for hydration and moisture because I am very dry skin so I decided to pick this up and try it with you guys on camera and give you guys my first impressions on this it says that this can be used as just like a regular moisturizer or you could use it to prep your makeup which is basically what I'm gonna be doing today so if you guys are interested then keep on watching alright so we're gonna jump into some details about this product because I have to know like what it says it's supposed to do so it says this is the rose gold elixir which is the 24k moisturizing gel cream it says it's a weightless gel cream that instantly adds lush hydration to the skin while keeping it supple and leaving a naturally shine free glow so it says that it's not gonna be shiny so we're gonna see if that's the case this gel cream refills moisture levels and refreshes skin without a heavy feel it contains rosehip seed oil 24k gold and hyaluronic acid so that's really all I needed to hear it sounds like it's really going to help moisturize my skin so I want to see if I can use this as a moisturizer by itself without like any other type of moisturizer on my skin I want to see if I want to add this skincare product into my makeup routine in if it really works it retails for $39 and it's a 45 milliliter bottle which is really not bad for for Sally their prices are usually up to close to $60 but this is $39 quite affordable it also comes with this which you can use this to apply the product so it has a very thick consistency not too thick and this is what it looks like it's very jelly like I know people who dry skin do always have to moisturize their skin before applying any makeup because it just helps the makeup sit on the skin much better I'm gonna start off by applying the Holly eyes brightening eye cream and I like to use this eye cream at night as like my daily eye cream like skin care eye cream I'm just gonna apply it today because I do want my face to look really really bright and my makeup to stand out I was like to bring this towards my eyelid area just so that I can also print that and get rid of the dark areas and I've been using this product for like almost 10 months close to a year now and it's been really good it's lasted a really long time I would say this is definitely one of my favorite for Sally products you guys can see it's instantly like took away the dark areas around my eye area and that's exactly what it does so I'm just going to jump right into applying this product I'm gonna use the chip that comes with it it feels really moisturizing but it doesn't really feel like a moisturizing cream it feels more like a hydrating cream like my skin feels really cool and it just goes on like more like a hydration cream so this is what it looks like it looks like it leaves like those gold particles like those small small gold particles on my skin right here kind of similar to this rose gold skin mist this is the 24k gold skin mist and it has those things at the bottom right there it feels the same way when I applied this for Sally liquid glass but this liquid glass is a lot more tackier like it feels like more sticky this just feels like a moisturizer it feels like it's really really moisturizing my skin and it sits really well on my skin so so far I feel like if it was really really good I did also want to give you guys an update on this for Sally liquid powder that I reviewed about like a month ago I actually really like this powder I actually use this quite often in my videos just to kind of get rid of the oils around this area of my face I feel like it gets super oily and then the oil just sits like right in here and it makes my makeup crease so me using this liquid powder really gets rid of that so I just wanted to give you guys an update because I know I said it in my review video that it wasn't really like doing much for me but it actually does a pretty good job at keeping the oil away from my t-zone area so I'm gonna apply quite a small amount and I'm just focusing this like right on my nose area right here and bringing it a little bit towards my t-zone cuz that's the area that I really want to get rid of the oils then I'm gonna use a Beauty Blender to just spread that out so after doing this you want to let this dry a little bit so I'm gonna let it sit for like about two minutes let it dry then I'm gonna jump right into applying primer ready so it's dried up a little bit so I'm gonna go ahead and take a damp sponge and just press on there just to kind of like get rid of the whiteness and then today I'm using all moisturizing hydrating products I don't use matte products that much the only map product that I use is this for solid liquid powder that around this area and the morphe mattifying continuous setting was other than that I tend to hydrate my skin a lot when I'm putting on makeup because I do have dry skin and that's just what it requires so for primer I'm gonna use the Fanta Beauty Pro filter hydrating primer and this primer does have like a matte finish it's still like a hydrating primer then for foundation I'm gonna use the Fanta Beauty Pro filter hydrating long run for nation in the shade for 34:40 not for 3440 I've been really really loving this foundation like okay I liked it the first time I tried it but ever since I got the shade match changed I've been like really really loving it it's been perfect for my skin the undertone is like really really good so this is like my go-to everyday my all-time favorite foundation right now as well as the Pat McGrath foundation other than that I feel like the other foundations are okay for me but this foundation is just like everything like so one thing I've noticed about the moisturizing gel cream is that it kind of allows the foundation to blend a little bit better I dunno because like your dry skin and you moisturize your face everything is gonna glide on really well people with dry skin their skin tends to be like really rough like this there's not enough moisture for things to blend so it ends up being sometimes a little bit patchy but it definitely blended up my foundation ten times quicker and on top of that like the little particles on the product like disappeared as soon as I put on foundation so it's not like they're gonna be showing through your foundation I don't really see them anymore that's a good thing because I don't like those particles on my face anyway so so I'm gonna move on to concealer for concealer I'm using the elf hydrating camo concealer this in the shade deep cinnamon I don't know why this concealer does this you guys see the red from there like I don't know why the consistency is just kind of like right so dearly but I honestly really love this concealer it's a full coverage concealer and it lasts a long time the only thing about this concealer is that it has like a little bit of creasing when you apply it but you can always just like blend it up so of course as usual I'm gonna go ahead and let this concealer sit in for a little bit and then back to blend it out alrighty time to blend this bad boy up alrighty so if we're come to where I'm gonna use the same elf hydrating camel concealer but I'm gonna grab the shade rich ebony I'm gonna place a small amount because this contour is so dark then I'm just gonna blend that out with a sponge as well these concealers blend out so good with sponges I've realized a brush is not really the best thing to blend out the concealer I don't know if it's because it's like full coverage every time I use a brush it just never works out so I'm just going back with that concealer sponge just to kind of marry the contour and the highlight together alrighty so to set my whole face I'm gonna use the black opal deluxe finishing setting powder I've been really sleeping on this setting powder it's so good I've had it for like almost five years now and it's been a while I've used it but I've recently started using it and it's so good like it absorbs the oils around your t-zone area and it just goes on really really well so I'm using a damp sponge to apply this because I feel like applying powder setting powder with a damp sponge kind of gives you that airbrushed look like it literally makes your face look like a filter then I'm gonna place a little bit right under my cheekbones just to give that reversed contour type of look and there we have it this is all the complexion stuff that I applied on I'm gonna say so far that this 24k gold moisturizing gel cream it works just like a moisturizer a hydrating moisturizer which is gonna be a good addition to my routine because I always moisturize my skin before applying any makeup and always moisturize my skin like when I go to sleep so this is definitely something that I could use before makeup I can use it if I'm not wearing any makeup just to kind of keep my skin hydrated so I'm gonna go ahead and finish off the rest of my face and then I'll be back to give you guys like my final thoughts on this product and then of course I'm gonna do a wear test just to see how the moisturizer sits with my face for a couple of hours so I'll be back to let you guys know right so I've completed my whole face and I filmed this eye makeup look so if you guys are interested in seeing that stay tuned because I'll be posting that about this for Sally 24k moisturizing gel cream I really like it I feel like it will definitely be something that I can add as a moisturizer I feel like it's very affordable and I don't know if that's why I like it even more because I'm like okay I can afford it if I use it and it runs out I can definitely replace it so I like the fact that it's very affordable compared to like the other prices $39 it's pretty affordable for me for a high-end makeup brand such as for Sally and it does the job that it says it's supposed to do it makes your skin feel really hydrated really rejuvenated you know how sometimes when you jump into the pool and you get up and you just feel like oh that's really what it does to my skin it makes my skin feel like it's like absorbing all the hydration it needs and it feels really good I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but I'm gonna do a wear test to see how my makeup wears with this moisturizing cream I hope that it doesn't make my makeup move or anything like that because I've used products that I'm very familiar with so I know that if my makeup does move then it got something to do this moisturizer so I'll be back in like five or six hours to see how this looks so I'll see you guys in six hours alright guys so this is what my skin is looking like after about six hours I took off my lashes cuz Who am I kidding what am I doing with lashes inside the house like no so I knock those off as soon as I finish the video I was like we're not doing this today but I really like how the makeup lasted I feel like it lasted pretty good I don't feel like the moisturizer and altered how long my makeup lasted I feel like it just it's just a moisturizer that's really simply all it is and I really like how this moisturizer feels on my skin so you guys would definitely be seeing me using this moisturizer for applying makeup I feel like it's very similar to the liquid glass except this liquid glass kind of gives you skin like more of a radiance but this moisturizing cream definitely be something I'm adding to my skincare routine it feels really good on my skin and I'll give this moisturizing gel cream to thumbs up good job for Sally I was looking for a different moisturizer and this seems like it's really really good so if you enjoyed this video don't forget to thumbs this video up and also

creator and if you're returning to watch me you absolutely welcome back so in this video i have the mccary 24k rose gold set this is what it looks like it's so beautiful it's stunning and i must say this is one of my favorite ranges from the mccary's um brand i love this range so much i'm gonna introduce every single product for you guys to see the first product i have here is the mccary 24k rose gold illuminating body milk this is what it looks like it looks like this is so beautiful the next product i have is the micari 24k rose gold illuminating spot treatment serum the next product i have here is the mccary hydro gel brightening face max looks like this as well and i also have the mccary 24k rose gold soap which looks like this because i lost the pack but this is what the soap looks like is so pretty i don't have two products here with me because i have not used those products before i don't have the 24k multi purpose dry oil and i don't also have the um 24k gold replanation night face cream those are the only two products i don't have and i have not used those products before and this i have here is the mccary 24k rose gold illuminating body milk this is so good i love this this lotion helps to replenish moisture of the skin it helps to fade the appearance of stretch marks and dark spots it helps to soften the skin it helps to reverse early signs of premature aging and this lotion will give you a vibrant glow when i was using this people were always asking me what i was using at the time and i was like because i knew that i was using the mccarrick gold illuminating bodies uh lotion this is so good for the skin it gives this glow that i can't explain people would notice something beautiful about your skin which is the reason why i love this and it's got great ingredients in it which one of the key ingredients in this lotion is gold flakes and gold flakes is so good for anti-aging so if your main concern is anti-aging you would love this i highly recommend this lotion so excited because this lotion is recommended for all skin types so there is no one left out you can't say i can get it because it's not for sensitive skin or combination skin is for everybody so if you can afford it get this and one of the great things again about this lotion is you can use this every day in as much as is pricey you can't use it every day so um if you're a sensitive skin you can only use this um one to two times a week and then if your combination to oily skin like myself i use this three times a week i use this three times a week because i love this lotion so much the very first time i got it i used it every day i was glowing i had to go back to the website to read up about the lotion and i found that it's meant to be used only three times a week and i was like oh my gosh what have i done so please don't be like me use this um three times a week which is one of the reasons why i love macaroni juices they take out time like they always put in so much work in making their products they make their products with love the pack that this product comes in is so pretty which tells you that the brand itself love their customers they love what they do and that's one of the reasons why i trust them so please get products from a brand you trust i trust my career disease and that's why i always recommend your products to everybody so please get this lotion for yourself so the way you apply this lotion is you cannot apply this lotion all by itself on your skin right off um shower or your bath mccarry recommend you use a body glycerine or the baby oil from your website or an almond oil of your choice that is not from the carry so you use those oils or the glycerin to hydrate your skin before you go in with this body lotion it's just like um using a primer before your foundation for your makeup that's how you use this lotion you cannot use this all by itself and again you can't use this on your face i've got a few people dm you on instagram about this lotion asking me if they could use this on their faces please i'm begging you mccary does not recommend this lotion to be used on your face it's a body only product it's not to be used on your face treat your face with respect get products that is meant for your face so moving on to the next product here is the mccary 24k rose gold illuminating spot treatment serum i love this like seeing this here in front of me makes me so happy this is so pretty i love it this sound diminishes skin imperfection this serum also helps blur out wrinkles and fine lines on the skin it also helps to fade out dark spots sunspots and areas of hyperpigmentation which is the reason why i trust this serum because of the ingredients that it has in it one of the key ingredient in this serum is gold flakes and gold flakes is so good for anti-aging if you feel like you are at that age where you need to take good care of your skin i highly recommend this serum although it's pricey gold is not cheap so for you to have gold flakes on a product then it's legit okay but i've got great news because this is currently on sale on the mccary's website right now it retails for i think 69 i'm not sure but it's a huge steal if i were you i will go and grab this before the sale is over this is recommended for dry and maturing skin you could use this to spot treat your face or your body and you can only use this three times a week like night only next product i have here is the bakari 24k rose gold moisturizing soap there's a reason why it's called moisturizing soap it looks like this it

you in my next [Music] you", "v2-fsy5BSeg": "hello everybody this is rob with gold plating services and i've got a really exciting video for you today we are going to be gold plating this bad boy this is a glock 19 gen 3. it's made out of 416r stainless steel and before we get started i want to give a special shout out to the tactical store they are out in port st lucie in florida and they provided this slide they made it it's 416r stainless steel they start with a rectangular block they do the special cuts they do the windows the side serrations the optica for the optics and they engrave as you can see here's their logo it's the tactical store they're a great place and uh we're really excited to plate this slide for him today this again is stainless steel but the process we're going to be following is going to be exactly the same as you would do if it were regular mild steel just going to quickly show you this is the prolab we have five stations set up here but this one right here we're just going to be leaving it out of the equation today i've got a power rectifier up here for the first two and the other for the last two we've got electric cleaner trival gold strike bright nickel plating solution and finally the 24k bright gold solution let's get it going this has been a long-awaited video and uh i'm really excited for it and a lot of our customers and potential customers are as well so the first thing we're gonna do is get it going in the electric cleaner here this is a very critical step to the whole process if you do not electroclean it good enough you will not get good adhesion you'll get the gold to deposit but you're not going to have it stick basically it will wipe off if you don't sufficiently electroclean is probably the biggest mistake that people make when doing stainless steel i've got set at 5 volts here it looks like we're pulling about 9.4 amps that will vary just depending on the size of the item how far it is from the anode what not this kit is awesome and we've had a lot of requests to do a gunslide and so this is a very special video and i hope you guys enjoy it and on top of that we couldn't be doing a cooler slide i think so this particular step we're going to leave it for probably about a minute and a half i like to at least do a minute and a half next we'll be going to this solution which is the tri-vel um it's not going to be in there long so i'll talk about it real quick while it's in the electroclean this is an acid-base solution that attacks the stainless steel bringing down the layer of chromium oxide which is what keeps stainless steel from corroding like regular steel the chromium oxide typically makes it really difficult to plate onto but what this does is the acid in the solution attacks the surface bringing down that layer and then simultaneously deposits a little bit of gold now you could use woods nickel strike instead of the trival gold strike but i like the gold strike a lot better because you can actually see it with a wood's knuckle strike you cannot see the deposit i think we're probably good on cleaning here and i'll show you why i like trevel because when you see that the gold is tinted or the part is tinted gold you know you have a good strike so what i'm going to do here is check it out see right here i got a water break we don't want that so i'm gonna go longer in the electric cleaner here and if there's a water break like that and you move forward you will have a discoloration or an adhesion issue um what you do to check for adhesion when you're done is actually take a piece of scotch tape believe it or not put it on rip it off there's bad adhesion the gold will come off but that's one of the telltale signs sometimes you'll still get a water break no matter how much you electro clean it and that's just because it may be the shape the surface geometry but in this case i do feel like it was a little bit short on the electroclean so i'm just going to go a little bit longer after we do the gold strike it will be tinted gold and then we will go into the bright nickel the bright nickel is a heated solution 130 is good 120 to 140 is where people run it i like 130. what this does is when you when you look at the slide it's got little scratches in it they did a great job of polishing it but there are little micro scratches in it the bright nickel will fill those in to a point you know if it's bad enough it won't but the scratches that are in this i believe will be completely gone after we've right nickel plated and it just brings it to a even brighter luster so let's check out that area again now see now there's no no water break happening there it's probably hard to see but since this is such an important slide i'm just going to go in for another probably 15 20 seconds just for good measure you really can't overdo this step but you can under do it so again yeah those those scratches will be filled in by the bright nickel the longer you leave it in the thicker the nickel gets the more it levels it's called a leveling effect typically people don't nickel plate stainless steel but that's if it has the finish you already want in this case they want to be able to make up for a little bit of scratches here and there so they asked that i bright nickel plate it okay we're going to move forward okay now watch what happens on this strike here and put it in and you just kind of move it around like you're stirring tea if you will when the gun's already a little bit or the slides are a little tinted gold i'm going to go just a little longer and that's good i want to keep it submerged in the water as much as possible but i'm going to show you see now it's already tinted gold but it you may not be able to tell from the video it's not super gold but it's just enough that what it does is seal off the stainless steel and we'll keep it from reforming that layer of chromium oxide that would keep this bright nickel from typically depositing now over here i've got this one set to 2.8 volts that's where i'm going to brighten the plate out and let's let it do its magic this is going to be a quite long step i'm gonna leave it in there for three or four minutes so i'll go ahead and pause the video while it's in there and we'll resume once we're at that point all right guys it's it's only been in there for two minutes but while we're waiting last year i want to talk about the kid a little so tons of people want to do guns it's very popular right now and this kit has just made it so simple but i want to show you the behind the scenes of it so the power comes down comes into this we call these the power tower okay this right here is a sensor that goes down in and checks the temperature of the solution constantly this right here is wired inside to here which carries the negative current and also you can plug a wire in i like to do both technically this bus bar will conduct electricity but i always like to make sure it's solid these anode frames and you'll be able to see it better in here go down inside and are really really nice if you've ever tried to rig up a an anode before because usually you have to either hang them over the edge or something it connects to this which is the positive so that wire comes in sends the black here red here and then we have our jumpers in between this jumpers the two power towers together each tower has a controllable voltage it's really easy you just click set change the temperature push that again it will adjust accordingly i want to keep my electric cleaner at 130 so i'm going to set it back this is room temperature so we don't worry about it but it's still on anyway right here you'll notice the red one's disconnected so what that does is they all share the same black the common but the positive current stops here so from that power rectifier up there um now this one is connected to this power supply the nice thing about this is the bright nickel and the gold have the same voltage and the electrocleaner and trival have the same voltage as each other so that i don't even ever have to touch the voltage i just go through i mean if you're running lots of parts you literally just move through the process timing your steps and that's about it um this little thing right here is a heater that so this senses the temperature kicks this on when it needs it there's our time let's check it out let's just see how it looks oh yeah it looks great i'll leave it in for one more minute while we talk for a sec there is a round black heater here that heats the beaker and then this is insulation that keeps the temperature in in this case we've got a bag nickel anode that keeps the nickel anode as it breaks down from getting debris floating around in your right nickel so it's really a really brilliant design this tube here is the air it's got a little throttle on it so i can turn it up or down just by twisting this knob uh you need air agitation for your bright nickel if you don't you'll get white ugly cloudy deposit and the gold has their agitation as well the air pump in this case comes to this little thing here where i can also control um okay let's pull it out it's bright nickel plated let's take a look at it [Music] that looks good it's not too dramatic because you know i'm actually gonna go a little bit longer and the reason being is there's some deeper scratches that i think will fill right in i'm going to leave it in there for just a couple more minutes and when we come back we will gold plate it all right so it's been another minute um i wanted to talk a little bit more if this were a mild still slide you would have to bright nickel plate it if you don't once you strip the bluing coating cerakote whatever it may be you have exposed nick um steel that will rest some steels will rest within hours if you just go straight to gold at that point you will get rusting underneath your gold if you right nickel plate it it seals it off and we call that a diffusion barrier absolutely critical again with stainless steel that's not nearly as important um most people don't write nickel plate stainless steel but this is a a test and actually it's something you could just make a normal part of your routine a lot of stuff that if you were to buy a slide that's stainless steel it either has like a matte texture or is already mirror finished shiny and you would just go straight to the gold you just electroclean strike gold all right we're just going to call it good at this point i think it looks great really shiny nice nickel deposit and it's hard to tell a difference because it was stainless steel to begin with but if it wasn't you would really see if this would have been like a dull mild steel you would really see that point okay so now we're in the gold gold is 2.8 volts 100 degrees this is a hardened 24 karat gold i deposits 99.7 plus real gold yes it is real gold i get asked that every single day multiple times and it is real gold the way it works is it has nothing to do with the purple it just probably just looks dark to you but it is a nice beautiful purple solution the gold is actually looks like table salt and when you pour it into water to make the solution it dissolves really quickly that salt is now dissolved in the water you add the other makeup components the purple is actually a brightener and hardener and that makes it up to three times harder than say a pure soft gold would be which we do have what happens is is when the cath the anode has the positive electricity the cathode has the negative and when you send the electricity through it the gold ions are attracted to the cathode which in this case is your piece it also plates this little rack um you know there are ways you can coat the rack so that it doesn't but in this case it's so small it doesn't matter the gold is going to be depositing at a rate of about 1 micron every 6 minutes if you're using our our a fully concentrated bath one micron also known as 40 micro inches is a very thick plate relatively you can go as thick as two and a half microns and on this particular site i am going to i'm going to be plating it as thick as possible so i'm going to leave it in there about 15 minutes the thicker it is the longer it lasts period people say does it scratch yes stainless steel scratches anything scratches does it wear down yes it's even though it's metal it does and gold's particularly soft but really any metal will wear down over where the most important things are put it on thick don't scratch it like intentionally and it will hold up a long time um two and a half microns man i mean this slide could stay gold plated indefinitely who knows 100 years if it's used every single day it's gonna wear off a lot quicker if it's not used very often and you just hung it on a wall it'd stay gold forever anyway i'll be back in about 15 minutes we'll check it out we'll show you

pour yes you heard right a Dutch pour using only the 24 karat gold metallic DecoArt with black to blow it out with just surround it with blow it out with and the black I'm using is golden brand carbon black and what I did with the gold instead of having just one shade of it I made the original version so the colour it's meant to be and then I just used a little less to make it a little bit lighter to see what kind of cool effects we can get in this now my paint although you don't need to mix them like this you can mix your paints with just the float roll and water and do the Dutch pour with the gold okay I chose to mix up the bloom recipe to do this I just like the way the cells look a little bit more so for my paint I mixed them with three parts vivid enamel so bicolor art and one part of polycrylic okay and I am using house paint on the canvas but again you can use white acrylic paint with your flow trawl and have just as nice of an effect now it's going to be interesting to see how this reacts people use this 24 karat gold to get effects in paintings it's gonna be interesting to see how it reacts with the polycrylic and the vivid enamel because i noticed this the paint itself had separated because it was in a canister for a long time and i hadn't used it and so you could see whatever it's mixed with laying on the surface and it smelt a lot like polycrylic like a varnish so not saying that's what's in it but it did smell like that and because this is the only color I'm using I'm going a little bit heavier with the colors as a matter of fact I'm going to add a little bit a little bit more gold well they're both gold but you know what I mean okay and now just are black so the black I mixed with just float all and paint that's it now let's see how do we want to do this I need it to be thick enough so I can blow it upwards and downwards right so let's see how it goes with this I am a little scared I feel like there's not enough paint well down here okay so we'll work with it blow-dryer lower your volume [Music] [Music] we just realized something and that is I didn't want to do this type of Dutch before I wanted to do the other one but it's too late now so I'm just going to turn it around like so and then we're gonna blow out this way now my blow-dryer by the way is a gin gin REE pair is professional somebody asked me this the other day I don't know it's a hundred and twenty five v AC 6008 1875 walk and I use it I low and cool [Music] [Music] right I think I'm going to turn it again and try to do this area a little bit better but maybe not let's say well that's gonna be tricky let me get my airbrush I also like to do the wispy ends so she's got to be careful there [Music] [Music] okay [Music] don't want it to be so straight but it's gorgeous I like that a lot [Music] they didn't do anything really crazy [Music] okay think I'm gonna leave it alone I'm actually loving it so I'm gonna make myself leave in a second here I just have to yeah

notifications on to all so you'll never miss out any uploads follow me on the instagram because when i'm not on a yt i'm on it in style even though i was a little bit quiet on it in start and without further ado let's get right into the video so before we dive in to the video i just want to say quickly thank you so much for all the love and support for those that's reached out to me since i've been a little bit anti-social and especially the fact that i have hit 9k on youtube like that is a big number to me might be small in other people's eyes but my aim was to hit 10k at the end of this year listen i just feel choked up like i just feel so blessed revolution posted me on the instagram as well tommy clark shouted me out in a video like the love and support system i honestly cannot even put into words how much i just appreciate every single one of you guys and i'm also going to be doing a giveaway in this video and it wasn't actually planned for me to do it in this video because i did post this on my instagram a few weeks ago but because i was a little bit ghost um this is probably going to be the perfect time to do so but anyway make sure you do stay around so you can see how you can enter the giveaway if you wish to do so but let's dive into the makeup review part of this video funny story i've actually filmed a first impression so this technique is not going to be a fashion impression but i just didn't like the quality of the video i didn't like my makeup look honestly it was a right off but today i'm going to be reviewing the revolution pro 24 carat gold palette set so this is what it looks like i've already dipped my hands in it so i kind of know how i feel but obviously i want to do it on camera for y'all so the details about this palette so this reaches for 14.99 this is the revolution pro 24 carat gold palette this palette will give you the inspiration by the glow of golden hour it has 18 pounds of shadows in this palette with buttery smooth warm tones cool tones and true golden tones richly pigmented warm transition shades with a mixture of matte reflective pearls and glitter pigment this palette came as a collection so it did come with the serum and the setting spray but i didn't get that because i'm quite funny with foil particles in like solution to rub on my face or to spray on my face so i skipped that so as much as i don't really like eyeshadow palettes as i always say i was actually really excited to try this out what the packaging looks like and it's got really nice weight to it you can see the reflective it is like cardboard texture and it's got a magnetic um lid or whatever you want to call it you know and this is what the palette looks like so it does come with a mirror and it comes with all these beautiful shades i don't know if my camera's brushing it out now you guys know i'm always honest i first looked at this palette i really like the shades however i am a little bit um i don't know like and i would explain why i felt a bit this shade silence which is like a purple shade i don't know why she's there i just find that shade very random these two brown burgundy shades um strike and coin look very similar and also the gold shades in here as well and this is gilded and this is 24k or 24 carat whatever you want to say those look very similar as well now these shimmer shades in hair are like party formulas so you can see like dents in the shimmer shades so they don't give you that shimmer shimmer and me love a shimmer shimmer but it don't give you the shimmer shimmer but anyway i'm actually gonna swatch some of the shades so you can see exactly what i'm talking about so again strike here like so and this is coin like so very similar on the fingertips very similar like you cannot see a difference i'm just gonna swatch it on the back of me and so that was strike and that was coin are those what the shade looks like to me they look so similar i'll probably say this one is a little bit more deeper but the undertones and the shades are the same gilded is it guilded guilded guilded don't dodge me also 24k which is this one down here gilded 24k and very very similar if not the same now i'm going to swatch plate which is this smoky cool tone brown and silence which is this purple shade hair and there you go i don't know where the back side i was going with this watching game like what is this please this is so off but there you go it's also like a cream based formula down here which is literally named as base so if you want something to prime your eyelids you can use that i personally don't really like these base formulas because i like to use my concealer instead primer eyelids first i love using the nars soft matte creamy blue soft matte creamy soft matte complete concealer in the shade on monday and i personally just like to apply this on the lids okay so i'm going to dive in and create a look so the first shade i'm going to use is the shade um i think i'm going to go with strike so i'm going to tap it into the crease first hopefully i will create a look that goes with my outfit because i'm actually in a process of going out i'm gonna go to little family barbecue you know birthday celebrations but yeah it's like a warm i can't speak today this is what happens when you haven't filmed for a while but it's like a warm maroon shade beautiful blends out flawlessly like the pigmentation is clearly there and funny enough there's actually hardly any fallout not even in the pan but that is a very nice shade scissors i'm gonna go in with one of the eig shawl brushes and blend the outer part of the eye just to make it more flawless seamless airbrush whatever terminology i'm in a makeup artist name yeah just to practice one thing at all okay so i'm gonna darken like the outer v so i'm gonna use the shade [Music] mine which is this one on here which looks very similar to plate but this one is more warmer where plate is actually quite cool tone so i'm going to use like a flat brush i'm just gonna pat the outer oh no it's just gonna work oh yeah is it gonna work oh yeah so i'm gonna pat that on out of the switching over to a tapered brush and like try and blend that semi cut the crease and with a little bit of concealer just like done like a half moon semi cup you know what i talk about anyway so i'm gonna add a shimmer shade on top which i definitely gonna go for this shade which is the 24 karat gold sometimes i like to like grind the shimmers just a little bit more just to get more payoff bearing in mind this brush is actually dry i didn't wet it i didn't put no setting spray on it but it's applying really nicely oh yeah see with the finger it's just so much better oh god this is actually really smoky and grungy it's not gonna go with my outfit oh no now i'm gonna go with a glitter and i'm not gonna lie to you guys ever since tommy's clark's palette with revolution the twilight tropical palette and it's got those um pigment glitters in it i have literally fell in love with glitter because mina and i know glitter i don't do no pigments i am not that type of gal but it's just so easy to apply i don't need a sticky place i don't need glue or anything like that so when i saw there was like pigments um glitters in here as well i was over the moon so i'm gonna actually go in with the gold leaf one so this is gold leaf to be a little bit you know different and i'm just gonna apply a little bit i'm not going to go to cray-cray because i'm not going to lie to you guys in my previous look i looked like a disco ball sis and i was just not about that and so i'm just gonna oh i just done the same thing oh no that's too much oh no oh oh look at that look at me in my bare self all right so just gonna blend oh oh no oh no no how do i get this off someone help me please why am i speaking to the camera like say you can help me right now while i'm filming oh i'm making it worse i'm gonna rectify this problem off camera so remove i'm gonna add the shade bullion if that's how you pronounce it which is like this sort of rosy champagne gold and i'm just gonna add that to the brow oh okay so this shade here because i haven't used it before it looks like that but it does actually look more like a rose gold um but then when you swatch it it actually looks gold i've rectified this issue and um put on my lashes because this has gone completely left but the lashes i'm going to use is from lubi lash and it comes in this sort of mesh net little pocket bag and it's got one of the um lashes brush as well and a little card and yeah it comes like this and the styles i'm going to use today is a buddy so these are quite like bold thick and wispy oh yes wait a minute take two yeah so it looks like this and then the logo at the back with you know the style black on company you know support the sister so i'm gonna use these today and yeah anyway let me just fix my eyes do the rest of my makeup

three winners and all three runners have put down their favorite bundles in order then the first one will get their first best choice the second one would get their second choice and then the last one would get their least favorite trace so just make sure you put it in order from your personal preference which is going to be your most favorite bundle down to your least favorite bundle all the products i'm going to mention are completely brand new they haven't been opened they're still in their packaging they still got like the seal on them so they're definitely not open i have sanitized them but i will sanitize them again before shipping and then i will assume you guys will sanitize that as well when you get your product because obviously we don't want no issue around here so the

description box below with the rules to recap what you need to do and good luck to everybody who choose to enter the giveaway if no one chooses to enter the giveaway then i will just give them away to someone else so you know okay so anyway back to the palette this is the final completed look um i've got a little bit cray-cray with the glitter but it's okay it is what is um is what it is there's nothing i could do about it it's definitely i definitely feel better about this look like i did before try somebody overall i really do like this palette um i feel like the packaging is quite decent it's got nice weight to it mirror is an absolute bonus and the shades in hair are gorgeous i really feel like the matte shades in this palette have really improved the shimmers are nice they're just not my favorite shimmers because i don't really like the potty soft satin shimmers i like a proper shimmer shimmer but the shimmers are nice and the glitters are beautiful very effective i mean a little goes a long way like even just a little tap on the finger you will pick up a lot of product and this shade gold leaf which has got like dual chrome greens in it i really love that shade i think this is a gorgeous palette that this would be my perfect palette if there was a true brown matte shade like these two shades are very similar and both of the golds are very similar i personally think they should have just used other shades in this palette especially when these shades have pretty much the same undertone as well and there's not like a true matte brown so i will find it quite difficult to always want to use this as my goal too because i need a brown shades and they ain't got no brown spaces the only thing i feel like is missing just purple shade is a little bit too random for me but that is the only knockoff i will probably say while this would not be my perfect ideal go-to palette because if you guys know i'm a simple bee and i love like you know browns and golds but i just feel like this is not a true brown shade in this palette overall this palette does get a thumbs up and it's not perfect but it does get a thumbs up so you guys let me know what you think i hope you guys enjoy this video good luck to everyone who wish to enter into the giveaway and i would love to see you guys in my next video bye", "SAN_A9oUnnE": "- [James] Fyre Festival. It was supposed to be\nthe pinnacle of opulence, decadence, and hedonism\nbut everything imploded and it became a big fat joke. And that's kind of what happened\nwith DeLorean as a company. This car in particular, this 24 karat gold-plated DeLorean, which was designed as\nthe ultimate 80s symbol of luxury, wealth, and success, is the biggest failure in\nthe history of DeLorean. Today, we are going bumper to bumper on this factory 24-karate\ngold-plated DeLorean DMC-12. (rock music) We've had some amazing cars on this show but this, this is the rarest\ncar that we've ever featured. It is a 1981 DeLorean DMC-12. Now, they only made like 9,000 DMC-12s but this one is very special. It's one of only three in the world that's covered in genuine\n24 karat gold-plating straight from the factory. It's the perfect metaphor\nto describe John DeLorean and how he ran his business. On the outside, it's a shiny\nattention-grabbing future car, but on the inside, it's underpowered and ready to break down at any moment. The thing is, everything\nshould've worked out for DeLorean. He knew how to run a company. He knew how to make a great car. He had a great idea to build the world's first ethical sports car. A safe, fuel efficient, and\nlong-lasting alternative to the gas-guzzling\nsports cars of the time. So how did we end up with this? (electronic music) When John DeLorean worked\nat GM, he was a dynamo. DeLorean designed the\nPontiac GTO, the Firebird, and the Grand Prix as well\nas the Chevy Cosworth Vega. DeLorean commissioned\nfamous Italian designer, Giorgetto Giugiaro to draw\nup the plans in the 70s. This dude designed everything from Fiats to Saabs to\nmy favorite, Volkswagen. Literally hundreds of cars. He designed the MK1 Golf\nand the MK1 Scirocco so naturally, I wish he was my grandpa. Si Papa. John DeLorean built his career\nin Detroit as a young man. When he left Pontiac in 1973 to start DeLorean Motor Company, he\nwas the youngest division head in GM's history. He did what any fast track\nexec having a mid-life crisis would do, he divorced his\nwife, got plastic surgery to enhance his jawline,\nand started dating models. Hell yeah. This car was tailor-made\nfor coked up yuppies. It was a cross-promotion for\nthe American Express Gold Card and it was featured in their\n1980 Christmas catalog. Available exclusively\nto Gold Card Members. This thing could be bought for $85,000. Which is about $250,000 today To put that in context, in\n1980, you could buy a brand new Ferrari 305 that performed way better than this for around $55,000. American Express had planned\non selling a hundred of these. Seven were ordered but only\nthree were finished before the plant shut down. There's this one, which sat in\na bank in Texas for 20 years. It has nine and a half\nmiles on the odometer. And it's never been driven. There's another one that\nwas bought by a dude up in Northern California\nwho decided that he was gonna drive his but he dented\nthe door the first time he took it out. His insurance had to pay\n$14,000 to replace it because it couldn't just be buffed out. That dude gave it away\nafter his insurance payments went up to $1,000 a month. The third gold-plated\nDeLorean was up for sale by a private owner and\nit's unclear whether or not it's been sold. The asking price was $250,000. I mean Will.i.am probably bought it, but no one will ever know. Unlike Nolan's heart, the\nbody isn't made of solid gold. The body is actually 24\nkarat gold sheet on top of stainless steel. If you scraped off all\nthe gold from this car, it wouldn't even fill your hand. It's less than an ounce. The steel plates are attached to a fiberglass monocoque underbody. This wasn't the original concept though. DeLorean had planned to use\nurethane foam and fiberglass for the underbody in a process called elastic reservoir molding or ERM. Or ERM. The benefit of this method\nwas extreme crash resistance with impact being spread\nover the entire panel. It was a smart idea but in the end, they ditched the method\nfor a more conventional and cheaper fiberglass underbody. DeLorean actually bought\nthe rights to ERM process before it was proven for some reason. It was just one of the\ndumber moves in a string of dumb moves that would\ndescribe the DMC legacy. Luckily, DeLorean made a\ncouple of smart moves too. One of them was enlisting\nthe minds over at Lotus to look over the earlier,\nheavily flawed designs of the DMC-12. Lotus helped with the design. They added larger rear\ntires and helped fortify safety features in the DMC-12. Without the help of Lotus,\nthe DMC-12 might have been much worse than it was. The chassis was completely\nredesigned by Lotus. It's a steel double y\nframe chassis that's shared with the Lotus Esprit. Obviously, one of the most iconic features of the DeLorean are its gull wing doors. They open straight up like how a seagull gets into their car. That's how they got\ntheir name, true story. Now would be a good time to\nmention that I have to wear gloves to open this door. I'm only allowed to touch\ncertain parts of this car. The main differences between\nthe normal stainless exterior and this gold-plated exterior\nare that fingerprints are super hard to wipe away on this one. And big bros got warrants. (seagull caws) One common misconception\nis that these doors require a larger clearance to open, making them useless for\ncramped parking lots but that's actually not true. They only require 11 inches\nof clearance to fully open which is less than a\nnormal car needs to open. So, eff you haters. One thing that's pretty\ncool is that even the inside of the door is gold-plated. And they used gold screws\non the door panels. Nice attention to detail,\nin my humble opinion. Despite some small victories,\nthe DMC-12 was still a huge failure, whether\nit's covered in gold or not. To understand how broken\nDeLorean's system was, you have to understand the circumstances in which it was built. The original DMC-12s\nwere made in a factory in Dunmurry, Northern\nIreland, a suburb of Belfast. If you don't know, Northern\nIreland in the early 80s was at the epicenter of a bloody conflict between Loyalists, who\nwanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK, and Nationalists aka the\nIRA, who wanted it to be part of Ireland proper. Listen to \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" by U2 to learn all about it. Long story short, it\nwasn't the ideal situation for a blooming new car company. The location of the factory\nhad an adverse effect on DeLorean's price model. The DMC-12 was named that because DeLorean wanted to sell them for\n$12,000 but the added cost of shipping them across the Atlantic meant that if they wanted to\nmake any profit the cars needed to be sold for $25,000. You could get a Corvette\nfor $16,000 at the time. So DeLorean was already\nfacing an uphill battle from the moment they entered the market. And let me tell you, I\nwouldn't want to be stuck in a DeLorean going uphill. You see, this sports car's\nengine only makes about a 130 hrsprs, let's take a look. Which is what I would\nsay if I were allowed to open this hood. So I'm going to rely on the\ntalents of my editor Max to make it look like I am opening the hood and we're putting the engine right there. Whoa. This (eye wink noises) is a 2.85 liter V6 PRV engine. PRV stands for Peugeot Renault Volvo. It wasn't DeLorean's first\nchoice for an engine. It wasn't even his second choice. He originally wanted to put a 200 hrsprs Citroen sourced rotary into the DMC-12 but\nthat idea got scrapped. The first prototype had\na four cylinder Citroen, then a Ford V6 and eventually they landed on this leaky PRV. It has a top speed of 110 miles per hour, it can do 0 to 60 in, get ready for it. Hold onto your seat, let\nme know in the comments if you're ready, hit the subscribe button. You ready? You ready? You sure? 0 to 60 in 10.5 seconds. The boys over at DMC\nran into a big problem when they switched to the PRV. The initial rotary took up a lot less room so they had to move it back\nand then it went from being a mid-engine car to a rear-engine car and that shifted the weight,\ncausing massive problems with the handling. That was not their only problem, however. The build quality of the DMC-12\nwas shotty from the get go. Inexperienced workers\nneeded to be trained quickly and immediately production\nschedules were delayed. Even by the time the factory\nwas on schedule in 1982, they weren't producing\nenough cars to cover the manufacturing overhead. DeLorean was sinking. He needed to find\ninvestment capital quick. And on October 19th 1982, John DeLorean was busted by\nthe FBI in a sting operation for bankrolling the transport\nof 59 pounds of blow. (upbeat electronic music) - [Reporter] Federal authorities\nhave finally arrested him earlier this week. - [James] A week later,\nthe British government pulled the plug on the DeLorean factory and laid off 2500 workers. Now a lot of people say he was framed. I might be one of those people. The big three don't want to\nsee a little guy come up. Why do you think Elon Musk is\nrunning into so much trouble? Let's take a look at the interior. (electronic music) This is the only gold DeLorean\nthat has black leather. The other two have brown leather. So that's pretty exciting. I would love to touch this but alas, the Peterson will not\nlet me sit in this car, but if I could, I wouldn't\nhave a problem fitting. John DeLorean was six foot\nfour and wanted to make sure that he and the rest of us\nbig boys could sit in his car without having to hunch over. If you're short, it's a little harder to yank to doors close\nso there's this loop that you can pull. It's like a subway loop. All you JDM boys love it. The seats look comfortable. Wouldn't know, can't sit in it. They're tastefully\nbolstered and the leather looks nice and soft. It's really crazy\nlooking at a car this old with carpet this nice. I don't think I ever owned\na car with carpet this nice. The gauge cluster is pretty\nbasic but there is one pretty cool thing about it. The door ajar light has gull wing doors instead of conventional doors. And that's about all I can\nsay from this distance. This gold covered car is the\nmost DeLorean thing ever. The dude was really smart\nand was driven to make the coolest car possible. But you can't produce a car\noff of pure determination. There's so much that goes\ninto making a great car that DeLorean skipped\nover because of his ego or because of mismanagement. Who knows? A few different decisions\nor if the cards fell in a different way here and there. We could have been driving\nnew DeLorean models today. If only Elon Musk had been\nborn 30 years earlier.

"ooiiyzgANB8": "hey guys welcome back to Jurassic collectibles I hope you're all doing as well as you can given the kind of global crisis at the moment but today I'm going to cheer you up we've got a big unboxing to do and we're going to take a closer look at one of the items contained in this box right so this box comes from the good folks at fnatic and we thank you very much fnatic for sending this over can't wait to see what's inside it's always great to get some Jurassic Park and drastic world goodies on the channel so let's open this first off we've got a little paper flyer from fnatic believe it was Louise who helped send this over thank you to Louise so let's get cracking we've got some bubble wrap okay so I think one of the items were reviewing in this video is containing yes here it is it's the VIP 24 karat gold plated Jurassic Park ticket now if you're not aware of how quickly these things sold out you only need to look on the secondary market for how much these are now going for it's ridiculous yeah so these were very sought after by Jurassic Park fans and we're gonna be looking at this one in this video today got a limited edition blue coin again we we told you guys about these when they were coming out a couple of weeks back we said we are going to be reviewing these on the channel so yeah looking forward to taking closer look at that if you guys know me I'll be collecting all of these coins so far so I've been hot on the heels of all the collectible coins since the 25th anniversary and then they've sent over this Wow a Jurassic Park felt pennant so actually this is a nice flag for those in the UK and you can put it up on your wall and show how much you're a fan of Jurassic Park pretty cool and actually it's themed as if it's the opening weekend of Jurassic park's that all ties in with the VIP ticket these are kind of like merchandise that you would get if you were in the fictional universe of Jurassic Park which i think is really cool and imaginative okay so more bubble wrap and then now these are extras I don't think I'm going to be reviewing these but I'm going to share what else they've sent over so you can see and I think one has already been reviewed on the channel right Wow so these guys have really outdone themselves I did not expect this Thank You fanatic this is amazing and Louise for sending us over I'm a big fan of Back to the Future I have a lot of Back to the Future stuff on the channel and yeah I just didn't expect this so this is all of Marty's costumes throughout the three films so that's Back to the Future one that's a future two and that's the Future three it's a cowboy outfit really cool this is a limited edition print you can get it from fanatic really really nice and actually it's Universal comes with a certificate of authenticity and it actually says it's limited to 5000 prints worldwide so if you're a big Back to the Future fan this is a really nice piece of modern minimalist art for your wall really cool and then this is what I requested it says I hate computers engine the feeling's mutual I really love that phrase from Alan Grant and it's always made me laugh so I'm gonna be putting this in my office room on the wall so it should kind of tie nicely with the fact that it's near a computer I think it should be a nice bit of tongue-in-cheek comedy there and again certificate of authenticity this is limited to 5000 worldwide as well really cool thank you guys I won't be reviewing these prints in a separate video obviously because they're kind of just prints but definitely go and check it out on the Phanatic website these are really cool and we've got some prints from them before I'll put all the links to those videos where we've reviewed prints from them before down below and then they sent over this so this is awesome and there's a drastic part of fun I'm really excited about this this is the limited edition like the graph set now we've reviewed this on the channel tom carefully reviewed this and has done a brilliant video so check out the link for this review down below but I didn't actually and after seeing Tom's videos I was sold so definitely go and check this out and yeah I can't wait to open this up and take a closer look at those lovely limited-edition prints Wow and this is limited to 995 worldwide so fanatic there's a lot of limited edition pieces and yeah it's wonderful just really lovely collectors pieces and I love the coloration they've used here like the bonnet of the Jeep Wrangler in Jurassic Park really really cool we will be reviewing this felt pennant on the channel and the new blue limited edition collectible coin so stay tuned for those let's move those out the way for now this is what you're here for this is the Jurassic Park of VIP ticket 24 karat gold plated and essentially what this is is like an in-universe fictional prop if you attended Jurassic Park on the opening day and you have the most premium ticket around this would have been it and it's limited to 1,000 pieces as made by fanatic and I think it's a wonderful collectible for Jurassic Park fans now unfortunately this has already sold out so you cannot get your hands on this unless you look on the secondary market and the prices online are ridiculous but you know it's a sought-after collectible and we're gonna open it up and take a closer look so taking a closer look at the packaging this is an officially licensed Jurassic Park piece opening weekend and it's in gold there and you can see there's the ticket inside very very nice it's got a lovely sort of yellowish gold glow and this is limited to 1,000 24 karat gold plated this is the ultimate Jurassic Park collectible on the side it says here 24 karat collection same on the bottom same on this side and same on the top so I'm assuming there's going to be other 24 character collectibles for other franchises if you're interested and this is just the first limited to 1000 worldwide 24 karat gold plated embossed metal ticket and it comes with a displaced which is pretty cool and it's individually numbered universal and fanatic Museum so here is the box out of the shrink-wrap and actually there's another piece of plastic between me and the ticket the ticket is a little bit loose in there so it can actually shake around so I wouldn't recommend shaking it like I just did and yeah okay so it's got a handy little economic finger holes here to open the box let's open this thing up it's gonna be cool and here it is Wow I don't know how well you can see this but there's actually a foam lining on the inside to protect your ticket so actually probably shaking it wouldn't be wouldn't cause too much damage but wow this thing is weighty and oh this is a very nice piece so it's done Lee the weight of the ticket tells me that it's definitely got a premium feel and it's not flexible at all it's like a rigid piece of metal and this is a very sturdy piece and it's catching the light and glinting in all those magical ways and inside is the display base so this is cool so if you're keeping it in the box you won't have to fiddle with this but it looks like these two pieces just simply slot together like that I just noticed while dismantling the the stand actually there's some like a film on these acrylic stands so actually it's clear acrylic it's not frosted acrylic and then if I bring in the ticket and place it on the stand there we go so if you want to have your ticket on display you can open it up and use the display stand that is really nice really simple and actually it's quite a nice trinket when its stood on that little this ladies it's got a nice of conversation piece quality about it if you came into the room you'd go what's that and you go out sir it's a ticket if you went to Jurassic Park the opening day of Jurassic Park and I like that okay so let's take a closer look at this thing so straight away we've got this lovely glossy gold finish in the area that matters most the Jurassic Park logo really nicely done lovely details there on the T Rexes T from the rest of the skeleton says here opening weekend and adventure 65 million years in the making got the engine logo there the fictional corporations in Jurassic Park actually says opens at 9:00 a.m. so you can go in at 9:00 a.m. and start your tour so admit one and then it says here customer unique reference number and then you've got your actual limited edition number here it's number 28 down here it says VIP ticket admits one adult and then I'm really struggling to read this but it says here VIP helicopter ride to Isla Nublar first-ever public access to safari tour net and complimentary refreshments at the Visitor Center Wow I'd be well up for that that would be amazing ah sounds like such a good trip to the visitors center in the film they do actually dine on those refreshments so that's quite cool and then here it says opening weekend really nice nice and glossy and again you've got the four stars and you got a nice little false perforation line there as well on the back you've just got gold and then you got the licensing information just as an overall appearance thing as you actually get towards the edges of the ticket it gets a bit more glossy so there is almost like a sort of false where that's already sort of like built into this replica it's almost like it's a little bit more opaque a bit less shiny behind the lettering which really makes the lettering pop and of course at the bottom we've got this repeated t-rex logo with these lovely ferns as well just a really nice embellishment along the bottom there okay so let's replace that on the stand so there we go a Jurassic Park VIP gold-plated ticket what more could you ask for as a Jurassic Park fan than having one of these on your desk and the nice thing is when you're done with this you can replace it and keep it nice in this really lovely foam line box and then you can replace your ticket like so and you've got a lovely presentation box to keep it in so there we have it guys what a wonderful little piece I think this is a really nice collectible if you're into Jurassic Park it's a lovely fictional prop and a nice conversation piece do not worry if you want to get your hands on one of these and you've missed this one and it's too expensive on the secondary market they are doing a silver plated version which is available on their website right now so go and check that out I'll put a link down below so you can get your hands on the silver version which in some ways you might prefer as usual guys rate comment and subscribe hit the bell for notifications in your email about new videos and we'll see you guys in the next video [Music]", "WvZyGnHTqRo": "[Music] ok guys welcome back I am going to do a kind of a cloudy pour for you today now I actually worked this out by accident you guys remember me doing this pour here drying out so it's tried pretty much the same as what you'd seen it on the video and this was actually an accident as I said this some metallic here was my rose gold I'll just grab a bottle I've still got some left research it's called a howl art extreme Sheen that's it there and yeah it just reacted all by itself so I got some of the gold which is that one extreme machine 24k gold I don't go out and I'm gonna play with it today but with global paints and see if it will react like this because a lot of people in Australia you know use this global paint and I just thought I'd see how the deco art this one reacted with the global because I've only used it with liquitex basics and I can't keep buying liquitex base exclaims that awfully expensive so I'm gonna see if I can get the same effect with the global so the pouring medium today is just float roll back roll reacts really well makes cells on its own you don't even need silicone oil when you're using float roll but your cells don't have the stability that they do when you're using glue so I prefer glue now oh yes float roll this paint is really quite thin and as I said it reacts a lot so it has got one part pouring medium which is float roll to two parts paint it's pretty liquidy in here this holds so 60 mils so 60 ml is about 30 mils of float roll so that's that one there Navy but I ops us in purple and the black have been mixed two parts float roll to 1 part paint this turquoise which is a lot thinner has been mixed one and a half parts float roll to 1 part paint so sound consistency I've achieved but I had to use a little bit less flood trial because the paint's thinner so it leaves a little mound little bit thinner than what I would use for my flip cut pause but still a little mound and the flood trial makes it so beautifully in creamy little mound clouds even though they look nice to begin with you know you come back an hour or so later and they've just taken over the whole thing so I don't like to have it too thin my mix so the colors are deep space [Music] chuckwei's darks is in purple and black and when I do not before after this and I'm going to add to take out the black and I'm gonna add white with some Sutton enamel so that'll be the poor after this one if you're interested in that one and of course they don't go like 24k gold so that's but now what I'm wanting is a dark Center with some gold in it and there being a little bit too lenient with my gold and just put little amounts in probably need about 3/4 of that for this size 30 by 40 centimeter so just start with a good amount of the Navy in the bottom so like the nice dark Center and then I'm just gonna drizzle a little bit of gold and I want too much I do want the gold and the turquoise to turn a beautiful sort of a greeny gold color that's what I'm doing what am i doing I pull that in but just a little bit maybe a little bit more and then I want to go with the and then black and then I thought it might be nice to drizzle the gold across the black because those cells would look pretty wouldn't they gold on black yeah and then I'll go with someone Navy put a mound of Navy it's kind of push the gold all the way across now and then we'll leave the gold out and I'll put some Chuck boys some purple some black and then okay back to the gold a little bit of gold not too much I'm not even sure whether or not the guards going to react with the young these Global's I have no idea now what a nice dark outside for my poor lots of black and I'll keep the black because all no doubt use some of the black on the edges and I still got half my gold left so if it's going to react the way I'm hoping it will I don't need a lot and that should be enough for my neck painting when I add the setna numbers alright let's hope for the best expect the worst but let's hope for the best now I'm gonna try and do maybe some smaller rings round round do we go I have to move the cup around a little bit so I don't get too much of a big black spot now as the cup empties a little bit I can actually get a bit closer to the surface see I'm going wriggle ahem don't want to go readily not to slow down a little bit I think kind of losing my rings because it went a bit Wiggly I think my spats a little bit big probably needed to have a little bit more of a point look at the gold see how it's taken over and I put such a small amount in there I already wanted that dark blue Center but it doesn't look as if I'm going to get that because the Gold's really really taken over isn't it it's just amazing like the hardly had any gold in then and that's just one really taken over anyway I don't do it looks like and this will be a little test obviously know if it's really really powerful this gold then I can maybe use a quarter of the amount and use that one little bottle and get all poles out of it I do want to have some black on my edges so it's going to fit my black out just a touch and I'm just going to pop a little bit of water just in my black yes flash of water and then I can spread it on the corners I do like to have this a little bit thinner this paint that I use for my corners just so that the other paint can flow easily over it it's not going to like hit it and then have to climb over a bump you know what I mean run away paint not terribly reactive just yet is it that's okay actually don't want it to be react too much because when you when your clouds react or your pancreas and creates those clouds sometimes they just overtake everything and you lose the actual look of your painting now because it's just a mass of clouds and you think always all my colors with all my rings and I just don't like that so I want a little bit of an effect taking over the whole thing if it makes sense makes sense to me cuz I don't want just a mass of cells claps I should say it seems that this don't go out paint is quite reactive so it'll be interesting to see whether or not it's just reactive to the liquitex basics or whether I can get that same effect with this global cheaper alternative okay so the funeral sells happening along here I just can't believe how much that God's taken over and I hardly used any of it I guess it'll be really pretty when it's dry be very gold and shiny won't it when it's dry just moving the paint around getting it to stretch out all of those rings I noticed leave it like that you don't have to have everything oh you know rings all separated sometimes it's nice just to have that bad mood oh dear I'll take it up a little bit I guess if I didn't use so much paint I could have left more of that great band there but because so much paint on here kind of had to stretch it out I don't really have an option I have to get rid of some of it it's not doing a lot at the moment the gold is looking guess it's looking a little bit puffy but it's certainly not reacting like it did with the limit X basics don't know why must obviously something to do with the the paint ok let's go off to this oh and I want to see if I can keep some of that blue so I'll click down here and then that way I don't want to lose all my blue I'm just gonna have to end up with a little bit of black on the corner there because if I go any further all that blue is going to be gone skis corner there ok now we'll need to take it down to the other corner you know I hate to lose that bright paint just got too much paint on the surface here see if I can do that and just keep them a little bit of that right happy turquoise there was that not too weird much it looks a bit odd doesn't it ok I have to go over get rid of it down there down there bye bye blue well certainly is very shimmery it's a beautiful beautiful paint this deco upsetting extreme Sheen it's called beautiful beautiful paint so when this dries it's going to be amazing but wow it certainly takes over doesn't it sure does what I've seen any artists really nothing happening it is a pretty cool though but yes certainly haven't done its thing with the local tax basics okay I will take it down for close up and as I said I think it's gonna be really really pretty once it's dried because that gold is amazing and yeah really like that turquoise in the center there probably needed to use and I'll do it for my next one tiny little bit of gold and a much more of the color in between the layers of gold yep just to get more right let me take you down to the close-up I don't even think you can pick up the shimmery of it the shimmer enos of it don't think you can I can see it with the naked eye but don't think the camera is going to pick it up don't think so I have to look back on on my video and see if it actually picks it up but don't know if it is so there's the center turquoise and then over here that's really pretty I wish I had more of that boxes in purple in it all righty well that was a car called a failed poor it wasn't a failed poor it just as far as clouds were yeah it kind of failed a bit there I guess the global doesn't react like the liquitex basics ones but the next one as I said I'm gonna use the Sun paints and I'll use less gold and I'm gonna put some setting enamels in it actually maybe I won't I don't think it's probably any point me trying the global again because I have tried the global with a certain enamel and it didn't work either so I won't do that I'll mix up what I can from liquitex basics I haven't got much paint left mix it up and then we'll go again with this gold that extra little bit that I've got left okay I'll see you for that one soon bye for now", "w8rYTR5mXD8": "hey you guys what is up and welcome back to March oh and another episode I guess we're just gonna call this review it drugstore edition so I think that's gonna be the new segment is reviewing drugstore is dishing is it shonduras stamp of approval but hold up make sure you subscribe to the channel make sure you thumbs up this video make sure you follow me on all my social media sites and make sure you check out savvy naturalistic comm for all your skin care needs miracle glow oil as well as larimar elixir in our Rose toner aqua de Rosas so make sure you check that out evidentially sitcom so in this episode of reviewing i'm so excited will be doing drugstore edition and will be trying this mask ecology gold serum now a lot of you have been asking me to try it 24 go serums again or anything with 24 karat gold like gold products again apparently they're in again and i didn't know that because i started doing them on my other channel and then when i just wished to making the new channel which is this channel and making it all skin care so this is what it looks like it's pretty i love the packaging now let's just talk about what it does so as i said its anti-aging formulation and it adds moisture and elasticity to the skin while helping to restore the skins youthful complexion it will leave your skin is fully smooth and refresh refresh now i want to do a disclaimer I've tried this before I really like this serum but we're just gonna pretend that I never tried it before okay okay and let's just get into it the ingredients so the first now this is not a clean Beauty channel but I do like to run down the ingredients with you guys cuz a lot of you are very picky on ingredients and you want to know what is what what it's not I'm not very informative on all ingredients but I will do my googles after just to make sure you know how we do so the first ingredient is water and glycerin there's this greeting called myth afloat prana doll let's just find where sodium collar on it is because that's what we want so sodium Paulo Romney is like one of the last ingredients in this and then there's ten oxide and then gold so they have iron oxides in this sodium color running and then tin oxide and gold so I would say let's just say there's 20 ingredients sodium howa howa Romney would be the I would say the 17th or 18th ingredients so it's sodium hi Lorena is the eighteenth ingredient out of the 20 ingredients mass ecology anyway so yeah also there's real gold in it but it's all the way at the end and they're probably some oxides in it to make it look gold but yeah let's just get into this so the directions say your face needs to be clean my face is clean that was my cell and they had like five left now the thing is really hard it's like y'all hear that this thing is hard listen I think it's made us glass oh this is glass see it is glass so this is what it looks like we're gonna do a close-up so you guys can see what it looks like I'm gonna add a little bit to my hand because we have to swatch you guys know I like this watch skincare so this is how it looks on my hand I'm trying to light back now yeah I see can y'all see the gold that's the go it looks more like a shimmer not a really real gold so i'm swatching it so i will say that it's not sticky or tacky at all and it melts in the skin I still see the shimmer so it smells like I would say personally my personal opinion smells like your grandma's perfume so like back in the olden days I would say we'll be like yo grandma's perfume I don't mean to say that but you know how your grandma wore that really strong perfume I don't know some of y'all may think it's a subtle scent but if you're like really gung-ho on essentials this would be really potent to you I don't know it smells like Grandma perfume you know how grandma's be taking it point I'm gonna do miracle glow oil y'all see miracle glow oil how she has gold at the bottom can y'all see so I'm gonna shake it up so y'all can see the difference in what real gold looks like and this this I don't know this shimmer gold so America blow oil we use real gold can you tell the difference see I don't know if you can see but literally one is like a shimmer and one is like real go so i'ma turn the lights down really really low so I'm gonna do a two drops of miracle glow oil hold on let me turn the lights down because I feel like we're doing science here so this is miracle glow oil can y'all see y'all see the gold y'all see how the gold is glistening I know y'all see that that's miracle low oil and then this says is gold in it but it looks more like holographic glitter than me to me it looks like gold holographic glitter and I used to work with nail polish as a nail polish artisan and I see a lot of holographic and this looks like holographic go to me so we'll do it and that's it can y'all self look can y'all see you see how this one is glitter and this is gold so this is miracle glow oil and this one is the mask ology so if we all so if we're comparing gold the gold I'm just letting you guys know the difference the goal it looks more like a gold holographic glitter to me so you get what you pay for okay it was $13 so let's just put some on our face read the directions it says use in the morning cleanse your skin I cleanse my skin in June with massage firm went to face and neck until it fully absorbs so that's what we're gonna do ah knocking mythology because I really like their stuff I'm just saying that you know if you don't say its goal that looked like holographic gold to me it could be gold pieces but the gold is more it looks more holographic maybe they just have like little tiny Gold's in it so normally this is what I do in the morning with this Sarah I use this during the winter time a lot because it's been really really dry so just use it and I put it in my skin and they say get your mixer you know we got to get her neck okay so I added the serum to my face now I will say like it's very glittery so like if you like a really light shimmer then this would be a shimmer shimmer for you I'm gonna do a close-up and I only put a few drops but last time I brought this product I didn't have this much shimmer to my face sold either they got a new formula or some going on I got a bad batch I don't know but my face is very tacky and there's a lot of shimmer always this shimmery I don't remember it being this shimmery last time I bought it I mean if you like that glitter look I mean it's okay so I'm gonna do a close-up so you guys could see the glitter of his shows I don't know can y'all see it like it's a light shimmer like it's like my face is shimmer shimmer and shine yeah what's too much of it turning light down so you guys could see can you see the shimmer I don't know if you guys could see the shimmer but this is what my face looks like after it's a lot of shimmer there's a lot of shimmer like a lot lot of shimmer maybe too much for me I don't know I'm not a shimmer type of girl let's talk about this Sara so I let it sit on my head for about 30 minutes now I've used two serum before and it wasn't as shimmery so maybe they added I don't know but it's out of stock and then they have a new formula and I got this one at Walmart so I don't know what's going on with mass college you don't ask me I don't know what's going on with them but anyways I guess there's two different formulas they have a new one but I will say after letting it sit on my face for 30 minutes it is no longer still sticky or tacky is a very soft feeling I can feel my face belly's awful supple soft and more of the elastic in my face I really do like this era mouth always liked it the shimmer is leaving I will also say you guys know I live in a desert so I'm all about hydration for a desert living I will say that my face does not feel dry at all and we're getting into the drier season now with March coming winter was really dry but we're about the hit like a lot of dry weather due to the fact that the snow and all that winter there those winter storms that came through and put snow in the desert are finally leaving so we're drying now and so i will tell you my skin my hands is a sheet but my face it's not and normally when my hands is at you I'd be looking like you know like an addict on the side of my mouth I'm just saying it is really nice it is moisturizing I look it is under stamp of approval I would like them them to work on the gold formula because this actually does have holographic glitter this is not this is not gold this is holographic glittered like this is really hollow glitter I don't know you could buy our logo letter and skincare products that's really interesting I didn't know that but anyways that's here nor there for me if you say you're gonna put gold in something least put a little flakes I'm the miracle glow oil guy oh good Elsa go in this and this is dispersed all over so I mean at the end it is $12 people will say you get what you pay for its long I mean if you're paying $12 for a formula with gold in it I guess you'll get some sort of gold but not a lot of gold I mean gold is the last ingredient in here so I mean don't expect to have a lot of go you're probably gonna get some gold flakes but you are gonna get some holographic glitter and a little bit of gold flakes I mean fragrance it's all the way up I would say fragrant at this 20 ingredients fragrance like fragrance oil is about the 15th or 10th ingredient on here and gold is at the bottom so I mean that should just tell you guys something better anyways what I buy this again yeah I would I will give it's under a stamp of approval I think they sure work on a formula though I want to see more gold more gold in this product oh nice ecology but I really do like the product I really do feel that it's moisturizing my skin my skin is still soft and sticky not sticky but soft and silky and at the end of the day that's all that matters is if it worked I mean we could debate fragrance oils and gold all day here but if it's making your skin feel soft supple and you know it's moisturizing your skin then why are you complaining some was saying so the end of the day you get shunned heir stamp of approval let me know do you like this new episodes of review it I'll be doing luxury skincare cuz y'all been dying for me to do luxury skincare products oh my god doesn't break

channel it's me a girl lia lee today i'm going to be showing you guys my esthetician nighttime skin routine we are doing this glowy glowy 24k gold facial let's get into it because your girl is about to be having the glowiest skin going to bed and waking up tomorrow morning what's going on y'all so i'm going to go ahead and start with my cleanser i have been using this peter thomas roth glycolic acid anti-aging cleanser it is in the form of gel so this is pretty different from what i'm accustomed to using i'm going to go ahead and jump right in a little bit about this anti-aging cleansing gel it does have glycolic acid which is an aha which works as a chemical exfoliator to help reduce the look of dullness it also has salicylic acid which is a bha helps to chemically exfoliate the skin as well and improve the appearance of problem skin the last main or key ingredient that is in this cleansing gel is the white oak bark extract which helps to brighten the appearance of the skin now i'm going to go ahead and with my fenty skin cleanser is almost gone you guys i do double cleanse i know this is sometimes some people double cleanse with more of a pre-cleanse cleanser but i do what works best for me and i recommend everyone else to do the same i use a pretty good amount that's probably why it's almost gone i really enjoy using this cleanser one because of the fragrance it is very lightly fragrant but it smells so fruity and refreshing and because of the gentleness of it if i feel like i've done too much exfoliating from other cleansers or other enzymes or chemical exfoliants um i'll go in with this cleanser for the next couple of days taking it easy on my skin i normally do not rinse this way but for the video sake i need to because my camera is hovering right over my sink and the last thing that i want is for my camera to fall i just damped my cloth and i'm just gonna wipe away using my fresh rose water toner ladies and gentlemen she's almost gone i'm going to use a cotton pad because it's got to the point to where the rose petals are actually coming out of the bottle and i don't want them on my skin so the reason that we are all here for the 24k mark and night gold leaf facial this comes with four sheets of the gold leaf and the makanai oil serum which also has like little teeny tiny flakes of gold flakes in them i need to make sure that my face is pretty much damp when i apply these gold sheets or else the gold will not adhere to my skin j beauty is pretty popular these gold foil sheets have been around for a pretty long time i feel like it's kind of newer on the end for the american beauty i'm going to leave a bunch of information down below the description if you guys want to purchase your own so you can give yourself a glowy 24k facial at home and there we have it i'm gonna start with my forehead and i pray that i do this right the first time i watched a couple videos of people applying some gold flakes on their skin i do want to thank mike and i beauty for gifting me this kit oh it didn't stick i wonder if it's too wet maybe my skin was too damp next time i'm gonna try for it not be so so damn so i got as much as i could off that sheet i am going to just gently damp this over the rest of my skin and continue to put them on okay so i'm supposed to leave these on for about a minute before i go in with the oil serum and basically rub it all in and the gold is going to dissolve this is going to be interesting i was just having fun right here so y'all do not mind me i know y'all have definitely been in the mirror and feeling yourself so yes let me enjoy my moment okay so i'm having too much fun with this 24k gold sheet on my face the 24k go sheet mask whoa so cute so now i am of course going to go in with the oil smells um i don't know it has a smell but i'm not sure what that smell is i don't know anyway i'm going to put some on my hands not too much that much i probably can't see it but okay so maybe i need a little bit more that dissolved pretty quickly into my skin i wish i could do this like every day to see what the results would be and if you wanted to do even more of a relaxation facial at home and allow your skin to soak up and absorb this a nice 24k oil as well you could also go in with a hot towel just bring the towel out with some water put it in a microwave for about 30 seconds just lay it completely over your face and let it soak in and that will be wonderful super glowy now to lock in this moisture i am going to put a thicker night cream on top just because my skin dries pretty quickly especially overnight while i'm sleeping going in with my human race moisturizer because it is super thick so alrighty my lovelies that is going to conclude my nighttime skin routine i am all ready for bed my skin is super clean relaxed and hydrated which is the goal right before bed and during the daytime as well hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did you know what

to be showing you\nhow to do large chrome items. It's probably one of the most common questions that we get from people is, How do I do a large item? There's a couple\nreally important things that you have to know and you have to do just right.\nOtherwise you're going to encounter problems. and problems are much harder to\nfix than just doing it right in the first place. So we're going to go over doing\nthat. The item we're going to be doing is this large wrench. For the sake of time, we're sticking with this item instead of doing something like a wheel. However, you can apply the same concepts to a wheel, a bumper, anything as you can to this wrench. I'm just going to quickly introduce the kit. This is the Universal Plater Chrome Edition. Really it looks just like the regular Universal Plater but it's quite different. You have the ability to strip chrome. And this is called the Chrome Edition. I already have the Chrome Stripper, Surface Activator, and 24k Brush Gold gel in there positions. And we're actually ready to go. To set up like that only takes about five or ten minutes. It's no big deal. The handles come ready to go with these cotton sleeves already on them. You just prep the sleeves a little. For more information on that check out our unboxing video for this very kit. So I'm going to skip a lot of that because if you have any questions about that, just refer to an unboxing video for the\nUniversal Plater Chrome Edition. Alright, let's get to it. Our first step is to to chrome strip. Now you got to make sure you're in Chrome Stripping mode. There is chrome stripping and normal plating. The only time you ever put it in chrome stripping mode is if you are stripping chrome. Aside from that you always flip it to normal plating. Okay so I'm gonna do from about\nhere, to here. This area is what we're gonna focus on for the first section. Okay, now as we start stripping, You're gonna notice a color change, okay. First you're going to see the solution turn yellow. And then you're gonna see the piece kind of turn brown. If you notice the\ndifference between here and here, it's almost like a tan brown. Some people even describe it as it looks like it's turning gold but it's not. What it is is we're removing the layer of chrome that has been plated over the nickel. If you try and put gold on the chrome, you will never get it to stick. It's the number one cause of problems of people trying to plate. See and I just flipped my brush\njust to get some more fresh solution on there. Now the most calls we get for this\nkit are: I'm getting a cloudiness or I'm getting a dark spot. Really any issue that you have when you're doing a chrome item is due to not stripping the chrome\nenough. We really want to make sure that we get every little bit of\nthis chrome off, or else you will have a problem. As you notice I'm going over it,\nand over it, and over it. This has probably been long enough. The telltale signs are it's turned tan everywhere. So now what I'm going to do is\ntake my spray bottle and just rinse off the chrome stripper. And then you watch\nhow the water behaves. This is something when I'm doing tech support I tell\npeople you know if you, if you notice over here on the chrome when I spray it. What happens? the water beads up and just falls right off of it. Over here it's staying wet. Now after a minute it will start to bead as you see. But if there's any concern which I have a tiny bit of concern over here Just hit it longer. It's worth it to just take an extra minute to make sure that you don't have\nan issue Then have a problem and have to polish all the gold off and start over. So I'm just hitting it a little bit more. I'm pretty sure at this point it's\nperfectly stripped. Down to the bare nickel. At this point you may notice a little bit of discoloration don't worry about it. If you see little dark smudges, I get calls here, there's these little clouds in it\nfrom stripping. You'll notice in this next step those just vanish with the activator. So now we come over here and we flip it to normal plating mode. I already had it set at 7 volts, so we're just going to leave it there. Grab the activator handle and come and activate that fresh nickel that we've\njust exposed. Now when you're activating you just quickly hit it. You're not going\nto notice that any sort of real reaction. There is a light bubbling that happens\nbut it's nothing dramatic. You'll notice some of that darkness I was talking about vanish. Make sure you activate beyond, into the chrome. Okay that's, that's an important step and we'll talk about it more here in a minute. Okay, that's activated. Just quickly run over everywhere don't don't sit there and dwell on it. Just get it done. Now that I've rinsed off the activator We're gonna change the voltage down to.. gold works anywhere between four and five. For the sake of having it go on pretty quick, I'll set it up up near five. And now this is the fun part. You'll notice it, it quickly turns gold and the higher the\nvoltage is the quicker it goes on. So you may ask well why not go higher? But at some point you will burn it. So you just got to find the sweet spot for you. Another key is to keep small circular motions. Notice how I'm constantly moving. If I were just to stop and hold it there for long you will get a dark, purple, pink burn spot. If that happens it's not the end of the world. You can clean it up with\nbaking soda. Just put some baking soda and water on it. and polish it up a little and that burn spot will be gone. Okay now the important part. If you notice right here is chrome. Next to that is nickel. And then I have the gold that I plated down here. Do not gold plate up to the chrome. That is the number one mistake that is made by people. Leave yourself what I call a buffer zone. Leave about a half an inch to an inch of area That is exposed nickel that you are not plating onto. That is one of the reasons this\nvideo is being made. I cannot emphasize it enough. Do not gold plate up to the\nchrome. You will get a line. I get the question: Why am I getting a white line or a dark line? and that's exactly why because they tried to gold plate up\nright to it. Leave a big buffer. Okay now we've gold-plated that area. You're gonna see once they clean it off, it looks a lot better when that gel is not on there. It's a beautiful 24k gold. The longer you plate the thicker it gets. And so if you were doing a piece of jewelry you would plate it longer. If it's a car emblem it\ndoesn't really have to be thick but that's up to you as the plater. Now the question comes, okay I've got this gold, I've got this little nickel, How do I merge the two sections? And that's the second purpose of this video. The way you're gonna do that is you're going to pick a section I always recommend baby steps. So I'm gonna say about the same size. Up to this 15 is going to be wear i'm going to strip. But that means I'll activate up to there, but only gold plate to about the H. So here we go. I put it back into chrome stripping mode. Flipping that switch. And I'm gonna go ahead and set the voltage ahead of time to 7 volts. just so it's\nalready there for the activation step. Here i go with the chrome stripping the\nsame thing again. Gonna start up high and let the chemicals kind of drip down that's just a little secret. It doesn't matter too much. Come right down to where\nwe have gold plated and into the gold. Okay, you want to strip into the gold. Look it's not gonna hurt it. Not gonna do anything. You will notice a little bit of a dark spot forming right there at the edge of the gold. Not concerning. It'll go away when we activate and when you gold plate you won't even see it. So again go over it for a good minute or two. Really overdo it. And when you feel like you've done it long enough, do it longer. Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and get the sides too a little bit, for a sec. Now I think this has been long enough. And so I'm gonna rinse it and check for water breaks. Make sure it stays what we call wet out. Make sure all the chrome strippers off. Down here in this area it's breaking a little, so I think I'm gonna hit it just a tiny bit longer because I don't want a problem right there. And now I'm fairly positive that all\nthat chrome is gone. Much better. Alright, now we switch to normal plating\nmode again. So now we're going to activate that freshly exposed nickel. Again, just quickly go over it. You'll notice that dark spot lightens up.\nIt may not completely go away but don't worry about it. Usually stuff does not cover up with gold plating but in this situation where two spots merge, if you do it right and if you overlap as we've been talking about. It'll cover up. If you don't and if you plated it right up to the edge, that's when the line is going\nto show up. So I'm rinsing off the activator and now turn my voltage down to about five volts. We'll go a little higher this time. It'll go on a little quicker And let's put the gold on. Start here. We'll start down here. And you'll notice right at first the gold is a little dark. It's kind of a phenomenon that really no\none can explain why, but after about I don't know, one minute or two it changes\nback to its regular color. Just freshly deposited gold is slightly different so\ndon't freak out when right at first it looks darker. It's not burning. Give it another minute or two and it'll be gone. Now I'm leaving a buffer zone up at the\ntop as you see, another about 1/2 inch. And I just quickly go over the whole\narea just to put a thin layer of gold. For the sake of time, again, we're just\ngoing to leave it at that because it's already as gold as it's gonna get. On that note, plating longer will not make it more gold. once it's opaque, it's\nopaque. That's it, that's the gold it's gonna be. Luckily it's a nice rich gold, with our gold. Now I plated into, as you see, I could come all the way down in here if I want. Into to make sure that, those areas merged well. But I did leave that buffer zone again. Fresh gold, fresh nickel, Chrome. Now I come up, rinse it all off. And look at that No line. No issue. It looks great. It all merged together seamlessly. I could continue on and do the exact same thing again. But I think you probably get the point. You know, it's the same thing I would just\nstrip At this point, I'd turn the wrench around. And clip it or touch it somewhere\nover here. Strip down here all the way. Activate up into the gold. Then gold plate into the gold and the whole rest of the area. Now again, it doesn't matter\nif it's a wrench, a wheel, a bumper, same concepts apply. If you're doing a wheel or a bumper, do not try and do the whole thing at once. I promise you it will fail. You will be very sad and you'll have to polish all that gold off and start over. Pick little sections. I would recommend maybe start out with a 2x2 section. Get it looking good. If you merge another 2x2 and it\nlooks good, then step up to maybe a 3x3. Just don't, don't try to do to big of sections. I think that pretty much covers everything I wanted to cover in this video. But yeah, that's doing large Chrome pieces with the Universal Plater Chrome Edition. And when you're done you can just wipe everything off, put the lids back on these, take your brushes out, and store them away or some people like to clean their, their cotton sleeves out. It's not necessary. And you're done. It's a really easy, fun process. Hope you enjoyed this video.

here we have the redox dragon ruler of boulders we have tempest blaster and title so these are going to be really cool they have five booster packs in each one of them and you got the dragon rulers in it so we have one of each of the dragon rulers which i think is really neat this deck was one of the most popular and most powerful yugioh decks to be in the card game even after the forbidden list so they had the original big dragons and the little dragons being used in the deck and it ended up winning worlds and then they got rid of they banned the baby dragons and then people are still able to find a way to make it uh make the deck work with with just the big dragon so it's really really neat let's pop up in the promo pack and see what is in store here for us today okay so we have our secret rare tempest the oh that's nice the thunder sea horse and you could get x number 50 and we have our rank up magic it's some pretty good foils in here to just give us right off the bat really nice put that up there with our lucky bolt penguin and jerry beans man and i don't think there's anything they hid inside the tins here but it's always nice to check just in case don't want to throw anything away all right so we have two cosmo blazer booster packs a lord of the talcion galaxy booster pack so we got two of those and then we have a number hunters pack so these are our five booster packs they give us in these tins not too bad they'll be 20 booster packs we'll be opening up in today's video it looks like plus the promo packs obviously and the promos themselves is just really nice i felt pretty uh i was pretty happy about being able to find these dragon ruler tints oh nice a box of friends secret rare very very cool actually a really nice looking card i love it i'll put that over here with our our pile of hopefully growing foil so the lord of the tao kion galaxy got the number 107 i believe that is up there in the front you can get that in here as a ultimate rare or a ghost so really really awesome that would be insane if we were pulling a ghost ray in today's video oh my gosh no foil in our first pack that is okay we have so many more packs to go the mecca phantom beast oh my gosh if you guys haven't played the mecha phantom beast deck i did and i had so much fun playing it oh my goodness it is a lot of fun especially if you like tokens and stuff so be prepared you got to have a lot of token cards or dice or things to be able to indicate you have tokens on the field because that's what the deck's all about we got our green dustin the battle and boxer and we have a phone here no foil on here that is okay though oh battle and boxer glass jaw what a battle unboxer card it's really cool that is actually pretty awesome i had a deck profile put on here my friend won uh a yu-gi-oh day over here at our locals years and years ago with that deck so it's a old deck profile on the channel but it is there somewhere and so we're moving to our our first cosmo blazer booster pack actually was a really really popular set back in its day a couple of hazy cars back to back there this is a uh foil as well i reprinted it as a hollow okay i guess it hasn't been that long there you go maybe it has been a while i don't know i just saw them that's why it dawned on me i was going through some of my cards and i saw i had some german ones and some english ones which was really neat right by each other a playset of both pretty neat yeah the hazy flame cerberus right there infernal flame oh right on we got to end up getting a mermail abysstios this one is really really awesome this is one of the staples for the mermail deck when this card came out for them you def that was a three of oh my gosh 2400 defense really incredible mermail card wow what a nice pull definitely going to sleeve this up right now oh my gosh wow that is great first 10 i'm getting a i was our first four letter that we'll technically our first pack had all foils but first pack foil and off to a good start right there memorial bistios gosh that is awesome all right let's move over to our redox dragon what is this dragon ruler of boulder's tin i'm trying to be careful with the tin so these tins are a little bit more difficult to track down as time goes on getting older and older these tins becoming harder and harder to find let's see let's see what is in store for us in our little promo pack here i believe it's exactly the same as the other one and those other two are different up above i believe oh no these are different i am wrong we had our redox there diamond direwolf number was at number 88 the spell book of the master and their other rank up magic very nice and beautiful looking gosh that is great maybe in our next video maybe i'll use the dragon rulers as a giveaway one of each that'll be kind of neat for you that don't have the dragon rulers want to add it to your collection they are just really awesome looking cards so i'm actually going to put them down here so once we get down to the end you can see all four of the dragon rollers together so looks like the same you got the two cosmos the two lord of the talcum galaxy and are one number hunters whatever i hear number hunters or number cards i always think of my friend cyberknight because he has a number collection i don't know if he's i think he showed on his channel ages ago but nothing as of recent i wonder if he's continuing to keep collecting all the number cards that would be pretty neat all right we're gonna do cosmo blazer this time maybe we'll lead over to the 107 next pack so you never know jerry beans man has been giving us some incredible luck as of recent right on so our first booster pack and getting a super rare very nice the brotherhood of the firefist this uh the firefist deck as a hole when dragon rollers got well initially hit it was a its main competitor i would say was the fire fist deck yes spell books were in there too doing really well so there was a couple of decks there's a couple of decks never mind some decks out there that were they were keeping up with it a little bit but the dragon rulers as a whole was basically the best deck so everyone was gunning for that side decking everything for them it's a really powerful deck they were able to spam so many different exceeds and yeah it was pretty pretty crazy xyz double back oh blackwing no fall out of that pack that is a okay oh that is what is that the bacon saver what oh what on earth all right let's move over to our lord of the tao kion galaxy booster packs here as you can tell these are pretty classy they don't have the rip tabs or anything on it so you know that the packs are older when they're like that and they got the rip tabs you got the little jagged edges on top that's uh more of a recent thing that konami released making it a little bit easier for all the access the cards inside i mean either way it's not like it's too hard with the even with this so no fall out of there the little fairy all right on to our next pack let's see if we can get a cover card that would be epic i always love pulling the cover card no matter what it is it's always super exciting to me oh this is one of my favorite mecha fan to be so you summon it you get a token and then you can ship it off the token when you're attacking and it gains 800 attacks really really awesome a little fairy again no fallout of that booster pack that is all right let's move over to our title tin over there that was one of the ones that they had some of the mermail decks ran back in the day really cool and the tint itself is just absolutely beautiful looking i'm definitely going to hold on to one of each of these tins and add it to my pile of tins one of these days i've been mentioning this in videos whenever we open a 10. one of these days i'm going to figure out something to do with all these empty tins that i have i think they're really cool i don't i want to display them in a way and i think that would be neat maybe i'll uh record it just a little clip she'll show all of you once i figure it out i don't know what i want to do yet [Music] yeah so far oh that is beautiful yeah so these problem the problem packs were i believe the title and the and the blaster ones were a little bit better because i mean you got the title obviously which is really good all the dragon rulers are good so that kind of negates the rest of the promos here so you've got a black luster soldier that catasta which was the big one super dreadnought real kind of gustav max ran that in um my mecha fantaby stack and then you have bear here which was a really big card that was and the ultimate rare was getting really really expensive when the deck first came out that's why they gave it a reprint so he got some really good promos in in here a little bit better than the other ones i would say oh that's neat so you have a lord of the tao kion galaxy two of those oh two abyss rising booster packs and then the hidden arsenal seven wow man how many years has it been since i've opened up a hidden arsenal seven pack wow that's a little treat for me so the abyss rising set was the basically the big set that came out i would say was really featuring the mermails and this is like this was big and then the bit and then you got that abyss to use and a later set so that's pretty cool maybe we'll pull a mermail out of here mermail foil let's see pull a megaloo would be cool that was a definitely one of the big big key ones what is snow dust giant that's really cool it uh reminds me of one of the bosses in boulder's gate i don't know if any of you guys ever played that game i think they just came out with a new one but it was old back in the day and me my buddy paul actually played that game a lot it reminds me of that okay memory loss all right and what are the baby dragons this is the ones that they ended up banning originally so before they actually hit the big dragons they banned all the little ones and then they just kept the big ones at three and then what did they do the next one they limited them to two and then they just ended up they started just banning the dragon rulers as a whole so they realized that they were a little bit too powerful for their time oh another battle and boxer very nice another one oh what are the odds of that deployed a rare redox out of here that'll go along with our secret one that is too awesome yeah so you can pull all the dragon rollers in here as well and you get the foil one so right on so we ended up actually having two redoxes all right so now we have the hidden arsenal seven that is a nice tree well that kind of spells the secret error because if they put the secret like that all right well that's all right we have the evil swarm bahamut and the evil swords i love that deck it was like a anti-meta deck really really yeah the constellars and the evil sworns those were two uh big decks against the dragon rulers as well i forgot about that yeah because uh the evil swords able to put their big boss monster preventing special summons at level five or higher monsters then constellars are just a really good control deck able to like basically bounce cards from the field back to their hand and whatnot so really cool all right so let's move over to our blaster dragon ruler of inferno's tin here let's go and pop this thing open and see what's inside of these classic booster packs and see what we can get there it is i don't know which one my favorite dragon ruler is i don't know what yours is comment down below your favorite dragon ruler i'm gonna that's a tough one maybe blaster is my favorite hmm not totally sure i think so i'm gonna say blatcher's my favorite dragon ruler yeah there they all are all four of the dragon rollers who have been assembled now you got gaga cowboy here which is always a big staple card this one was getting really expensive as well so these reprints back in the day were really really key for the game because they're just getting some of these cards are just getting outrageously expensive for a while all right so let's see the booster packs are different in here uh lord of the talking galaxy two of those two abyss rising and a hidden arsenal seven nope exactly the same that's nice i believe we opened up some of these i mean years ago and we didn't get hit in arsenal seven at least i don't remember it it has been years so let's go and see or we could have our abyss rising maybe we'll get a hollow mermail out of here we can obviously get one ultimate rare as well which would be absolutely insane not slushy that's one of my favorite cards i love the way this thing looks and we got some madolche love oh my gosh if you have ever played madolche's i've played against it and it is terrifying to play against madolche at least for me i don't know if that deck could build a combo off with just like one card terrifying oh my goodness i have lost some serious games against it but i've won some too oh nice this is actually there there was a lot of people that are running into that one in the mermail deck oh right on so we ended up getting a noble knight of our superheroes i have mentioned this before in one of our previous videos how i'm surprised i never played it because i really love equipment cards this whole deck is based around and also this looks like a super fun deck to play i don't know why i never got into i mean the arch of the cards look insane as well i don't know maybe i should go pick up noble knights and play it for fun that would be cool i never played the deck and i don't know why again i just love i love equipment i built dexter's literally with united stand mage power actually despairs i mean i played those decks for years they were my favorite so i don't know why i don't play a duck it's literally based around uh equipment so we have the big whale here xyz block another glass down our third one the king of feral imps that was a car that was getting played in the performapal deck all right move over to our last lord of the talcion galaxy booster pack oh my gosh let's see what we'll get out of here maybe we'll uh getting those elusive foils out of here a little bit more battle in boxers the shark fortress very nice and oh right we got a totem bird secret rare nice this one is uh oh my gosh what was it uh was it magispectors yes this was a xyz that the magispector deck ran oh my gosh i love the magispector deck if you haven't played that one that was like a good combination of like a control antimatter edge deck but you have like the pendulum ability that deck is so much fun it's probably one of my funnest probably one of the funnest combo decks i've ever played it's not even like a super combo deck so it's good it's like if you're getting into like wanting to play a little more competitively like get into combos that deck is like the perfect deck for you and what a awesome card so our last booster pack there we ended up getting a secret rare totem bird right on gosh i love this xyz because we such fond memories of playing the magispector deck i even put it into ycs had a lot of fun with it oh my gosh that's great all right we have our last booster pack here so i'm gonna try to not spoil the fun because it was secret was the first card there we go that's a little better okay i got the constellars gem knight i never play the gem knight deck but it looks like a lot of fun as well another gemini and oh nice look at the castellar plemedes i believe this is like the big staple card for the cellar deck uh once per turn during the damage step on either player's turn when a castellar monster you control is attacked or being attacked you can detach one exorcism material from this card that monster gains a thousand attacks that was not it it was another one what was the other one called it was like you you detach and then uh just basically like compulsive monster on the field to the owner's hand that's what i was thinking of that is yeah so that's what made that deck super super scary so let's do a little a little recap here of all of our foils that we ended up getting out of these epic tins that was a lot of fun man i think i need to go and open up more of these dragon ruler tins so i'll try maybe i'll try again later on this year do that again because i i really enjoyed this it was really neat so there's our foils from that and we had so yeah i'm going to try to go and track down that link so you guys if you want to get the gold ones they're that they're pretty neat and then you obviously have the oh what did i do here put the thing upside down yeah go me all right so that's live for the sky dragon here i like these ones a little bit more because the box matches the the god card so i mean you got the you got slicer there which is you know obviously the red one you got the yellow one here for the wing dragon of raw and then you have my favorite which is obelisk the tormentor which is coming up right there so those are beautiful i'm going to try to find that i'll go through my emails and uh go try to find a link to the actual website so you don't have to go through target i don't even know how i did it literally typed in yu-gi-oh target i was just scrolling down and then these popped up so that's how i got these

"4Qgghhau-5Y": "hey guys what's up welcome back to my channel today i am so so excited to be filming this video pharmacy has now launched some eyeshadow palettes they had a huge launch on december 1st we actually had a surprise launch and as i'm sure you guys can see by the title we launched our 24 karat gold collection you will see right here that there are two pieces to this collection we have the 24 karat gold palette here look how stunning that packaging is it's got a really pretty window where you can see the name of it this is a six shade eyeshadow palette and then we also have our 24 karat gold this is our lipstick set oh my gosh this packaging is just absolutely stunning so we're going to go through all the things we're going to swatch everything for you guys we're also going to play with the eyeshadows put on a lip color have a little bit of fun i'll kind of give you guys my thoughts i will give you all the information that you need everything in the description box as far as a link to purchase other information where you can follow me on social media and all that stuff so let's just go ahead and get started i'm so excited so this 24 karat gold palette here like i said before has six shades in it i did already swatch these because i received these in the mail um this morning or this afternoon and i really could not i could not wait so this is what the shades look like inside like i said it is a six shade palette and it is really nice because it does have a mirror there so you will see those there and it looks like from swatching and kind of touching everything earlier there's um one matte satin and then four kind of shimmer shades if that makes sense so i will go ahead and swatch these real life for you guys so this is the shade base this is kind of the cream color here so swatches pretty well actually for a white and they're so creamy this is a shade bronze the shade next to it i'll kind of do it this way that's the shade bronze there and then we have the shade star dust after that sorry i'm trying to make these straight and i'm not succeeding that is that is stardust over here and then we have gold golden flash which i'll put next to this cream one here oh my gosh that is such a stunning gold color and then we have gold digger i love these shade names they're so much fun this one is a really interesting color because it's kind of like a mustardy shade i just think that's so pretty for all over the lid and then i'm really excited that they gave us a black in this palette this is called space noir i will swatch this one on the side here this is actually pretty pigmented for a black that is just one swipe and then a couple swipes on my hand there so those are the six shades in that palette so we're going to go ahead and play with that and then really quickly here i will show you guys the lipstick so it comes in this cute little box it's got a flip top and then it reveals it's got a little set here and then it has our um gold packaging our lipsticks are normally packaged in black so this 24 karat gold packaging is just so stunning so there's three shades this one is richie purple and let me see here oh my gosh i cannot wait to put the shade on my lips you guys look at how pretty that is it's like such a fun eggplant purple so that's richie purple and then we have royal red everyone loves a great red during christmas time oh my gosh seriously the best these are so so creamy you guys so that's royal red and then we have a royal nude so i love that they gave us a really fun color a traditional red and then of course a nude that you can wear pretty much every day these colors of course you can wear past christmas time it's just a really fun collection for the holiday season so there's though they there is those they glide on like a dream this cute little box is so stunning this you can only get in a set you cannot get these lipsticks individually so really quickly here i'm going to apply some eyeshadow primer and then we are going to jump right in to the eyeshadows all right you guys so we are all prepped and primed on my left eye here i kind of want to take you guys through a tutorial just on one eye and then i'll do the other eye off camera and we will try some lipstick swatches we keep that way we keep this video nice short and sweet now of course just like the palette suggests or maybe they did on purpose maybe they didn't we're going to start in the shade base here this eyeshadow primer of course is a little bit sticky and we want to make sure we set a nice powder base down to go in those shades with and i did take that eyeshadow primer all the way up to my brow i like having a nice clean slate to do some um some eye shadows on so i'm just going to go ahead and really quickly dust that on just to kind of help these shadows glide smoothly so we are actually going to go in with bronze here the second shade we're going to put that in our crease i'm using the same brush i used to apply base with and this is going to be a perfect transition shade and all i'm doing is just making really quick windshield wiper motions back and forth to get this in the crease oh my gosh these shadows are so pigmented and they are blending buttery smooth so far of course i've only tried two shades but i cannot wait to dig into those other eyeshadow palettes we knew about the three that were coming we did not know about this collection this was a complete surprise and we are so excited and i think i said before this is a limited edition so i think once these are gone they are gone for good these are not coming back so that lipstick set is a really really great gift the same thing with the palette already is in stunning packaging all you need to do is just wrap it in tissue paper some colorful wrapping paper and you are good to go so so pretty okay so i just sweep that all through my crease just nice and blended out and nice and smooth and we're just going to do kind of a really traditional holiday smokey eye i'm going to add a little bit more bronze towards the outer corner here and then whatever i have left i'm just taking it into my crease so you can see i'm just really moving that motion back and forth right in that socket okay so now we are going to go into the space new r which is the black in the corner here i'm actually going to use the exact same brush that i was using and as you guys can see i just have brows on i don't have any foundation because i wanted to be able to kind of be free with these shadows and blow them out as much as i wanted to and then i can go back and clean that up and it is also like nine o'clock at night i couldn't help i wanted to film with these so i probably won't be putting the rest of my base on but if you're working with shadows you've never worked with before not sure about fallout you can always do your eyes first and then do your base last now this black is blending out so smooth i've had so many issues with black shades in the past just blending out patchy not blending well once they sit down they're like i'm not moving anywhere so i'm really just kind of tapping that black into the corner and then whatever i have left on my brush i'm just kind of doing little circular motions the key with eye shadows is to hold your eye shadow brush down at the end you actually get more control with that than if you hold it really really tight up to the bristles there which sounds counterintuitive but i promise you it is not so i'm just packing more color on we really want this outer corner super deep for that really nice smoky effect and then just taking whatever i have left and kind of dusting that into the crease just a little bit we don't want that black to go in too too far and then i think we're going to go kind of traditional christmas here and play with this gold shade that we have golden flash i think this black and this golden flash would also make a really stunning halo eye these shadows are just blending out like a dream you guys especially if you're a beginner and you're a little bit afraid of eye shadows this would be a great palette to grab of course these shades are pretty neutral and you can use them any time you know that's not the holiday season so that is nice and blended i think everything looks really seamless there i really love that what i'm actually going to do now is i'm actually going to take my index finger i'm going to use golden flash here and actually use this to apply it on the rest of the lid i find that most of the time shimmer shades are going to apply better with your finger than they do with the brush if you are going to apply them with a brush you can always spray the brush with a little bit of setting spray because that will help intensify that shimmer shade that you have going on i also don't necessarily want to be super precise with this i just kind of want to lay it all over my lid and just make sure that i am kind of really nice and sparkly a little bit blown out i don't mind it being kind of all over the place so to speak and we can always go back in and touch things up i want to lay down as much color as i can first and then once you start blending actually some of that pigment will go away so we'll go back to that same we're actually going to use a clean blending brush because that same blending brush has the black on it and we're just going to lightly dust the crease to kind of blend those two colors together you can take a little bit of golden flash and kind of just blend that into the crease make sure they coincide together and then we're going to go back to that brush that has the black on it and kind of blend those lines making sure that they look nice and blended we want to not be able to tell where the black starts and where the black ends and the yellow starts we kind of want that to be a really seamless spot there you don't want just a blatant edge so sometimes you have to go back and forth a little bit between the two colors kind of really dust it make sure they're nice and friendly with each other you can always go back in with your finger as well this golden shade is so pretty especially if you have darker eyes like i do these warm tone shades these sparkly shades are so pretty for dark eyes just going to go back in with that brush that we have done the black and just kind of dust a little bit of that away and sometimes it's a little bit of a back and forth process and that's okay oh my gosh so pretty and that's it you guys the next thing i would do with this look is to give it a nice winged liner apply some falsies but like i said before it is nine o'clock at night i just wanted to kind of play with the palette show you guys how it performed do some swatches for you um i'm gonna go ahead and do this other eye off camera that way we're kind of symmetry here and then i'll throw some mascara on and we'll do some lip swatches so i'll be right back all righty you guys other eye is done i put some winged liner on and some mascara popped on just so you guys can see what a full eye look would look together i just think that these colors were so blendable it's such a travel friendly palette you guys it's got that mirror it's just that is a great palette if you don't like bigger palettes if you just want a couple colors to work with they're all pretty neutral in my opinion easy to use so i'm really happy with the way that it turned out i can't wait to play with some more colors but now we are going to play with some real life lip swatches i want to end on the red shade just because i really love myself a good red lipstick so i'm going to start with the nude then we'll go into the purple and then we will end with the red i'm going to go ahead and speed these up for you guys that way we're not here for a half an hour tonight okay so here we go [Music] [Music] all right you guys so the nude color is on i just love the way that it applied this formula is so so creamy these colors were curated so that they would look good on every single skin tone so i would love to see all types of skin tones rocking these colors this nude is perfect for just everyday wear throw on add a little bit of color to your look nothing too crazy really comfortable to wear doesn't feel like i'm wearing anything very soft formula really enjoying it we are going to go ahead and move on to the royal purple shade [Music] [Music] oh [Music] all right you guys so the royal purple is on i don't know if you guys can tell on camera you probably can't but this purple actually has little flakes of gold in it which is not super noticeable it's not like a really sparkly heavy it's just because i have a ring light in front of me as i was applying it i could just see these little flecks of gold in here and it's just like a really subtle but fun touch and i just think that is so stunning i would say with this lipstick i would probably want to use a lip liner with it um darker colors like this are kind of hard to apply just kind of willy-nilly they do tend to slip inside a little bit especially when you don't have foundation on so just keep that in mind you may want to use just a um nude lip liner or if you have a darker purple it might just be helpful to kind of slap that on first but overall i think it is a stunning color in person it's like a really rich eggplant shade and i just think it's super pretty so i'm going to take the shade off and we are going to move on to our final shade which is royal red [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right you guys so the royal red is applied and i just love love love a good red shade i told you guys that before earlier in my video i would say that this red is 100 like a really true red it has a nice blue undertone to it there's no kind of orangey shades or anything it's a really true red that i really super love i think it's going to be great for the holidays but it's great for any time of the year a very comfortable formula to wear super pigmented just glides right on super easy to use i was able to get kind of more of a better edge with the red shade but still probably with this i'd want to use a lip liner especially if you have fuller lips it can sometimes bleed over the edges anything like that so just keep that in mind with those brighter shades you might want to have a lip liner on hand to use but a hundred percent not necessary you can clean up those edges and really get it just the way that you want it so those are the live lipstick swatches and i really hope you guys enjoyed this

anyway I have a review to do for you guys on a Korean skincare face mask the Laguna Moon has the Laguna Moon has sent me this product to test out for you guys so I've actually been using it for a couple of weeks and I have some pros and cons to using this face mask so the first thing you want to do before applying this 24k face mask is completely washing your face cleansing it you know what a scrub brush these are some of my favorite items right here to use which is soap glory and the spin brush for your face is actually a great exfoliator and then after you do that you want to dry your face and then come back a width of the Laguna Moon 24k facial mask now this facial mask is supposed to instantly smooth the skin of wrinkles and skin regeneration it's also supposed to give you a radiant glow and locks in moisture for ultra hydration skin it helps improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles for a more youthful collection also a great day as you can tell from the back of the bottle it says that is not tested on animals and that you could keep this for six months shelf life okay now that goes beyond suggested usage but which is what I just told you was to rinse your skin and put the mass right over your face in a generous amount and then you're supposed to leave it for 15 to 20 minutes now when you're doing that you could go ahead and I don't know which legs read a book watch a movie but I will mention that it did not dry completely so wait you're applying this all over your skin you do not have to worry about it being on your eyebrows because it's not a peel-off mask it's a wash off mask so you can feel free to put this on your eyebrows and not have to worry because you're gonna wash it off you're not gonna peel it off so with that being said after about 15 or 20 minutes of you doing whatever you would like to do then you're gonna come back with a warm water and try and rinse your face and I say try because I had a really hard time washing this product up it kind of gave me more of a slimy feel so what I suggest that you do is a rinse off your face as best as you can and then come back with a warm cloth and wipe off the rest of the product over the seat and then rinse your face again now after I was done applying the mask and had it on for about 15 to 20 minutes this is what my skin looks like afterwards I did it did feel soft and ain't got no wrinkle so I can tell you that my wrinkles is going to ready so if you ladies have any type of wrinkles and you're interested in using this the link is down below if you want to try it other than that that's the only con that I had about this product is that it it was very hard to wash off so maybe it was supposed to do that maybe I buy too much might have been the case okay so it does come with a applicator thing I went in as you can see straight with my fingers I mean it didn't matter you can use your fingers whatever so after I was done washing my face and cleansing it with the face mask I went ahead with my favorite moisturizer which is by soap & Glory and I'm using their nightly rejuvenating mask or nut mask the moisturizer as well as some puffy aye-aye sir and applying that all over my face and dabbing it just underneath the eyes and then after that I'm going to bed to wake up looking nice refet refresh radiant and youthful looking because of everything I used last night [Laughter] so if you guys are interested in this product the link is down below if you have any questions go ahead and leave that down below make sure you subscribe give me a thumbs up leave your comment down below and until next time see you in the next video you", "8TRAmEOzJAk": "hey guys welcome to this week's WTF and the very first WTF of 2017 so we're going to kick off the year with crazy expensive skincare I'm really excited to try this out you guys actually were the ones that told me about this product I then wouldn't ordered it it took a few weeks to come in but we are playing around with the Mimi loos on skin well-being secrets 24 karat pure gold treatment I'm so excited I have the Box open in front of me but I haven't actually opened the product itself you get a separate packet right here that houses the actual 24 karat gold sheets I'm really excited to use this because we all know that I love me some gold on my skin I love the space it really does lift your skin and firm your skin and that is similar to the claims that this mask says that it does is going to lift and add radiance and make your wrinkles disappear and do all of these wonderful things the kit is $300 which is crazy steep which is why this is a WTF item but you do get four treatments if that helps you to justify the price a little bit maybe I think for a special occasion if this works and does something incredible then maybe it would be worth the splurge because that is going to be less than going to a spa and doing for facials that's kind of what I think in my head and then also the corrective anti-wrinkle masks that you get you're supposed to put on before you put the gold leaf on your face is something that I think you'll have left over and you'll be able to squeeze maybe a few more masks out of this bottle decent sized bottle here's something that I noticed when I was reading the ingredients is that all of the really intense good for your skin ingredients are up at the top in the ingredient listing which I love yes the first ingredient is water which sometimes makes you go oh great I'm paying all this money for water awesome but the second ingredient in here is the hexapeptide 8 which is their ingredient that is said to plump the skin firm the skin make wrinkles disappear do all these great things and then it goes on to list a lot of awesome ingredients you get apricot kernel oil jojoba oil coenzyme q10 you get red tea extract chamomile extract you get lipids and just different flower extracts this looks like some that I am into I like the ingredients on here so this alone is like really catching my attention but of course I am excited just to put the gold leaf on my face and see if it does anything that will give me like an immediate wow factor so let's just dive right in and go for it and put this mask on you do leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes so let's get started this is an item right here you guys I don't know why I always spaced on putting this in a favourites but they are fuzzy bobby pins oh my gosh I got them at a beauty supply and they have changed my life they are the best bobby pins I have ever ever used if you come across a pair of fuzzy bobby pins I'm try and find them on Amazon for you but oh yeah they just like I can do my whole hair up with just two of them BAM okay what this says to do is put a thin layer on your skin and massage it in so let's start there okay smells really fresh and it feels just like a moisturizer so I'm going to put this on my skin like I would any of my moisturizers use circular motions because it does say to massage it into the skin and then it says to apply another layer and keep it a little bit wet like an another layer that you're not going to so much massage in but just keep on the top of the skin i guess i always rub whatever excess i have like if there's any drop of product i never wasted i either you know put it on the neck my hands my arms i even do that with a little like single sheet masks i will actually dip my hand in there i do not waste just so you know that's like my little mask hack okay it says to use three leaves for treatment do not touch your hands directly on the gold leaf only touch the silk paper wow oh my god am i supposed to just like stick this on my face on top of the corrective mask put gently the gold leaf one for each cheek cut one with scissors and put half on the forehead and one over the chin oh my god why do I feel like I'm about to screw this up in such a big way it's just what you do Oh oh my god it's beautiful holy Sh what I'm not trying to get every last little thing on my face ohh oh my god as am i oh wow dude why am I so into this this is amazing but what about your nose I want my nervous the anti aged to just saying I need a little bit of a bigger piece for my forehead so I'm going to do like a 75 25 type of a thing here oh my god this is like the coolest thing ever I feel like very happy with my life right now I love this oh my god look at that big forehead seriously yes ah I love it okay so now what I'm supposed to do is chill out oh I don't want to like talking like crap this I wanted to be like full potential so I'm not going to talk too much okay hang out for 10 minutes and I'll be back to massage this off the things that are like you do to me don't pretend like you don't want to try this don't ah okay so here did you this is the first WTF of 2017 you want to be brand freakin brand new me me lose all skin well-being secrets yeah we've already been over that am i late you're late to the party I corrective anti-wrinkle mass here you you know what it smells like hmm I don't know that twice this ask yeah okay so my massage some enemy then we put another layer that the mask is actually gonna like stick to okay I try my best cool is not me this highlight is on this week wait this is everything okay oh yeah this is everything so how expensive is that $300 no way for treatment arrow or horse sheets I'm not going to cut up another one because you don't need it and I need it more oh I don't deserve it but I can't put it here so I'm just going to put this little bit more on forehead or do you really want more morris more oh well how many sheets did you get you get three per treatment I get 12 okay one more it's got good stuff in it just like $25 a sheet and you just put two sheets on my face so that's $50 more that's true love when you will share your goods yeah you want more yes is that like gold so that means that like his 24 karat gold so it wouldn't be better like put that on a piece of jewelry or something instead of your face your face is jewelry all right is there any difference between edible gold and gold coal oh I would have to google that so what do we do now now you have to hang out with me for 10 minutes okay [Music] don't touch it don't touch it there oh my god James you just you just oh my god you did $10 doesn't work you wanna look no no Michael why do you want to eat it recycle old dan dan dan dan dan no no no it's just you well you just watered all over it this is my nurse Jamie lip scrubber the good news is I can wash this and it's not going to grab any bacteria and I think the discount code is still working that I actually don't receive any commission on all right what don't aren't you supposed to feel like some stuff on yeah just put this on okay I think that's good make you look special you know it makes you looks really soft that's cool Todd you look so fancy you look fancy hmm I have an idea just that let's have like never mind in ten minutes you're sure yeah to take off the mask with your fingers and with the circular motion massage you did the skin wash off the leftovers finish the treatment with suitable cream and get the glow there's no country of origin on here maybe on this one it says made in the USA it's made in Florida I know why that's funny but it just is cuz it feels really like and granted off the shore of Florida coming up really easy as yours coming off easy yeah but I would have rather saved it you know like $75 I could be feel it all to my planet in the center all right this is getting a little bit messy for me so I'm gonna go to the sink why are people go to this game have definite opinion on this oh okay let's hear it my face feels a little bit tighter whoop-dee-doo there's a hundred products out there in the world that can do that um I think and this is just my uneducated opinion okay I think that the the secret sauce is actually the cream and the gold is a novelty I'm not impressed I would not waste my money on this again I would not I are like on this would um my face does feel really firm like really firm which I it also feels really hydrated so I can feel a difference um but I think you have a point there are other firming masks out there that probably don't take as much effort because you really do have to like do the mask and then lay the leaf down and not touch it and mess it up and it's a little bit of a treatment two-step kind of a thing there's an easier way to do this and firm the skin so I kind of agree with you a lot of people are like wasting resources I don't like the idea of wasting gold I mean like seriously we just that was $75 you know what that whole bottle cost $75 in the last year month I just put $75 it's going on my face I love you think you're okay with it only lasting a month this actually lasts me for like three or four nights okay but that's my point for and bigger Tonti and you're beautiful you're you and I should not be putting $75 gold on my face and ten minutes later washing it down the drain even if you have a special occasion I'm sure there are other products out there doing so your vote is No yeah my vote is no as well it was fun to try guys but I don't think it did anything so like ooh-ahh Wow to make me want to rush out and spend $300 on this system again I think I will continue the hunt for a really great firming mask you guys know that's a mission of mine that is not so expensive yes yes tell me in the comments below did you see a difference did you see a difference do you see a difference in my skin you look great you always look great you see difference in mine yep okay I'm just gonna blow a kiss me smile okay don't do anything weird with your hand deuces thank you all right guys so listen thanks for hanging out with us today we really appreciate it and thumbs up for James being a good sport I'm gonna talk to you bringing that into this video and thumbs up to 2017 we will see you in tomorrow's video actually you'll see ultimately you guys interest me alright thanks for watching don't buy this mess [Music]", "7DIXFA95x4M": "[Music]", "-rlK83nioQk": "hi guys okay so I did an unboxing and one of the products was the 24 karat gold buying new face and so I thought I'd give it a try this is the packaging it's actually quite lovely this is what the traditional primer looks like and this is a wash off primer this is a leave on primer so that you put this on you do your new face and you wash it off so I thought I'd give the 24 karat primer a try for a couple reasons one is it's a leave on and it's supposed to they have two different formulas one is for firming and the other is for brightening so I chose the firming hello I'm 50 and you think that firms that fits it's a good thing and I really like the packaging of this one you pull the bottom off the top the bottom of the top so it's up like this it's the bottom you took like this is add up you pull the top off and it has a brush on it which is really kind of cool and there's this it pulls up and down so it locks and unlocks and I'm gonna go ahead and do it I'm gonna I forgot it's gonna do this vlog and I was gonna show you and I left the new face little machine in the bathroom hey I'll be right back okay it actually helps if I'm gonna do this to actually you have the machine so here's the news this will be the second time that I try it the first time be perfectly honest I had a reaction to it right here near my lap line [Music] and then I did it a second time just on one side of my face so I'll show you the pictures of what happened with the reaction and then I did just one whole side of my face and then there was no reaction I mean there was a little bit of red but I get that just from the machine itself and using the traditional this is what the traditional primer anyway so you can see my camera there you go now I will say this seems to dry faster than the other and I'm not sure if that's just and I'm if that's just the you know the new formula or if it's just said because I'm putting it on with a brush I'm not putting on as much I'm not really sure and all if you're interested in how I use the new face I will at this point include the first vlog that I did on exactly how I use the new face all you do is leave the primer on it will fill a little tacky right now I'm gonna finish up both sides of my face we'll take a picture if there is you know I'll take a picture and let you see if there's any reaction this time around I've got a little Ric red here and a little red here that's kind of normal and even when I did the other one so I'm not too concerned old one or this one and I would wipe it off but with this one it just goes into the skin and that's the end of it how does it feel right now it's still a little tacky so you have to wait you know until it dries - then go ahead and put on your you know vitamin C and whatever else y'all use um and I'll see if and I'll take some pictures I'll take a picture right now and then I'll take a picture about 20 minutes and we'll see if it's gone I will tell you when I did break out and it took about 30 minutes and then it was gone so it wasn't anything that stayed for a long time you know keeping in try and you can see I'm not breaking out and this is this is normal and I have sensitive skin so you have to keep that in mind anyways I will check back with y'all bye [Music] okay y'all this is where we started three months ago and as you can see the new face machine certainly has lifted and tightened the jawline lifted and tightened the apple of the cheek as well as lifted the brow line it is also minimized the nasolabial folds so for me we know the machine works with regards to tightening and toning and lifting as far as the 24 karat gold primer the only reason that I am going to continue to use this product is that it does have anti-aging and firming benefits and if I'm gonna have to use a primer then I might as well use one that has skincare in it okay guys so final thoughts on the new face 24 karat gold primer first let me just tell you a little about both of them they're both two ounces this one's roughly $33 in this one's roughly 19 this is a stay on this is a wash off this just squeeze you just pop the top and squeeze it into your hand finger and rub it on your face this one has a brush applicator which is nice the consistency is the same as far as the gel with the exception of this actually has gold flecks you can see them in you know through here and when you put it on your skin you can actually see gold flecks in your skin so yay the biggest difference the biggest difference guys is the ingredients because you know how this packaging is pretty the applicator is cool but if it's doing nothing then who cares it's doing something because it's putting anti-aging products on your face and keeping them there the anti-aging ingredients are first it has hyaluronic acid peptides golden algae extracts then it has firming ingredients of dmae and alpha lipoic acid I'm probably not pronouncing that one right which is supposed to tighten and tone the skin okay I'm out 50 yay anything that tightens and tones anything that gives me that you know refreshed look is awesome I will tell you just I will probably always buy this I happen to have a new full bottle of the bottle of this so I'll probably alternate just to get rid of this there's nothing wrong with this guys but what it is is the main thing and this is water which sucks fine but basically you if you ran out of this you could use aloe vera gel or anything that is helping to glide the new face machine over your face that's what this is it's fine but it's not doing anything for your skin the machine is but it's nice to add the machine for the tightening and the lifting to now have a firming you know a primer that stays on your face so of course I'm gonna use it it's pretty easy to use and I like that there's skincare benefits to a primer and it's kind of doing two things at one time which is great so um I hope you enjoyed this video if you enjoy my reviews please go ahead and hit that subscribe button and I will follow up I I've only used this for 3 weeks I did post the pictures you know before and after pictures I would have liked to have used it longer before I did a review on it but I'm actually going to have microdermabrasion tomorrow and so I didn't think that would be fair for me to do that and then show you the results because I'm assuming that my face will look better fingers crossed after microdermabrasion so we'll see but I will continue to use this I don't really see a reason to necessarily do a follow-up unless you guys want one in another month um kind of hit it all I will say that I'll probably eventually down the road purchase their serums that they have and give those a try as well because I really do like what the new face has done for me and like I said I will put the link of how to use it in the video and I will put the link to the before and afters as well for y'all I've got mine off of QVC which I have mentioned several times I love QVC because you can try products and if you don't like them you send them back with new face they gave me a 90 day they didn't give it to me I bought it but they had a 90 day where you could try it out and that was awesome because I really got to see if it worked for me because you'll know if the products working in 90 days for sure I knew this product was working week one that was probably the most dramatic difference was week one and month one and now I think it's just a matter because I think it can only lift and tighten so much I did I really do um you know it's not I wish it was like oh yeah you got a whole face lift out of it it's not gonna happen hope you enjoyed this video if you like my reviews please go ahead and hit that subscribe button and that is my thoughts on the 24 karat gold a primer for a new face and I'll talk to you guys [Music]", "1RRISV_auIs": "[Music] hi guys it's mino welcome back um it is the morning after my red spirally comb wrecked crazy thing and i haven't been able to sleep very much because i keep thinking about doing it again so we're going to do it again right now this is the 20 by 20 gallery wrap canvas from michaels from artists loft okay so colors very simple golden's turquoise phthalo leaving a mound on a mound on a mound this one is decoart americana decor metallics in 24 karat gold mixed it pretty thick i want it to stay keep it shape i don't want it to blend into everything last one is uh liquitex basics bright aqua green and to that i have added a lot of the 24 karat gold sort of thinking about malibu that art mine's one that's discontinued but then it also seemed a little bright to me so i put a little bit of the decoart americana satin enamels and pure white in there too to lighten it up and that's like this really pretty pistachio sort of color i'm hoping it's sparkly because there's a lot of gold in there so i love the contrast between those two that's awesome with the black that's um artist buffalo acrylic in black last time i mixed my flow extender with just flow troll and i'm not going to do that again because when i put it in there to dry and i'm watching it you know you scrape the lip and you're making sure that it's you know drying and setting up but because it was only flow troll it just kept falling down and spreading out and it was driving me nuts so i am gonna put pouring medium in my float extender because i want it to set up and i want it to dry when i have it in there to dry i don't want it to keep spreading which drives me insane okay not that i'm not already insane but okay so we're not putting gold in the center i'm going to start off with some black sparkly i bet you that's the drips from the other night okay that's the drips from last night so that'll be the flow extender here's our artist's law flu acrylic black okay nice thick layer okay we're gonna go right into the turquoise thicker layer of that one and then a lighter layer smaller layer of the bright aqua green this takes over small layers of the bright aqua green okay small layer of gold and we're going to go back to the black nice thick layer so the other thing is i only want to put like 15 or 16 ounces of paint on that canvas and then i want to put a lot more flow extender than i normally do okay we're gonna do it again thick layer of turquoise smaller layer of the bright aqua green ish color and some 24 karat gold okay so this time i'm going to put another layer of turquoise on this end too okay so i'm back to the black nice thick thick layer of black okay all right so that's it [Laughter] i want this to work okay so it's the flow extender so we'll see what happens okay i'm gonna put a puddle of this ready there we go i'm gonna do a ring pour [Music] [Music] all right we're going to thin this out just a little bit maybe an ounce of paint or ounce of water and you want to stir it i know it looks like i stir things forever but i do stir things forever because you want to make sure your water is incorporated you don't want to have thick paint with like streaks of water going through it that's not good here we go always wants to go that way no matter how many times we level the table it's amazing here we go that's good oh that paint out spread this out real quick okay what's up i'm gonna wreck it okay [Music] okay so last time i kind of did this i'm going to use the thicker i kind of did a curve and then i kind of went up and then brought one end of it up so it ended on just one point and the part on the red one that i don't like is where i didn't do that i wasn't careful instead of coming to one point i kept going straight and i didn't like it so we're gonna curve and then come up to make it sort of like petals and i think i'm not going to do the whole thing i think i'm going to do like two and then leave some space and then two and leave some space so actually i think i want to leave that black space i'm going to go through here curve and then come to a point and i'm not going to dip my paper towel in it this time either which i also did okay curve and come to a point okay okay shove that back that way a little bit okay that's so cool i love it okay okay last one okay now last time i poured a little bit into the center and i'm gonna do that again so literally just taking what was in my cup i'm gonna put in a dot of turquoise just a tiny bit of gold and that's it that's probably half an ounce of paint right there and i'm gonna go right into the center to cover cover up that [Music] [Laughter] okay [Music] it's pretty let's torch it i've also learned don't turn the torch on right on top of the painting i don't know if you saw one of the last videos i turned it on and like this dust flew out of it so turn it on away see and turn it on [Music] all right let's do it ready now i'm okay with leaving some black negative space on here when i was watching the video for the red one i tilted off the two corners and it looked really cool and i was like hmm i could have just left it like that so we're going to go that way i don't want to go off the edge yet i'm going to take it down to the other side and stretch out that end here come back to the middle now we're going to go down off of this corner back down towards the middle again okay see how it went off the corners there so because it did that i am going to take this off the edge because otherwise it would have stuck in those two areas i'm just going to go down to the other end walk it down nice and slow you want me here [Music] all right i kind of like this with the negative space on there but we do need to take a little bit of this paint off so let's maybe try to get the end of the where the turquoise starts to about here and get that covered up and then we'll come back and see how it goes okay so where's the weight of the paint the way the paint is right there in the center we're just gonna walk it down and let that black go over the corner back to the middle just going to take that bottom edge down a little bit because bug no get out of here please thank you sorry okay okay i like it i'm not crazy about the very very defined edge on that center that we poured i mean it's kind of cool i'm going to go look at it from over there on the other side i think i just want to incorporate some of these lines it's not so sharp okay that's better just broke it up a little bit all right um i think that's it you think i should keep going or stop it like that [Music] i really like your left your left edge here yeah yeah this part's really cool i still want to take this back a little bit to open that up somewhere that's cool so okay let's torch it one more time i think we're done that looks like so this is what i was when i was saying that the flow troll made me mad yesterday when i mixed the base coat with it okay so usually when i scrape this edge like that i take it and i put it inside and then like half an hour later i check again and maybe i need to scrape it one more time and there's like a couple of drips and that's it then it stops dripping yesterday it dripped like eight times it was driving me crazy so pouring medium in my flow extender i'm good with that okay that's cool thanks for hanging out with me for this one indulging my i have to do it again but uh this is really cool so definitely want to play with this some more i'll show you want to try okay so this is a few days later and it's completely dry now this one is dream catcher i love how this turned out it's so cool this top section is definitely definitely my favorite beautiful depth sorry we're losing the sunlight beautiful lines in here so there was no white in this this one was that bright aqua green that i had mixed i did put a tiny bit of white in it but it was still green really pretty lines though [Music] so this was the [Music] another uh comb wrecked ring for like allegra but i left a lot more space in between and i didn't do the whole thing very cool cool stuff pretty center and that's black with the turquoise and the bright aqua green and it got like this blue from the turquoise and the green and the black mixing together very cool cool stuff so this one is dreamcatcher because it totally looks like that to me thanks for hanging out with me guys i will see you for the next one have a great day [Music] you", "kS50yeXSTUY": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi lovelies thought welcome to today's vigil today's vigil is going to be use and be a w7 24k gold rush palette 14 of the richest pressed pigments so I'm assuming all of my press pigments based on that and so it has like three different types of shadows it has the shadows on the back and they all have a number and so it has if I want two or three and then that corresponds to with the ingredients on which kind of shadow that it is it's like a matte is sort of metallic shimmer and a like glitter like this one gorgeous but anyway yeah it comes it's looks like this it comes with a brush so like that it's like the same stylus that Anastacio Beverly Hills ones but it is a lot smaller I was actually surprised how small it was when it came so yeah I would just like to say thank you to Kimberly from Kimberly's beauty box yeah on YouTube Shay currently bought this palette for me and I sent it my way and because I see it she uses rule to w7 palettes and I says I wanted to try one so she kindly got this forest because this one is just the one that I've wanted because it's kind of like a so a dupe of the in etosha to know my gold palette I think so yeah it is a neutral palette I know I'm not very like no one felt like like in neutrals well it is a very nice class think it's easier cool as that guys it's just a beautiful beautiful palette and I will do swatches in the next one so as I said it's got three types of different shadows it's got like this good I want which I'm well me in a corner here and then cause few of those good a shades the kind of like holy but it's not like fully if you know I mean like the ones that you have fun makeup revolution which the Fila wet this one feels like movable so it just makes any sense I feels like movable but it picks up on a brush really well which I really really love so I would like a whole palette of them please w7 it's like a glittery as just very very glowy and it's amazing that shadow is amazing and yeah they're just the glass the stick on well they pick up on a brush well is which I really really like because the makeup revolution ones are quite tricky to use like that's all file type put your this is really a fine it's literally like just a good it's just hard to explain but it's gorgeous it's absolutely gorgeous and so most of them the Browns are a little bit the brother the three Brown Matt a little bit similar but yeah I'm kind of so yeah I'm in love with me luck yeah thank you again to Kimberly she just loads of Facebook lives and different looks and eye makeup page and then she's got that Instagram which is really really good Instagram I'm never gonna Instagram but here Instagram is so good she does like loads of different looks and shades the queen of soft glam I'm crowning as queen of sauce I'm crowning to the queen of soft glam but it should also does like more out there adventurous looks as well so she's got like a mixture of everything and just saw that whatever and she's just lovely so please go and check her out and all this is not a collab anything but I just wanted to make sure that you all know how old me isn't she is because she did not have to buy me this and I'm so grateful and thankful that she did and it was just so nice of that and she's just a Julie Pierce and so it's going follow here and check her out and stuff because yeah that would be amazing but yeah basically we're come off the shadows I had no shows at all it was just it was a pleasure to use and I don't have any negatives so far about the palette I just say it's very nice it's likely as a series like the abh sort of layout but it's a lot smaller palette and it's got like the same policy as the Natasha 1009 gold palette which is the only one that's really interest but I will add do not have the money to pay for Natasha and an owner so hopefully I covered everything and that's basically it in the next clip we'll be the swatches and I'll try and do like a close-up of the palette and stuff so yeah anyway that's it enjoy you we're going to be used in the w7 24 karat gold rush or 2014 I'm sure Santa it's a 24k gold rush palette 14 of the richest pressed pigments and obviously as gold so these is what the shades look like I'm showing you again and I repeat myself in everything because I haven't filmed the intro yet so I just repeat myself and then I gotta film the intro and then repeat myself again so anyway this is what it looks like and we're not gonna talk too much about it but again I just want to see it thank you to Kimberly for kindly liftin may this palette and again all three of social medias like links will be down below so me first like a source and a look that I want to do is what these two colors but then I thought I don't want to go over the obvious option I want to kind of maybe do something neutral so I am gonna try and like a stick to the Browns and then I will do another look with these two right yet or have primed me eyelids with the revolution conceal into Spain concealer in se 0.5 as I always do and yeah I've just zoomed in so you can see what I'm doing a bit more I downloaded this app ordinem we form called open para maana has like this zoom in sync so if this is helpful then let us know or if it's scary then also let us know and if you don't want to do it anymore and I will but I don't think it's quite cool so you can actually like to see what I'm doing and I don't have to have the camera so close to any face because if I have to come round really close to me face it has like I don't know what like blues a little bit and I just tried to move that back so if I can zoom in on there and I don't have to have this camera to close any face because then it me exactly we blew everything and I don't like it so anyway just I'm gonna cover I'm just gonna get on with it so there's like three Browns that are pretty pretty similar and it just got like different tones ones move like a woman like this one it's more like a light room brown and this is more like a must study Brown and then this is just like a neutral Brown sort of deal and then you've got that dark brown which is definitely a point up for this palette because I hate neutral palettes I don't have like oh I just hate palettes I don't have a shade that I can't defend up the outer corner with and if you familiar with my channel then you will know that I need something that I can add a drama with so what should we do I think I'm going to take the shade millions which is I'm what I want to show you the right wheel but I don't want like I don't want to break it I don't know if this is going back or not I do not want to break it but yeah this one millions that's like that mustard to take color and I should have got all the brushes out but I see this every day but I never do so I'm just gonna take that and make it fluffy crease brush and I wouldn't put it in my crease I watched Angie's Angie from 4 FPS video on this as well a few weeks ago and she uploaded it in it it just she said it was really good so I'm looking forward to using it I've used one and w7 palette before and that was I can't remember what was called but it was like they the hood IBEW joke enough what was alright but like the matches and that just went like really medium the shemites felt quite nice but than me little cousin wanted it so I just thought I'd give it to her but it was alright but I said like if the mattes aren't like it didn't have a good deep that I could I could like add drama with look I said it was the tip of the hood at new nudes palette and that palette doesn't really have too much darkness to it either so so I wasn't like too much of a fan of that but this is pretty nice it's a lot more than yellow mustard tape Brown in your life I think on the camera to come off a bit more warm well it's pretty nice it's pigmented for what it is then done quite well I haven't put me a coupon for like we've been out for maybe two weeks I really wanted to film a video but I just have not had the energy and I haven't felt very well I don't know I just haven't felt like I haven't felt like myself I felt a bit like I don't know it's hard to explain I just haven't felt right but when do I not to be honest so that is pretty pretty nice I'm pretty happy offer so yeah actually it's nice it blended out really well it's nicely pigmented it's not even seen but it's just basically a transition class in it so as long as it does what I need it to do it's not gonna be like the main focus of the look so now I want to take that dark brown which is called wealthy this one and I'm going to put that in the outer corner yeah I'm just gonna put that in the outer corner that's pretty nice because when you do like neutral looks like this when I don't need to look in the shadows that I'm using I want them to be able to build on top of each other a lot of like the pressed pigment palette in that when you do collector looks and you want to add like drama a lot of like the time if they're like the pressed pigment is too dry then they don't build upon each other very well so yeah I like to be able to build shadows on top of each other and this looks so good we've been very well and we'll go in with a different brush and like blend it out maybe I'll try with the brush that comes with it maybe we'll try out I know that in a minute so yeah I've got makeup on and a while I just haven't felt myself and I've wanted to do it but like actually finding the energy is just really just really hard but like if I had just got up and done it instead procrastinating about filming it for like I was and then never doing it because I'm too tired by the time I just talked myself out was it I don't know yeah but I think I'm doing it now and I really want to do Warlocks I've got so many like ideas on your head but yeah I just have not even like the thing is with videos like I really want to film them like any head book of the time I just really don't want to talk and that's the thing like when I don't film videos as I said I want to put me home and come on I talked like that well in my head I want to put a make on but like I don't want to put makeup on my face because my allergies are just annoying and let me eyes get  and it's just very irritating I don't really want to use that brush I'm gonna funny go back and forth with that million shared and the brown just to get the outer corner how am I gonna how I want it so I really technical it's just music basic makeup application but it's looking pretty nice so far they're very soft and very very blendable there's just like literally no issues very nice and also I just realized that I never actually thanked ears for 1000 subscribers although I have 1000 subscribers and I can't monetize my channel yet because you have to have a voice not for 4000 watch minutes and I don't currently have that I have 2784 or something so we've still got a while ago but yeah and also if yes actually do follow us on here and he's he's like me Channel and stuff and he's one of followers on the integer gram if you not already then the Instagram is always listed below so Google's our follow on that and if you do enjoy watching my videos and you haven't subscribed yet then please do it because it says a lot of the people that watch my videos on subscribe to a channel I don't know if you just do that because you just won't have an account or whatever and it's really annoying because if you look like one of the eyes is like we more hooded than the other eye so this is me of like a fully down like look how I did this one is compare this one this one that also smaller so getting them right like to look Samar it's just very hard it's a skill I have not yet perfected so now I want to take the revolution conceal and define concealer just a little bit and then when it came to do it cook crease but not like a soft a vision of a half-cup grease just so the lid seeds have something to stick to so I'm not gonna do like a proper coat just as a cook crease but it doesn't have to be too precise a that makes anybody sense but I need to own the air can't see I can't see what I'm doing I'll see calm put my glasses on and pop makeup on at the same time and that eye is just right if I shut that and try to do that it does not say any detail it just says like blogs you so I'm just taking a tiny bit of Thor's too much it together but merely the late I want I keep messing up but you know it's not like huge message was just in my head I got to inside me old had numbers like need to have like me protectionist aside just like take a step back but anyway just like salt blend that in a bit more I definitely definitely want to use this shade like initiate it's just luck its literal gonna talk it's like literally like just look at that sparkle look a lot like I definitely want that I don't know if I just wanted by itself because I really like the look of these two as well like this one and this one so I think but then once I gone as glittery no not that one these ones I aren't is glittery so I might put one of those on well that is to be honest that one is more glaring so these are the ones that I'm thinking this is the one I want and so I think that I'm going to put this one on a sec I sort of just recently out of obese and then I can pack that on top of it just to make it look a bit more thank you because this one has more khalaqtu weight if you know what I mean and so like have a more even based as it shadow on the lid and then if I go over with this one so the fish it I'm takin is the Jade billion which is that middle shade it's like just a shimmer you so it's not like an intention I take it sort of soft shilla I don't want my job rush it's not doing what I wanted to do you yeah that's pretty nice that's like a sort of more subtle deal without I want to take that and this she'd it's kind of like one of those movable shades like the was putting shades and it's called golden boy and I'm just going to tape that on my finger and then it's gonna put it on top can you say oh I don't know if I should add like a glitter glue go it and then pack it on so I want to take like a tiny bit of the NYX glitter glue and just like it's so much more like a yellow like golden this instead of what you and the camera got yeah it's very pretty you it is absolutely gorgeous that she's like a so gorgeous it is like a lot more yellow on this can you see how I know I don't have the best camera in the world well I keep pressing stop instead of like start like a pause when I pause the video I keep pressing like this actual stop record and instead of like and we start the video it's gorgeous and I love that I picked up on the brush because like those and put me like a foil tape shadows that makeup revolution in that do they don't pick up on the brush very well and you have to like work very hard where this one picks up really well it's just gorgeous it's absolutely stunning like look at that and it can sure you probably it's literally like let out in a shadow and I'm glad that I put that piece down this one just sort house like that extra like bit of color to it absolutely gorgeous so yeah definitely use some really a glow with it as well because it looks even more intense and absolutely just think it looks lovely I would say I'm just gonna add like a align without the wing but you know hopefully I can like that that's what I wanted but the only thing is with this I could never get the app heart to look good look good without a wing so I'm gonna take a bit more that dark shadow and they're sort of crying added to the outer part of that shadow to try it I mean that Lena just to make it a bit more like smooth I don't know what just never looks right to me like just that just Lena just stop it what I might do is just take a black from a different palette and just basically just literally tap it on the outside just add a tiny bit more drama until I blend this sort of edge let's just talk it to the next slide all love it that just tiny but a black just added something like look at the difference clean that up me it's like this is I that I've cleaned up in this one it's just like so I'm taking the shade what's that called wealthy which is the dark brown that I'm just packing that on little eyelash light then I'm taking the lightest color called millions and I'm just blowing them out and I've give up like you can never ever if you wear glitter on your eyelid like you can guarantee that it will be on the rest of your face so I just give up try to get all the little bit in pieces so then I'm gonna go back in with the brown then I want to take the revolution a pro pigment pomade in black I'm gonna put that any water laid then I'm going to take a matte black shadow and I'm just using the one out with the black as a no black palette and it's just a month and I'm going to place that closest to me lower lash laid so then I'm gonna take a bit of the next black blue because this doesn't have like a shimmer shade for the inner corner I'm just gonna take a bit of this ugly we'll just place it in the other corner and sort of like bringing it on to the other half of you know a nice play now what it is a gorgeous shadow yeah and it's just called what I said Goldie it's basically it looks like white but it hasn't really got a lot of white pigment it's just basically like very light gold glass maybe even say that what is absolutely stunning like so that is the lower lash line I'm going to go off and do the rest of me face and then I come and look this is the finished look for the eyes I'll zoom to write in hasn't that something in me I think is this a shadow huh but it's come off a little bit here because it's I've been out I had to go shopping with me Mom so if I'm looking a bit windswept and that is why so yeah this is the finished look overall I really truly like I love this look it's like so sparkly and nice I hope that the sparkle is coming up well so yeah we had a bit windswept I was gonna have it with me friend I'll put that out when I'm going out new friendships get anyway and I guess Comenius so this is luck and I really like it and I hope that you like it too but basically I just wanted to show you the final look I was going to do lashes but I'm not going to because my eyes are already irritated I'll do lashes in the next look I would if I was only doing this look and then taken off I would apply I would have applied lashes but because I need to I'm going to keep it on for the rest of the day and I'm gonna have to wear my glasses and then lashes just like  against me glasses and just I know you in a Cell yeah see if you liked this video give a thumbs up if you like me to subscribe and turn on your

"6c1GZ33xV7s": "Gold purity can vary, and the potential value of your precious metals portfolio could be significantly impacted by the purity of the gold coins within it. \u201cKaratage\u201d refers to the purity of gold, such as 18 karat. Fineness expresses the precious metal content of gold in parts per thousand. For instance, the number 750 indicates 75% gold content, which translates to 18 karat. Gold of this purity is generally reserved for jewelry. 22 karat gold has a fineness of 91.7%, and 24 karat is the purest gold you can buy, with a fineness of 99.99%. The 22k Gold American Eagle Coin is one of the top selling gold bullion coins in the United States. It is designated as official legal tender, meaning the federal government backs its gold content, weight, and purity. It's also the only 22k gold coin authorized by the IRS for inclusion in a Self-Directed IRA. The 24k Gold American Buffalo Coin is another fine example of American coinage. Introduced in 2006, it's the nation's first-ever 24k gold coin and is also authorized U.S. legal tender. The Gold American Buffalo Coin takes its inspiration from one of the most recognizable designs ever struck by the U.S. Mint. As you might imagine, since 24k gold coins are made of pure gold, their prices tend to be higher than 22k gold coins. Certified gold coin prices can also vary based on a coin's grade, condition, and availability. So, why buy gold coins instead of gold jewelry? Coins and bars can be easier to sell than gold jewelry mainly because their purity and fineness are simpler to determine. Bullion coins and bars could sell closer to the spot price of gold than jewelry. And some would argue that the coin and bar pricing is more objective and consistent than jewelry, since fashion, added gemstones, and the history of a particular piece of jewelry could have a significant impact on its price. The bottom line is that coins can be one of the best ways for asset holders to buy gold, because they're highly liquid and easy to sell or trade.

I'm gonna go in one more time and watch my face even though my face feel clean I want to make sure I really like the products I mean is it one more time and the next step is going to be the mythology 24 gold toner looks like this and it's in a wrapper so I gotta take it all and it has like little sprinkles of gold in the liquid I like that that's cute I love the packaging well thought-out Oh hold on I need a cotton around for this because look if it doesn't squirt it pours out so let me get a cotton round okay so I got back our ground [Music] oh okay it was a little thing that just popped off okay okay I'm understanding it and I guess I can just oh it's well it's a thick liquid holdup how to get it off the bottle I guess you can just shake it it's really hard and difficult to get it out I think I think that'll be enough but it's hard to get it out okay you can see the gold on the cotton round has the same scent NoHo it really doesn't happen cent job and these some more dough working squeezy it's like a glass bottle so it's not plastic so I just have to shake it like I like that show I'm like it needs to either in it it it gotta be a better way it gotta be a better way okay I

trying to give me a headache [Music] okay so here's the audio and if it's 24k gold orange oil and it says that you apply a couple of drops on clean fingers and pat on to clean dry skin for the best results so let's see got about that much we're going to put it to the palm of my hand rub it whoa you can smell the orange I put too much on y'all oh I got too much oh I got too much oh that's so much that's so much that's too much oh god you can smell that citrix whoa whoa let me come closer oh my skin is o okay yeah so I am back with the mythology go cleanser and I really like this cleanser it really got my face clean tight like I was I was feeling it I used it two times both times did a great job I like to smell it'll be good for sensitive skin it will if you do get it into your eyes it won't like make them red or anything I really like this this is a keeper for me I'll give it a 10 I really like this they did a great job making this love the packaging as well and it does lather really well the next thing I used was the max ology 24k gold toner looks like this and the toner is a no-go for me I like the packaging I like that it has the sprinkle of gold in the solution but it's really hard to get it out the bottle and yeah I just don't want to deal with it I literally give it a 2 because I couldn't get the product out the bottle so no I'm going to pass the next thing I use was the sermon and I liked the server I really like it I will give it a 9 I really didn't like that it left my face like kind of sticky like when I put my hand on it but other than that I like that it has to drop I like that their directions are on the back you know it gave you some type of leeway on how to put it on and what to do so that was cool now the one thing that was my favorite part of the product line was the 24 gold pixel oil and this is 24k gold with orange audio and this is my favorite oh my god now I usually use the rosehip or you but I like this better y'all I give this a 10 it will be in my facial wash room it will go in there if you want the rotation but yeah this was a really good oh yeah I really like the way I make my skin look I like the way it smells okay guys so here

"HU2kIJoiPlo": "is this worth rupees 4 800. hello my loves welcome back to my channel i am very very happy that you are here with me today and i'm very happy that i was able to put out this video today as well i took a tiny little short break from youtube and i couldn't be happier to be back we are definitely feeling a little festive as you can see and in today's video we're gonna be doing a skincare review you guys seem to really really like that but before we get started with that just in case this is the very first time you're seeing this face hello i am jovita and i would love it if you took a second to click that subscribe button just underneath this video so let's get started in today's video as you already know from the title of this video i will be reviewing forest essentials moisturizer sunscreen and a lip balm basically the total cost of all of this is a roundish 5100 about five thousand rupees and that's a lot of money for just three items now forest essentials everybody knows that it is a very very reputable ayurvedic indian skin care brand if you remember from my amazon haul i got this just to review this guy for you and of course threw in a couple of other products as well because these were the ones that caught my attention right so what i'm gonna do for this video is as usual like we did in garnier and all of my other videos i'm gonna take up the forest essentials website and i'm gonna read their claims how rude of me i have not told you what the name of this moisturizer is guys forest essentials oh forest essentials has a couple of moisturizers and this is the saunderia radiance with 24 karat gold and spf 25 i don't believe that topical application of gold on your face or body can aid in beauty it cannot really deliver any sort of skin care benefits to your skin because the gold molecules are just way too large to penetrate into your skin so it has an aesthetic value for sure it has a luxurious value like your moisturizer has gold in it and some of the serums with gold flecks or leaf or whatever it has it looks beautiful but it's really not doing anything to your skin okay so if this price is just because of the gold in it let me tell you right here before we even get into the website but but i'm gonna hold my horses one thing that i find a little fishy is that the picture on the website of the same moisturizer the packaging looks very very different and the one i got off of amazon looks very very different the one on the website has a more it looks like a glass jar which is slightly maroon with a gold lid and it's more square than round mine is a plastic round jar so i don't know if i got an old batch but this does say manufactured in august 2020 and best before 2022 so this does look like a new batch but do they have multiple kinds of sound area radiance cream with 24 gallon gold and spf 25 i don't know anyways so the price is 4 800 rupees ayurveda speaks of flawless skin as lustrous smooth firm elastic with a golden sheen is that what i really that says why do we need a golden sheen anyways the forest essentials sounded a radiant screen with 24 karat gold and spf 25 now this is a mouthful of a name let me tell you that is an exceptionally rich yet light textured face cream that incorporates a combination of precious herbs and real 24 karat gold which helps to restore the firmness of the skin giving it a natural face lift this face moisturizer comes with spf of 25 that helps neutralize uva and uvb radiation and protects the skin from sun damage environmental stress and pollution the sound area cream has been awarded as the best moisturizer by elle india and as the best anti-aging cream by asia spa is asia spa a magazine i'm so sorry i don't know the benefits that i listed on the website it deeply moisturizes the skin to defy early signs of aging it helps in controlling collagen depletion and increases skin elasticity and smoothens fine lines this emollient protects the skin against detrimental effects of uv radiation free from chemicals parabens and petrochemicals eco-friendly packaging well now we know that parabens are really not the bad guy so we don't have to be really scared of having parabens in our skin care again i've mentioned this in my older skincare videos check those out but it's good that we have in india ayurvedic options that do not have parabens but every time i see this now i always wonder how is this product having a two year shelf life what is the preservative that they are using in here if it is not paraben because paraben is one of the most well studied preservative in the market so other preservatives in the market are not as well studied so chances are so i'm not talking about this at all i'm just taking a huge diversion into speaking about preservatives and parabens chances are your paraben free moisturizer could be using no preservatives which can cause your moisturizer to get moldy or it can have a preservative that's not really studied as well as paraben which could potentially be more dangerous than all of these dangerous claims that people speak about parabens again i was not speaking about this particular cream i'm just talking about preservatives okay now some of the key ingredients that they've mentioned is saffron pure ghee gold basma or that is gold dust and licorice saffron purge and licorice root extract is very very beneficial for the skin so i'm no one to debate contest or even speak about that those are all ayurvedic signs but gold basma what they say is 24 karat gold basma has a property of penetrating to the deepest layer of skin thereby providing radiance and increased velocity increased lust increased why can't i say this elasticity well it doesn't matter how finely you mill that gold it's not going to even penetrate your topmost layer so forget the deepest layers of your skin not gonna happen not gonna happen okay and basically this is all that they have to say about the cream now let me tell you that this moisturizer is definitely a very very luxurious moisturizer now let's talk about my experience i use this for one month i'm going to insert my before and after right here so you can take a look at what my skin looked like before i started on the 24 karat gold journey and after my karma sound area journey i try to keep my other serums and treatments minimal so that we can see the collagen benefits and the tightening firmness and all of those kind of promise benefits from the moisturizer alone now the texture of this cream is exactly spot on as they have described on the website this has a very light luxurious velvety airy texture and it does absorb into your skin very beautifully it goes on your skin and you know you can blend it into your face and neck and you definitely feel luxurious when you're applying this on your face i can't get the scent of saffron or turmeric or something ayurvedic when i apply this on my face i'm gonna give it a wild guess and say that there is definitely essential oils in this now ayurveda is not against essential oils so i have no problem having a little bit of essential oil in my moisturizers but i'm just saying that you know it smells divine probably because of the use of essential oils in the moisturizer now if you are living somewhere in south india where it is hot and humid or if you have oily skin this is going to leave a light glaze i want to say on your skin it's not greasy don't get me wrong it leaves a glow on your face not shimmer there's no glitter particles like a glow but if you have dry skin you might want something a little bit richer now about their claims of the firmness and the collagen production and the i don't know what else they said i didn't feel anything what i felt was it's a good moisturizer that comes in a gorgeous extremely luxurious pot i mean this on your vanity is gonna look so beautiful i also like the fact that they've included spf of 25 that's minimal but if you are mostly sitting at home or if you have a nine-to-five job most of your time you spend indoors i think spf of 25 is okay now coming to the most important question that i had that you probably have is this worth rupees 4 800. if you have a lot of money that you would like to fly yes it is but for me no will i ever buy this again no because i really don't think that this moisturizer is worth 4 800 rupees because you even get a really good moisturizer for like 500 rupees and this also gives me a very old lady vibe you know every time i look at the jar the scent of it the price of it so not about that life yeah the pot definitely has a very deceptive packaging the jar itself only comes to there the rest of it is just clear acrylics so you are getting a lot lesser than you think you are getting now you are getting 50 grams of product in here that price it's painfully high that gold is i'm sorry not gonna do anything to you all right let's move on to product number two of today's video and this is the sun fluid with tender coconut water with turmeric and basil leaf spf of 50 pa plus plus so this comes in a 50 milliliter bottle and this costs 975 rupees if we have learned anything as an average consumer from the whole purito scandal is that we don't really know how much of actual spf protection is there in our beloved sunscreens just by reading the label just because you've written spf of 50 pa plus plus there is no way i can confirm that to you because as a skincare youtuber i also feel responsible to you you know when i'm reviewing a product i need to be able to tell you if a product that says spf 50 really has spf 50. all i'm saying is i don't really know the labels is spf 50 pa plus plus all right now let's move on to the claims on the website a sunscreen that has the lightest texture for intensive sun protection the forest essential sun fluid with spf of 50 pa plus uses the most organic form of sun care available in nature tender coconut water no they did not just write that no we need filters you know we need actual some sort of filters in our spf if it is just tender coconut water we would be just buying coconut water and applying it on our face guys please don't do that okay this is just flowery words of marketing that they are using our sheer fluid formulation evenly distributes a thin veil of luminosity over the skin a blend of hydrating and nourishing ingredients is infused with naturally derived spf yashada basma zinc oxide which is very good that adds to the intensity of the sun protection basil leaf infusions protect the skin from environmental stressors making it perfect for daily application benefits an ayurvedic formulation that minimizes the effect of harsh uva slash uvb sun rays it contains an spf of 50 pa plus plus that promises protection up to four to six hours it is blended with natural humectants to keep the skin hydrated free from chemicals parabens petrochemicals that is just that one line that i don't agree with anymore i don't like hearing it eco-friendly packaging all right um let's start with that last part of the eco-friendly packaging this does come in a glass bottle with a plastic pump so for the most part this is recyclable but that doesn't mean that all of forest essential products are eco-friendly so whatever let's cut to the chase i love this sunscreen i love it i think i think i'm gonna be brave enough and go ahead and say this from all the sunscreens that i have currently this is my favorite why you ask they are spot on about their description of the texture it is a very light beautiful airy textured sunscreen it does not leave a white cast on my face and it feels like a nourishing lotion you know it does hydrate on days when you're lazy you can definitely skip a moisturizer and just apply this it does not clog my pores it does not give me bumps or pimples or acne it does not irritate my skin it feels so nice on the skin if you have normal dry skin this is perfect if you have excessively oily skin you might not like that sheen or the luminous sense that this gives because it's not a matte finish sunscreen basically but i absolutely love this sunscreen i love the fact that they have infused it with tender coconut water because i don't know about the sunscreen properties of tender coconut water but tender coconut water definitely has amazing skin care benefits basil leaf has amazing skin care benefits they are coming nourishing enriched with nutrients vitamins so they're amazing for the skin it also has turmeric and we know about turmeric turmeric is superb for the skin so all in all i love the beautiful mix of ayurveda and science with sun protection that they have so take it with a pinch of salt i just don't know about any sunscreens in the market anymore because as a layman there is no way for us to find out if an spf of 50 actually is spf of 50 on our face but apart from that this is a brilliant sunscreen the price of 975 rupees for this 50 ml i think is completely worth it i would re-buy this and re-buy this and re-buy this and re-buy this until i find a better alternative guys i love it and finally we're gonna be talking about the luxurious lip balm with sugared rose petals once again so fancy this is the luscious lip balm not luxurious lip balm but guys this whole packaging is just i want to say luxurious and old lady and also the scent is so it reminds me of my mom's lip balms and lipsticks and foundations it has a very old lady perfumey rosemary not actual rosemale you know that perfumey 80s i'm sure all of you can relate from your mom or grandmother's products you know that's what it smells like but strictly talking about the packaging alone um it's a very cute packaging it has a mirror who who whoever puts a mirror in a lip balm if this gives you absolutely no tint at all is it bad no is it the best i've used no does it do the job yeah but i just don't like the overly fragranced feel on my lips you know it gives you a very glossy finish it's kind of like you've applied a mediocre gloss not like a high shine intense gloss somewhere in between i hope i'm not confusing you but it stays on top of your lips i feel like it doesn't get absorbed into your lips to really moisturize your lips stays on top and prevents it from drying further so it kind of does its job but yeah it's okay i'm not the biggest fan of lip balms that come in pots because you have to keep dipping your finger in it to apply and especially during times like this with corona and the virus and everything it's not the most hygienic thing to always dip your finger in and apply even if you sanitize your hands so i just i never see myself reaching out to this one i was hoping it would be a tinted lip balm with that beautiful rose in that case i'd be like okay i would still like not mind it you know but this is just literally uh watered down vaseline so why would i pay 695 rupees for that you know what i'm saying and for 695 rupees you get 4 grams of product you know put in another 200 300 rupees and get yourself that sun fluid that is brilliant but this no but shall we quickly read the claims on the website we did it for the other two so let's just do it anyways right the ultra hydrating forest essentials sugared petal lip balm i'm telling you these names are way too long it's a unique ayurvedic preparation of kokum butter organic beeswax and cocoa butter which helps to replenish and soften dry chapped lips i don't think that's gonna i don't like i don't have dry chapped lips and i still don't feel that intense hydration that i get from some of my other favorite lip balms so if you actually have those winter burnt dry flaky lips i don't think this is going to treat it or heal it for you due to its extraordinary moisturizing and hydrating properties this lip balm seals in moisture and soothes dry lips leaving them soft and glossy well that's true it seals in the moisture if it has any but if your lips are already dry it's not sealing in anything and it soothes dry for sure it has a soothing effect and the glossy part i already explained that an effective blend of emollients which replenishes and softens dry chapped lips it gently heals and moisturizes the lips for a glossy finish free from chemicals parabens and petrochemicals eco-friendly packaging this comes in a nice plastic dubba i don't know how that is eco-friendly the outer packaging of it was very very beautiful like a cardboard and everything which i threw away i just couldn't be bothered to keep it but i don't see how this is eco-friendly at all guys i know i don't agree with it so that is everything i wanted to share with you in this video so basically is all of this worth 5 000 rupees of yours i would say no i don't recommend any of the others except for the sun fluid this is brilliant but the moisturizer and the lip balm is so skippable by the way if you've tried out any of these products or

everybody welcome back to the hartford games channel i'm your host tony and you did read that title correctly today we're taking a look at a ten thousand dollar 24 karat gold plated xbox one x scorpio edition inside all of this bubble wrap big thank you to andrew e for lending this treasure to us so we're gonna open this thing up we're gonna check it out learn a little bit of the history behind it and also try to figure out how much gold has actually plated onto it by colorware colorware being the company that microsoft uses for their promotional xboxes so let's go ahead and dig in so so in here we have the you know the av cables and power and stuff but we also have a gold controller set that down very gently it's pretty heavy hello all right let's go ahead and set this thing down see some of that shine and shimmer coming through oh my goodness i'm gonna have to like microfiber my fingerprints off of this thing because it's definitely like a fingerprint magnet there we go you can see how reflective this thing is oh my god wow look at this that's pretty incredible so this is just an absolutely gorgeous console you could just see obviously you can see my face and i hear all all distorted my uh my chin and neck here unshaven just it is just absolutely gorgeous shiny heavy freaking console here oh my goodness it is just so incredibly reflective and beautiful and uh one nice little touch here i don't know if the regular scorpio editions have this or not but it says hello from seattle xbox one x just absolutely just stellar console and then of course we also have the controller here and that's definitely lighter feeling like a controller would be but still so bizarre to just like see so much your face distorted like a fun house mirror in the uh in the controller but that's just really really cool so a little bit of history here the xbox one x is a premier version of the xbox one souped up better specs all that stuff obviously not up to snuff with current gen but for the time very powerful it was released november 7th 2017. the pre-order exclusive version was the project scorpio edition named after the fact that this was called project scorpio in development the gold-plated version however could be won via the xbox game pass quests contest quite a what a mouthful here's an example from their site introducing xbox game pass quests summer edition hello fellow gamers your summer fun is about to begin starting today we're kicking off the xbox game pass quests summer edition with new quests every other week exclusively available to xbox game pass members whether it rains or shines you will get rewards to play the games you love all summer long a little bit further down here what is the first quest starting today complete both quests listed below to get a fox bat brasilisk from the elder scrolls online tamriel unlimited sorry i just i i i have not played that game i'm mispronouncing everything here plus a chance to win a gold-plated xbox one x project scorpio edition quest one play 60 minutes three days in a row in any xbox game pass title before july 9th quest two earn three achievements in the elder scrolls online tamriel from july 10th through the 16th so essentially different quests had different playtime goals achievements to unlock etc doing these would put you in the running to potentially win a prize and in some cases it was one of these interestingly some individuals didn't know there was even a contest going on and won so they just happened to have a subscription and happened to achieve the requirements just by naturally playing how they would normally anyways and then they were contacted by microsoft to let them know they want a prize which is pretty incredible so currently we know of four of these that exist but andrew has an inside source that tells him that approximately 15 exist granted there's no way to verify that but what my guess is is that again we know of four of these that are out in the wild because their owners have made it very public that they have one there are probably other individuals that have won these that just kept it more private it's also possible that microsoft made some and then kept them internally either giving them away or auctioning them off at their private developer auctions so so it's kind of vague how many actually exist but that's also why it has such a severe price tag now of course the title says ten thousand dollars but uh there's been one recently that sold for eight another that sold recently for 13 so i'm kind of averaging that out into a nice even number so i was really curious how much gold was actually put into this thing obviously when you gold plate something it's not solid gold it's thin sheets of gold that are plated on top of something so yes it's 24 karat gold but how much mass of gold is actually on there so theoretically there should be a difference in weight between this console and a normal pre-order retail xbox one x scorpio edition so i headed over to retrotaku video games and hooked up with john and the employees over there they happened to have the scorpio edition console so i weighed that in grams ounces and pounds grams being the finest measurement and now we're going to go ahead and weigh this and see what the difference is if any john you want to weigh your balls real quick so here we go the regular xbox one x scorpio edition is [Music] 3650 grams this is 3730 grams meaning that there is 80 grams worth of plated gold on it retail console is 8.048 pounds this is 8.224 pounds retail console is 128.74 ounces this is 131.56 ounces and just out of curiosity we're gonna go ahead and measure the controller versus unfortunately they didn't have a scorpio edition controller they just had a regular xbox one controller but let's just see if there's a difference this will be a little bit less exact so the regular xbox one controller is 235 grams this is 239 grams so a difference of four grams worth of gold plated on this thing so there is a definitive difference between the retail version of this console and the gold plated one in terms of weight 80 grams worth specifically and another four grams on the controller itself assuming no other internal differences which i really doubt because i'm assuming microsoft just had a stock xbox one x scorpio edition and sent it off to be gold plated one could guess that additional weight is the gold now i didn't think that 80 grams worth of gold was a lot but then i looked up how much 80 grams worth of 24 karat gold was worth so big thank you to andrew e for lending us this incredible console if you want to see more content like this make sure to subscribe to our channel click the notification button

out world there's a new wine in town and some say it is I think I'll be the judge of that now here with more on the launch of Blu 9 24 karat gold sparkling wine and sparkling rose a is a sales manager of FW Langguth urban mark Tremont's hi mark how are you I don't know if you can get a close-up a shot of this that throwing this gold is amazing you have to sing talk about this exactly what it is it's basically it's a wine from sparkling wine from Germany and in the final process just before we bottle it we add 24 karat gold flakes to the to the actual wine hey can we stop with why that's safe hahaha the quite the answer to that is why not the wine industry has become so serious that we're looking to bring fun back to the line so this is really one way to do it I mean to make something just a fun product to to drink a fun product to have the gold is there it's not going to do anything to you it's not going to hurt you it's not going to help you but what it does is it adds a lot of so kind as to send me a case which is already finished it doesn't harm you but it sure does make your skin glow anybody seems like a party just by looking at the glass seems like a parties going on there it's fizzing the gold tree whirling around so what else makes this unique besides the actual gold flakes and then well the gold flakes are part of it the other thing that we do is we really spend a lot of time blending it to make sure that it always has that slightly sweet but very refreshing taste to it so that it's never really heavy on the palate it doesn't taste like you've drank a bottle of sugar water or something and really this one has got a lot of good of a lot of good of acidity and it's a city that really cleans the palate when you drink wine and open you up for another taste of it so that's really the whole idea behind it it's really our winemakers that do a lot of work to make sure it always has a consistent taste and consistent profile and let's talk about the branding because I mean gold bars will catch any woman's eye why did you pick gold bars well because it really matches the product it matches everything that we've done the bottle was redesigned about about six years ago so we went through a whole process of redesigning the bottle in the packaging and really bringing it up to date and making it more exciting so when you look at the shelves it really stands out there we make something different for you know to take home and when you pull it out of the refrigerator and you're going to serve your guests it really adds a lot of life to a party I don't drink alcohol but I shop by like we're going to dinners our shop the packaging is how I decide what that's pretty what looks good and both the packaging and the bottle both are beautiful presence in themselves you know now because he doesn't drink alcohol right I guess we need to educate [Music] about sparkling wine what makes yours so unique and what exactly goes into it well in this is a as I said before it's a blend of grapes and it's a proprietary blend because to get the gold to stay as it is in the wine you really have to have a certain balance between acidity and sweetness right and so when we blend it we utilize grape set will consist of Riesling Miller thurgau a lot Gewurztraminer and a lot of other great things it's made in Germany it is made in Germany but we also grab grapes from around the EU okay since we are an EU car company based in the European Union we can source grapes from around the EU and then we bring those into Germany and we blend it most wines are blended to some degree they're either blended from different parts of a vineyard or different parts of or different grape varieties will go to make a consistent tasting type wine and that's exactly what we've done here so what makes this one different from the Rose a that you had well the Rose a first of all we didn't put any gold in the Rose you can't rose gold does not is not able to be consumed 24 karat gold is the ultimate of it's a pure gold it is ninety-nine point nine nine thousandths of a percent gold so it's it's absolutely easy to be consumed the Rose a we didn't put gold in it but it's going to have it's going to have the same taste profile but it's got that little flash of color and roses today are really big and exciting I mean they started out in the Hamptons with a number of different roses and they are the the new trend of the winemaking frozen's as well exactly ice cream or a ring for the summer rose a slushie exactly so what would one pair these wines with these wines would be great as an aperitif so something before a meal so you gonna want to have something that may have a little bit of of a cream sauce to it or something that has a little bit of a butter to it because this has a lot of acidity in it and that's going to cut that heaviness on the palate so what you do is when pairing wines you either look for something that complements or something that contrasts and in the contrasting part of it what it really comes down to is if it's going to make the palate clean there's going to clean up the palate to go on to the next the next meal the next dish of the meal this is like an amuse-bouche yes you can definitely need to buy something for my next dinner party last time I don't have to sell all of my gold or give me one of these because it's beautiful okay language family this is something that but here in the on the US side it's around $14.99 of on oh wow yeah wait go for 24 karat gold we don't we believe that it should be that fun and fashion and incredibly affordable we're using your drinks then drinking them that it was too expensive for me but a lot of people celebrities included a lot of drinks well that goes back that's part of our history part of the blue none blue none has been around since the 1920s and if you go back into the 70s 80s and 90s we've been as we've been part of the Beatles we were look at the liner notes on the White Album it says lot the song long long long there's a reference to blue nun in that the rumors album was Fleetwood Mac there's a bottle of blue nun in the write on the inside cover of it and the Beastie Boys check your head I think which was a came out in the 90s they actually have a song called blue nun that they wrote at the forum of one of the former owners of blue nun when we launched this we said let's go back to our roots let's go back to you know talking to the celebrities that had promoted us in the past and that's what we did over the newer newer group and you can go back to singing 24-karat now [Music] but we are looking at that we also have a we have a couple other different sparkling wines too to go along with this available mainly in the EU we have a non alcoholic it is exactly that it's a non-alcoholic sparkling wine and we also have a 100% Riesling smart play so we have a number of different products and we and our people back in our reefs research and development team back in Germany are definitely always working on something new and exciting assist your research team would you exactly what it is you should make next okay diamond champagne Oh with real diamonds in it yes of course so I can have diamonds for $14.99 this amazing style all right and cheers to you but don't go anywhere we'll be right back with more rice 360s",

[Music] [Music] [Music] my song [Music] [Applause]", "BgcOtFhhMB4": "hey everybody its silver seeker and today we're looking at and talking about what's in this book now as you can read by the top here it says golden replicas of rare stamps of the world and it's by the postal commemorative Society now I picked this thing up some time ago and if I remember correctly I paid like 10 bucks for it and it I don't remember if that's the accurate number but anyway it's interesting and I wanted to share it with you because it's been kind of sitting there collecting dust and I've been saying I wanted to make a video on it and want to answer the question if these are actually worth anything at all did I even throw my 10 bucks away or you know what's going on with it so it says golden replicas of rare stamps to the world now the front page here actually has a stamp now if you look at the actual stamp we'll go ahead and pull this out and show you so the actual stamp design is this right here and then there's a six dollar label and then it says Antigua and Barbuda but the the stamp itself this is the stamp design and then the rest of it's kind of like a plaque if you will and it has Antigua and Barbuda on it and so this one right here is the six dollar and it's the black Honduras and it says issued its so it's also issued by the government but on the back it says $6 black Honduras and it tells you a little bit about it I suppose so the amazing saga of the black Condor starts in 25 and we're not going to read the whole thing because we'd be here all day and this would be way too long of a video now as far as the gold stamp itself is concerned while I slide this back in here this is actually made of 24 karat gold now it's 24 karat gold leaf and if you watch my video on should you stack gold you would know that you can flatten gold to a very very very very very thin like almost you know micron thin layer which makes gold very very versatile you can take one ounce of gold and and spread it out over a hundred square feet which is absolutely insane so all of these about this book all of these are issued by the government of Antigua and Barbuda but again the actual stamp design is going to be the little thing and then the whole big part is a plaque now how much gold is in each one of these stamps is not very much I do not know for sure but I believe that when these are made like the design of the stamp okay is actually impressioned into like a piece of plastic or something like that and then it's layered with 24 karat gold leaf now the cool part is that there's a bunch of these in there I believe there's 93 or something like that in this book if I remember when I counted them and at the top here you see it has a certificate of order of origin and authenticity and it's gonna be hard for you to read I'm not gonna read everything to you but it says I further certify that all postage stamps in the collection are minted in 24 karat gold and it's signed by VG bird the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda so you know it's kind of cool and each one of these is every one of those is issued by Antigua and Barbuda but for example right here this is the six dollar inverted locomotive the six dollar Queen Victoria so it looks like they're adding like Antigua and Barbuda currency value to the plaque but that's not what the value of the actual stamp is and you can see each stamp is kind of sized differently so again the actual stamp design is kind of impression and then they put their you know the name of their country and their face value currency which I'm sure isn't very much but we have all sorts of them you have another black Honduras here you got an Amelia Earhart Queen Victoria and there's all sorts of them now how much are these actually worth well I don't think there's a really good way to figure that out I mean outside of just seeing what they're selling for an ebay but if you're wondering what the value of the gold is and these stamps it's gonna be really hard to figure out because you can remove all these stamps and weigh them but it's not gonna help you very much because the weight of the plastic is probably heavier than the weight of the gold leaf and so that's not going to help us we do know it's 24 karat gold leaf so it is real gold but if you were to refine all these take the plastic away and then just you know you know have a little itty-bitty gold nugget when you're done that is kind of what the value of these would be so a lot of cool stuff and if you notice over here one thing I didn't point out so this is the six dollar Saint Lawrence Seaway and that's showing you know it's Canada right there it's actually showing as well as like this one here the six dollar inverted locomotive it's actually showing the stamp itself like printed so you can see what the stamp looked like on top of it also being impression into the gold leaf so now that we've taken a look at a book at the book we're gonna go on eBay and we're gonna see what these are selling for or something like this is selling for so we can at least get an idea of the value of what something like this would be and you know go from there that way you guys if you ever seen one at a yard sale or in a thrift shop or something like that you don't have to pay too much or you know if it's if it's really cheap or whatever you'll know you know whether or not you should be able to pick it up so let's go ahead and take a look at eBay see what's going on there and then we'll we'll go from there okay yes now that we're on eBay we're gonna do some searching so let's go ahead and search for 24k gold stamps of the world let's see if we can find something like this all right so we have this one right here it says rare stamps of the world book 24 karat gold definitely not the same book that we have this one here is showing a Franklin Mint 79 to 80 it says were 39 24 karat gold over silver stamps so these are gold over silver also not what we're looking for let's let's let's do stamp replicas and see if that helps us of course I forgot to put a space here we go alrighty so 24 karat gold stamp replica so no exact match is found but it's showing us some stuff here so we have a Dwight D Eisenhower US postal commemorative Society 24 karat gold stamp we have a first day of issue 22 or 22 karat gold replicas and stamp World War two Space Exploration they're asking nine dollars a piece of plus shipping for these here's a book right here it says 39 1982 eighty one golden replicas of US stamps only ten bucks now that's a bid it's got four days left no bids on it yet now here's a Buy It Now this one right here there's twenty three stamps minute and twenty three karat gold okay so we got a bunch of stuff going on here let's go ahead and see if there's anything that's actually sold because when you're looking on eBay for what something is worth you don't really want to look at what people are asking because you can put anything on eBay and ask however much you want for it but what stuff is actually sold for obviously is what's important so we're gonna go ahead and click that so let's see we have golden replica of the United States stamp proof of replicas what surface of 22 karat gold so this is a six set now this isn't the same ones that we have but this is a six piece set that's sold for twenty six dollars and fourteen dollars shipping let's take a closer look at it it kind of looks like the same idea kind of the same idea these are very blurry images which isn't going to help us very much but you know it's it's golden replica stamps let's see if we can find like a book alright because we're not getting a whole lot here let's see we'll go 24 karat gold stamp replicas book alright alright so here we go golden replicas 22 karat gold first-day issue stamp a lot forty-two book one now here's probably what I was expecting more to find so this one right here sold for nineteen dollars and 36 cents plus seven forty three shipping so about twenty-seven dollars and here's another one that sold for 1936 plus eleven ninety five looks like all right so this is book six book one so the books are selling with 40 stamps for about twenty bucks plus shipping our book has 93 stamps in it so we can probably expect forty to fifty bucks now of course these aren't the same exact books these are 22 karat gold are some 24 karat gold again it's just gold leaf it's gonna be really thin we're gonna take a quick look at this thing now so yeah this kind of looks like what we have I mean it's not it's not the same country it looks like they have some actual colored stamps on here so these ones look a little bit more professionally done than the ones that we have but still you know it's really cool stuff so anyway that kind of gives us an idea we didn't find the exact book that we have which is kind of unfortunate but you know now we're looking at gold coins so I mean it doesn't there's not a whole lot of history on these I mean just to show you like these sold in March right now it's May 31st he's sold in April this but this one single stamp the sold May 8th this book sold April 17th so there's not a whole lot of history on these anyway so it's not like they're selling you know like hotcakes they're just flying off the shelf so it just looks like you know a random sale every once in a while so here right this these guys are asking that says great Americans plus us damn 24 karat gold foil covers book a hundred stamps 150 bucks is what they're asking here's another one that's asking $99 again you know these are these are what they're asking this isn't what they've actually sold for so a lot of them on there but not a whole lot of people buying them so probably not a whole lot like if I were to figure what that book that I just showed you is worth probably thirty to fifty dollars it would be my best guess but it's still really cool but hopefully doing this video just gives you an idea of what these things are actually worth which unfortunately is not a whole lot it takes up a whole lot of space if you can get them really cheap at a yard sale like you get a book like that for five bucks or if you can get you know individual ones like ten for a dollar two at a yard sale or something maybe it'd be worth picking up but would I pay more than a dollar or two apiece for those probably not given that even if you do sell them you're not gonna make much on them and additionally you know they're gonna take a long time to sell because as you saw they don't sell very quickly so there you go guys I hope you enjoyed the video I hope it gave you some information about those gold stamps if you did do me a big favor leave a like and let me know in the comments and if you haven't done so yet guys I would appreciate a subscription because it really really helps me out and guys we will see you in the very next video [Music] [Music] you", "gTDPavbrA2s": "hey guys welcome back today we're gonna talk about a new palette and this palette is from I heart makeup and it's called 24k gold and I just recently got it and I really really liked it and I thought I'll do a review for you guys so if you're interested please keep on watching now obviously by the name of it you can tell guys that this palette should have lots of shimmery shades and it's true it has lots of shimmery shades now on the inside it looks exactly like other and chocolate shaped I heard make a palette and it has the same amount of colors it has a mirror as well and now in terms of colors and there is a lot of shimmery shade but I was really impressed to see that there are a lot of matte shades as well so you can kind of use this palette on its own you don't have to reach for another palette so this is very useful there are seven matches and nine shimmery shades but in terms of the shimmer shades guys these are not your usual very intense glittery shimmery shades these have a very subtle Sheen to them and I've used this palette on my eyes today and it looks really really beautiful the shimmer shades they look very pearly if you know what I mean but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys it's quite hard put them on your eyes the easiest way to put the shimmer shades on your eyelid is with this brush that comes with the palette and you'll be amazed how good this is for this shimmery shade and if you use like normal Harry brush it's not gonna work because if you kind of have to dig into the shimmery shadow and then put it on the lid so that's what worked really good for me so if you're expecting from this palette called 24k to be super duper shimmery and lots of glitter and sparkles and it's not really like that it's more settled and more I'd say more wearable kind of and that's good that's really good it's just that it's quite hard to put them on your leg but once they there they look really nice in terms of the matches they're really really nice the colors are very very wearable and you get a peachy color brown you get a black you get a creamy white and then this is like a tea rose like a very light purplish color and then this is like a darker purplish color and then there's a light brown over here I really like the color selection because you get like this tea rose purplish theme and then you get like the pinky peachy theme which is really really nice as well I've used the peachy colors today on my lid and I really liked it I like the matte shades because they are pigmented and easy to apply on the lid and you can build up your color like the other day I was working with some really intense pigmented shadows and I was amazed on how hard it is to deal with very pigmented shadows on your eyes whereas working with shadows that you can build up the color it's so much nicer and you have so much more control and that's why I really like these now I would definitely recommend this palette however guys be aware that the shimmery shades are a bit hard to work with now if you do want some shimmery shades that are more intense and easier to pick up from the pan I recommend this one I heard make a chocolate rose gold toilet over this one but have a look at the color selection in this one because it's really really beautiful and it's more wearable I would say than other palettes for my heart makeup okay guys so now I'm gonna show you a closer look of my makeup that I did using this palette and then I'm gonna show you the swatches and I will see in a sec [Music] so here you go guys these are the swatches I've put all the shimmer shades together over here and then I've put a matte shade over here as you can see the shimmer shades are very settled very beautiful and there's not a lot of Sheen to them but they are very pearly and I really like them and they are very wearable as well now in terms of the matte shades I really like the color selection you've got these purpley shades over here you've got this peachy shade and then you've got the Browns and the black and creamy shade and here you go guys this is a closer look of the palette for you so you can see the colors in the pans see if you like them thank you very much for watching I hope that this review was helpful please leave me questions down below and please subscribe to my channel and I will see you soon bye", "N4E54S2wdRU": "you scrappers who's here again back with my feet back downstairs on the workbench so this video is going to be about motherboards we're going to go over a few different types of other boards we're going to talk about a motherboard myth that has a pretty ugly myth and we're going to go over some of the components on them what's in them what to look for cetera so sorry for the camera angle being way up there I lost one of my other tripods that was lower so alright so let's start off you have the two inch socket motherboard right this is the one that has the large chips they're usually plastic with a little lever here to release them these are the older ones and these are the ones that are usually worth some of the most money right so large socket two inches all right next we have small socket motherboard now this one it's pretty much it kind of the same thing as the large sockets up smaller still has the holes for the pins and a little leverage release it this is it's still you know a decent motherboard next we have the metal clamp motherboards now these are the boards that have these are the newer ones that have the pinless CPUs so those are the CPUs that are worth the least and let's this is the type of motherboard that those come on alright you also have motherboards for slot processors these right here um as far as their volume and this was going to bought loaded tantalum capacitors on it so I'm not really sure what the complete value on this would be but it's probably pretty good then you have the double socket affords the two inch double socket boards are the most valuable boards that there are different places that will pay you know different amounts of money for every board some places the same other boards whatever and give you a low price but for the higher prices you're going to get more for this type of board we also have boards that of Apple computers are usually blue and the processors are usually this great big you know rectangular thing that kind of Nestle's into that piece right there they usually have a lot of great big pop orphan Reed eater type heat sinks and finally we're going to look at this type of motherboard now there's a couple of videos out there and a lot of people see these and their heart starts pounding or thinking oh my god this is a gold motherboard no it's not there's no such thing as a gold motherboard I have never ever seen one and the people on the recorders running forum that I've talked to have never seen a gold motherboard what happens is yeah it looks gold and if you use a gold test solution and you can keep putting you know the 10 karat solution 1418 22-karat solution but you're only putting it on a solder mask a gold color soldered mask so you the Gold's not going to dissolve so or this isn't going to dissolve so you're going to think that oh yes 24 karat gold well it's not if you scratch it you will see that it is copper underneath now the thing with that is copper underneath here is going to be very shiny so sometimes depending on the light it's really hard to tell the difference between gold plating and copper after a while they get used to it you learn to make sure you're looking at it through the right light but you want to make sure that when you see these don't send these to a refiner thinking that you're going to get a whole buttload of money because you're these are actually a lower grade board now all of these boards come in different colors the green boards are the ones that are worth the most I mean they come in purple blue gold tone is pretty much the only colors I've seen most of us like foreign companies and they're just not worth very much but then again there are some places who will pay you know flat rate from other boards all right so when you're selling motherboards especially if you're going to sell the place is like boards or comm it's really important that you take the batteries out this one's got a big one yeah like this one over here you want to make sure you take those out most of the places that buy them ask you to remove them so as far as what's worth money on these things now you want to make sure that you pull off you know any PCI cards have the gold fingers on them the RAM of course you want to get that little CPU you want to get those as well and after that you're going to have a variety of different things the aluminum heat sinks keep aluminum heat sinks from the motherboard separate from all your other aluminum because aluminum heat sinks on these computers are actually one of the highest grades of aluminum that scrap yards of lye so you want to make sure you keep those separate so you make more money on yeah let's start off with this little board here so in all of these slots here you want to make sure that you you look through the light you know kind of at an angle and some of them are gold-plated like on this one these are all gold-plated the little metal pins in there and here they're not it's usually just a very small portion of it that's gold-plated so if you want to go digging for that by all means also have these IDE pins over here and there they're usually scattered here about everywhere some more up here so see also on these things are going to have these little monolithic ceramic capacitors those little boxes right there now those things are the last reports that I got was that they are three percent palladium so for every 100 grams of those things you have you'll have three grams of palladium which is a pretty good percentage and there's also silver in them as well you're also going to look for the North and South Bridge chips which so there's going to be one of those right here it's this one over is right here it's this chip right here that you see the little gold tail on them and the other ones going to be right underneath that aluminum there you have there's the other one those those icy chips are going to have you know some good gold content and also the little icy chips you find everywhere all over this board you go not save those as well for an old recovery or for selling now we also have these little metal caps right here if you see that that is a crystal oscillator some of the one right there those have gold content as well so you want to put those aside separate them for processing or selling you want to make sure you look underneath the battery because sometimes there's a gold plate in that and also make sure that you pull off everything that has copper on all right now over here we have the the monitor and putting up with the ports for printers or whatever all of these little things are going to have little gold plated pins in them even the USB ports and even sometimes these these jacks over here for microphone speakers whatever you want to make sure you check those as well so it could be some gold plate in that once in a while on these older motherboards you might find a little box like this that has these little number switches if you can see that right there you're going to want to carefully take those apart because sometimes they have little gold balls in them and according to original feeds they're solid gold there they're very small I'm not sure if the inside is actually brass which would make it kind of gold colored and they're just gold-plated I'm not totally sure of that but again still something definitely worth worth keeping oftentimes you're going to find these yellow boxes those are tantalum capacitors that's been a real hot subject on the past week or so on my facebook page people wanting to know can you tell me more information about tantalum unfortunately I can't I don't really know a whole heck of a lot about it I just know that these little yellow boxes are Taylan capacitors I know there's some all right so the next question I guess is going to be how do you process all this stuff well most of the gold pins the gold-plated stuff you can process with AP you can use hydrochloric acid alone if you bring it to a simmer I should heat all the base metal out the IC chips you're going to want to use a process it's a multi-step process there's a youtuber author's name is Gio he has each step done it starts off with incineration then it goes to separation and write down a gold panning and then processing because we when you incinerate the chip you end up with three gold bearing things you have the gold bonding wires that are you know freed by the incineration process process you any gold plated pins from the legs or anything like that and you have a little silicon wafer now that may have gold on it as well so that's that process tantalum I have no idea how to recover that I just removed components in bulk and sell them at Andale them is one of those metals that is quite expensive and it has a lot of very interesting properties like its melting point it's like over five thousand degrees Fahrenheit which is amazing as far as processing anything else and you can pretty much process everything with those three methods AP hot HCl or incineration so have any questions for something I forgot please let me know I'm sure I forgot something this is such a huge topic to cover to cover the best that I can and again sorry I can't tell you any more about tantalum but there's somebody else out there who's watching this who knows more if you have any website links that would have some better information please put it down here in the comment section and thanks for watching comment like subscribe see", "xbxobzyLaI4": "So for almost a year now I've\u00a0\nhad this one particular supply.\u00a0\u00a0 That's just been the hanging\u00a0\nout inside of my art studio.\n\u00a0 Hello, my lovely Misfitians and welcome back to\u00a0\nanother video. So my name is Carrie. If you are\u00a0\u00a0 new here, I am the artist behind Watercolor\u00a0\nMisfit. So here is the plan for today's video.\u00a0\u00a0 I already have an illustration in mind of what\u00a0\nI want to paint. And since it's Valentine's day,\u00a0\u00a0 it will be related to that as well as one of my\u00a0\nfavorite favorite animated or movies or even books\u00a0\u00a0 is Alice in Wonderland. It's going to be related\u00a0\nto that. So, first thing, what I'm going to do is\u00a0\u00a0 just paint the illustration and get kind of the\u00a0\nbase down, and then we'll play around with the\u00a0\u00a0 gold and see how this works. I have no, I have not\u00a0\nplayed around with this before. I have no idea how\u00a0\u00a0 this is going to turn out. It might be a disaster.\u00a0\nSo come along with me and we will go ahead and cut\u00a0\u00a0 to a time-lapse real quick of me doing the\u00a0\npainting. And then we'll get into the actual\u00a0\u00a0 figuring out how to put this\u00a0\ngold down on that painting.\n\u00a0 So\u00a0\u00a0 I'm going to stop for a little bit and let this\u00a0\ndry, but I thought we could just have a little\u00a0\u00a0 chat to chat about specifically gold before I\u00a0\nactually start using this supply here. I wanted to\u00a0\u00a0 just talk about what gold means to me. So\u00a0\nwhen I first purchased this, I really was\u00a0\u00a0 just kind of in awe of how ordinary it\u00a0\nlooked. I know that sounds really ridiculous,\u00a0\u00a0 but for those of you who've seen like gold flake\u00a0\nor anything like that is supposed to resemble\u00a0\u00a0 gold. This looks very, very similar. I was just\u00a0\nreally shocked at how similar it looks. Cause I\u00a0\u00a0 actually have a lot of different supplies in\u00a0\nmy art studio that have basically gold Fleck,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's not real gold. And so when I, I don't\u00a0\nknow what I was thinking when I purchased this,\u00a0\u00a0 but I was thinking it would be a lot\u00a0\nmore, I don't know, different.\n\u00a0 It would have, like, I don't know, it would just\u00a0\nlook different. I just was thinking of that and\u00a0\u00a0 looking at it now, especially compared\u00a0\nto the other things that I have,\u00a0\u00a0 it does look more solid and more hardy, but\u00a0\nat the same time, it looks very similar,\u00a0\u00a0 which got me thinking about fool's gold\u00a0\nspecifically. And then I started realizing\u00a0\u00a0 about miners in the past and stuff like\u00a0\nthat and how they would think that they had\u00a0\u00a0 stumbled upon this treasure. When in reality\u00a0\nit was fool's gold and the way they would tell\u00a0\u00a0 whether it was gold or full schooled was\u00a0\nby putting intense heat or pressure on that\u00a0\u00a0 particular element. And if it was pure gold, it\u00a0\nwould basically melt and it would become even\u00a0\u00a0 more pure and even more beautiful and even more\u00a0\nprecious and valuable. But if it was fool's gold,\u00a0\u00a0 it would start to stink and smell and\u00a0\nimmediately they would know it's fool's gold.\n\u00a0 If you put it under heat, it starts to smell like\u00a0\nrotten eggs. And so immediately they would know\u00a0\u00a0 this isn't the real thing, like crap, I got\u00a0\nfools gold. And then I started thinking about\u00a0\u00a0 how that can so much relate to relationships. So\u00a0\nI started thinking about the difference between\u00a0\u00a0 fools gold, my previous relationship that did not\u00a0\nhold up to pressure or stress or different things.\u00a0\u00a0 If anything, it exasperated stuff, it made our\u00a0\nrelationship more turmoil and stuff. Whereas\u00a0\u00a0 with my husband, when we were in stressful\u00a0\ntimes and when we were under pressure, our\u00a0\u00a0 relationship became pure and more beautiful and\u00a0\nit actually caused us to become closer together.\u00a0\u00a0 So I want to encourage you, maybe your\u00a0\n24 karat person that is in your life,\u00a0\u00a0 your true gold soulmate is a friend or a family\u00a0\nmember or someone who is really there for you\u00a0\u00a0 through the thick and thin through the hardships,\u00a0\nbecause that is what my husband was for me.\n\u00a0 And that is what he is for me still. And\u00a0\nfor the longest time before that, I actually\u00a0\u00a0 had a really close friend in college who was there\u00a0\nfor me through thick and thin. And she was my 24\u00a0\u00a0 karat gold. I've got to have this person or else\u00a0\nI might break type thing. So yeah, I just thought\u00a0\u00a0 I would kind of insert that in before we start\u00a0\nworking with the gold fleck and just kind of the\u00a0\u00a0 difference between fool's gold and real gold. So\u00a0\nanyway, let's go ahead and jump back into painting\u00a0\u00a0 with our gold and figuring this out. Cause I\u00a0\nhave no clue still how I'm going to do this\n\u00a0 And that is it for today's video. I really hope\u00a0\nyou enjoyed this.

Bye", "DwACH4F4tHg": "hi guys and welcome back to my channel so today we are testing the 24 karat gold revolution pro products so they've released three new products and they also had the month 342 on the revolution website and they have been putting on 3v2 a lot recently so definitely check that out but yeah we've got the eyeshadow palette and then we've got the fixing spray and also the primer as well so gorgeous so i'm going to be talking you through the products and showing you how to create this makeup look and also just give me a review at the end as well so without further ado let's get in with the video so the first product i'm going in with is the revolution pro 24k gold prime and serum are we ready for the bottle i mean look how beautiful this is so this is the hydrating primer serum infused with 24 karat gold for added radiance contains hyaluronic acid which we love because that means that our skin is going to be very hydrated plant-derived collagen and vitamin b's so i mean this reads pretty well and visually it looks gorgeous i mean just look at all them little particles of gold i'm excited to try this so this has got a little pipette which i actually haven't used in the primer before i mean is the gold particles gonna melt like dissolve on my skin i hope so so i'm just gonna pop on a couple of drops it's so cold uh it's so cold and just rub this in i would say that it hasn't left my skin feeling cakey it does say on the website that it will leave your skin feeling very hydrated and plumped i would say definitely hydrated as a primer it will obviously prolong your makeup throughout the day hopefully i am quite a fan of the paper actually so like i said this is just in a glass bottle and this was 15 pound so i'll be interested to see how my makeup stays on for the rest of the day i'll probably let you know in my next video but overall feels very hydrating that's what i like in a primer so let's pop my foundation on and see how it goes on so today i am using my xx [Music] revolution [Music] so the foundation is all on i look very very pale right now but i feel like the primer acted as a really good base for the foundation it went on very smoothly there's no kind of patchiness so yeah i'm very impressed with the primer so far i'm not going to talk too much about the other products that i'm using because i have done reviews on these already so this was the folks station in the shade 3.5 so i'll pop the video up there if you do want to check any of these out but obviously it is video i just want to focus on the 24 carat gold so i'm just going to go ahead and pop some concealer on and do my brows and i'll be right back to do my eyeshadow so that is them done i will pop everything in the description as usual but next up we have the 24k gold by you guessed it revolution pro eyeshadow palette now this was 14.99 so this is the outer packaging again it's got the lovely little pieces of gold i mean this is just imprinted on this isn't actual pieces of gold because i think the palette will probably be a little bit more expensive than 15 pound now revolution pro i've thought of everything here because they've actually included a cream eyeshadow there so this is called based and they said on the website that you can use that as a primer it's basically a lid primer in an eyeshadow palette i mean what more could you want for 15 pounds like that is very very good so i'm gonna just pop this all over my lid that cream eyeshadow was definitely full coverage so i'm very impressed with the cream eyeshadow now these shades are just gorgeous aren't they like you've got some glitter i mean i'm hoping that they'll go on as glittery as what they look you know when sometimes in an eyeshadow palette like you see really pretty glitters and you put them on and they just don't go on the same as what they look like in the palette so i'm hoping that's not going to be the case today but overall it's very warm kind of vibes and this has kind of got me a little bit excited for autumn is it too soon i don't think so you know so i'm very excited to go with this as i might have mentioned so i think i'm gonna go in with coin so there's quite a lot of ma and shimmer shades in here that's it's about 50 50. let's go in with coin and i'm just going to pop this all over my eyelid with my real techniques 301 brush it's so pigmented it actually is as well and i think what i'm going to do is bring this up towards my brow bone now i'm just going to go in with the shade mine and i'm just going to pop that on my outer corners i still will say is don't worry about like this part yet i will just go in with some concealer at the end and really make that more defined just in case you can see i'm switching up my brushes so i've got my 301 brush which is kind of like my base shadow brush and then i've just got my 300 brush which is kind of more of a blending brush it's a deluxe crease brush and then i'm going to take gold leaf and i'm just going to pop this on with my finger and i'm just going to pop this on my inner corner and this is probably like the prettiest shade i think out the whole palette to be honest i mean this prescott is also very beautiful but i'm more attracted to the gold leaf i'm gonna be honest look at it look at that i feel like i'm gonna potentially get some fallout here but it's fine we'll use some concealer if we do i can't deal with this revolution pro oh my goodness wow this literally will be my face for the entire video have you seen that and can we just appreciate that actually i was wrong i should have had more faith there's no fallout i think i'm going to go in with a brush just to kind of really get in my inner corners so my hands are legit full of glitter right now but i don't mind so i'm going to go in with my smashbox smoky shadow brush i'm just going to pop this a little bit further in and i'm just going to kind of tidy up a little bit i feel like if you wanted a little bit more control over where the glitter was going because i honestly didn't realize well i mean i should have realized how glittery that was you could go back in with the cream shadow and then do like a cut crease because i feel like i've put glitter everywhere but i mean it's me and i'm obsessed with glitter so it's fine i feel like i'd be rude if i didn't go in with the 24k shade so i'm gonna pop that under my eye and i'm using my real techniques faithful rubble edge fine brush now i'm going to take metal and pop that on my inner corner so i'm just going to go ahead and put the rest of my makeup on and i'll be right back so that is the finished makeup look now i have the revolution 24k setting spray as well so this was at eight pound so i paid 15 pounds for the other two and then got this one for free since they had 3v2 on now if you look on the bottom because we can't actually see in the bottle apart from this tiny bit yet so there's a lot of gold shimmer chilling at the bottom so we're gonna give it a shake [Music] now can you see that does anyone else think of iconic london's prep set and glow could this be a dupe we're gonna try it and find out can we just appreciate as well how obsessed i am with this eyeshadow because this palette is an absolute dream like honestly for 15 pound i would highly recommend it it is absolutely gorgeous but i can't get over this is probably the best glitter palette that i've ever used and to run out there revolution pro is done very very well very incredibly well so i'm literally obsessed so let's go in with this setting spray so 24k gold revolution pro fix and spray it with a golden shimmer it actually smells so good as well it kind of has like a pineapple kind of extract love that let's go in so they said that it would give you a warm glow which i think we will agree i am definitely glowing right now it smells so good as well honestly definitely gives a hydrate and glow look and you know sometimes satin sprays can be a bit like sticky i don't want to touch my makeup right now but it doesn't feel like at all it feels very lightweight which i do love in a setting spray so i will just give you my usual little close-up of the makeup look that i've done [Music] and as usual everything will be in the description that i haven't mentioned but i've got on my face so overall would i recommend 24 karat gold revolution pro range yes definitely especially when it's on for three for two like i genuinely will pay full price for these products like the primer was fabulous and really acted as a really good base and was hydrating as well but again lightweight not cakey the eyeshadow palette while i've already said honestly i am actually blown away by the eyeshadow palette i think it was amazing i can't emphasize that enough and then the setting spray like say again not sticky lightweight but smells amazing and it's very hydrating so overall i'm very happy right now so i hope you enjoyed this video

"[Music] [Music] hello and welcome back to my channel so I am going to read to you what the mask claims to do because I mentioned it in the video but I rewatched it and I wasn't happy with the way I was saying things so I'm just gonna read it to you with a voiceover through a voiceover so this is the twenty four gold series anti-aging essence sheet mask by the brand Danielle creations and so Daniel creations is not a Korean brand it is a UK founded brand and they now have partners in Canada and in the States so I just thought I would mention that to you that is not a Korean brand but however it is made in Korea it claims to have a gold layer to lock in essence rejuvenates dry dull skin improves skin elasticity and helps stimulate cell renewal that's what it claims to do on the mask here or on the packaging and then it also says the essence in the mask is packed with many anti-aging powerhouses like colloidal gold collagen retinol hyaluronic acid niacin amide and vitamin E to brighten firm lift boost and nourish the skin the essence is further enriched with the addition of honey to restore moisture and elasticity to dry skin and green tea to help fight harmful free radicals now I did do some research on whether or not gold actually does help the skin or whether or not it was just like this new fad why I guess it's known you just like a fad and when my findings on the internet indicated that gold is actually an antioxidant and so it will help with like redness and inflammation yeah that's basically like all the information I can tell you give you I guess and [Music] okay so first impressions it smells really freaking nice it's not overwhelming it feels really nice on my skin it's sticking really well to my skin as well which is something that it claims to do so that is impressive about the mask itself it's like very firmly on here I feel like I look like Iron Man okay so now that it's sitting first impressions um yeah it feels really nice lastly nothing is itchy it feels like a face mask a little cool sensation it does feel really like it's really stuck on the skin I'm gonna check back with you in 20 minutes goodbye Ben 20 minutes and I'm like really sorry about all these weird camera angles my powder room is a really small and I just really had to play around right now I'm sitting on my toilet but I'm not taking a I am just sitting on it yeah so let's take this off feels nice I don't see any redness so that's that's a positive we're just gonna start this and this is what the other side looks like in case you are curious and we're just going to massage this in I hate the feeling of stickiness on my face and the fact that you're not necessarily supposed to wash this off just I don't know how people do it I have kind of tapped in as much of the essence as I cut into my skin it's still pretty sticky so I'm just gonna take a clean paper towel it's a little bit damp and I'm gonna take a bit of it off I don't know if this is counter-intuitive but I'm telling you I will not be able to sleep if I know that I have stiffness on my face I'm very very lightly patting it off I looked at my skin and I'm honestly pretty impressed it seems like it really really hydrated my skin so that's that's a thing that it claimed to do and that's what it did as for the other things I'm not sure I don't think anti-aging products work that quickly I will check back in with you guys in the morning and I will let you know how it feels and what it looks like so good night [Music] so just washed my face with water usually that's all I do in the mornings anyways I wash my face with water and then I moisturize obviously I didn't waster eyes because I wanted to show you the full effects of the mask what I can tell you is that my face isn't hurting because it's really because it's winter my face hurts after I wash if he is so dry which is why I need to moisturize but I feel like I could go out of the house without moisturizing um it's also almost glowy like it's giving me that glowy do you see that my face is like glowing which is really nice who doesn't want a glowy face yeah I have no bad things to say about this I also switched to my iPhone just because my camera battery died but I don't know why I charged my battery last night the entire night and then it died on me the microphone doesn't work sometimes so we're just gonna settle for what works and I hope this quality is okay right now I'm filming filming from the front camera so it might be a bit lower quality so but I'm sorry for the audio and I'm sorry for all these weird angles but this is what you're getting this is what I'm gonna do it's keeping the ball rolling for me already so this is my face with a bit of moisturizer on some blush and my eyebrows on otherwise I have no concealer on my face I have no foundation in my face I just want you to see what it looks like I will say this I enjoyed this face mask I would do it again and I would repurchase it I liked how the essence wasn't tacky started the mail man it was like coming in distracted I have a package coming so I'm I don't see him holding box or anything so I think we're okay anyways who would repurchase this mask and I would reuse it and I would recommend it to people with dry aging skin I guess I'm 23 years old I'm not sure what one you're supposed to start using anti-aging products I've never used an anti-aging product before but I would recommend this mask I liked how the essence wasn't very sticky and I liked how it wasn't very thick it seemed like it really adhered to the skin and the skin really sucked it up real nice what else I liked the fragrance it wasn't overwhelming it was like a hint of like freshness a bit of cleanliness yeah so if you're not into super fragrant masks I feel like that would be for you I would recommend it Danijela creations 24k anti-aging mess 24-hour K gold wow wow wow", "rlJNs1LWLjw": "along my journey people questioned why I was

pinch me it says supreme 24 karat gold foil mask and it looks like this and it's by i don't know how to say that brand z-o-z-u i don't know how to say that brand but so this is supposed to help moisturize and smooth the skin help improve dry and dehydrated skin keep skin moist which is really good during the winter time so i can't wait to try this so i'm gonna open it and i'm gonna leave it on for 15 minutes it says 15 to 20 minutes but always leave it on the less amount of time because my skin sensitive so i'm gonna open this and put it on and then leave it on for 15 minutes and then come back and tell you how my skin feels okay so very little bit of smell to it and it's just a white mask and let's see if i can get it open [Music] do [Music] so i'm gonna leave this on for 15 minutes come back and tell y'all how my skin feels i thought it was going to be gold but it wasn't it just looked like this so i'm going to leave it on for 50 minutes and come back and tell y'all my skin feels so be right back so i left this mask on for 15 minutes like i said this is what it looks like and there is a lot of serum in this mask so if you really need the hydration this is a great mask to try i'll link it down below if i can find it but we're gonna rub it in and there is a lot on my face so i'm gonna put some down my neck as well because that's what i do when there's a lot on there so all you have to do is let this sink in and then your skin will be good so my skin looks hydrated and it was hydrated and soft and i like that i did not have no burning sensation or anything because y'all if you are new here my skin is really sensitive so if it does burn i would let y'all know but it didn't burn when it was on and i liked it so i really recommend you try this mask during the wintertime if you have dry skin and you need the moisture i really recommend this because there's a lot of serum in it which will give you the moisture i try to do it put it on with that foil on there but it kept not working out for me so i just put it on like a regular mask but that's what that foil is you put it on then you just pull it off and it's supposed to be right on your skin so yeah

for about $11 so out the pack you see here I got 30 sheets of this gold leaf for about $11 and it's about as big as a quarter these are 24 karat gold they are supposedly pure gold gold is interesting in that it can be flattened into very thin sheets just a few atoms thick that's why Rutherford used gold foil in his experiments when he was studying the structure of the atom and ended up finding the nucleus so the gold leaf is really fragile here's a piece of it and when I blow on it you can see it just kind of floats away so that made it a little challenging to test whether it was magnetic so here we have our gold leaf and I'm gonna put the magnet next to it I've put a bunch of paper clips and other things around it just so we can see how the magnet attracts things this is a very strong rare-earth neodymium magnet and you can see the gold foil remains unaffected another problem is well the gold foil is not attracted to a magnet it is attracted to static electricity that has an effect on it and you can see here these styrofoam balls they're attracted to this pen that I rubbed over my hair to build up a static charge the gold leaf itself is attracted to the plastic pen as well due to that static charge so touching the magnet to it I have to make sure there's no static charge on my hands or the magnet and we can see that really there isn't any attraction from the magnet in that gold it's not a magnetic substance it does not respond to magnets so that's it you can find gold foil fairly inexpensively but it's very thin very fragile and it's not attracted to magnets thanks for watching", "FhA6kDfkTgQ": "(JV) Oh, we got the middle part going now.\nVery nice. KAREN! (Bobby) She's here somewhere. Probably (JV) She really is elusive, huh? Karen?? hold on.... (Karen) Hello? *distant voice* Hiiii *everyone greets Karen*\nHey, how's it going? (Bobby) Good how are you?\nI'm doing well Can I take your bag for you? Oh, my gosh, thank you. (JV) It's the most stylish\nsuitcase I've ever seen. This is super stylish. Ed, obviously, Bobby, JV...\nNice to meet you. (JV) Nice to meet you, too. How was it being in Taunton.\nYou got here yesterday, right? Yeah.\nOh, my God. It's so pretty. *surprise and confusion from everyone* What did you just say? Did you just say it's pretty in Taunton? Yeah! Pretty shitty! We just got to go for it\nKaren, so I'm going to be putting you\non the spot a lot while you're here. OK, are you good with that? Oh, I'm totally a nervous wreck.\nSo, I mean, I think. Perfect. Karen, you want to explain\nwho you are and why the hell you're here? Karen, I make some Dice maybe sometimes (JV) what an understatement. Is it a company that some\npeople have heard of perhaps um, Dispel Dice? I actually was going to call it Decent Dice when I started cuz I was like,\noh, these dice are pretty OK. Decent Dice?\nYeah Where did Dispel come from then? So I play a wizard in DND. I like a lot of utility\nwizard spells when I play. So it's the nerdy side coming out. Karen is underplaying\nexactly what she does. Karen is the founder of Dispel Dice. The Kickstarter is actually so big that it made its way into Wyrm Lyfe. Dude,\nlike look at these Dice (Nick) they are insane, like no\none is making Dice like these You guys just kind of came out of nowhere\nand just like shook the industry. Everyone was like, \"these are the craziest Dice.\" They weren't decent,\nthey weren't pretty OK. We have a bunch, hold on,\nwe have a bunch of Dispel Dice. We should take a look at them. We're going to show these like people\naren't familiar, people fucking know. So what's in here.\nLike what is this. (Karen) I have it all in my suitcase. So look at this... So have you guys ever....It's like when\nyou wrap presents sometimes you wrap it in like mylar if youre doing\na gift basket. (Bobby) Yeah, yeah, yeah. So these are like plastic sheets\nof Mylar that I cut up and then I crumple a certain way and then I put it in\nthe Dice and then I pour resin into it. So this isn't like a standard design. Like every single D20 is essentially going\nto look a little bit different depending on like how the material\nfalls when you pour it right. Yeah, definitely.\nThat's pretty. That's super sick. Hey everyone! We're a little\nlopsided, I feel like we got to even out. *team rambling* I want to talk about Dice 2.0. First of all, I'm pretty sure everyone has introduced\nthemselves individually. But this is Karen and yeah, Karen is here from Dispel Dice. And we are doing a big ol' collaboration and she's going to be here\nfor the next couple of weeks. She's going to be turning Dice. We set up a spot right in like laser land\nright next to Paige ca-casting dice. Karen, is there anything you'd like to add\nabout yourself? A fun fact perhaps? No. This is Dice 2.0, not only for us,\nbut for Dispel as well. This is going to be the second time in the\nworld that Dispel Dice are even for sale. If we can capture this story like we did\nin Modular Gaming Table, I think that there is a very,\nvery good chance that this could be bigger than it already is going\nto be on the surface. This should be, as far as backers,\nthe biggest Kickstarter we've ever done. The Dice we did eleven thousand. I mean, what did your Kickstarter do? 20,000 something... Yeah, I see no reason why this\nshouldn't be extremely big. So speaking of Dispel, Karen is here to actually develop new Dice\nthat were not in the last Kickstarter. How do you feel about actually bringing\nback the most popular sets from your campaign and just recycling\nthem into this campaign? I think that I would prefer\nto release new designs. We've been fulfilling the old\ndesigns for some time now. I'm excited personally\nto make some new stuff. We had 20 last time. I'm thinking something like 15. You want to develop 15 new sets\nof Dice while you're here. Yeah. Hey, that's fucking sick\n. Like I think that's great. Don't get it wrong.\nYou know, I think that's great. I just want to make sure we're setting\nrealistic goals for ourselves. Master work Dispel. I want to make something\nso ungodly stupid. What's the most expensive\nDice that you could make? Because I wanna get like, could we go out and get....\nwe need gold flakes Like I said, I want to go out and get twenty four carat gold\nput it like flecking for real. There's no way we can do it at scale. So I want you to basically be like, all right, I got this idea and this\nset of Dice would be 500 dollars and then I want to make a fifteen hundred\ndollar Vault to go with it. 24 carat gold flakes is very doable.\nThat's hot. I made it an inlayed Vault for my wife and it was eighty six dollars\nfor the material to do one border. So we could also do gold leaf. Gold leaf is a lot more doable. Do an engraving inlay whatever leaf, copper, gold, silver,\nwhat have you. And then you can put another material on the top\nand the gold leaf *sound starts to muffle as Dimitry zones out* Definitely could be a doable thing. How blue sky are we talking here? I want to go like, once you get to like OK,\nthat's ridiculous. Go one more step and then push it.\nOK just to give you an example,\nlast year we sold the tungsten T20's for fifteen hundred dollars a piece\nand we sold them, a lot of them. The T20 is the next thing\nI want to talk about. We are bringing the T20 back.\nIt's going to be bigger. It's going to be better,\nit's going to be tonyer. It's going to be almost double the size,\ndouble the weight, AND sharp edge. *everyone talking* How heavy is a shipment of this. Oh we don't make any money we make ZERO dollars. This is so crazy, I want to lose\nmoney... I just, just for the fact that we have it is so great.\nSee what I deal with, Matt? (Matt) I share an office with this dude I like high variance. How\npopular was high variance? A little bit.\nIt was like, \"eh\". I don't think it's worth the amount of SKU's you guys\nare gonna have to deal with. I'm totally fine saying\nfuck high variance. I'm totally fine.\nI agree with her 100%. I think we look at the numbers from the last Kickstarter\nand then we make the decision. What I would like to see is high variance\nD20 across the board on everything. If it doesn't do well\nafter this, it's dead. I think that's the best chance\nfor it to be successful. OK, one last thing. What\nabout spindown D20's? Oh, my God, no. No one cares about Magic. (Karen) I care! No one gives\na shit. ADD-ONs, A Dispel Vault. We want a Vault that is kind of like a Dispel x Wyrmwood\nkind of Kickstarter exclusive. You got a little something? I got a few little somethings. S-s-s-s-sit down. Sit down. The classic go to for a lot of things that we offer, we always kind\nof tend towards the cherry. Then we go the BoRo and brass and typically the ebony and something\nspecial and right now it's aluminum. However,\nsince and going along the same vein as the two things coming together\nand going crazy, I went a little further and I decided, what if they put\ntheir resin in the Vault instead? (Bobby) So wait that's the resin that..... No, no, this so this is just an idea to represent it is resin\nand not like the typical stuff. So you're saying if they get a Dispel set, they can get whatever resin they\nbought inlaid into the Dice Vault? If you want to be complicated or\nDispel makes a Dispel resin and it's in their Dispel vault.\nIs that doable? No, I think this is totally doable. I think that there's going to be some\nlogistics things for us to figure out. But I think this would be such a lovely marriage between our two mediums,\nI would be really, really excited. I think that's great. If people can get\na set of Dispel Dice and then get a Dice Vault to match that uses the resin,\nthat's really cool. But is that complexity that we can handle? I'm super skeptical\nthat we can even do it. Like, would you try. Oh yeah, we should definitely try. It needs to look the same. The Dice Vault to the Dice if we\ncan get that going to be hot. Let's talk about our\nother partner, Guinness. Guinness has been great. I'm spearheading the actual event.\nHere's the thing. I want to do it outside in PA. I want the Kelly Mennonite\nspy cam to capture it all. And I want Crazy Ed to create a fireworks\nshow to celebrate when we actually hit it. If we have enough backers, I'd really like to line these Dice up\nto James's house, if we could. That be kind of fun.\nJust so everyone's on the same page. The record is Dice just lined up\nin a sequence, they must be touching. The record is like over 6000. We are obviously going to crush that. I think an elementary\nschool is the holder now. *everyone laughing* Fuck those kids i gotta go, boys! *Rock music plays* We just got some new sweatshirts and I was curious, what do we think\nabout the fit check of Doug? Terrible, they're so tight. (JV) That is a tight fit. It looks good.\nDoes it? New style for Doug,\nnever seen you in a hoodie. I don't think I've ever\nseen you in a hoodie. (JV) This is different. I feel cozy. They are, I'm telling you, they're tight,\nthese are poorly made sweatshirts. These are poorly made sweatshirts,\nthis guy, do you want one? Yeah, Extra large I think.\nIt's OK, it's a little tight. but it's... (JV and Doug) Looks good, looks good.

this is my batter the daughter you're not here to violate me on my own channel anyways today we are going to be reviewing a product that's why I'm in this video with not Michael so so tell them what we're reviewing our reviewing demora under eye patches 24 karat gold on dry patches it's a skin care range that at clear off cosmetics have brought out and they basically want us to review it and the reason we are doing mother and daughter is because they need to have it tested also on an older person which is mate with saggy under eyes at my mom I'm gonna test them out and so is my mom will gonna be testing them out test them out for 10 days and we're gonna update you guys throughout this video the thing I like about them are T's I've already looked at some reviews on Amazon where clear off cosmetics actually sell these they come in either box of 15 or a box of 20 they're supposed to help with so many things under-eye puffiness tiredness they're so unique because you can put them in your bag and take them anywhere you would mainly use some other night time really when you are relaxing swear I like to do most of my spa kind of treatments on my face you know yeah she open this box and like before the video I know is inside the box they actually give me a scratch card I think if you scratch it there would be something behind it for you to like win so you're not just getting the patches you are also getting a scratch card in there so like a little fun game so you won't know unless you scrapper I'm gonna scratch them I know let's see she's gonna scratch Congrats you won five free pairs of I mas and then you have a coat so I'm gonna cover my code but as you can see it says that we have ones so you get like a fun little game inside the box so you basically purchasing them and also getting some for free if you do win it's pretty amazing what we're gonna do is we're going to show you the package in there and that's the inside of the box this is the actual package today we're going to show you the product and not only show you the product but we're gonna put the product on wear it for the next ten days in this box there is 20 between mother and daughter we're gonna have ten each so we will wear them for 10 days start starting today well update we'll update you at the end and show you and tell you what we thought of this product that sounds pretty amazing already those are the reviews on Amazon they're really really good I'm expecting to have a brilliant review at the end of this to come back and give you an update on how it's affected our skin and obviously this girl has younger skin so she doesn't have all the puffiness and the dark circles so I am going to open mine and I'm gonna show you what they look like it says at the back to remove all makeup initially our clean skin before putting this on this is what they look like okay so that's what it looks like it applied on and you open it there's quite a lot of liquid in the package and that is what absorbs into the under eye now it is my turn to attempt to put these on its kind of tingly but not in a bad way like mint eating leave now it definitely feels refreshing because like I've had mine on now for like approximately like a minute or two and I do feel like a refreshing kind of feeling it's not like all the ones that I've ever used before I have used or the ones before and they don't have the same feel Italy feels like it's doing something straight where you can feel a lovely cooling effect hopefully it will help me with all the - underneath my eyes and the dark circles here it is we are going to leave this on now for half an hour and we will update you guys will update you from my angle as an amateur person I'll update you from my angle he updated for the second part in 10 days love you guys I'm getting out of it because I don't want to be on camera with that you just tripped over the wire hi guys welcome back to my channel this is the update on the review of the 24 karat gold under eye patches from clear cosmetic we're back to give you an update basically we did the first part of the review where we showed you how we applied them and what there were four we have had a box of 20 we've had to separate them and have ten each you've been wearing them there for ten days for the first say three days we decided not to put them in the fridge to put them on and then after that the next seven days we put them in the fridge an hour before to see if there was much of a difference between putting them in the fridge or not putting them in the fridge when we put them in the fridge and we applied them the amount of puffiness that went down compared to not putting it in the fridge was a lot better I love them I love the way that they felt as soon as you put them on they were really cooling underneath the eye I felt that they were doing something you wore them for twenty to thirty minutes and then you take them off leave the residue on your eyes to let it just dry now I'll let my daughter tell you how she felt I absolutely love them I usually put them on and a night time while I'm relaxing and and they really felt refreshing under my eyes if that was a main thing about them there really like calling and refreshing I don't like a minty fresh feeling that's the only way I can describe it really like deep puffed my undereyes I after taking them off not that you had much no I didn't really have much puffiness but I did a little bit because I don't really sleep early so I did need them and I did see that there was a major difference they brightened my eyes daddy puffed my eyes you know after even one use you could tell a difference even the darkness on Tunisia always actually a lessened quality yeah after a while the darkness on your eyes actually like start to you like well it lessens it actually widens I mean under mine mine were really really puffy I made so puffy they stuck out I mean if you can see they're not as puffy as they looked in the first video that we showed you when we were telling you that we were going to review these I think they're amazing I love the way that my skin feels underneath it's actually feels like it's tightened the collagen because in older people obviously the collagen lessons after the age of 25 and then because I'm 51 it's lessened quite a lot I think it's done a miraculous job I love it and like for younger people I obviously won't have that much puffiness or like wrinkles but it does really help with younger people as well not every young person goes to sleep early I don't know one young person that goes to sleep early so they do have puffiness a little bit of puffiness so it's just great for like all like age growing older people workforce youngers it is pretty good as well I just love the fact that when you put them underneath your eyes within like 30 seconds you didn't actually realize that you've got them on there was so comfortable I'm just worried about after when I've run out all these bags gonna come back all the lines gonna come back is the darkness gonna come back but you know if if I don't want it to come back then I'm gonna have to get some more of these because these are absolutely fantastic I love them clear of cosmetics you have done amazing I love this product I have seen only makeup on your site and didn't even realize that you did like skincare and stuff like that so happy to have used this product reviewed it and actually can tell you my point of view and show you as well thank you so much for allowing us to review these products I'm really happy as an older person and my daughter happy she loved them she loved them and she was right about saying that they were very comfortable because I've tried over like under eye patches before from different brands and like they were really like scratchy I don't know why they were scratchy but they're really scratchy under the eye and with these they were like really soft and like you did not notice that they were there I kind of had them one a little bit longer than 30 minutes to be honest but um no they're like really really amazed by other thing that I actually loved about the product is that when I want to do like a normal face masks throughout the sheet1 I can put the sheep face mask on and the pie patches at the same time and I'm getting a complete I mean a complete what you call it pampering session but with the benefits obviously of the results and how it effects and what it does I'm I'm like really happy in my mind I like kind of like less purple I don't really die so would i buy it again would I have it again yes definitely and don't forget we have the scratch card so we won some as within this five stars definitely if I could give more than 5 stars I would give it more than 5 stars but a hundred percent this is absolutely a brilliant product and if you guys want it as well I will link it down below in the description box because literally you need your hands on

no no watch it all ah how's that I'll put that in you stop posing because I'm not putting that in [Music] [Music]", "kXKV3wgPQjA": "put any makeup on or apply anything else to our skin well and I do think that especially in the red carpet moment we're gonna very quickly see it takes a village yes we've got to start a little early for that moment and I think with what you're gonna see next from Peter Thomas Roth is a really wonderful opportunity to do just that these are called the hydrogel 24-karat I masks this is I'm gonna go ahead and say my pick of the show this J's pick of the show these things are magical oh yeah you start to think okay what's in there no no no 24 karat gold featured price which are gonna see click on that item number if you want to Alberti I'm so jealous right now just unsealed with flora Geller so I will leave you that Tiffany is here from PTR oh hey girl hey side braid I love everything gorgeous fabulous alright you here's the set why do we need an eye mask in mine more importantly why did you pair it with 24 karat gold oh that's a great question 24 karat gold is all about firming your skin and that delicate under-eye area is so difficult to firm and smooth out all those fine lines and wrinkles so Peter Thomas Roth put these in these beautiful gel hydrogel patches that are infused with 24 karat gold collodial gold to help firm the appearance of that under-eye area it also has hydrolyzed collagen in it to give you that that plump and that bounce back underneath that eye it also has hyaluronic acid so if you're looking for hydration and moisturization under your eye area this is the perfect go-to mask you can apply them right after you've cleansed your skin I love to do this like the first thing after I cleanse my skin in the morning when I'm actually like putting my eyeshadow on it helps prevent shadow falling which is a cool tip too on how to use these yeah or you can do these as like a midday pick-me-up and apply them over top of makeup and when you remove them you get that beautiful luminosity and glow from the 24 karat gold and what's better than giving yourself instant results with it as well so as you'll see in just a second these masks when you leave them on the skin you will have instant results once you remove them just 10 minutes later check out the before and afters on your screen right now how amazing is this like waves of aging and yeah for and in the afters it doesn't even look that the same person exactly you know this is what Peter Thomas Roth is known for he's known for breakthrough formulas that give you a stunning results if you're like the before and you have that crepeiness under your eye if you have that dehydration like this woman does under her eye area look at what you can get immediately after using these 24 karat gold hydrogel eyepatches for 10 to 15 minutes this is immediate result so we're not asking you to do this for four weeks six weeks eight weeks like you do not have to wait to get that smoother looking under eye like in the after and in this one I mean this is somebody who's in her late 30s she's starting to get those fine lines and wrinkles in the before she has a little bit of dryness we call those dry lines and you know if you just need that like instant smoothness in the morning you just want to look your best you know the eye area is the area that people notice first it's like your first impression why not have a smoother younger-looking under-eye well what I always say about these eye patches is the fact that you know I put them on at my own convenience right I do them you know when I'm cleaning the house when I'm walking the dogs when I'm just running errands when I'm prepping for shows things like that you can do them that easily you just apply them you're getting 60 total patches and I can't even turn it too far over to the side because there's so much serum in here but you're getting 60 total patches it does come it does come with the little spatula to pull them out don't throw that away because you're gonna need that and then you know what's amazing is that you can use these not only on the eye area but you can actually use these on the forehead on the eleven lines on the last mile line yes you know I will tell you a lot of times before I come on air I will take these and put them on and then I put my sunglasses over so some people don't even realize that I have them on and it's great while I'm using that but I do think going back to when you saw those before and afters you are getting technically 30 different eye masks which is awesome with the quantity that you're getting here but they have instant results eyes are the quickest skin really on your complexion to show the signs of aging and the fact that you can have that incredible turnaround instantly and not have to wait for 812 weeks is really why you trust Peter Thomas Roth superior skin care expert and you're gonna want to use these over and over again you're seeing Christine she's actually using them two different ways right exactly so she have hide these under her eye she actually applied the fat part in the corner of her eye so she wanted to address her crow's feet in the corner for eye if you have under eye you know puffiness or discoloration or you want firmness underneath your eye because you have that creepiness underneath your eye you can use them the reverse I actually put the fat part underneath my eyes so Christine is going to show you how to do that there are two different ways that you can use them and Christine's also using them on our forehead you know if you have fine lines and wrinkles on your forehead if you have the classic 11 marks those are a great place to use them if you want to use them for your laugh lines those are a great place to use them so they're really multi-purpose and you're getting really potent anti-aging ingredients here in this formulation with the 24 karat gold the collodial gold you have that hydrolyzed collagen that's going to give you that youthful plump back to your skin you're gonna get all of these ingredients infused into this really unique hydrolyzed eye gel and they're so easy to use they just cling to your skin and you're also getting a really great deal because if you purchase the eye patch masks like individually sold they're 5 bucks a pair here you're getting 30 pairs that's 60 different patches altogether 30 pairs imagine 30 times 5 bucks each I would rather just pay 3 payments of $22 and 73 cents and have the whole thing at home this stays in my top drawer in my bathroom like yes not leave my counter tomorrow right this is the kind of thing that like when you see the results you're like to the nightstand you know cuz you just wake up and you're like the turnaround especially with the texture underneath your eye take a look at some of these results because I mean this is the kind of thing that if you've never ever seen Peter Thomas Roth or you've been having that age-old argument what do I do with my undereyes like do I have to live with this the answer is absolutely not if you've struggled with that under-eye area you know you've tried things that just don't give you the results that you're looking for I telling you try this because these are immediate results after just using these 24 karat gold hydrogel eyepatches for 10 to 15 minutes this is classic dryness you know as you approach your mid-30s you tend to get you know dryness underneath your eyes you start to develop those fine lines and wrinkles and you want a smoother younger-looking under-eye so these 24 karat gold hydrogel eyepatches are gonna give you everything that you need immediately let me ask you this how long should we realistically been be wearing them because I have noticed that they are so comfortable and it is it's been an hour there I've taken them off but even further now that we're going from the vanity to the nightstand can you wear them overnight or is that kind of pointless with how saturate with how saturated everything is you know what Russell the makeup artist here he's known for where and he's overnight so you absolutely can wear these as an overnight night mask you know for that under-eye area but to get the results like you saw in the before and after photo you only need to wear them pretend to 15 minutes but I will tell you there are really powerful anti-aging ingredients in here flip them over get w's out of them wear them all night long yours under eye area your skin under your eyes will love you for it well I love the fact that Peter and Tiffany when they come and they when they break make products and bring them to be tiq not only give us great ingredients but also great savings so pick them up here while you get a chance they're at a super great discounted price and you can pay for them over the next three months so 22 dollars and 73 cents on a credit card to use this item number if you're going to beauty iq.com type

you should do an action action welcome back guys to sr audio vlogs i think it's vlog number nine or something like that uh today in this video we are going to look at project menace there it is it's back we're going to be going on some wheels and maybe put the headlights and stuff back on today depending on what our time frame is like martin's working on the e63 up there we'll take a quick look at that and see what he's up to and we took my father's iseta out uh for a quick spin the other day in the snow we tried to do some uh fun stuff with it we'll show you that and we took it out today in the sun so we'll give you some clips of uh inceta other than that we've got a whole bunch happening in the shop uh let's go and see what happens in the rest of the video here they are the wheels we've been waiting for for so long 17 inch dayton knockoffs we're going to put them on the car test them out and see how they look uh look at this this is the adapter now the cool thing about these adapters let me put my mask on the cool thing about these adapters is they tell you it's left side or right side so the wheel doesn't spin off while you're driving if it's on the incorrect side so we're putting the left side wheels on today just to test them out it's a regular four by four and a half wool pattern and let's do this let's see where we get to okay so this is the one yeah [Music] i'm going to get an extender for the socket yeah you get that so what's really weird about this is that because we do a lot of european cars and uh non-american cars usually our bolts are literally bolts not just nuts on studs so in this case uh he has to go get an extended socket because uh we usually don't deal with this kind of stuff we usually have we don't use nuts or anything anymore so he's getting an extended socket so we can clear this so once we do that we're gonna test on one of these wheels uh so these are 24 carat or gold-plated uh centers right here 24 karat gold plating chrome wheels with a dayton chrome onion gold knockoff which looks like this [Music] it's pretty damn cool then then they even send you a hammer it's so it's a it's lead this thing's so heavy and this thing literally you have to knock it on to get it on and also tells you the side left side so you can't screw that up pretty cool okay so the dates are going on i've been waiting for this for almost two months so are the bolts clearing my friend um yeah sitting fresh there's no plenty business no it's perfect how cool is that all right yeah it's the simplest wheel is all around okay bring it down oh yeah look at this that is awesome oh it's gonna be amazing guys i'm so excited about this car one of my childhood dreams ever since i saw the movie medicine society i wanted to build this car my good friend decided to build it before me but it doesn't matter it's here and we're doing it right now [Music] okay let's do the backwards let's see what happens with the back down bam that's what i'm talking about yeah okay let's put the top down i'm gonna sit in it and pretend i'm 20 years ago [Applause] okay so there it is let's take a look at this thing let's take a look at this thing oh it was gonna be awesome i can't believe it's a little down hood's closed brings back good memories there this is it we have so much to do though okay i gotta take a picture so the guy actually i'm building this for he's gonna be ecstatic he's wanted this as long as i've wanted it it looks awesome got a lot to do though we have the interior to do the roof to do all the lighting all the moldings the rear luggage compartment the audio is not done yet a lot to do but we're going to button up the outside today and hopefully uh get a few good pictures of it before it goes back to interior it's gonna be awesome so i guess it actually started for a while because look at this so we haven't gone to the exhaust yet we're replacing it there's obviously some water some condensation sitting in the mufflers which have given you this rusty water so we'll probably change that up anyway but i wasn't expecting it on my floor anyway we've got a lot to do we'll do that tail lights we'll put this back uh luggage rack on and stuff like that uh it'll be cool it's gonna be a really cool car uh check it out in the future videos guys when this is done it's gonna be amazing a delivery phil what is this it's a urus in for a bunch of upgrades wow it is brand new it is from me yeah hello how are you doing where'd you bring this thing from so we get a lot of these uh cars just dropped off to us uh without me knowing because my guys know i don't really know what's happening but this car is coming from lambo calgary i guess he just bought it and who wants some modifications done we'll ask phil about it in a second hi when we need to move these uh cars out and get the carrera gt uh the tires swapped so do you want to move the party or do you want me to throw me here you're gonna move it that's a big responsibility is that a cool start raymond sure it's all up to you buddy [Music] okay another cold start yeah why not oh god oh yeah i'm gonna help martin put on the exhaust for the e63 so he's gonna move the hangers so we don't have to fight and the only thing you have to do is basically is hold let's just put it on here yeah and they just put the clamps over you don't have to settle them how much do you think that weighs uh it's actually really light anything amg is already a performance exhaust um i don't know maybe 30 40 pounds okay hold and i do the punch [Applause] there you go just like this and just like that so martin always makes me work because he's lazy but i can't say that because people hate me on the internet when i pick on martin the mechanic how do you feel martin be nice to me be nice to the guy okay what's that what's that so i'm a bit anal so everything has to be the right way and it's got to match the other side martin is ready to do the rest oh gosh you are good okay that's it thank you thank you you're welcome thank you for checking it out so uh the wheels off the cgp so these are ceramic brakes or they're supposed to be ceramic brakes on this car the owners um before i bought it uh the owner put on steel brakes because he took it to the track a few times i have the ceramics they're in a box somewhere just in case i ever want to go back to them i like it on the steel brakes for now just so if i can use the car i don't damage the factory originals it's really cool this setup uh you have these five bolts that hold the wheel on sorry the five studs that the wheel slides onto this is the center lock spindle where the nut goes this is the nut so it literally slides on like this and then screws on so really cool thing about this car is the nut colors are different red goes on the driver's side so left hand side and blue goes on the passenger side for uh left hand drive so you can't mess this up it only goes one way left is red right i'm not so bad come on ed it's a pretty old tire oh i got it there we go what's going on we're cleaning up this wheel it's pretty dirty and then ray when he gets new cars in especially cars of this caliber he likes to get all the wheels nice and clean before we put them on so there's still some work i need to do before i can actually get this wheel on again so give me a little time so we're gonna go find the parts for the mustang now it's a lot of fun yup you are right so we are looking for you found the headlights we are looking for grills well the back rail's got that you know like the lines in it right so that that's already been refinished so i know these are that already that's carpet yeah so we got some carpet so this is the madness to society project all the parts uh we gotta go through and find out what we got locking rings and gaskets no idea what the hell that is what is this fog lights the center shifter bezel look what we have brand you're gonna like this one it is the mustang sign for the dash i think on the dash yeah look at that oh armrest cool that's a nice color oh we got some drywall screws from ford yeah don't know what those are for but they're drywall screws oh switches i ordered some switches here are yours broken for the top so we ordered those okay so as i've showed you guys in a different video this is the the template for the tail light see so it's already grooved so you put those in here paint this body color which will be green in our case and then you peel these off so the reds show is that what they are for sure what are they green in the movie uh we'll have to check but i'm i'm fairly sure it's the same color as the car do you want to go get my scooter what do you mean how fast the center does at least 40. how about that well you gotta have two people you're not gonna put a unless you put the gopro on it put the gopro on it and come alongside no no no let me get a camera car we're going to go for a drive of that is that it we're going to do it i don't care i'm going to put a d plate on it we're going to fire it up why don't i need a battery from the inside is the booster so while we're here we have this tundra beside us it's here for a supercharger we're going to be installing it uh tomorrow and the next day once martin gets those downpipes done uh trd pro tundra it's really a cool car we have a lot to do this week i'm actually quite surprised how busy we got all of a sudden so raymond i have a question yes sir how come i don't see a door handle on the side because the door handles in the front it's a bmw setup check it out it goes like that goes like that so it's not finished yet as you can see we got batteries we got boosters we got wires hanging everywhere but it starts [Music] here we go ah let's see if this puppy starts first let's put the key in and here we go is it in neutral yeah it's in neutral oh yeah uh the gopro fell out hit my face and it still runs pretty okay i'm quite surprised how fast were we going we did 45 and i don't know where first gear is i keep going in second and uh shaking my neck but give me two sets i'm gonna go say hi to andrew and uh i'll be back no i gotta find reverse it's gonna be here somewhere okay let's try this oh so my impatience has kicked in i i can't wait for somebody to install this so i have to mess around with it so when you get a new uh headlight from lmr late model restoration you get the headlight you don't get the the adjusters or the back plate you can order them but i had all of that stuff so i just have to take it off the old headlight and move it over now i wasn't expecting to do this uh in this video or even today but i am a man of no patience so i'm gonna mess around and see how it looks right now so here's the back plate uh here are the bolts that hold it to the car but as you see there's these adjusters that are held in by these c clips right here so we're gonna move those adjusters over to the new headlight right here and then put the back plate on and slide it on into the car this is old and finicky there it is there's one there's two out that hit my face and number three number three so the black plate pieces should be easily ball just like that and then bend that around and as easy as it came off it will pop right back on so you see the ball socket that's what it adjusts it slides in to all three of those so it's nice and tight there and then you got to put the clips back on to hold it in so exactly how you took them out these hook in behind and the front one pops down here not as easy as i made it sound out there you go there's one okay number two clip is in and voila everything's been transferred except a light bulb which we can do right this second the light bulb shouldn't be this hard it's still good so we'll jam that in there and put the lock on it and that's it so now all we got to do is slide it into the vehicle like this this is the other side and there it goes right here and bang we got a headlight okay now we got a headlight what do you think that didn't take any time keep in mind there's a lot of adjustments that need to happen like i said i'm just impatient i wanted to see the car kind of look like the way it's supposed to be now i've ordered the corner lights but did i order the marker lights that i can't tell you let's take a look oh i did i did i am smarter than that i am much smarter than that so these guys go like that and i chose to keep the amber guys i really like the original look so uh i chose the amber there's clear versions of this but i don't like it i wanted to go with the amber oem style so we did and i will slide this in and see how this one looks and i should do it hold on oh i see what's happening so as you can see they have these three pin holes that actually line up the the light but they're too big for these holes so again this is not an oem part they don't make oem parts anymore so the companies that make this stuff uh they get them as close as they can but in this one case like look there's three lines that line up the the corner light but in this case the pins are too big so i i'm gonna have to either shave these pins down to a smaller size or probably drill larger pilot holes in here for it to slide right in so i can get most of it in but it doesn't go in all the way so i'll get to that later on today it is looking like a car again like i said i'm very uh impatient i needed it to look the way it did i have new fog lights new headlights new tail lights every rubber trim is new uh there's still a lot of work to do on this car but for today's episode uh you know where we're at we haven't even touched the interior yet uh audio's in uh let me quickly show you the audio before we go further two keys who the hell used to use two keys okay so so the audio uh they've done the subwoofer enclosure they've done all the fiberglassing they put the alpine amps in there's two 12-inch subwoofers that go in they're going to do that at the very end they're gonna do all the finishing all over it what have you and then we'll put all the rubber moldings and stuff so audio's there door panels are already done the dynamats in all the wiring's done so really it's assembly time right now so next video if not the next video the video after when we come back to this car uh this thing should be going to its owner uh it's gonna be awesome so martin and i had this uh argument yesterday we were in his car it's a cls 500 i believe okay 550 cls 550 mercedes and there's a button that says c s so he told me that it is comfort or standard what does that even mean how do you get comfort and standard comfort is standard that's the regular but he's like raymond i bet you five dollars because one time you took five dollars from me so this time i bet you five dollars that that's comfort and standard i said no martin that's sport he's like no it's comfort and standard let me get the booklet and show you well martin what are you giving me right now once again don't mess with the boss five dollars this is my second five dollar game from martin the mechanic i have no remorse taking it well let's see what's happening with the uh e63 why aren't you ready to fire this thing up or not i'm ready you ready okay let's get a cold start so this is a e63 s with down pipes that arm has been putting in for two days because we have to remove the so let's see what it sounds like partner so exactly what the customer wanted he wanted it to be quiet but when he gets on he wanted it to have that really crazy rumble uh is it on now okay let's go yeah i think he's gonna love that that's that's a really good sound so really quiet when the exhaust valves are closed but when he's on it with the valves open they sound just ridiculous so guys end of the video sorry it came so fast but our main focus today was to see what was happening in the shop uh we looked at the mustang the mena society mustang it's gonna look killer with these wheels i've said it 10 times but i'm just so excited about it martin is finished at e63 over there uh he's just setting up the lights he's turning them all off and you saw my dad's aceta i gave that to him for his 80th birthday he's 85 and it's still not finished uh when he sees this video he's gonna probably say where's my setup um that's another cool little project which we'll be working on we'll probably show you what happens in the future with it guys there's a lot to do with sr auto group there's a lot that we can do keeping watching the videos we're going to continue with all these uh cool projects we have a bunch of new projects coming we have a supercharger going on a tundra we have a mansory rs6 that we have to finish or start for that matter we have

hydrates the skin it gives you that beautiful glow that your skin is just like searching for and I want to point out in terms of application you really do not need a lot of this because it starts as a solid buttery texture and then when you actually massage it into your skin it turns into that oil texture when you take the konjac sponge that actually comes with this when you dip that in the water and gently exfoliate and massage that into your skin that's actually gonna then turn into like this milky texture so you literally need like this much for your entire face I mean it just smooths over your face look at how luxurious it's just like you want to dive into that it's just so buttery and silky it feels gorgeous and when your smells so good what's that fragrance it's like maybe it's the chamomile the chamomile that you're actually set that that is that beautiful scent it smells like you just walked into like a five-star spa it really does and it's gonna be brought to you at home in your vanity you're gonna have all that experience so remember guys this is what's coming in each one of these boxes right so you're getting two sets of this one of these at retails 55 bucks you're getting both of them buy one get one here for 55 bucks that's amazing so both of them are coming home for that price and remember one is going to be that five ounce jar of the butter and then the konjac sponge now the concept konjac sponge comes in a little plastic bag it's hard when you get it home you're gonna think oh I can't put that on my face well the second you put it in water it becomes this soft cushiony amazing sponge and how long does this sponge last this sponge I've had mine in my bathroom for like three or four months and it still keeps its consistency yeah keeps it shapes gonna hang it somewhere so I love to hang this like you know read on like my bathroom sink I let it just hang and drip dry it will turn hard again so when you go back to use it you'll submerge it into water and just look at how soft it gets soft and sponge and that's what feels so beautiful on the skin with that 24 karat gold cleansing butter it's just really an all-encompassing cleansing treatment that's gonna firm your skin it's gonna hydrate your skin I know you're thinking wait a minute firming and hydrating in the same sentence that doesn't make sense to you but when you experience firming and hydrating together this is gonna really take your skin to a whole new level because everyone as we age we want that firmer looking skin but we don't want our skin to be dry and dehydrated because dry dehydrated skin is older looking skin and for this time of year perfect for this time of year it's perfect to incorporate into your skin care routine as needed yes and you can kind of switch out like if you know and love Peter Thomas Roth anti-aging cleansing gel you can incorporate that and it's kind of like you know do the cleansing butter one night do that cleanser another night but your skin is really gonna thank you for giving it that firming property but all that hydration and moisturization and how about that chamomile butter oh yes we really gonna calm and soothe your skin and you know what you know our Beauty IQ teas are geniuses out there Leanne said can you use this with a Claire sonic that is my favorite question of the night because yes you can use it with your Claire sonic you could use it with your pop sonic you could use it with anything that you want to help exfoliate you don't need to use it with any exfoliator at all in fact you could just rinse it away and wipe it away with a washcloth if you want to absolutely remember it comes I keep putting mine back in my little bowl here it comes with the konjac sponge that's super soft and lovely and it gives you that exfoliation when you want it and it really just helps to remove all that makeup now that guys remember is our Beauty IQ steal it's only good for the next 24 hours if you want it remember pick it up at Beauty accom use this item number right up here or you can call this number on your screen and you can ask one of our customer service reps to help you out and you pay for it over four months it's $13 and change to get it home and try it out all right so let's talk about the cream one more time the prison cream because I feel like we didn't get a full you know like full tutorial on the", "n8KE4KeqsFg": "Okay Rob, we're going to talk about gold\nplating stainless steel using the Universal Plater. Okay, as Terry said\nwe're set up here with the Universal Plater. This is set up particularly for\ndoing stainless steel. So we have Electro Clean here, we have the Woods\nNickel Strike here, and then our 24k Brush Gold solution, the standard brush gold. We do have it set up with the larger conversion bit which goes from\nthis little eighth inch to a bigger, so that we can have the bigger sleeves the\npurpose is to carry more solution. As we're going to be doing a larger item\nand also it just helps with doing electro clean and woods sometimes to\nhave a bigger sleeve carry more solution. So we have that on our Woods Nickel\nStrike as well and then our gold we just have the standard quarter inch gold sleeve on a conversion bit. Over here we have the piece we're going to be doing\nwhich is a 316 stainless steel so polished stainless steel finish and this\nis one of the hardest stainless steels to plate the 316. So if you can do this,\nthen you can pretty much do any steel and this is the way you would want to\ntreat any steel item that you're going to be plating. Okay, so let's just move\nright ahead. We're going to cover the concept of wetting out, that's something\nI really want to highlight. We call it wetting out and that is the\nelectro clean step. See if you squirt water on stainless steel it's just like it's a wax.. it's like it's a waxed car. The water just beads up and falls right off of it. This is a major problem. If you try and put gold straight on it\nwill not stick, it will not adhere, it'll take forever to go on,\nyou shouldn't even move forward as long as your stainless steel is doing this.\nNow the electro clean step luckily fixes that. What kind of voltage should we\nwant to have for the electro clean? well let's try, let's start out at 6 volts. What do you think of that? Yeah, six or seven, yeah \nyou're good. I'll start out six. Okay, you've shown us that the water just runs right off. Yeah we'll highlight that again. I'm going to go over the\nwetting out. Okay, so we'll start down here. We'll do like a.. like a\nfour-inch section k? Okay. So we're just going to start. You'll see a voltage drop\non the machine maybe by a volt. That's okay, that means that the currents flowing that's actually a signal that\n your.. your sleeve is soaked and that it's working properly. Why don't you hold still for a sec,shouldn't there be some bubbling at the surface? yeah it's kind of hard to see\nwith the woolie but yeah..yeah, you would see some bubbling. Okay. If you had a flat sleeve ah.. the voltage drop shows me that the.. so we dropped down from our six and now we're down about five point one volts while your\nelectro cleaning, okay. Yeah and if you weren't getting that drop then your\nsleeve may not be soaked. Prior to putting the sleeve on I actually took it\nover to a sink and ran it under running water and ringed it out in my fingers.\nJust for the first time use. It really helps the sleeve to absorb the\nsolution. Okay, so we we are going to Electro clean. You kind of.. you're okay to\noverdo this. You know notice I'm not timing it. I'm just going over it. I want\nto make sure that I'm getting everywhere very well, because anywhere that is got\nthat beading or breaking is not going, you may as well not even continue if you\nhave that. So let's check it at this point. It's probably been, i don't know, half a minute- 45 seconds. We're squirting the water on and notice, no longer is there\nwater breaks. Over here where we haven't got, see that? It's just a huge difference. Yeah, the water just falls right off, whereas over here, it stays wet. That's why we call it wetting out and if on this piece, if I\nwere to have an area over here where it's breaking, after a second, see even up\nhere on the top edge it is a little bit. But that may\njust be because it's sat for a second. I mean this looks pretty good but if there\nwere a question, you know I'm just going to go over it again for a second right\nthere. Why not? It doesn't hurt. Let's go over it a little bit more. I believe this is probably electro cleaned sufficiently at this point. So make sure you rinse off between steps, well. Now you're rinsing with what kind of water? It's distilled water. I recommend that for every step. You're using like one of those squeeze bottles. Yeah just a squirt bottle. You can get them for a couple bucks. Okay, now we're\ngoing to just get that water off, see it still wet out. Now I'm going to immediately move on to the Woods Nickel Strike, still at six volts, and I'm going\nto do about the bottom four inches here. I'm just going to quickly go over it for,\nyou know, to get everywhere just real quickly. Maybe 15 seconds. While you're\ndoing that, I'm going to.. okay, so we're getting about the same kind of voltage\ndrop with the Woods Nickel Strike as you did with the Electro Clean. Now should I expect to be able to see anything at this point? No, you shouldn't see anything. If you're seeing burning, hazing, anything like that you're probably too high on\nthe voltage but you also don't want to overdo this too much. Just a quick layer,\nit applies a non-visible. You may be able to see a difference, probably not. And then after that step, you know, it doesn't look as hydrophilic, which is odd,\nbut we're going to move straight onto the gold plating now. Now what voltage\ndo we want to be out for the gold? We want to adjust our voltage down to let's do four\nand a half. 4.5, okay. Let's see if the gold just..\nshould go right on and then one to three seconds, the area you're plating\nshould begin turning gold. If it doesn't, there's some sort of issue. It shouldn't\nbe taking 5-10 seconds to turn gold, okay. See we've already done that two square\ninch area right there. I mean it just flies on and that's what you want to see. It's\na very consistent look. You're not going to have splotchiness, you don't want to see any of that. If you're seeing that, that's probably insufficient activation or\nElectro Clean. You know, people can really have an issue with that and it's almost\nalways that. Either the Electro Clean or activation. Now notice on the Electro Clean step, I Electro Cleaned about six inches. I came about halfway up\nthe strip to about here. Now I did the Woods a little bit less, about five\ninches. Now I'm going to gold plate only about four inches and that's to make\nsure the area i'm gold plating has been fully activated. So this area now is..\nlooks beautiful. I hope you can see it good in the video there. It's a very\nuniform, nice layer of gold. Looks great! Tip it back and forth a little bit. Looks great! Roll it. Yeah! Okay. Toward me. That's good, okay. Okay, so now the.. that area is gold-plated and you know that's what you're looking\nfor. Now to move on and to do.. if I were gonna do this whole piece, I would just\nmove on here. Electro Clean this section. Do another 5 inch-6 inch section and\nthen, you know, do not for a good minute. Then Woods Nickel Strike a 5 inch\nsection. Do that just for 20 30 seconds. You know, hold your piece so your Woods\nisn't running down into your gold too much. Try and always angle your drip\nedge well. Then rinse it off and then we would go plate a four inch section and it\nwould look the same. You won't see a line here. You may want to taper over\ninto the gold. There's a half inch or so that you'll have a uniform\nplate. Those are the main points we wanted to cover in this video. If you have any questions, please comment or give us a call. But that's plating stainless steel with Universal, with Electro Clean, Woods\nNickel Strike, and 24K standard Brush Gold. Thanks!", "-1FerUQSDwQ": "hello this is rob with gold plating services and today we're going to be gold plating this tesla car emblem uh this is coated with 24 karat gold and we're going to show you how it was done we're going to be plating it using the prolab it's our new bath plating kit and we have a new special tower that we've made specifically for chrome stripping as all of these emblems have a layer of chrome on them and underneath that is nickel we're going to show you how it's done so this very first step is chrome stripping and we just set it on this rack and you can see the stripping start to happen it's going to be in here for about 30 seconds some emblems have more chrome some emblems have less usually in about 30 seconds you'll be getting most of the chrome off now the reason we need the special tower for chrome stripping is chrome stripping requires what's called reverse polarity it switches it around it makes the positive negative and negative positive after we come out of there we're going to be going into the surface activator solution and then we're going to go down to the 24 karat bright gold solution you may notice all the extra beakers here they're just they're set up for other plating jobs all right let's check it out now it's going to be hard for you guys to tell but it's already a little bit more of a tan color i'm going to go ahead and just put it a little bit longer just in case because if you don't get all the chrome off the gold plating will not stick to it the key thing to look for is when you come out of the rinse after the chrome stripping you want to make sure the part stays wet everywhere if you see anywhere where the water is drying really quickly or breaking then you did not get all the chrome off that should be good so now i'm going to come into a distilled water rinse look at it looks wet out to me nice tan color and now we're going to move down to the surface activator this is now a nickel surface and the surface activator will activate the nickel this is only about a five second step just a real quick activation and now into the magical 24k bright gold solution now we're going to leave that in there for about two minutes it'll put on a really thick layer probably about oh i don't know about a quarter of a micron for intense and purposes of an emblem that's plenty so we're going to go ahead and pause the video and get back with you as soon as it's done all right guys it's been two minutes let's check out how this masterpiece looks oh yeah it looks beautiful see just in that short time we got these two emblems done you can uh really do a lot of work with this kit i'm gonna go ahead and rinse it in distilled water and some people wonder if they can immediately handle the part yeah it's it's set there's no curing time nothing i'll get them dried off and actually they still have the adhesive backing on the back it doesn't affect it they just stick right to the car perfectly fine as if it's a normal emblem so yeah that's uh how easy it is to do 24k gold-plated car emblems and uh this tesla and will look great customers gonna love it we got them all dried off and i thought i'd just show you what they look like you may have noticed we had them clipped uh people wonder if there's gonna be clip marks as you can see there is not they look fantastic it gets all the sides and everywhere seeing brush plating works but you may miss some spots and with this you can do it multiple at a time that quick and uh get 100 coverage well thanks for watching guys again this is the prolab with the new chrome stripping tower um we also have electric cleaner set up here for if you were going to do like other items the gold strike activator bright nickel and 24k bright gold they look awesome",

extra product all over my face just this facial oil as a night cream or night product that was one week of footage for you all and I am on my 15th day of using this product on this one because so I was doing some research on facial oil whether this is worth the hype or not whether I should be using it on my combination skin and acne prone skin or not so your skin produces oil itself without any oil production your skin will be dry and eventually it will start showing the signs of aging that is fine lines wrinkles so the oil is important to maintain the hydration of your skin because oil helps in lock up the moisture on your skin any oil including the oil produced by your skin is hydrophobic in nature which means they will prevent the escaping of water from your skin and that's how they keep your skin hydrated and moisturize not only that I pay is very important role to create a barrier between our skin and the outer environment so that the chemical entered in conch and dust a bond penetrate into the deep layer of our skin now as we age the protection of oil on our skin decreases and here plays facial an important role because they could be hydrophobic apart from that they can give you some healthy skin benefits like this oil that I've mentioned has anti-aging benefits to it so that's how facial oil phase in cotton roll and any skin type can use this dry combination and oily skin people can use facial oil specially for dry skin people jitka oil production already bought dermatitis skin pip so it could be beneficial for dry skin people a lot now let us talk about what

glow it is it's completely giving you a glow a radiance and a lifting to the skin so we're gonna take a look here at edy because it's going to absolutely blow your mind so I'm gonna turn her a little bit just to show you that if you have sagging skin leaves you see the crepeiness here in that area I'm always doing that right that's how I how I am I'm in the mirror doing that right take a look at the difference with the gold repair ampule in that skin the skin is radiant it looks like it's firmer it's you know it has the appearance of being repaired the underneath of this eye is completely smoothed out your bathing your skin in pure 600 ppm 24 karat gold which helps with increasing the elasticity the collagen production in the skin and Bobbi this is something that has been used for thousands I think it's 2700 years it's just in South Korea alone for the skin brightening and evening benefits let me look at evey skin and you don't launch my mind you look at a lot of products you see some products on the market and they'll have like a few flecks of gold if when you look at this bottle this is massively packed with gold like John said there's over a gram of gold 24 karat gold just in this one bottle alone having the little dropper because what I'm finding also Chelsea it doesn't take a lot just a little bit goes a long way it immediately absorbs into your skin I love it's not sticky no it's not tacky I mean I said I put a little on my arms and like you want to do your old body with you you really do but if you go to a department store and you look at any high-end brand that has 24 karat gold in their products they could be upwards of five six seven hundred dollars a bottle so I would suggest if you want to do it on your body you can but it's so precious you really want to save it for your face I'm remember that this is east-meets-west technology so if we're taking a look here at cigarette and I want you to notice that we do something different in South Korea when applying products this is an ampule what that means to you is more powerful Bobby than your actual serums so what you do is you apply a small amount you see what cigarettes doing we want you to press it into the skin so as you're pressing into the skin all of the benefits of the hexapeptide the incredible korean lotus flower the gold are really being absorbed by the skin to help with that collagen production to help smooth out fine lines and wrinkles to help give you a brightness and a lift to the appearance of a lift and when you see what cigarette looks like in this before this was one application live and you'll see what we're talking look at okay yes this is where you stop what you're doing please look at your television screen she has absolutely nothing else on her skin and just you know we are before-and-afters they are done same spot same lighting yeah absolutely nothing changed we always say have you ever met our legal department so when you look at her skin in the after and even like even underneath the eyes it looks so dark yeah she has it pressed all the way up to up in the cheek ball look at the glow look at the lift of her skin that is gorgeous yeah and if you look at even her forehead so remember that this is an oil on her skin Bobby this is her actual radiance now coming through due to all of that 24 karat gold so if you have darkness if you have uneven skin tone if you've tried everything this is really amping it up by utilizing an ampule and itchin one of the most sought-after prestige high-end brands there's no animal testing in South Korea because it's banned so you're getting a product that I'm going to show you close up again I'm the bottle that when you get it home it is filled with no fillers I know it's filled with collagen 24 karat gold and all of these incredible peptides that go to work to immediately start your skin just drinks it in and what it's doing is brightening helping to firm lift it has lotus flower that helps with the elasticity so you get more of like that bounce back to your skin the evening primrose gives you radiance it's truly an east meets west ampule it's not for the faint-hearted yeah you have to have seriously like you're aging your skin is aging I would say you know 40 and up wrinkles deep lines this is a serious serious anti-aging ampule I can't believe it and the texture of it is so different but it's the gold and when you look at your skin you put on your skin you can see the gold just oh it melts right so the go light and you put the serum onto gold melt into your skin and then you get this gorgeous glow first of all thank you and I know we have a lot of people still calling for the jeans if you can go to hsn.com and shop shop via your app that's the way to do it to me that's always a quick fast easy way and we have such a limited number of these to go around a few of the 2000 already left of the whole country it was launched with launching it in this hour and just I'm telling you just when you look at this is the actual you're going o it wants you to be able to put it I brought it for you don't try to take my gold Bobbi give me that gold look at that so that's the actual gold I'm holding it right next to your and by the way this is three point three eight ounces have you ever in your life ever seen a gold serum 3.38 ounces you look at $52 if this were ever in the retail market you'd be slapping what a to in front of that or even more yeah yes yeah of course it's all because it's a combination of east meets west so what we're talking about is this incredible 24 karat gold what you're like why do I need 24 karat gold do you know that there are women right now in South Korea that are paying thousand dollars to go to a spa to apply 24 karat gold sheets to their face because it's been proven for thousands of years to brighten to help firm to help with the elasticity to help with the collagen production and so needs in this incredible company is now making it available for you to get those same benefits but in the comfort of your own homes yeah so you just apply it to clean dry skin I'm gonna go back to edy because I want to show you you get these incredible immediate beautiful radiance but the skin over time just looks better and better and better and you want to use it first so you can use it without anything I mean dry skin dry skin if you have a serum you love put it on top if you have a moisturizer go ahead and put that on top but your ampule is the 24k in this first sure yeah yeah once you start seeing the results you'll want to and by the way don't think we are shipping this to you for free 4 flex pay payments and that we only a handful of lucky people in this entire country will have the opportunity to be able to have this serum and if you follow Chelsea in the beauty spy listen last night Chelsea had a show I think almost every single item sold and a little crazy but this we are this week's the hots for you this was easy today and it is something you know and I always say this I think really one of the biggest signs of aging is that dull drab you know uneven looking skin yeah absolutely so it's really about changing your entire skin from not just lines and wrinkles and that sagging skin but it's about a brightness like you're saying Bobbi a radiance and a health that you can get back to your skin you guys here companies every day talk about peptides right there's the age defying peptides this product actually contains the most advanced peptides but it's cocktailed with ingredients that have been passed down for generations to generation from these beautiful women in South Korea with that click with the 24 karat gold to give you even more of a powerful powerful anti-aging serum you can see the ingredients again Bobbi right there right now hyaluronic acid 24 karat gold actually in your one purchase today you're getting a gram of gold the collagen 10 peptides and then on top of it there are actually 30 front botanicals you know if you're a beauty a beauty junkie like I believe you're watching right now you are and you follow on all of the beauty bloggers and everything that is new and exciting is coming from South Korea well Harriet it comes down they are the mecca exactly yeah it's the hub and the reason why Bobbi is because women in South Korea spent two times more than any other country in the world on skincare so they have more skincare manufacturers and more technology and they would say in the beauty industry not me saying it that South Korea is actually five to ten years ahead of everywhere else in the world when it comes to technology I'm because they're moving at such a fast rate but they have a real belief in using traditional Korean ingredients that have been passed down like I said but with today's science and the new age and repair ampule is just proof that was not the smart part about that is that when you take great care of your skin right when your skin skin looks great you don't have to worry about covering it up with all kinds of makeup exactly it is about bringing out the beauty of your skin so first of all thank you over 500 and flown out of here which means I think we have like 1400 left for the whole country and the other point about this with all of these products as long as it takes to get them here when it's gone is it though oh this is oh yes I'm sorry yeah I don't mean to be yeah I mean but yeah you guys listen at the end of the day I mean I'm totally transparent about what I do at the beauty spa and I think you know me I'm on Instagram you can come visit I get on a plane i'm flying sixteen thousand miles round-trip to work with these incredible companies to bring you guys products that you wouldn't find here in the US that are gonna do these kind of results so it was super hard for us to actually get this product because it's such a big seller over in asia it was like no i need some and so finally the new agent eeeem allowed us to get the repair ampule i'm telling you if you have skin and you're looking in the mirror thinking gosh i use a lot of skin care and it's just not next level this is an ampule it's a repair ampule that means fine lines and wrinkles that are deep uneven skin tone utilizing copper peptide tripeptide one bobby thirty natural botanicals and pure i can't that's crazy about 24 can you prove it when you take overseas when you buy an Bill's 9 times out of 10 because there isn't this really huge spot it was $50 for like one tiny mule when you look at three you're getting three point three eight ounces the fact that when it is gone it is gone so you're not gonna see this again three point three eight ounces think about how many ampules there are in just this one jar that you're buying today for $13 on any credit card debit card PayPal by the way on your HSN card it's ten dollars my gosh ten dollars get it home try it you will not be disappointed and when you press it into your so my gosh and you write is ridiculous see the gold and the gold flakes melt into your skin it is astonishing different know and a lot of people do say to me they're like hey are we gonna see the gold on our skin and I say I want to see so you will actually see the gold on your skin you have an overall golden radiance to the skin but it it doesn't interfere with anything that you're already using your skin just looks radiant I mean it has a luminosity to it I mean Bobby look at the back of my head I know I know I'm watching it in the back 50 year old hand right there all right so do not

Channel today I have another episode for you of WTF genius or epic fail and today I'm going to be talking about a very very interesting product that I put to the test the other day and I'm going to be sharing with you my thoughts my opinions and my overall review and of course I'm going to decide whether this hair product is genius or an epic fail so the hair product that I put to the test is the Peter Thomas Roth 24 karat gold pure luxury age defying hair mask and bonnet system WoW is that a mouthful so this is what the kit looks like as you can see it comes with a jar of the 24 karat gold hair mask it comes with this very interesting contraption that you put on your head and you connect a blow-dryer through it and it's supposed to be a deep conditioning treatment for super super dry hair and make it shinier silkier and healthier overall so I'm going to start at the beginning and unpack this kit for you to show you what it comes with where we get into that I just wanted to show you that on the back of the box you get all of the full instructions on how to use it is very very simple to use and the instructions are very very easy to follow so you open up the kit like this and it comes with this pouch over here when you open up the pouch this is going to be that contraption that I showed you guys before so this is what it looks like you're supposed to tighten this over your head and then secure this under your net and this little hose is where the hot air blows through and at the very end here you can supposed to put this over the nozzle of a blow dryer so I have to say the packaging on this is absolutely amazing everything feels very very high quality although I have to say there's a couple things that I didn't really like about it for example this little strap that is supposed to go around your neck to make sure this stay secure it wasn't really aligned with the center of the bonnet so the hose kind of came out in a very awkward position either had to come out from the front of my forehead or from the very back I would prefer for it to come up from the side that way it's much easier for me to hold on to the blow dryer or position it on surface while it was doing its thing and I really like that it comes in a little carrying case like this because when you're not using it you can easily store it and it doesn't take up that much space and you also got six of these disposable shower caps there's only five of these left because I did use one of them and then you get the actual jar of hair mask can I have to see it as a packaging list is absolutely gorgeous I love the gold it looks so expensive and so lucky and initially it did seem like the jar came with light a bit of product but I'm going to get into that a little bit later that's what you get in the kit this kit cost me I believe 81 Canadian dollars so if you're in the u.s. it's a little bit less it's probably around these sixty five or seventy dollar mark which is kind of expensive considering what you get because honestly these disposable shower caps they cost nothing and then bought it all so the value of it should not be more than a couple dollars so essentially what you are paying for is the 24 karat gold pure luxury age-defying air mask so the thing that turned me on about this kid in the first place was this hair mask obviously because there's nothing in here that's really that interesting but the thing that sold me on this and really wanted me to try it out was that it has collodial gold in it and colloidal gold is known to have a lot of benefits on the hair one of them is the prevention of hair loss so if anyone is experiencing hair loss especially due to the frigid weather this time of year this could really help with that and another thing that really sold me about it is that it is targeted for people with super super dry hair in general all year round my hair and my skin is super dry but in the winter it's like multiplied times a hundred and over the past few weeks because of the really really frigid air outside my scalp has really been suffering it's been really difficult for me to manage my dry scalp and the flakes that come with that I live in Canada so the weather here is colder than it is in a lot of places so that's why I really wanted to try this out to see if that would help me with my dry scalp and my dry hair issues so I'm going to read you guys what this mask promises to do on the front photos but it is an intensely rich and luxurious deep conditioning treatment patent-pending pure 24-karat gold keratin peptide complex helps to repair and strengthen dry damaged over process hair moisture is replenished strength is renewed here is les silky soft smooth shiny voluminous and revitalized that is a lot of claim alright so now that you guys know what comes in the kit and what this product is supposed to do for you I'm going to get into my review the first thing you're supposed to do is wash your hair with shampoo and then it's a conditioner only on my ends then I wash it out well you're supposed to do is towel dry your hair and try to get as much moisture out of your hair as possible and then you're supposed to apply this hair mask so that's what I did I towel dry my hair I let it air dry for about half an hour so just so that my hair was not very very damp if your hair is too damp your hair is not going to absorb anything that you put on it as well so that's why I wanted to allow it to air dry a little bit now let's get into this canal first of all I was kind of disappointed that the actual hair mouth was not gold I was really looking forward to it being a really beautiful gold colored I thought it would be a really cool experience try but whatever as long as it did what it almost to do that was something that I was going to live without I also wanted to mention that this hair mask Mel amazeballs I can't really put my finger on it what it smells like it smells like a really luxurious expensive perfume but it's not that strong but when I wash this out of my hair my hair smells amazing even my husband noticed and he commented on how good my hair smells so I really like that and I really like the texture of the hair mask the hair mask itself is on these thicker side so it felt really really moisturizing when I was applying it to my hair so before I apply this my hair what I did was gently brush on my hair from bottom to top in a wet brush just to make sure that there were no tangles in my hair and it would be much easier to apply this product and get it evenly distributed throughout my hair the issue that I had with this hair mask is that because my hair is so porous meaning that it literally I'm not even exaggerating when I tell you this it sucks up everything that I put on it even my hairdresser whenever I get my hair wash she rings out my hair it's literally a massive puddle in the middle of a floor so because my hair is so porous I used up I would say almost half of this jar if I didn't use up that much my hair would not be evenly coated and I felt like the effect would not have been as good and Donna scares me because this kit comes with six shower cap so I'm assuming that you're supposed to get six uses out of it and considering I used up almost half of it I would only get two uses out of this tub and I went on Sephora and they don't sell this mask individually you have to buy the entire kit again so for someone like me who has really porous hair this was a turn-off for me that's probably not default Peter Thomas Roth the blame is probably on my hair but if any of you guys have tried this and you have a different hair type than I do let me know if you needed to use this much or people can get away with using about a tablespoon because that was really a big bummer for me so if I were to use this entire thing up I would robably get another two uses of it if I really really tried so considering that this jar would last me three uses and it cost me eighty one Canadian dollars plus tax let's round it up to 90 dollars that's 30 dollars a treatment this is definitely a very very pricey treatment I just wanted to put that out there for any of you guys who are interested in trying this out okay so after I applied the mask all over my hair I then gathered my hair on top of my head and I used one of these shower caps to cover my head and after I use one of the shower caps you're supposed to put this bonnet over your head so this bonnet has little perforations throughout it so that the air has somewhere to escape so it's not like you're just applying all of the heat to your scalp it does have a chance to escape oh there is some circulation going on through this thing and it also has a drawstring which I showed you guys that goes around your head and that is supposed to keep the bonnet secure and prevent it from moving around that is the only thing that I wish they included in the instruction initially I secured the jaw string around my ears and made sure that it covered the rest of my hair but after turning on the blow-dryer and having it apply heat to my hair for a few minutes or so my ears started to heat up and it was very very uncomfortable so I had to take my ears out from underneath the bonnet and then adjust the drawstring so that it was still secure on my head so just wanted to give you guys a heads up about that if you are planning on trying this out once you secure the bonnet on your head what you're supposed to do is take the end of the hose and secure it around the nozzle of your blow-dryer so that's what I did it fit perfectly and from there you're just supposed to turn on your blow-dryer and put it on the low setting and let it work its magic for fifteen to thirty minutes and because I wanted to make sure that I got the maximum effects from this hair mask I decided to leave it on for thirty minutes and because I wasn't going to sit around in my bathroom for thirty minutes I decided to bring the blow-dryer and the whole bonnet contraption over with me to my office desk so that I can try to get some work done now I have to admit this was extremely uncomfortable it did get very hot at certain times but if you don't think about it it's not too bad that wasn't able to move around because I was worried that the blow-dryer was going to fall down on the floor so it is a very awkward arrangement but I kept telling myself if this is going to help my dry scalp and my dry hair and revitalize it and make it look and feel a hundred times better then that would all be worth it for me so that's what I did I sucked it out and yeah I just let myself marinate there for thirty minutes and then after the thirty minutes were up I you obviously turn off the blow-dryer removed it from the hose and then I removed the bonnet and also disposed of the shower cap and then I went back into the shower to wash out the deep conditioning mat that's another thing I wasn't such a fan of me personally after I get out of the shower I'm freezing cold especially after I wash my hair I feel like I'm a freaking wet dog so not only did I have to do that once I have to that white I wasn't such a big fan of that but as soon as the water hit my hair and I started to run at my fingers through my hair my hair already felt so much softer and silkier than it does when I just washed my hair with regular shampoo and conditioner it literally felt like silk so that really excited me so I just continued to wash out a de deep conditioning mask from my hair put my hair up into a hair turban and then I just allow my hair to air dry naturally overnight now when I woke up in the morning my hair dried so much shinier and smoother than it usually does this time of year my hair felt softer it looked healthier and my waves had a lot more definition to them than they usually do and I practically had no pra's though that was amazing and the last test that I wanted to put my hair through was to see how well it styled after that treatment so what I usually do after my hair dries naturally under percent I run over my hair with a flat iron and I use my croc infrared Flatiron that I've been using for the last three or four or five years of my life it's my holy grail flat iron it streams my hair in one pass and it is the least damaging flat iron I've ever used on my hair so I always put it on two hundred and ninety degrees Fahrenheit oh and I also wanted to quickly mention that before I style my hair with any heat styling tool I always apply a heat-protective serum and this was the only thing that I applied to my hair after the hair masque usually when I wash my hair I add in a hair oil to nourish my ends and I also add something to my scalp I didn't add any of that to my hair this time and only applied a key protectant right before heat styling my hair so that says a lot about how well this hair mask moisturize my hair and my scalp and as you guys can see our chilli have no dry flakes on my scalp usually by this time I have so much more going on that's one of the things that I've been battling for so so many years even though over the years it's gotten so much better in the wintertime it's such a struggle and you guys actually notice my dry flakes in my last WTF genius or epic fail and a lot of you guys thought it was dandruff not dandruff it is just a very very dry scalp in the brutal winter my scalp just goes crazy I love the way that my hair looks after I styled it it looked smooth it looks healthy and my hair still had that amazing smell from the hair mask and it felt so soft to the touch so overall I have to say that this hair mask is genius I love how it nourish my scalp and my hair and how it made it smell and how it made it feel and I really like this idea of having this bonnet I wish that it was a little bit more comfortable to wear and that you wouldn't have to wear it for such a long period of time but honestly considering what is it for my hair I'd be willing to do this all over again the only downsides I have to say about this product is that of course because my hair is so porous I have to use up so much of this product and spend $90 Canadian with taxes on a jar like this that would probably get me three treatments at the very most it's very very expensive so I would probably just do this treatment maybe once a month that way it will last me a little bit longer so overall I think this was a genius product if you guys are interested in checking it out I'm going to link it down below in my description box and if you have tried this masque and have a different opinion than I do or maybe you want to add something in that I missed out Li's leave your comments in the comments below that way I can read it and anyone else can read it who's interested

gifted to me by some of the brands and companies that I have been working with over the last year", "IEY2mA3K_zM": "alright guys so in this video I'm gonna show you how to turn your plain white xbox one controller into a 24 karat gold xbox controller like you see right here alright so it's not actually 24 karat gold but I mean it might as well be it's pretty dang shiny and basically it's just a faceplate it goes on your Xbox one controller and I'm gonna show you how to put it on and basically impress all your friends with this now gold face you have for Xbox one controller and if you want to pick this up check a link down in the description it's made by a company called extreme rate on Amazon goes for about 15 bucks which is that's a steal first for a gold piece like that so let's go ahead get into it it's pretty simple process I guess I should show you what comes in the package first so obviously comes with a gold faceplate which you know is the whole reason they're binding but it also comes with a few accessories like this screwdriver and a few screws so you can take your Xbox one controller apart and actually make it work so the first thing you want to do is take whatever Xbox one controller you're gonna replace the gold faceplate and you know it can be any Xbox 1s or ex controller so basically anything standard is not the elite controller and the first thing you're gonna do is turn it over and take off your battery pack or batteries whatever you have there you're gonna see in the middle there's a little hole right there kind of got a poke through the plastic part or the sticker to get to a screw and that's when your handy-dandy screwdrivers gonna come in handy so your kit should come with a little screw driver that's it's not hard to focus on because it's so small but it's got a kind of like a star shape with a little hole in the middle and you should be able to just stick it in the middle there and untighten it like so it doesn't take too much force so you know just average number of rotations and I would definitely get a little somewhere I put your screws I don't really have any good place but I'm I just got to put them to the side so that's square number one now after that you kind of have to take these this little piece off right here and this piece off so I'm never gonna do that I think you can just kind of grip it up here and should come off alright guys so if I finally got one side off now one thing that I would recommend buying that doesn't come with a kit is a little pry tool like this is what I'm gonna call it I'm not really sure where I got this from but I'll try to find on Amazon and link it down in description it shouldn't be more than a couple bucks and basically what it allows you to do is once you start getting some headway and pulling this panel up you can kind of dig down under it and pull it up you can also do this with a flathead screwdriver but you might damage a controller so I probably wouldn't try that but now I'll try to do this other side on camera so you can kind of see my process and I'm gonna try to pull up this little part first and unclip all these and then kind of pry the other part off it does seem a little bit sketchy because it starts to you know sound like it's gonna break but I don't think a will alright sorry guys I had to take it off camera for a second to get enough leverage to start opening it up but as you can see it got a little crease here now I can just dig under with my pry tool and it kind of just snaps up and I kind of got one side you can see I got this one side up now I'm not try to get the other side to snap off like that so it's it sound like it's breaking but it's not as long as you don't pull it too hard so now that we have these two pieces off we got to the easy part now so the rest of it is just screws so yet one screw here here here and here I'm not sure why it comes with all these screws over here because I think if you just reuse the screws that are already in here but maybe it's something I'm missing but basically just go ahead and unscrew it just like you did the other ones so there it is little tiny screw and zoom out a little bit I'm just keep these in a safe spot so you can reuse them if you want to alright so there you go guys all four screws are out and now we should be able to just slide the faceplate off as like so and if you ever wanted to see the inside of a xbox one controller there you go this done here is for the vibration and you know buttons and tons of other circuitry and stuff all right so now we can put on the gold faceplate which is what we're all here to see so it just slides on super easily and there you go voila you got a gold faceplate and this thing to be honest I haven't talked about the quality of it but it actually feels really nice in the hands it's like a kind of a glassy surface and you know it's not the same kind of material as this but it actually feels really nice and I don't really see any fingerprints so far maybe a few but they can wipe those off pretty easily all right so now we're gonna put it all back together and basically just gotta put in the four screws put the little side pieces on and put in the middle screw and you should be done [Music] all right so now I got four screws in and I'll just clip these pieces back on which should hopefully be easier than it was to take them off so I kind of start with the outside and clip them in and then the inside should clip in pretty easily yeah that's a whole lot easier to put them back on than it is to take them off all right and now the right side or I guess the left side actually should push them in there this shouldn't break or anything make sure I'll clipped in there you go and now one last screw in the middle all right so now that our last screw is in you can just put in your battery pack or batteries whatever you had and there you go guys there's your 24 karat gold xbox one controller and it is pretty sleek if I do say so myself obviously the back of my controllers are like match very well I've got a white and black controller on the back for the front looks glorious looks great I mean it literally just looks like gold I don't know and it makes you look rich in case that's the look you're going for I'm sure if you've got friends that come over to play games they're gonna look at this controller and they're gonna want to play with it because it looks pretty dang sick so definitely check the link in the description to Amazon if you want to buy his controller as I said it's only like 15 bucks and then you just need to buy one of these like prior tools if you want to make it a little bit easier for yourself and obviously as you saw it's not too hard to do the hardest part is definitely just taking off these side pieces other than that super easy and once you've done it once you can do it a million times thanks for watching guys and okay Friday [Music]", "y3pIPUsr_sA": "[Music] hello my lovely people if you're new here my name is Boyd now if you are not then welcome back hello hello hello tonight night tonight either target 24 karat gold this is the makeup revolution Pro 24k gold and and yeah so it's got 18 eyeshadow mixture of got a soft creamy one shade one soft creamy shade that you can use as a base a couple of glitz says some shimmers know what you super soft anything that represent 24 boom this baby is packed full of gold and oh yes it's got a mirror I believe in the mirror right the way you can see the colors we've got quite a few yellows and golds and when I was talking about their cream shade that is only this one here this is a cream machine that you can use as a base for your on your lid I'm not gonna be using this as a base because it's just not right for me but if you are kind of medium skin tone and then you will be able to get away with using this one here you've also got a whiter shade here somewhere along the way well let me see where it is this one here which you can use as well again that's not for me so after the whole palette I've got two shades which are not for me but nevermind I love the fact that it's got some gold glitter in it I know mode normally I'm not glitter person but ever since I fired that palette from the tiny collaboration I actually liked her kind of glitters because you don't actually need to use a glitter glue there's something about them that they tend to stick together and you just dab them on your lid and do a good go boom alright I see not talking I'm gonna get started I'm gonna mmm yes I'm looking at this and already I can see one problem with the palette I'll talk about it at the end of the video I don't want to start any issues this is a morphe M 505 brush and first shade I'm gonna start with got no choice really I'm gonna strike I think the slightly light and and that is this shade here strike and I'm just going to dab that in my waterline there's a little bit fallout that I've already got by the way on my eyes I've got I've got the P Louise I know I've got a P Louise I base in shade and number eight eight because I've got shade five and shade eight and I can remember which one I've got it shade number eight which I do laugh at a DI base so yeah I can see pigment I'm just going to apply that in my crease line that was just two taps in the pan not bad not bad so I'm just going to try and build that out we're gonna move on to the next color at for the eager line oh gosh honestly I use a primer by the way I had a little white mark around my nose - I did not look pleasant but it was a yeah it was a prime okay so we're gonna move on to the next color and the Dottie's we're gonna have to go with a brown and I'm gonna go with a minor mine and that is this moving on swiftlet okay I'm gonna go with this this is a mixture I'm going for yeah I'm using these or ever two to eight crease brush and I'm just gonna do that this got a bit more fallout than the other one yeah and I'm just going to pack that on the outer corner well pigment whoa whoa okay excuse me he's impressive that is really pigmented Wow I like it I like it a lot oh and it's a lot more cool time and I was expecting I'm just gonna further it in he's so pigmented I absolutely love there oh so smoky and it blends really well with the other shade as well a dream to blend I have no complaints I really have no complaints whatsoever so hmm I don't know what to go for now I'm a speaker for something gold oh right you know what I'm gonna go for I hope I say this right auric and that is this is horik alright come on come on come on come on there you go that won't apply that all over my lid we're gonna try it with the finger gold let me try it and see pretty yes yes yes oh yes this woman ah he's actually the really soft one that kind of that's super super soft that leaves the mark on the inside I mean you can tell by look that and the best way to apply it I found is if you're gonna use your finger you need to drag it along your your your eyelid or if you're gonna use a brush you need to spray something on a brush and then it works but really much much better yeah so I'm going back in with mine on the outer corners and just going to tap them using the same brush your hair before if I can find it that easy yes there it is and I'm just going to tap it on the outer edges again for the final shape I was going to actually leave it as it is but you know what I'm gonna try the glitter but only a little tab in the center nothing major at all I'm gonna go with actually Halcyon which is the gold go mmm this one here hopefully is going to be very very similar to the tummies a collaboration and I can just tap my finger oh yes yes I'm just gonna try and be oh yes oh look at that just gonna keep it this Center okay so there you go the glitters in place I can't believe I actually like glitter I'm gonna go and finish off with the rest of my face on camera and then I'll give you my final force at about and this palette all right this is my face or darn people and yeah I you know what it is a good palette it is far more representative of its namesake thank goodness for that and and they are very pigmented yes it takes getting used to with the new formula pressing it down if you can't stop rubbing your finger it sort of moves on a little bit it feels a bit weird but and yeah a sort very pigmented and you also the shimmers you can play with them and and s watch really really nice on the arm as well fantastic and what else the only problem I've got ISA I would have preferred really let me just move things that the way I would have prefered really for for there to be more of a proper transition shade I mean this shade here and this shade at the top are basically the same this one's a bit more red I believe but it's so close together that really would have made more sense to have a color between which is probably about shaded or two shades lighter than this one so you can use it as a proper transition shade because to be honest that these are one here are just a little bit too light and yeah I just I just wished it it actually it's an opportunity lost there for them to have had a proper transition shade their because these are really really pigmented and I show so well on my skin and if you are a loved fairer skin these are going to be like pop on your skin but is it worth 250 quid I say it is worth it I love the glitter here I cannot believe I am saying I love glitter hello I don't normally love glitter the loose glitter type not by the way that I have formulated this glitter it says to stick together and you can tap actually and build it up as well which is so fantastic and and even swatching the glitter actually I never thought it would be so easy to swatch glitters and I did not put anything and no primer or anything and based on on my arm I just did it straight on my arm as normal and and that's that the glitters came out hello what's not there to love yeah and I mean I'm happy with it absolutely happy I'll definitely recommend this super pigmented like even the idea of having a base color there to use to use as primer what primer as a base for your eyes but honestly for me if you are dancing like me that ain't gonna do anything it becomes that comes out we kind of ashy and washed out no it is for someone who's much and it was farad and we are or I think we I think assuming you as that because I am that is if you're not this is for you if you if you wanna stock as I am that color ain't for you but you know what the rest of the eyeshadow palettes can work as well can make them work which is great it doesn't feel like it's a waste of time thank you for watching and yeah if you do like do like I don't even ask people to subscribe anymore if you want to subscribe you go ahead what I do ask is that before you go can you take a like or put a comment and that would really help as well thank you very much wherever you are [Music]", "41RjpY5eDUc": "hey guys it's Casey welcome back to my channel today's video is going to be a first impressions does this thing really work sort of video I thought I'd bring you this one on a really cool product that I've sort of seen all over social media which is usually where I come up with the ideas to do this video it's wrong because social media is flooded with a whole bunch of crazy-ass new products libraries have been using it and it's just been something that has been pretty highly seen on at least Instagram and in the beauty community in general as the masks I'm going to be trying out today are these babies here this is the packaging how sexy is it it is called the gold glow 24k I must buy elastic code I don't know how well you can see right now but it has like little tiny words saying gold gold gold logo across the whole of the white paneling and then it has it in gold in a little shape of the actual eye mask it's like a little jelly bean on the back it has a little blurb that I will read you guys a little bit later but pretty much the idea of these eye masks are usually to boost collagen and to brighten up your own your eyes so I thought that I would give it a shot because my eyes I don't know how are you can tell right now I feel like the studio lights definitely help to make them not look so blue when I was younger I was like anemic and I did not have an iron and as such people that are anemic if you are out there yourself in the same boat you'll know that you have really dark under-eye circles and they can often look sort of sunken in due to lack of iron plus I'm just feeling generally really freakin exhausted I don't know if you guys can tell but I just feel really tired and a little bit rundown so this is something that could give me a little bit of a pick-me-up I mean if it's good enough for celebs I'm already freaking sold ok I'll try anything I want to do a quick zoom in as to what my under eye area looks like right now so it comes with five little sachet things that are filled with the pairs of the gold face mask so it looks like they're just a little jelly bean sort of shaped things and they're sort of enclosed and sealed into a foil aluminium that sort of type of bag with all the liquid in there so it smells real good it just smells like a really I don't even know what it smells like I'm confused okay so there is a hell of a lot of the liquid in here and it feels and smells really a really not okay oh this is so so lip free there like a little tadpole gonna try and put it up as close to my eyeball as I can it's way you highlight your face it's like really slippery boys they just making their way downtown I'm gonna put the excess for my hands on my neck but but they feel really cooling but the slipping is a little bit of an issue so you definitely can't like have these on and walk around the house and stuff like you're definitely gonna need to take some time for yourself and just sit back and relax oh my god it's just even on the right way I suck that off I think I figured it out I think I had them on backwards I don't know I didn't think it was possible to have them on backwards but now they're on the right way and they seem to be staying off a lot better this looks much better and there's definitely not slipping off my face as quickly so the retail price for these ones for the 5 pack is 3995 which is actually pretty good because it's under $10 per pair of these babies which is definitely really good I mean that's pretty cheap if they've got 24 karat gold and this bucket so the benefit of using gold glow is to restore tired eyes dramatically reduced dark circles and puffiness burns the skin to assist in the reduction of wrinkles which is definitely something that I've got to start looking at now that I'm getting a little bit older prevention is definitely better than the cure so that is why I like to try all these new skincare anti-aging sort of products it says collagen is essential for the health and appearance of your skin and this protein is also necessary to reduce your typical signs of aging collagen is an important building block for elasticity and its ability to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles like I said we're looking for the anti-aging in this product and then it says finally a 24k gold glow eye mask was developed by lost Australia with a signature gold shimmer that you won't find anywhere else giving your skin the luminous glow it deserves and that's definitely what I want to be doing by putting these suckers on it is something that looks like it's supposed to be designed to be a part of your beauty regime so it's like something that you just drew like you know how you have a mask once a week like a clay mask once a week or a sheet mask this is supposed to be something that you do and you beauty regime so I'm going to go and lay down a twitch but telly watch a bit of YouTube maybe read a book probably won't read a book she'll be studying but I don't really think I want to do that so I'm probably gonna sit down and watch some YouTube and I will be back with you guys when at least 30 minutes is up alrighty so it has been over 30 minutes and they as they dry they definitely were a lot easier to sort of stay on to my face I think when they were first put on and they were so stupid it was slippery with all of the serum on top of and around the product it was really slippery it was like sliding down everywhere but now like they feel really really good they still feel SuperDuper cooling and I don't even want to take them off because they actually feel like I don't know it's just nice so we're going to peel these suckers off now and see what we have underneath so there's still a little bit of serum left on the skin but honestly I think that it definitely has plumped up and brightened up my under-eye area like it looks really really bright up in here and it's definitely I feel like wow it really has brightened up the under eye area what there's little like gold like little glowy particles on my skin I don't know if you'll be able to see that because it is very very subtle but it's definitely brightened up my under eyes here oh my god how does it even do that that's pretty crazy it feels like I've had like conceal up that's brightened up my woops I am blown away that it actually works I was thinking I would see like a bit of plumpness and that I would sort of notice it feel a little bit more hydrated but it feels hydrated and it also is glowing and it is bright and it is just it looks really really cool I don't even know how it brightens that much like how does it make my skin legitimately look bright that is out of control it is so cool don't even need concealer like look at that it's just beaming it's bright I will leave all of the gold glow mask details down below by lust occur and all the information is to where you can get it and everything in the website if you want to check it out for yourself but honestly you can see for yourself that they actually look really good like there's no way for me to anything they look really nice and they do look a hell of a lot brighter than what they look like before which is amazing but that is it for the review / first impressions I definitely love the product which is exciting but if you liked the video make sure you put a thumbs up or comment any questions you have down below subscribe to my channel if you'd like to become a part of the family and I guess I will see you guys in my next one I love you will incredibly much fun [Music]", "dotc8MVMIwk": "what's up everybody today we're going to be doing another face mask review and today's is the 24 karat gold metallic peel-off mask let's get right into it so right away this is a very beautiful packaging it shows what it's gonna look like on the inside you know it tells you all about it on the front it says with real glow glowing lifting firming of the skin and then the back says a little bit about it I love the packaging very cute I've already opened it up once so I peeled off that very beginning when you open that but protect it of course and then it is beautiful gorgeous got that gold look it actually does also come with this mini spatula that you're supposed to use to apply this but I'm not using that I'm going to be using a much bigger one where I'm gonna be able to actually apply it on my skin the directions say apply an even layer to clean skin covering entire face avoiding eyebrows and hairline that's important because it is a peel-off mask allowed to remain for 20 minutes or until completely dry then I'm going to gently peel off from edges and use warm water to remove residue and you're supposed to do this two to three times a week hopefully this doesn't hurt when I try to take this peel off mask off let's do it you [Music] [Music] now I'm going to be taking this thing off sorry sir [Music] it doesn't hurt at all which is good okay I'm all finished it's all off now and um as all peel masks are I think that my face does feel like it's rejuvenated some of those extra hairs are off and it's nice and soft I do want to moisturize now but just enough why I for anybody that wants to use this it says to have it on for 20 minutes or until dry I waited about 35 minutes I was watching my TV show and let it sit and it didn't completely dry even though I thought it did cuz when I would go like that um it would start to slightly peel off so I thought alright it's time to take it off except it wasn't so my advice to you guys is to keep it on until it's completely dry and just kind of check it periodically even if it feels tight in some areas it may not be completely dry so you wanted to be completely dry other than that it didn't hurt taking it off which was great like I said my skin feels pretty decent and it just takes a little bit long to dry so very interesting mask I love a peel mask I especially love a peel mask that doesn't hurt so I recommend this to you guys and I would say eight out of ten for me just cuz I had just a slight bit of complaints but overall it was a good experience alright guys that's it for me thank you so much for watching this video if you haven't already please subscribe to my channel click the bell button so you can be alerted I post every Monday and Thursday mornings at 8 a.m. Central Standard Time if you have anything that you want me to review put it in the comments below and I would love to do that for you and if you do have a request I will do shoutouts for the person that requested that so that's kind of a neat new thing that I plan on trying to do so this is just something I personally wanted to do a review on and I hope you liked it like I said it was a total of an 8 out of a 10 if I had to read it myself so thank you guys for watching so much I appreciate it have a beautiful day", "Y20cpMefe9o": "18 people yes it's me I know I'm in I'm out and going on back but I really really really want to be consistent in my videos it just doesn't work out to be that way even watching my videos for quite some time at least the last few that I made you know that I've always had some problem with the light so right now I am hoping that I'm not a washout as I was in the last two videos but as you can see I'm more live on this side not as live on this side but I'm not dark that's the main thing so um I'm just going to keep going do what I do because I wanted to make a video no one that maybe 10 minutes and it's taking me over an hour just to get this much so any but in the way no matter what I'm just going to have fun with it and as you can see the camera I'm using but is my cell phone yeah and it may be shaking so I cuz I'm hoping it with a selfie stick between my my thighs and hopefully does it take too much but at least you know I'm trying I'm trying and when I'm in a better situation I'll be in a better situation because I'm into a meeting video so ok but this video today is about skincare and this is a company that reached out to me McCleary and he asked me if I wanted some products I said sure I had heard of company before if you subscribe to coral kick about a couple of years ago they sent us one of the soaps from the company and I mean it so had to be about this big and it was fable round I will use my other hand to show you but I can't it was a big technical I don't think it was a circle some kind of shape maybe hexagon hexagon octagon but it was some shape and it was a sadistic yeah and I mean it was a break so I really liked it and like I mentioned I heard her the company before that because they had a store I'm not mistaken right on th Street all New York you know that to be true leave a comment below it true and let me think that it is our obscene story so anyway tied to the cinema the items I had wanted to start looking into a skincare routine I really wasn't concerned too much I would have gotten something for anti-aging of course but I don't think what I was going to get going to help me because I would be honest until you I'm not really worried about wrinkles because I know my mom my skin looks like crime on the skin a grand proper skin on we don't have wrinkles and the next most likely true for most colorful I would shock that colorful but um we do lose collagen in that face we could make of course our face try searching the net without the sugar age I don't think they have anything over the counter for elegance of lifting and making look really useful but that's okay I will deal with all things when I have to as a matter of fact this year guys I'll be 54 years old in twos so I'm just trying to keep it together trying to do a whole lot because I can't afford if I said before that I probably would do a whole lot but you know just pray that I live a healthy life that's the main thing but anyway so they send me the product it sent me four tires i'ma tell you guys I'm not like a person I know again if you watch my videos you know I'll tell you I am a products cryptic as far as I'm concerned whatever they claimed the spartans going to do if not going to do is when to spend your money a lot of us do and they take our money get started that don't even work and sometimes every now me get something about i like that well okay in this case I like these I just they sent me four products and I'm going to show you the product I am going to do my best to show you exactly what they look like with the lighting that I have hopefully to come through I'm going to put the full names of the products down below and I want you to check out this company because they have great products now the one thing I want to say is that I had for quite some time I don't know when they popped up a windshield up but I had some dark circles under my a mean dog I mean like I said walking around my ankles I leave the dog balls and hum for whatever reason I don't know which is in this product they disappear gone and I was grateful now these are are the one thing about the products I don't like I'm careful to be they are very very strong insane very perfumed I don't like that because I have allergies and it made me sneeze only using products these products at night when I go to bed I'm use a doughnut day during the day will be what I do is just water on my face some rolls oil on my face and that's it but I want to do a little bit something different just to see by big different results but anyway so like I mention to you the dog circles disappear but then I have something's in the powder for a great one and it came back so I'm beginning to think my dog circles may have something to do my blood my capillaries or something it may be I mean I'm not a doctor I don't know now if you're a doctor and you do know after hitting that subscribe button and that like button leave me a comment as to what may have happened to a doctor or dermatologist maybe I don't know do you think but they came right back I thought this in the product they came right back and I have started within the product again but not every day like I had been on some would be like the early part of February to may be big March the April are using the products every single day non-stop and one day I was sitting with my mom and she asked me yeah makeup worn effect no she said your face looks so even so I mean it just looks so pretty those five I have to say honestly my son I gave him basing me some samples unfortunately I gave him to friends and family but my son and uses some of the times we had some acne scars on his face that he wanted to get rid of and I wish he would have let me take this one after he was let me do there but anyway you should see his face you see his face right easy and gorgeous he is so happy with the results and I'm happy for and then on a Newsome I asked my son what you doing to your face I want some of that so yeah and that's a sample that I gave him so you asked me the other day I got a packages and while that company is they send you some more examples I'm like no I gotta find out from the other people that I gave the samples to how they like it now that I mentioned to you I use your status only once a day that's at night so one of the first product that I use is the soap here and one thing I know is they don't play around with the souls manometer to use the soap became in the girl okay this is the same thing look I think it is pretty much concede young we have to take it out a good thing but the only thing like I said now this doesn't smell too bad this smells like regular body soap like down or something smells just like that so to me this is something that refreshes and makes you feel good I think I like it and it's not bad at all okay so then this is soap and I use data for Sweden I dry my face oil and then I think the most important thing out of this particular group would be this product right here now I wanted to use a serum I was going to start using number 7 booth I believe that's what it's called get it out of Walgreens and target but I hadn't started to use and then I got this but I'm in love with this stuff right here I don't know what I'm going to do um once the products are finished but I'm going to use them too they are ninjas this what did look like the applicator I don't put this directly on my face I just put on I just put some on my chin and then I tap it into my skin dab it I don't conserve the motion and I don't stroke I stab it and that's what I do and again look at the package and I think this packaging just sold with the box that it came in rose gold gorgeous as a matter of fact this here the accenting on the product rose gold you can see it much but the product is so gorgeous and I don't know if you can tell there's some gold flecks here in the product and you don't see them on your face at all so they must disperse but I really really love that stuff and then after I can then I remember again I do not rub it into my face like that then after that I use as a night cream now if you want to their website they have many other products they have a lot of different products you definitely find something in it you want and look how beautiful I mean going to the back they don't scapula anyway I'm gonna lie and look at the time just pretty as it can be this particular jar here once I'm finished with it I can try to get those letters off sometimes I'm thinking no polish to do it and this will be a beautiful keepsake job this is really pretty yes and if a queen I know if I open it up you're not really going to be able to see because it's a light and like admitted to you I'm going to put the full name in the description but anyway to get it now this here in the jaw it has a really tight fit but to me it's really really strong what I mentioned I really resent what the next storm is to me that's the only cond and then maybe another product which I don't have orphan boy a lot but again another pretty fun this is body it's so thick looks a big it is I have to leave it this way so that I can get down to the bottom one and then when I won't even sit down pounding for dear life some come out I like the part of what it is just so thick I was going to thin it out but I use something else yes and this particular collection or or rose Macari or rose and it is just a beautiful beautiful packaging but I really really like now this here supposed to be said about the full name in the it's a 24 called lightening body lotion you don't have any other information you just stick a year so like I mentioned you want to put the full name down below so that you can go to the website to check it out what you need to do because what I've done I've signed up for there I'm going to say well I signed up on a site and biggest to me I'm information like many have females and stuff which is great because I said he's got a clear all fantastic I would like I have to say that to junkie and me once I try something I try to finish it specially if I like it and then I'm going to something else but if I never get back to anything that I really like yes I will definitely definitely always try to keep me apart because I'm really really like this stuff is really nice and out of it the packaging is okay so now in case something that's going even out your skin make it look we make look better because like I said it gives me such a nice even tone and out really like that I used to have and I don't know how to sit on the sound but give the time I didn't have any blemishes on my face I'll say it that way to my family with it but now I do I have submissions on my face and I don't like that so um this particular product right here I'm not going to say has gotten rid of those blemishes those dark spots but for some reason it gives my face and even home and this is from what I'm seeing it's been a while yeah and you guys know what while pretty much looks like this is the applicator I'm going to tell you the name make sense we need to try to put it up to the screen this one is called nice to future you oh it says to summer baby exactly greatly but listen I just wanted to do that looking for you guys because I had promised Macari the company representative that I would do the video I have been using these files for a very long time so they do organ sound like I just got them try them for

wine on a dime or maybe today a golden dollar you [Music] today we're reviewing a sparkling wine I'm super excited I saw this and right away I knew I had to do it it comes in this box that is shaped like a golden nuggets we try not to shake it up too much because this is sparkling wine I am reviewing today blue nun 24 karat gold edition blue nun has a special place in my heart it reminds me a lot of my great-aunt I didn't know her a whole lot growing up but when I went to college I went to college in the same town that she lived in and she was a nun and I think at that point she was retired but she definitely was a nun yeah my dad and I went over to her house for dinner and she served blue nun wine not this version I put the one in the blue bottle I think it's a white blend and she just thought it was so funny that she was a nun and she's drinking blue nun why and it was her favorite probably because as done in the name so this one goes out to my late great aunt Rafe this one's for you blue nun reminds me of you so yeah let's get to it I'm gonna open up this box I feel like I'm shaking it up so much and it's gonna explode everywhere and open it that's okay that's okay so it comes in this box whose really fancy but considering how cheap it was I bought this for $9.99 at HEB in Texas and the retail on this was around $14 or know the retail at HEV was 1199 it was on sale but looking on the internet it was like between twelve and fourteen dollars usually and the cool thing about it not only does it come in this I can't get it out slippery cuz I put it in the okay not only does it come into this this gold nugget box but it has I didn't notice this until after I bought it it has like gold flecks in it and on the website it says it's sparkling wine with real 24 karat gold flakes from it so that makes me a little nervous I don't know how I feel about drinking gold but we're gonna do it today and this is a German wine it's a German wine company it's been around it says right on the label since 1957 has some history of being owned by different people I think in the late 90s it was sold and then the year after that they kind of introduced via the famous blue bottles that I mentioned earlier that my late great and Rafe used to enjoy yeah I think we should just pop this open and and drink some liquid gold right do I want to open it on camera because it might explode everywhere because I shook it up a bunch we'll see we'll see how things go I'll just keep filming and then you know if it explodes everywhere we all get to see it so what I do is when I open I guess I should tell you what I'm doing I don't take the the cage off I just kind of loosen it and I grab on to the top and I usually as a towel and then you kind of like spin the bottle around this is how I like to it's about to come whoo hope it is it's not gonna explode too much it's bubbling up though this makes sure that you you know you never want to shake a bottle of sparkling wine and then like try to like make it have this fly somewhere that's dangerous to you and others so that's how you should probably open bottle in I feel like all the gold flecks went down to the bottom see how this pours it's a quick busy probably because I've been shaking it up let that die down a little bit I have no idea what kind of wine this is I get through the gold flecks and the fizz I'm guessing it's like some sort of like sparkling of Riesling it says on the website it said it used like a historical method of fermentation so I'm not really sure what that means that's pretty big we're going to point for what a big last year put our 24 karat gold the bottle is really nice this looks really good for like ten dollars it comes in a gift box it has gold flecks in it and the bottle has like this dipped top and gold paint looks pretty fancy like if you were giving this to a host they probably would have thought that you spent more than ten dollars on it it's kind of a straw yellow color is very very fizzy and definitely has some gold flecks in it which make me a little nervous so Cheers smelling it kind of smells like house Chardonnay in it because it has it kind of like that Crisp apple smell that you get with a champagne smells like yellow apples maybe a little bit of pear in there the website said this is a sweet wine so I don't like sweet wines but I'm trying it anyway we'll see how it goes so Cheers let's take a taste Oh it is sweeter like it's not brute it's not dry it's probably like semi semi Seco it's definitely not a Dulce wine for sure it's like kind of sweet it definitely I'm guessing house Riesling in it it tastes a lot like I I say that because it's a sweet wine and I don't hate it and I usually it will like kind of like semi sweet Rieslings and that's kind of what this tastes like is it sparkling semi sweet Riesling I taste some honey in this so it's kind of taste like like green maybe like yellow yeah the yellow apples with honey drizzled on top that's kind of what it tastes like you like dipped an apple and honey that's what this tastes like definitely have more of a sour apple not like dozen Red Delicious this is quite good I wasn't no I didn't know what to expect I did not know what to expect I can't really taste the gold flecks going down that's good I would consider this kind of a celebration wine I'm not I mean it tastes like it would go good with with cheeses that means some snacks if you were just kind of having like a cocktail hour it's a little sweet maybe to pair with a dinner the website did say that it paired best with hors d'oeuvres so I think there are spot on there I swear as soon as I open this all the gold flecks oh now they come in who went straight to the bottom there's only a ten dollar fancy gold Fleck wine so I guess you can't have like high expectations but for a $10 wine this is pretty good it's better than I like cook champagne which is like also $10 I'll tell you that much right now what would I rate this wine it kind of like I said earlier you get a lot of it's very has a nice look for $10 and it tastes pretty good for $10 Tom it is 11 percent alcohol by volume by the way look it's like a sparkling Riesling I feel like I'm not had a percent sure on that so don't quote me it tastes like a sparkling Riesling for what this is I'm gonna give it a four point nine out of five and that's really high but it looks nice it has a gold theme definitely looks more expensive than it is and it tastes more expensive than what it is which is more importantly the thing we're going for here I feel like a lot of sparkling wines hello like in the ten to five dollar range really missed the mark but this one is one of the better ones I've ever taste so cheers to that would I pay full price for this would I pay $14 for this um I think it's priced right around $12 I think 14 is a little high but the retail price at HEB was like 11 97 so I would pay that I'd paid 1197 but for $10 I was really excited I'm really excited this was $10 thanks for watching my review of blue nun 24 karat gold edition wine this is pretty good if you have any requests or comments questions please leave them below and we will see you next time on wine on a dime", "_2ivsoqBXbU": "oh hey guys welcome to my channel it's me wetter so today I'm going to be doing a first impression video I really enjoy doing this and I think you guys enjoyed them too blackheads are just bothering me so I would decided to go to this camp and see what I can find and I came across this interesting peel of face mask so this is a 24 karat gold peel of face mask it's by stealing public and it also is an anti-aging face mask I thought why not give it a try and the fact that it has gold in it made me want to review this face mask even further I looked at the ingredients and the ingredients are somewhat questionable but I won't knock it this is what they actually say this age-defying gold peel-off mask combines the anti-aging benefits of gold with the deep cleansing properties of a peel-off mask for a radiant youthful glow I bought this one at this camp in Botswana and it costs me 53 pull at 50 and I've cleaned my skin so I'm just gonna apply it it's very easy to open oh oh wow it's beautiful it is absolutely gorgeous whoo scanners Bills fans welcome man my face well it's such a beautiful color I love it too I don't know if there's a way to actually apply this but I'm just gonna use my hands it's it smells really nice as it smells like gold although I don't know what goat smells like but I feel like gold smells like this like a royalty maybe this is a better way to apply it so that it doesn't get messy the formula is quite tacky and sticky but I guess that's because it's a peel of mask whoa it feels nice and cold oopsie don't get into my eye so I have applied my mask on now it says yes obviously avoid the eye area eyebrows hairline and lips so that's exactly why I left out this part because I do have hairs on my mustache it says live for 30 minutes or until the product is completely dry I can literally feel it getting into my skin then I feel it drying up as well so the questionable thing about this is that it does have alcohol as its second and third ingredient it has polyvinyl alcohol as its second ingredient and aqua as its third ingredient and then the gold is right at the bottom it's the ninth last ingredient it does however have blackberry fruit extract it has a number of extracts here I don't know what these other ones are because they're in the Latin names after 30 minutes when I come back and we're gonna peel this off hey guys so it's been about 30 minutes and as you can see my skin is quite tight so now I'm going to try and fill as well both really painful oh god I don't think this has a good idea this is painful enough I should like rip it out yeah it's well if I do it quickly [Music] [Music] so guys be a way that it is quite painful in your pineal oh oh kind of regretting this [Music] the chicks man whoa the chicks are painful my skin does feel soft although it feels irritated because of the pulling so it's still a little bit painful but a little bit nothing too hectic my skin is itchy I can feel it so I'm just gonna wash off with water they said to wash off with water and then I'm just gonna put on some moisturizer so my skin is definitely reacting to something that's in this product but anyway let me go wash off my my face and then apply my moisturizer so I washed off my face doesn't feel as Ichie however it does feel irritated so if you do have sensitive skin to be a way that your skin might eat I'm gonna go through the pros and cons I experienced with this face mask the positive is that I really am happy with the fact that it got rid of those blackheads and got them out I can actually see them on the mask my skin feels nice and smooth so I love that about this product that thing I loved about is the smell it smells very luxurious it smells like gold even though like I said I don't know what God smells like but mmm it smells like royalty honestly those are the things that I really loved about this product the negative side of this product however is the fact that if you have sensitive skin this might not be the best thing for you because my skin started itching thankfully I cleanse my skin so hopefully the itchiness woke away very very soon overall I would give this product a 3 out of 5 simply because it actually did what it was supposed to do it's just that it lost that because it's not gentle enough for people with sensitive skin so yeah that's the end of my video have you ever used peel-off mask and if so what has your experience been with them please let me know in the comments down below I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you in my next one peace [Music]", "1IJFpMGXeQE": "[Music] hello everyone welcome back to my channel hope you all are doing really well today's video is a review about an interesting product it is the dr rochelle 24k gold collagen hydrogel eye mask this product claims to brighten and firm the skin to improve wrinkles and fine lines works for puffiness dark circles relieves and reduces skin dullness dr richelle was founded in dubai and their products are manufactured in china dr richelle has always been working for natural skin care products this eye mask comes in four different types i bought this one because 24k gold really attracted me i wanted something for my dark circles and i thought there must be something very special about it this anti-aging eye contour gel mask is infused with pure 24k gold eye treatments it helps to reduce the look of fine lines wrinkles and crow's feet to reveal firmer radiant and revitalized and youthful looking under eyes the best quality of hydrogel is to lock in moisture and prevent the serum from evaporating hydrogel transfers water from the mask to your skin which gives a cooling and refreshing sensation it has hyaluronic acid and hydrolyzed collision which delivers intense hydration to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles it comes in a cardboard box and it has its name benefits ingredients and usage written on the sides of the box time to open it now it has this tiny information booklet inside which has all the description and usage of all four types of eye masks i'll tell you the usage after opening it let's take it out the eye mask comes in a screw top plastic jar the look of the jar is not much attractive but the product inside is the jar has 60 pieces when you open it you can see a protective inner cap and there is one plastic dispensing spatula i'll open it now the eye mask is presented in this arrangement the spatula works quite well to separate each ideal patch for application now i will remove the eye mask you can see that it has a glittery and shimmery look i'll show it closely which makes it very attractive it has a very nice and sweet scent just like a perfume these ideal patches are very thin and light you can see the essence inside i'll show you closely [Music] to use them cleanse and dry your face take the patches and apply them under eyes or any wrinkled area on the face these can be used on your forehead mouth and neck too if you use on forehead it is going to lighten the wrinkles for mouth it is going to lighten decree wrinkles and for eye corner it will tighten the eye circumference for neck it will lighten the neckline let the patches set for 20 to 30 minutes wherever you place them they will stay in their position for the entire wear time as you can see it has sticked properly on it the essence is very cool and if you want more cooling effect they can be refrigerated remove the patches gently and discard do not reuse them gently pat the remaining essence to allow better absorption do not clean you will instantly feel that your skin is well hydrated the eye mask will leave the skin looking smooth revitalized and radiant this eye mask is available on many websites online but i ordered it from noon.com which is a saudi website you will get many options when you google it it's not expensive the price is 39 saudi riyals but it is different on all websites so according to me the results are really satisfying my skin really feels refreshed and hydrated after its use it brightens the skin adjusting the skin tone and nourishes it it feels that the skin is moisturized around the eyes which increases skin elasticity and firmness for dark circles i have to use it regularly for long but till now it has effectively improved my under eye area it works so well for eye tiredness and you get a relaxing feel although it is a temporary effect but it is very hydrating and has brightening effects overall i like using this product the experience is really good i think you should give it a try so that's all on this product i hope you all found my video helpful thank you so much for watching give it a big like and do

realm will these bits of kit improve your creative process well we'll just have to find out but first of all shout out to sponsor this video skillshare an online learning community that offers thousands of inspiring classes for those curious about learning and creatives alike how all right we're ready ready to go lock's been setting up three cameras that's his excuse anyway i think you said you said you you want to take a look and there's on the atomos and uh yeah yeah yeah all i've got is the panasonic i can't remember the name is some like silly geeky name but it's the cube camera some something like bb btm 85 and uh yeah something bts boom boom no it's the cube camera that looks a bit like the zed cam so anyway super pokebros is back yeah finally after like a half oh amazing i mean all this i mean because now it's locked down again back here we've got lock up there and we've got locked down here i think might be a bit overexposed [ __ ] hang on oh this is going well isn't it oh so someone said he's got a simple one camera setup i think the trouble is i i am using the nikon set 6 2 because i just got it yesterday so i think yes let's make use of it so we both using a camera a new camera that we are not familiar with so that's that's that's why with my panasonic cube camera i've got uh two sd card slots hopefully this won't overheat but i've got it on continuous autofocus so you know i don't know what it's gonna be like i'm using the nikon z62 the autofocus is really good but this is on the thing it's micro four thirds and i've got a white wall just behind me so surely no you don't know i mean pairs on the camera i mean i like fans on the camera auto focusing okay moving on to the next bit we started doing a segment before called lock review [ __ ] which is uh kind of self-explanatory well no it's not self-explanatory you're not actually reviewing [ __ ] lock is reviewing [ __ ] as in you know stuff that might be good might be bad so the first thing i don't care oh wow look at that box yeah yeah it looks like a japanese bento box as well is this the best vlogging camera you can get look at that whoops what's that oh it's a lens cap it's a gimbal it's what dji hope that the optimal pocket would be like if it didn't fit in the pocket it's a hang on if that's an action camera with on the gimbal uh kind of it's got my name on it yeah what engraved or what sharpie blue i think uh laser laser engrave i guess they said it's 24k gold as well i feel bad though it's good and then this got a flip screen wow can i just say lock isn't getting paid to to do this i mean not getting paid to talk about this i mean not getting paid to say nice things about it the really the really shocking thing is that it's an interchangeable lens camera look at that whoops yay i didn't broke it this is uh this is um so you can see the sensor yeah you can this package got two lenses you got the normal lens i forgot what i forgot a focal length and then you got a fisheye lens yeah in the chamber lens camera that's something i don't understand is that it got a it got an extra on off button for the gimbal just the gimbal so you can turn off the gimbal and then turn on the camera no camera is on and the gimbal doesn't work and you can separately turn on the gimbal oh i love those noises but the proof is the pudding in the pudding so we've got the so how's the pudding taste i've shot some oh here it is oh you're wearing a mask so this is kind of a low light test it's kind of low light not extremely low light in a shopping mall in hong kong and this is uh and also the sound test as well oh it's not focused on your face no that's that's the first thing that is so the low light seems okay here but actually it's using a slower shutter speed even though i have turned off the low light low light shutter speed thing in the menu middle pocket is those in my pocket is um it's actually focused on your face it's flatter skin colors are not too bad on the idle cam but the audio is pretty bad well i can tell you one thing is that you can change the camera i don't know the lens on the on the idle cam so if i have to turn it off just pull it out hang on okay yeah although this fisheye but that's what you get from gopro as well isn't it and now of course you got this thing that must have looked like some dodgy adult toy or something with that rabbit on top you also got this green knight which is great for beauty shot isn't it what expressing connection is not very good okay that doesn't really make it that bright is it no it doesn't really seem to work even though it's not there the that ring light thing doesn't really work and then because the ring is so small it doesn't work like a ring light finally it has it outside it's quite wind a little bit wind and then you got we got perfect noise as well so we'll see how it performs on audio songs is so bad i mean it got a whatever phone i mean a wind block thing doesn't work yeah so now it's got wind block how it's done but the idle cam can use external mic see let's see how is that working so oh there's some kind of wind so you can see you can hear the difference so how much is this oh that's that's the best thing it's the you don't know the gold the gold package this with dual lens with a beauty light and the case it costs 3.99 which is more than a pocket is 99 399 yeah 399. what is the whole case gold or what and for reference the new dji pocket 2 is just 349. affiliate links down below it looks like you've got you got more stuff than a osmo pocket so you can actually get this just by itself just one lens it still costs 375. yep so okay moving on to more [ __ ] you've got more [ __ ] to show me haven't you this one they uh they sent it to me for a really long time this is a great beer this is kind of like the the cheapest uh motorized slider i mean the first time they sent it over i like i was like all right actually that's that's quite [ __ ] because it is really plasticky but that's what this segment is all about the thing is it works kind of i mean it's not it's not the best but it works because i have been shooting a slider shot with that over here i was shooting it with rx100 i mean it kind of like if they try to make it that's the cheapest they can do i mean because the thing is really plastic it's really just like a toy that looks like something you just put curtains on kindness so on top it's just a digit because this is for to set the speed of the motor and then you press which direction it won't go you want it to go and at the end of the well it will go back as well okay does it okay what kind of weight can it take uh i have to check it later but you definitely on the screen you're definitely using this um full-frame camera it's more for mobile phone compact camera maybe um those aps-c size camera well hang on it just does that it doesn't road road you know no but how can you show me one way it rotates in huh that is when you like you turn it off also you can disengage the the gear so it you can do it manually as well oh oh i see it here i've got it now yeah it's a little table top thing yeah table topping so you use the motor just yet and put it on the wheel and then yeah you do that well why is it wobbling it's wobbly yeah it wobbled a bit probably the wheel is not completely wrong but then i stabilize it and it works i actually do it for my a7c review i actually use this for that yeah so you're kind of watching there said it that you set up this it's kind of like faster than a slider with a pending head you don't have no software you just there's no software you just do it manually you just try to adjust the angle of the wheel here the problem is when you push it around the angle change a bit i mean it's shift a bit so you can't do a repeat uh movement you know what that's actually all right i i was starting to say isn't it that's not bad isn't it especially if you consider the price for this set this this full set is this is around 150 to 183 us dollars com depends on where you get it and if i look at bnx for a cheapest motorized slider i find the gvm professional video aluminum alloy motorized camera slider it is aluminum 199 so it's a little bit more expensive than this and you only got a slider but this set you got a slider you got the dolly it and it still can it's it still can pan because you can just put this on over there and then you've got a pending head i have to say it looked [ __ ] it looks [ __ ] and look at what it is some some parts of it um are not perfect but i i like it's it's likeable because you can take this out it's not too heavy right i guess it's not too heavy oh it's really really really light and it that's the base it's a bloody curtain rail and then this is really toy like but i like it i like it that's that's um all right oh payton so 2017. well there we are lock review [ __ ] we managed to find one good [ __ ] and one just [ __ ] [ __ ] so i think you still got one more thing from you which means the camera strap with a hard on oh [ __ ] oh yeah this one you're watching kai we will share [ __ ] okay so what have i got here i've got the uh strap on that turns hard it's the hard-on strap-on it's in it's in soft it's in soft mode a minute it's very floppy look at that it's not excited whoops okay but once you turn once you flick that switch once you turn it on sometimes i wish i had a switch like that all it takes is a flick of the switch and look at that no stroking so the idea is it turns into a solid almost solid but not bipod yeah bipod it's got two legs so you you put it on you put on the floor and then it will support your camera of a certain weight or less as a strap not so great as a trite wire that hasn't got three legs so it can't work it's a tripod as a bipod no it'd rock a bowl i guess their thinking was also maybe that you could use it as a i don't they didn't mention it specifically but maybe you could use it as a vlogging stick so you can you can stiffen it up like this let's get hard why is it knocking [Laughter] that's the first time i've said that so it's like that it's like a you know you can use it as a vlogging uh rather part you don't even have to lock it down you don't have to turn it on or off it just works so you don't like it [ __ ] i've commented on you know i got a comment in your video okay so there we are um yeah i've got no more [ __ ] i've just got these thanks for watching our [ __ ] and stay tuned yeah stay tuned we are we will try to do another one next month which is the end of the year

just start talking about the panasonic s5 when it got a face for it to focus it focused really well but when it doesn't have a face front of space everyone's got a face oh yeah yeah panasonic is still just i mean the focus really well on my face whenever i detect a human but then oh come on i kind of still like the s5 i think it's great and i think it's the best value for money when it comes to 4k cara for shooting uh video and it probably has the best kit lens ever the cheap kit lens when we talk about cheap kit lens because this 24 to 60 millimeters the zoom range is great i mean it's it's 20 to 60 isn't it 20 to 60 what did i say yeah i mean this is 24. 2060 that's really great it's great for vlogging great for a lot of things it's not constant aperture 3.5 to 5.6 but doesn't really matter so it's really light the funny thing is the s5 is probably really good for vlogging and but then they didn't really say it is a flocking camera because they have another vlogging camera which is a c100 or g110 you have tried that crop tastic i mean given the choice of g100 or zv1 i i'll go for the zv1 of course but given a choice of zv1 or something else i'll go for something else it's good it is really good i mean it's good you can use i i have shot a whole video with it or the dji oz no the dji pocket no no yeah the dji pocket yeah it's not dji pocket anymore you'd still put it on your title i know somebody corrected me some somebody left a comment saying oh no it's not called that dji osmo pocket anymore dji pocket it kind of to me it doesn't really make much sense so that's why i kept calling osmo because it should be annoys my pocket yeah because awesome what is a pocket yeah it's a cgi pocket what's that now did you i make garment now it'd be like you know the steve jobs reveal when he gets the ipod nano out of his pocket but instead of instead of bringing out something out of the pocket it'll be just like it's the dji pocket the pocket yeah here you go anyway let's talk about sony because we we just talked about the song time is money from the sv1 and then sony also releases a a7s3 really good they just listen to you the thing is whatever you want they give you that they change it the flip out screen they change the menu the newer a7c doesn't get a new manual it got less button than a6000 it should burst slower than a6000 oh you got a rx100 wheel finder it's so small i still want it though i still want it yeah it's small and light for full frame camera i mean someone in my comment sessions put it really good that put it really well that he said that is a7c is a camera that i don't mind have one but i don't i won't buy one and then talk about cameras where you really want but will you buy one c70 it's just a better tool for taking video just ergonomically i mean the thing is i find with cine cameras okay yeah the dynamic range is good yeah but sometimes a big part of it is just built in nd filters it's just so convenient i mean i think it's fantastic but i don't know if i'll get it because it's just a little bit much much money uh the r5 r6 yeah it's cheaper but yeah it's one of those isn't it it's one of those it's kind of one of those if you shoot stills and a little bit of video then yeah that's fine we'll see i mean the rs6 new firmware updates just released and then people claim that it's already improved overheat issue a lot so we'll see ah i remember you said a long time ago this was before ushd came out and said oh it's probably on the time or some [ __ ] i remember you said it you called out then you texted me and said i think it must be because it it turns itself off really on the dot yeah it is it doesn't really matter if i do it on my rooftop or indoor it just cut off after straight 20 minutes he's not tweeting that he expects canon to apologize to him no he just is he expect canon to apologize to everyone not just him he expects kennen to do you know not just a normal bow it has to be like 100 [Laughter] some yoga [ __ ] kissing their feet kissing their own feet", "NT0nqfDqk70": "hey guys it's Tina here welcome back to another episode of Tina tries it in today's episode I'll be trying out a purifying pumpkin peel-off mask if you have it already make sure you click subscribe to my channel below to stay updated future videos if you saw my latest Korean beauty haul video you would have seen this guy this is a purifying pumpkin peel-off mask the brand is called too-cool-for-school which there is a popular brand in Korea I found this in their store this must help stream of the skin cells and flushes out excess sebum to tighten and smooth the skin it also restores ratings to dull skin and it contains pumpkin extract and 24 karat real gold now pumpkin is an excellent ingredient because it's passions for enzymes and Ajay's which are alpha hydroxy acids which helps to exfoliate the skin and makes your skin look smoother it also soothes the skin and boosts collagen production now the instructions are pretty easy it says in the Box to use on clean toned skin apply a thin layer and allow to dry for 20 to 30 minutes and then peel off the mask from the bottom up my skin is already cleaned so I'm going to apply a thin layer of this here's a close-up of my skin it's not too bad that lately I've been noticing around here my pores have been getting a little bit more lose ball so if you like their kind of getting a bit bigger not too crazy and my under eyes becoming a little bit dark lately because I just have not been getting enough sleep and that my skin's okay it could use a really quick pick-me-up or something it doesn't feel the best so let's try out this pumpkin peel-off mask it's brand new so I'm just going to peel off the foil here with squeeze out all [Music] that's what the product looks like I'm going to apply a thin layer and smell like pumpkin actually I don't really know what pumpkin smells like I can smell a bit of alcohol I feel like most of these peel-off mask they must can all contain like alcohol that must be like ingredient all of them have because it kind of smells like the other ones that I've used it's pretty sticky and I wish they kind of like gave you a brush or something because these posters get really messy wait for it it's likely some has an air filter or something here you know there's car like okay so I was laying this on and I feel like my finger bit like it's time to stick together and see a while since I've actually tried the peel off month or new on Italy okay so think I've applied a good amount it's not thick it's definitely like a thin layer so I have to wear at least 20 to 30 minutes for this to dry and it specifically told me to peel from the bottom upwards so I'm going to do that when I get back so 25 minutes has passed and my mask and dried up and really tightened up my skin making it hard for me to speak for like when I like to lose my face around it just accentuated like please like bring clothing it look feel some really old like this is me in like 50 years and I'm going to feel this off so far it is a sting or anything there's no to move sensation was quite pleasant on the skin I can't stop doing this you know when you put highlighter on your cheekbones and like shines this is my whole frame so shiny this is like highlighting on another level always going really like it's really tough especially bad the material feels really tough though I feel like this will come off and want to go it's definitely going to cover one go this is really satisfying and it's not painful cool oh wow this is really cool look it came off in one piece and I didn't have to apply like a thick layer to get this it's actually quite thin but the like mask itself is really like durable it's really tough it feels like plastic is a little bit of it on my hair so it comes asleep pretty easily I can just rub it away I don't feel that there's a traumatic huge difference inside I do feel like it soothes my skin and some of the redness did go down in terms of my like how it my skin feels it does feel a little bit softer but it doesn't feel like it was so sticky it doesn't feel like extremely tight and so dry which is really important because some of the other peel-off mask I've tried in the past it kind of like tightens up your like skin a lot that it feels really dry but this is like this is nice it doesn't feel like heavily moisturizer or anything it kind of just feels softer yeah and I definitely feel like it's definitely soothe the redness in my skin in terms of my pores I don't think it did too much to my pores I still see them but again I only use this one so maybe it's one of those ongoing things but the actual mask itself isn't as like harsh as the other peel-off mask I can steal on that egg peel-off mask oh I'm really hurt to peel off this one it was actually quite pleasant it wasn't painful whatsoever in terms of the price I bought these for $20 in Korea which i think is pretty affordable considering you're getting like 24 karat gold in this mask the only things I wish they included a brush or an applicator so I can just like apply it on my face it back in my hands dirty and it was like getting bit sticky towards the end in saying all these I'm going to give this product a seven and a half out of ten I think it's pretty cool to use like once or twice a week I feel like because it comes off in one go and doesn't leave any residue it's good than saying that it's not like a miracle treatment your skin is not going to be like transform straight after it's just going to simply like smooth out your skin through that if you have any redness and I guess create a little bit of a firming effect not too much so don't expect like crazy results on this I feel like it's just fun and cool to you so that's its episode of Tina tries it stay tuned for more cool beauty products that I bought in Korea I have like so many products to try some stations than that make sure you subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and I'll see you guys next time bye [Music]", "rzjujGqn_Aw": "[Music] all right so this thing is definitely something thousand dollar Donald Trump 24 karat gold banknote an interesting gift from a viewer out there so I appreciate that but let's talk a little bit about this I mean when you hold it like this it's a lot better I guess I mean as far as like quality of the graphics on it well let's set this thing down we'll look at it we'll see what's going on with it adjust my camera a little bit there yeah all right so first off clearly a hundred dollar bill faced with the ink will and the vial of ink as well as the general layout the 1776 July 4 1776 date looks like they just took up $100 bill which of course as you know is the largest denomination of u.s. banknote currently and made it into a thousand dollar bill so unlike the normal $100 bill which would depict Benjamin Franklin this one has Donald J Trump a little less orange and more smiley than ever what's cool fancy serial number wise is what an epic repeater so cool there but other than that I mean it says nice I mean as far as bill wise is a nice bill it's very thick paper or thick whatever this is I mean I highly doubt it's 24 karat gold we won't have any preconceived notions about let's just talk about is hair for a minute what in the world I mean when you're looking at like this not so bad but when you look at like this it looks like it's like a gold to pay or just a hair piece that is just awful you know it's like a hair it's like a hovering in like a mother ship with a human below it so I think that's really awesome let's look at the back of the bill ah $100 bill back so same dealio with the depiction of Independence Hall Oh for verification it's got 24 karat gold so obviously it's real similar to the 100 dollar note they just added a zero basically but I think the back of it looks a little nicer than the front in my opinion as far as detail is concerned not to mention subject matter I have nothing against the president I didn't vote one way or the other that is irrelevant I mean it's just talking from graphics quality the front is kind of extra goofy there we go looks better like that yeah it's the way the lights hitting it when you hold it like that it looks a lot cleaner so not so bad but when you look like this it looks like it is kind of like looks like he's from The Simpsons anyhow really cool quality can't talk any smack about the quality and the detail on the bill is really nice so that's cool I like the transition of color as you move it in the light it's definitely cool it obviously is going to have a lapse of the actual anti-counterfeiting security measures because it's kind of like a plastic the vinyl bill nevertheless really cool though that's a first for me good old 24 karat gold Donald J Trump thousand-dollar the United States banknote I don't even know let's just just look at this thing let me know what you think of that mug on that face what you would think about Donald Trump getting his face on any form of currency or any other change in presidents depictions on currency or just what you think of this thing let me know in the comments below and I will meet you there to talk about it see you in the next video [Music]", "T89ElcIsSyc": "ON.

i'm elena brilliant i'm your russian american makeup and beauty addict i usually do reviews and tutorials of affordable inexpensive makeup from various website walmart i'll test it myself and i'll pass the savings to you guys so this is a review of newish palette this is a revolution pro 24 paired gold this is very beautiful very high quality and looks like this it's very neutral but still very pretty so i'm going to be doing switches uh quite tutorial and my final thoughts at the end so if you guys are interested then keep on watching and don't forget to subscribe and bring notification bell below so youtube notifies you every time i upload a new video i upload three times a week mondays wednesdays and fridays at 9am pacific time and also go live every sunday at 9 a.m pacific time as well which is 5 p.m in uk so like this video comment uh follow me instagram twitter links are down in description box so let's get right into this video [Music] it's time for the russian word of the day and the rational word word of the day is very connected to this palette obviously gold so i'll give you gold if you're into it i mean why not who is not into shiny things so gold is zolota so as usual cyril fellain is going to be here and uh pronunciation phonetic in english is going to be below zoho there you have it russian zolotta so you can use zolota in a comments below if you're interested or if you don't care about it just keep skip it and go on to the swatches so i got this palette a few months ago like a couple of months ago in the big hall or from um beauty bay so i'm going to list the card for that video if you're interested to see i'm doing another look in that haul and i used a lot of revolution products in that video um this part i did not use so i'm going to show you the swatches this was 18 for 18 shades which is amazing deal especially for revolution pro because the revolution profile it kind of tends to run a little higher because this is a high end of the brand of makeup revolution and usually it's completely worth it because revolution pro is amazing i love them so it has 18 shades and only five of them are mattes this is the only drawback i like to have more mattes in the palette and i did not realize that there are so many shimmers in it when i ordered it i just kind of grabbed it because it looked pretty so and this is not my usual thing i usually don't go for the shimmer for the neutrals i usually go for color but uh something about it spoke to me and chrissy did the review and greasy was a big influence for me so if i find her videos with this palette i'm going to list it up here and put another card because chrissy if you don't know christina collins she's amazing she owns like a revolution brand she has like a mini store in her house i'm just kidding but she has a lot of revolution products so check out her channel her review so she was a big inspiration for this one as well so again so i'm gonna show you the swatches which you just did my arm uh the swatches i took a couple of passes as usual because i don't pry my skin first maybe i should try prime minis first but without the primer i mean it takes a couple of passes on dry skin there they are so that's the first row six colors one two three four five six that's the second row again a lot of them are shimmers here we got mahat one they got matu the next six are here one two three four five six got two glitters on this amazing amazing glitters go home without primer everything stays i mean you'll see and these are all shimmers actually i thought this was mad but this is like a satin you know so and these this is actually a base it's like green bay it's kind of like who the beauty has those bases and folklore uh actually it works really well surprisingly got two moments three mamas actually one two and three and we got a couple of shimmers here and if you're wondering what that is this is car from bike accident i'm a cycling instructor if it's your first time here i cycle a lot and i'm very accident-prone so i got two broken elbows through the years people ask me often in the videos where are the scars from yes i hurt myself really bad i'm really good at hurting myself i'm like accident waiting to happen but anyway it's all good now anyway so that's the swatches really nice watches actually the glitter is watched amazingly i mean this palette did not disappoint the only drawback like i said is the number of maps there's only five but other than that it's top notch usually very very nice so i kind of spilled it already what i think about it so you can see my quick tutorial and the final thoughts at the end so this is a look i created the only another revolution product is that barium liner they use for the pop of color other than the hat this is all the palette so keep on watching for the tutorial so i'm going to start with the base color since it says base i'm all suspicious of those things it's like uh the folk allure palette that's a huda beauty new new dupe that had that base color in it but it was very creamy like almost too oily but this is different the other thing look at the color the color is a little dark so i honestly cannot see anybody with a deeper skin with a lighter skin tone use it i consider myself medium light like light medium but even on me it's a little like a yellow so if somebody is a fair i just can't see them using this it's a little too dark yellow [Music] starting with a spectrum dense brush and this is kind of a pencil brush a12 and i'm going to start with the deepest colors first i'm going to go into silence and it has a little sheen on it so over it i'm going to apply plate which is true matte i like the tone of it because it's purplish but i like the matte base of blades so i'm going with this slightly satin color it's not overly shiny is it so i can technically use it but still i would rather have it a little more matte so i'm going to dip into the matte brown plate and i'm going to apply right about over it just to modify the color a little bit next i'm taking a fluffier blending brush this is lavish brush which says tapered blending i'm going to go in between coin and white gold so this palette has mostly shimmers which i did not realize when i was buying it so there's a lot of shimmers and very few mattes so i'm going to mix this too and eventually create blend so this has warmer tones compared to the first two tones this is much warmer so i'm going to go right over in a little buff about 50 50 just to warm it up and blend it out [Music] taking a tiny brush from spectrum this is spectrum a27 i'm going to this satin color uh shimmery retriever this one and this uh the texture of a pro palette i love the pro revolution pro texture because it's really flattering the shimmers are not chunky at all the very smooth so that's what i feel like the difference it makes between the regular revolution or makeup obsession and the revolution pro is the next level because all the shimmers are so smooth and buttery i already cut my crease with the same base from here actually it's very decent i find it greases just a little bit i mean like any base would but it's not overly oily so i'm happy with the quality so i'm taking a kind of a large flat brush just for the ease of application this is spectrum a18 and we're gonna shovel some color i'm gonna go into uric that's a true gold shimmer [Music] going back to the first brush i was using i'm going to back into a provine and we're going to blend into the shimmery gold [Music] and now for the lower lash line i'm going to go with a flat brush like this and this is spectrum 813 kind of smudgy brush i'm going to go for the warmest color in the palette this is strike it's kind of pretty wide color and we're going to go put this in our lower lash line i'll put the base in the lower lash line too the revolution pro shades are literally like butter i'm always so pleasantly satisfied with this it's not a surprise anymore because i know the quality is gonna be there but every time i use a revolution profile it's like wow the quality so there are two press glitters one is gold leaf and one is uh hull cyan whole cyan i guess so i'm going to go into a hull sign because i want this to be real warm i'm going to use the same brush the flat brush for shimmer just going to flip it and we're going to see without any base without any glitter glue how it's going to perform i mean obviously did they die already look at that look at that glitter how easy went on no problems at all there is very minimal fallout almost nothing that's incredible the revolution parole keeps killing it this is so pretty look at that now i'm going to take this liquid eyeliner from berea and this is the gift from my friend ann marie thank you i love you my friend and this is color three it says so it's a light pink so i'm gonna i wanted to do something for it to stand out and i want it with uh glitter first but i'm like there need to be something pink here because the colors are warm here under anyway something for contrast so this is uh very misinspired so that's i look i applied urban decay eyeliner in my waterline and this is a color gold it's called actually gold mine so that's a friend gift shoe thank you guys for making me bougie which like dry but you won't succeed i'm still cheap ho and of course the liner was a high vis liquid eyeliner by barium for the shape like this missile like this kind of round shapes it's my first time going at it and after the eyeliner use the revolution liner the renaissance flick and for the mascara i use i heart revolution chocolate and eyelashes on the same lashes i've been using for a while these are ultra eager eyelashes so yeah so that's a look it's very simple very neutral with a little pink so just right up my alley let me finish the face makeup and i'll be back to give you all the tea and all the shade in the palette so the base makeup is done and this is the eye look so there you have it yeah very nice blend very easy very buttery very smooth i mean everything you expect from high-end eyeshadow this palette has it so this is not a brand new palette but it's one of my uh latest hauls from giddy bay and this came before a naked tutorial spot of course but it's very not elena glam usual it's very neutral but it's very pretty so i really really like this and the quality is the irregular revolution pro quality all the mattes are really easy to blend all the shimmers are smooth doesn't show texture which you like very well very much when you highlight the eyebrow brow bone it doesn't really give you those uh chunky pieces like some of the highlighting shades too so i really really impressed and this is like what you would expect for a revolution for the high-end quality the glitters are amazing the press glitter stay on doesn't fall out doesn't go anywhere i mean top-notch really top-notch even the base usually the shades like this i hate those but it really works well to me it just works well the eyeshadow light to it stuck to it very well and even though the shade is a little dark for some skin tones it still works really well i'm very very impressed with like literally everything about this palette so actually i highly recommend the 24 karat gold palette is amazing amazing elena glove approved so if you guys are into neutrals and some gold and some nice fresh glitter this is a really good buy it was eighteen dollars on beauty bay and i'm going to find a link i'm going to listed this in the description box real nice palette revolution pro i did not i don't don't ever remembers getting anything bad from them every single hiding my god from revolution pro is excellent top notch so if you wonder what's my skin applied revolution concealing hydrate foundation and revolution concealer hydrate concealer and these are products i have not used in a while that's why i wanted to use them again i applied the revolution powder a lot of revolution products the highlighter the revolution pro pretty much the bronzer evolution for everything is a revolution pro or revolution on my face and except the lips the lips are maybelline loyalists the matte lipstick so that's a look so let me know what you guys think do you have this palette this was released i believe a couple of months ago so it's new ish it's really pretty and i like all the gold line the spray it's like my favorite spray hands down so uh let us know in the comments what you think do you own this palette and uh leave me a comment like this

go ahead and hop right into this video so as you can see you're gonna need some of this imitation gold leaf flakes that i got from amazon you're also gonna need some tweezers and what i'm basically gonna do is pull apart these flakes just to get them as small as i can [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] so [Music] so as you can see my lip gloss base is already pre-made if you would like to know exactly how to make the perfect lip gloss base i already made a video on that so i will um tag that video at the end of this video so you can watch that one but right now i'm just adding the coconut flavor because that's the last thing that i do to my gloss [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so i know y'all looking at this like she did not cut up them flakes but i was getting tired like i kept pulling them apart but it didn't seem like they were getting any smaller and they rip apart easily so i was like let me see if they just um rip apart on their own while i'm mixing it inside of the lip gloss base [Laughter] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so gratefully the flakes mix good with the lip gloss base so it's perfectly fine um if you just cut them up for a little bit and then put them in there you don't have to like make them really really small they fit in the gloss perfectly fine and i actually added more flakes in as well i just didn't put it on camera [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Applause] you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now i sucked up my lip gloss base into my syringe and now i'm going to get ready to fill my tubes and a really key part of filling wand tubes is that you really want to stop at that line um for example for my my wand tubes you would stop at the pink line um because when you put the stopper and the wand stick in there the lip gloss rises a little bit so you definitely want to make sure that you stop at the line [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] so [Music] so here's the part that i was talking about earlier um now it's time to put this stopper in the stick in there you're going to see the glossy rise a little bit and then you're going to understand a little bit why i told you that it was very important to stop at the line [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Applause] [Music] [Applause] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] so [Music] and there you have it that's how you make 24k gold gloss thank you for watching this video be sure to support black businesses as i always say and be sure to visit my website at www.six [Music]", "a9a9Z6XK7s4": "i don't even know how many times i've done this intro breathe relax just take your time and say what you're gonna say

airbrush makeup look using my temptu 24 karat air compressor", "0E2h96a4Br0": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel I hope y'all having an amazing day today I am back with a very exciting video I have a review - demo on some eye patches these eye patches are super popular at the moment and I'm very excited to try them out for you guys in camera these are called the 24 karat gold collagen eye masks and they come in a box that looks like this now there are 15 pairs inside the box which will definitely last you for quite a while you're supposed to use these about two to three times a week to see results so these eye masks are packed with rich nutrients that help to naturally hydrate your under eyes they also help with puffiness dark circles and they help to rejuvenate that delicate area around your eyes which will help to prevent wrinkles and I am very excited for that you guys because my skin is super dry and to be honest with you I do take care of my skin but I do forget to really take care of my under eyes and that is such an important part of our face especially under eyes that's what tends to get wrinkled faster so I am very excited to show you in camera some before and after pictures after I use these and try them out so that way you guys can check for yourselves and see how they work so like I said there are 15 in the box which will definitely hold you off for quite a while and that way you can really try for yourself and see results so let's go ahead and get started with the demo so that way I can show you how I use them and also give you a little bit more information about them so before we get started let me show you the packaging these are from the brand Promenade cosmetics and they are called a 24 karat gold collagen eye masks you will get 15 pairs inside these help to reduce the appearance of wrinkles puffiness and you will also feel a nice refreshing feeling after the first use so the first thing you want to do is you want to wash your face and I with warm water next you're gonna take out the packaging and this is what they look like they're almost like a jelly-like formula and they do feel very refreshing to the touch right after that you want to apply it directly under your eyes making sure that the whole entire area is covered and you want to apply them as close as possible to your under eyes you can leave them on for about 15 to 20 minutes and they do say that it's best to use before sleep time or while resting so once for 15 minutes have passed you're going to remove the masks and clean with water immediately after removing these masks my undereyes felt so hydrated he felt very refreshed and I totally can see a huge difference here's a picture of the before and after my under eyes definitely look brighter now these masks say that it's better if you use them about 2 to 3 times a week so what do you guys think did you see any difference did you like them what do you guys think let me know in the comments down there below I really hope you guys enjoyed my honest review and opinion about these eye masks I myself personally think they are pretty awesome I am in love with them and I'll definitely keep using them I did see some amazing results after using them first or second time and I'm pretty sure that after I use them for quite a while I will see even a bigger difference but I highly recommend them you guys are totally worth it I'll leave you guys the exact link on where you guys can purchase these done that below as well as in my blog I will be making a blog post to give you guys more information more details about them so make sure you check that out as well I hope you guys have an amazing rest of your day and I'll see you guys next time bye [Music]", "67d_V1U7At4": "[Music] everybody just wanted to do a video unboxing my new Oakley Juliet 24 karat gold sunglasses so basically I just bought these and I pretty much just opened them now the package is like a carbon fiber type pattern not sure if you can see it pretty well so on the top of the box you have the gold coin the Juliette gold coin pretty cool the coin is actually removable and that's on the back of the coin that was skeleton all right and when you open the box up there a bit hopefully some glass case and inside the box you basically have warranty paperwork nothing interesting and you also have these accessories right here okay pretty cool on the case you have the gold X for a limited edition sunglass like this I'm pretty surprised that came in a in a sunglass case like this it's pretty much it's just a fabric type case hardshell would have been nice if it came in a nicer display box so you just take a look inside inside you have the caring polishing cloth pretty basic also again has as the X Oakley all right now let's take a look at sunglass inside and here we have it 24 karat gold Juliette these are polarized these are limited to 750 pieces so pretty rare they look really cool they're fairly they're pretty heavy they're not that heavy but they're definitely not as light as titanium itself all right well thank you for watching please subscribe comment like or dislike thank you [Music]", "1mSew07Fbpc":

"[Music] hey guys it's jest and welcome back to my channel today I have a distinct look for you guys and it's just like a golden dramatic yet wearable eye I really like how it turned out and if you guys would like to see how I achieved this just keep on watching if it's your first time stopping by my channel welcome and be sure to hit that subscribe button so you can join the fam and we'll just dive into the makeup so it's starting off you guys know I just had to show off my hand I just I had to it was a must but I'm going to go ahead and fill in my brows using my honest usnea brow definer I ran out of my old one and that was in the shade evany so I picked up the shade granite and I've been really liking it I've been cleaning up my brows or anything like you guys know I've been into the more natural brow and then I'm going to go ahead and prime my lids and everything and this is what I do when I can't find my Beauty Blender that that is the face that is the phase I'm just using my Sigma 3d HD Blender and I've been loving this recently I'm using my master palette by Mario this is discontinued I do believe I might be wrong but the shades that I'm using are just really common shades that are in most palettes so I'm just using a really warm tone orangie shade and then I'm going to go in with this war matte brown shade and just pop that into my crease and just kind of dust it everywhere it doesn't matter doesn't have to be perfect because I am going to clean it up but I'm just going to feather it out a little bit and then I'm going to go into my concealer in a second here and I'm just going to create a crease I like you can't tell but I actually have small lids so I kind of I kind of got to fake it a little bit and go a little bit higher then I'm going then I'm going to go ahead and see my NYX perfect filter palette into that like really really golden color and just pop that right on top [Music] now I'm just going back into that brown shade that I used earlier just to make sure everything just looks good you know then I'm just going to go back into that orange shade and just kind of blend everything out make sure everything is nice and seamless then I'm just going to clean up any fallout and create my wing I'm using the Milani liquid liner and I don't love the stuff but it did the job for today I'm just going to go ahead and create kind of a longer inner wing and then I'm going to pop on some lashes and then while I was waiting for them to dry I just used a little bit of color correctors just you know save some time and then I'm going to go into the NARS matte tinted moisturizer or something of that sort I really really like the stuff and it lasted all day it was really really seamless so if you're looking for a good it doesn't feel like a tinted moisturizer because it is a little bit on the heavy side but it's still really I don't know how to explain it I don't know but I really like it it lasts all day and it's just good for days where you can just throw something on and it has that coverage but I'm sure stuff I'm going to stop but if it's a good kitchen boy stressor and then I'm going to go in and highlight using my la girl pro longwear no yeah my la girl fro log we're and I'm going to put a little bit of my NYX like highlighting drops wow this is this is bad this is a mess but I'm just going to go ahead and lend that out again using my Sigma 3d HD blender [Music] next I'm going to go ahead and set it using my Laura Mercier translucent powder for bronzer today I'm going to use this new one from Becca I've really been enjoying it recently and I'm just going to put that on my forehead to make sure that everything looks good it doesn't look like I'm wearing like a mask or anything and then just go ahead and kind of dust it everywhere I'm not really contouring not really bronzing just whatever is in the middle of those two is what I'm doing and then I'm going to go into my Bobbi Brown highlighter in the shade bronze glow I believe and just pop it on isn't too intense or anything but it's still really really beautiful it's like melts into the skin and I love it going back into the eyes I'm going to put some Brown in my waterline and then I'm going to go back into those two shades that I've used earlier and just kind of smoke that out just a sad bit [Music] then using that highlight from earlier I'm highlighting my brow bone and my inner corner and then I lined my lips using the Mac bittersweet lipliner and I'm using this shade from Bella I don't remember the name of it and I mixed it with a lighter shade I will leave it down in the description box below so that is that for this video I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did be sure to give it a big thumbs up and subscribe if you have not already and I will see you guys in my next video", "_euLBBsKMTA": "hey mom you're getting fat try my nature's cereal blueberries blackberries crunchy pomegranate lychees dragon fruit ice 24 karat

jacket the atom lc so i've owned both the previous version as well as this year's 2020 revised version so i wanted to speak on some key comparisons as well as give you guys a real life look on this 24 karat gold color scheme i haven't seen too much out there so i thought i'd provide this review for you and keep you updated so i'm going to go start with some key differences starting with the bottom of the jacket the sleeves are slightly different this year the elastic clinch is supposed to be easier for marterix to layer next it's a slightly different zipper which i'll show you later but it's been pretty good for me no bite at all super smooth i didn't have a problem with last year's version so it didn't seem to be a problem the sleeves in the jacket are slightly longer they're 0.8 of an inch longer it's a little bit longer for me but it helps out with some people with longer arms it's for climbing when you're reaching up quite often the jacket is slightly longer last year where the back was hemmed out a bit longer it's even this year making the jacket slightly longer and i'm okay with that i think a little bit more length is okay for the jacket it's also quite a bit leaner the chest is a lot more narrow than last year's jacket i think that's great it has a really nice fit makes it super easy when i'm laying it under a shell a hard shell so i really like this new fit and wearing it around town this year as well there's a double cinch to pull tight last year's version just had one on the right side this just version has both so it's a little bit more even i think it's something a lot of people recommended so i'm glad they did that as well the hood this year has elastic the whole way around this makes it much easier to wear against a with a helmet on i think it's a nice added feature also looking at the logo this year it is stitched whereas last year it was a an emblem pasted on this gives it a much more uh high quality feel and something that i like quite a bit as well looking at this logo it's a 24 karat gold color scheme that's something new at this year's version i really like the 24 karat gold color scheme it's on the inside it's on the hood and i think gives it a really nice touch and i was really looking forward to this color scheme of something new from the atom lt and a really nice update it also has the same pocket on the inside of the jacket as they had in last year's version this jacket one common with this jacket is slightly colder with the new insulation that they have in uh the core compact insulation they have in this jacket this thing is around roughly for me around 20 percent colder but i don't think that's a huge deal when you compare the narrower better fitting movements of this jacket i really like it and i think it's definitely worth the upgrade of last year's adam lt so if you're on the fence and looking for some more information i think this is your side i think it's a great jacket i definitely recommend the revised version over last year's version it's a lot more narrow a lot less boxy and i really love some of the added features so thanks for watching my video and stay tuned for more updates in the future on our terrax and other outdoor gear so once again thanks for watching i hope this helped", "Y43cKkWTQyM": "I'm supposed to be doing it that video but this box arrived today and I'm so excited I can't wait to open this box oh I just change my plan because I want to unbox and share this with you guys so let's do it [Music] hey guys thanks for stopping by if you're new here my name is d and I would really appreciate it if you could join my squad so please subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and don't forget click on that Bell so you will be notified every time I post the video so it comes with the box and this is comes with a dust bag as well oh this is chanel medium/large plastic flow in of your leather and in gold hardware I think it's every girl's dream to own one of these because it's timeless and plastic and no matter how old you are it's not gonna go out of style and I so so so so once if this ever since I started my collection in 2011 but I just couldn't justify the price even back then because it's ridiculously expensive but imagine if I bought this in 2011 the price but that was just more than 2,000 pounds and now the prices can up to more than 4,000 pounds it's one of my biggest mistake that I didn't buy this Batman because the prices going up ridiculously and I keep on buying other designer bags that were more price friendly but this didn't leave my radar and I still end up buying one now if you've been following me you already knew that I always get my pre-loved designer bag from Coco priv\u00e9 and Instagram seller and please I got from him again and did I mention that he accepts installment basis so you can play him stuck idly for up to eight weeks and he can just say if any percent to secure the items that you wanted and you have the option to pay weekly or monthly for a maximum of eight weeks without any interest and it's very convenient for me cuz I can spread the cost and it's not too painful to pay a large sum to own this beautiful bag because it's still expensive even itself free love it's still a lot of money you can check him out on Instagram put the link below and don't worry all the items that he's selling or Olaf I think I bought a lot of my from him before and he offers double money-back guarantee if it can prove to him that the item that you purchase is not genuine not going to tell you the details of this bag please I think most of you knew about this very popular bag already but there is a significant difference between this bag and the card collection because this bag was manufactured in 2008 and the difference is this chain and the stirring lock which are made of real 24 karat gold hardware so in May 2008 or 2009 Chanel stopped making hardware with real 24 karat gold plates head and instead they started to use gold-tone hardware and so this hardware is made with an allied containing 24 karat gold and this alloy is coated into the metal so that's why this gold looks more darker compared to the card collection and there is a small pump if you can see yeah there is a small there is a small stump on this if you love because it's a standard practice in goldsmith or jewelry making to include the hallmarks thumping it's to indicate the what kind of gold or metal is used so this mount here indicates that the hardware is 24 karat gold although it's been a decade since this virus purchase is the only break condition all quarters are clean no scuffing or scratches and the structure is still in fact and I got this for a really good price I think the owner has made a profit but I still save a lot of money for this because I just purchased this for two thousand seven hundred pounds and I think it's justifiable considering that the price now has gone up to 4,300 pounds to be exact so I was able to save about two thousand or nearly two thousand pounds for this bag so my advice to you guys if you're looking or planning to buy this bag and you don't mind that other people have already used a search on the pre-loved market because there are so many out there who barely use the bag and it's still in great condition and you save tons of money this the design is still the same and nobody will check if the speaker or the card inside is brand new or is in card collection or not and as you as long as you take care of your bag it will last a lifetime so I don't regret buying this bag because it still looks really good and it's another pick on my wish list let me show you the inside this is not in burgundy color so there's still a zipper there and it's in black color and looks like this inside I have the card as well and the authentic card so this is a in twelve series so it seems 2008 collection and yeah I so love love-love-love whatever check I don't regret buying this and I'm so lucky to have found this in this condition and for this price as well and I think this is one of my best franchises for this year yeah this is my new Chanel medium large plastic Club so that's it for today guys I hope you've enjoyed this video and if you like this video please give you a thumbs up and I'll see you again on my next video final", "0trEDvynr6Y": "[Music] um [Music] baby i am [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] like [Music] [Music] [Music] what to baby i'm playing with your rules [Music] [Music] hey [Music] [Music] [Music] so i'm gonna resize [Music] it feels like i lost myself i'm an overthinker and a drinker i know hey i hope one day i'll be able to forgive me all cause i'm not able to forgive myself right now from but you always seem to let me down [Music] i made a few mistakes", "9CP0rom923M": "are you looking at his three vials at the bottom of each vial is pure gold at the top is pure silver okay if you melt this vial down what you're gonna get is an alloy known as ten karat gold ten karat gold is 41 percent pure gold I know that doesn't look like 41 percent but by weight it is silver is lighter than gold this is 14 karat and this is 18 karat you could tell the volume difference that you get with 10 karat gold over 18 karat because the silver is lighter you can get more volume it's like cutting up let's say drugs that people want more volume so they cut it up and they do this type of stuff these are beads that are used for casting that's what you're seeing in here this is how you make gold chains what you want to realize from this video is that whatever you own is 14k or 10k you always own pure gold inside your chain you have to understand you could melt it down and separate the two metals at any point of time keep that in mind", "vAwgMik41Uo": "hi everyone it's sandy I've missed you guys so much and today I'll be making gold slime and I think gold slime is so beautiful I'm starting off with clear glue and the reason why I'm using clear glue is because the color will show up way better than if you were to use white glue and I'll be using these pigments from KP pigments not sponsored but I've heard of them from Instagram and I really wanted to try them out so all I did was I just scooped some out and then I put it into the clear glue spread it out and mixed it all together until it's fully colored now it's your choice to add the pigments before you add in your slim activator or after the slime is made and you can add the color on to that but I just felt that that's Messier so I added it before the slime was even made and just look how beautiful the color is it's so nice and then now I'm adding a baking soda and I might have added a little too much baking soda but that's okay I added baking soda so that it will react with the contact lens solution and then ill form into slime so I just kept adding the solution until it becomes slime [Music] [Music] after the slime did not stick it to my ball that means it's done [Music] so the next color that I'm gonna try out is this gorgeous copper gold and it's called Nick's on gold medal so I just did the same thing as I did with the other gold color I scoop them out and then I mix it in until it's all fully colored [Music] so for this color I decided to use the borax solution method instead of the contact lens solution just because I wanted to see how different the color might be if you were to use different slime activators so I just kept adding the borax until it became slime and I know it looks so gross here but then later on after you let it sit for about 10 minutes it smooths out I guess this is pretty normal if you use borax I noticed this happens every time I use borax the slime just gets wrinkly so I kind of used a little too much borax so it was hard but it's okay you can always add a lotion to make it stretchy again [Music] and this lime I made it with contact lens solution and you can see a little bit of a difference the one that's made with borax is definitely more smoother and it's not as cloudy I think it's because baking soda was not added to it and here is the comparison of the ghost lives [Music] thank you guys so much for watching I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you have a wonderful day I'll see you my next video bye [Music]", "p3c9tzKJz0o": "hi guys welcome back to my channel this is midair jay and today's video is a requested video so i recently did an unboxing showing you guys a lot of the items that i received in pr or i purchased like some new stuff to me and some new stuff generally and in the video i unboxed a couple of new items from revolution pro and these are products i haven't used it's part of the 24k gold collection and i had a few requests to do a review makeup tutorial using these products testing them out see how i feel so that's basically what this video is going to be about i'm going to be using the items that i received from makeup revolution i have got a primer i've got eyeshadow palette i've got setting spray i've got the finishing powder so we're going to be using all of them in this video i'm going to be testing them out and hopefully we're going to create a gorgeous look so stay tuned and let's just jump right in so as you guys can see i've done my brows off camera it isn't a revolution pro product but it is a makeup revolution product and it's my go-to brow pencil it's the xs is the xx revolution xs fine brow pencil i absolutely love this pencil so i go through them like water so i've done my brows um and i've cleaned up underneath my brow i haven't done my foundation yet so i haven't carved on top of my brows yet apologies if you hear noise in the background my son's outside playing football so you might hear some noise it's unavoidable it's the weekend that's what boys love to do so yeah right so first things first i think i am going to do my eyes first um before i go on to my face so um i got the 24k gold eyeshadow palette and when i unboxed this palette i was pleasantly surprised by the color story to be honest i love revolution pro products i think the color story of their eyeshadow palettes and the formula is very very nice so i wasn't too shocked that it was an amazing color story um but i was more than pleasantly surprised by the look of it so this is the sleeve and then when you take it out you've got the same design on the packaging which is amazing it is a cardboard packaging nice thick cardboard packaging you've got 24k written in little prints and you've got 24k it's kind of like a an engraved 24k print on it and you've got revolution prize you've got um the shades at the back the shades that are starred the ones that have got pressed pigment in it and so they've signified that at the back of the box so definitely look on the back of the box so that you can see what ingredients are in each shadow they normally break it down so you've got shade 1 5 10 and 11 have got their ingredients shade 3 has another set of ingredients shade 6 and so on and so forth so definitely have a look just in case if you normally get allergic reactions to eyeshadow palettes it's important for you to check the ingredients but yeah when you open it up you've got your mirror you've got the film that protects the shadows from staying in the mirror and i love revolution pro palettes because i can bend it and it looks like that so it makes it easy when i'm applying my shadow to my face and yeah nice size mirror beautiful colors so i'm going to show you guys the colors before we dip in so this is the color story you've got some beautiful gold shades you've got some lovely autumnal colors like the dark and burnt type of red you've got your dark brown you've got like lilac you've got purple you've got rose gold so it's a beautiful balance of very pretty shades so excited right so if you're new to my channel i do like to do one eye one eye off camera just so that i can get my bearings with the shades i can try them out formulate my own opinion so that when i come back on camera to do the second eye i can give you guys a fully formed impression about how the shadows perform any problems anything that i love i'll be able to share that clearly so i'll be right back let me just get one eye done okay right so this is the look that we're going to be doing i just wanted to do something simple quick just to showcase how pretty the palette is because it is very pretty let's spoil a little bit so to start with i'm going to use the gerard cosmetics um new clean canvas base in shade fair this is what it looks like it's a little creamier than the white and so i tend to like to use it for like neutral well i call this a neutral look might not be neutral for some but i call it a neutral look um so what i like to do is i apply a little bit with my brush first on my lid and then i blend it out with my blending sponge so right onto the lid and then i take my sponge and i just blend it in and i like using the sponge now because it really gives me that like blended like i haven't done anything it's already blended blended look without any harsh edges right so that's blended so i'm going to start off with the first shade the first shade that i'm going to use is called strike strike it's like a dark brown shade i should probably show you guys the shade so this is this is not going well right so the first shade that i'm going to use is this one called strike and it's like a dark it's like a dark reddish kind of shade um so i just want to blend that into the crease i'm going to try it out and see how pigmented because it's clearly very pigmented and there isn't that much fallout from the palette like there's i don't have to tap my brush at each instance to kind of get the um excess off the excess just stays on the brush and i'm able to blend it in to my eye okay i'm taking that all the way in as well like so normally i start off with a darker shade and then i blend it out but i wanted to see how well the eyeshadow layers so now i'm gonna go in with um i'm gonna go in with two shades i'm gonna go in with mine first which is like a darker brown and then i'm gonna go in with this color called plate which is more like a cool tone type of brown shade i'm actually going to use the mirror because that might just be easier to hold other than another mirror i'm going to go in with mine and i'm really going to blend that into the crease because i really wanted to deepen the crease so with this shade i find that i have to like go in a few times to really get the saturation that i'm looking for like the depth which is fine but just so that you're away isn't a quick process you kind of have to layer it in and then i'm going to go in with plates to further deepen the crease and then to soften the edge of that i'm gonna go into coin now initially i thought coin would be like a lighter brown shade but it applies as deeply as this one does so i'm learning from my first mistake and as you can see it it's quite dark so i didn't use as much this time and i'm just gonna share it out i actually thought it would be as light and as brown as it looks in the pan but it has more of like a red finish to it so which kind of goes with the with um the other shades in the palette but i just thought it was a little lighter so i could use it to really blend out and diffuse the edges but um no it is not so be careful because when you look at the palette and you look at the color story you don't have like that light brown shade to kind of blend things out i feel like this concealer shade that revolution likes to pop into these palettes are quite redundant people don't use them people have their own eye bases or they use concealer so this could have been like a lighter brown shade to kind of blend out these deeper tones in my opinion like we really don't need that base shade so another thing i noticed as well is that the depth gets easily lost when you blend stuff out so you need to go back in to redefine the crease again which i am fine with because it stays layering like it doesn't not layer which is great so all right and this is what we have so now i'm just going to go in with my lid colors so for my lid the first shade that i'm going to use i'm not going to apply a base or anything i want to see how well they apply without an extra base so first things first i'm going to go in with 24k in the in the inner corner which is this gold shade and then gilded so initially when i looked at both shades they kind they look the same to me so let me swatch them side by side actually so that we can see what they look like because when you swatch them on the finger they look the same so this is 24k okay and then this is gilded so i don't see the difference um i'm sure there's a difference but it's not as obvious as i would like it to be for the lid so um yeah so i'm going to go in with 24k first apply that and i'm actually going to spray my brush so that it applies better and just and apply that quite sparingly and it's a very beautiful gold shade then i'm going to take another brush and then i'm going to apply gilded right next to it and really blend it in i guess when you look closely gilded has more like a cooler type of gold on the turn when you like when you're trying to really split hairs and then to just soften the edges i'm going to go back in with strike and just blend out the edges i'm going to add a little bit of mine and plate again and just kind of like blend it in just so that the lid color looks like it's together and there are no harsh lines because we really want this to be like a diffused look i'm not looking for any cut creases or anything just really soft really soft blend all right so obviously i have to try one of the pressed pigments so i'm gonna try halcyon on the lid so you're not in camera halcyon on the lid which is this beautiful pressed gold it's like a warmer gold type of um shade which goes well with 24k and gilded and i'm just going to slightly spray my brush a little bit for this you don't have to because it's a pressed pigment and i would readily use my finger but i've got nails on which is always a pain so i'm gonna have to use a brush and hope for the best and i just want to apply it sparingly don't want it like precise and i don't want a lot of it so just quite sparingly this is what it looks like i think it's quite pretty very very pretty very pretty and i'm gonna move on to my lower lash line so for my lower lash line i'm going to use um the same shades i used on my lid i'm going to use strike coin and mine on the outer corner and then i'm going to apply 24k on the inner corner just to open up my eyes a little bit so yeah and then i'm going to apply my wing liner so my eyes are done i'm going to move over to my face so first things first i'm going to re-moisturize my face because i cleaned a little bit of my moisturizer what when i was cleaning um any excess makeup off my face so i'm gonna do that real quick before we apply the primer so in the collection there is the 24k gold um primer and this is a serum primer and this is one it's like proper type of bottle okay looks like you've got flecks of gold in it very nice it says it's a hydrating priming serum infused with 24 karat gold for added radiance contains hyaluronic acid plant-derived collagen and vitamin b5 all right so let's try this i'm going to use the conceal and define foundation so i don't mind using a hydrating primer i am gonna set my face on all of that anyway this is very intriguing so i'm gonna use a dropper and i try not to touch my skin when i'm using a dropper oh that is pretty i can see the gold yeah i use a lot of primer guys feels nice feels like a serum because it is a serum it does feel hydrating immediately hydrating i like to hit underneath my eyes as well because i don't like that area looking dry [Music] that feels really nice i'm going to give it a couple of minutes to really soak into my skin that feels real good so this is what my skin feels like it does feel hydrated and it feels a little bit tacky which is great for my foundation and i'm going to use the goddess glow fixing spray so this has night nice cinnamon this thing always tongue ties me it has nice cinnamide in it and cucumber extract um fixing spray that gives the skin a dewy finish so this gives the skin a dewy finish we've also got another fixing spray this one has gold shimmer in it which i'm thinking to use as a finishing spray this is a refreshing shimmer setting spray with a subtle fragrance so i know this one says it gives a dewy finish but i am going to spray my face because the primer is a hydrating primer anyway which already makes my skin look dewy so it makes no difference but i like to set my primer in place and i don't think i'll have any other opportunity to use this so let's try it it does have a nice smell [Music] strong but very nice smell yeah it's a very strong smell so if you don't like smell you're not gonna like this because the smell is strong smells nice but it's it's strong it hits you at the back of the throat kind of strong so i'm gonna let that dry all right that's dried and yet skin is still feeling tacky which is brilliant so i'm gonna go ahead and apply my foundation on top of this and i don't have a new foundation from revolution pro i do want to try the cc cc foundation i don't know i still haven't purchased it but i don't have a new primer so i don't have a new foundation i don't have a new concealer from revolution pro i am very interested in the new concealer let me know if you guys are intrigued by that or if anyone's tested it and what you think um so i'm gonna do those off camera just to make just to speed things up and then i'll come back with the other products that i do have so be right back right so this is what we have so far um just to give you a run through the products that i used i used the conceal and define foundation in 13 and i also use the conceal and i also use the conceal and define infinite concealer in c 12.5 i set my face i use my setting powder and to bronze i use the revolution pro um sculpting bronzer in n-robe i love this sometimes it doubles up as a blush for me as you guys can see i really accentuated my cheeks so now i want to try out the goddess glow finishing powder so they come in two shades basically these finishing powders are supposed to be like all over finishing powder on your face they're not setting powders they're just to like finish to give you that extra oomph um after you've done your makeup you can also intensify the color by um using a damp brush to apply it so it comes in radiate and it comes in splendor it says that it's a weightless finishing powder that provides a subtle glow to the skin so it's kind of difficult to know what shade i would use so this is radiates you can see it's very light underneath and then you've got splendor which is slightly darker so obviously i'm going to try splendor first i'm going to swatch it on my hand and they come with a a puff which is good so i guess for light application throughout but i think i'm gonna use a brush because if it's supposed to be like loose all over powder i almost do not want to like concentrate the product it comes with a seal and then it's a puff all right it's like a cushion to get the product up so you don't get that much product at once which is great so let me see how much you get on the path okay get tiny bit on the puff i guess so best things for me that i would do because i you know we're gonna be here all day if i do that so i'm just gonna see if anything so a little bit comes on the cap i'm gonna try the one on the cap and see how it looks like the back of my hand okay it's got a little bit of a glow a little bit of a sheen to it you can just barely see it which is good because you don't i don't really want anything to ruin my makeup so a little bit of a sheen is all right so let me get a little bit more on the cap and see if i can i'm just gonna use a nice fluffy brush and just go over my face i don't even know what to do okay let's go over oh do you see that see my cheek okay i see it i see it let's see it on my forehead now can you see that is pretty all right all right come through revolution i like products like this i knew i would be pleasantly intrigued by this so now literally just like oh all right all right i'm gonna intensify i want to see what it looks like um intensified somewhere on my face drying everything so i'm gonna get a new brush i'm gonna spray it make it down and i'm just gonna concentrate it as a highlighter because i don't have one on yet so okay okay i love that subtle i don't do subtle but i do this one this is pretty this is pretty i just love the way it catches the light what do you guys think way i think just catches the light ever so gently this is definitely not a highlighter but you can use it as a highlighter as well if you intensify intensify by using a damp brush i love it and then all of this as a i love it as an oliver finishing powder but it looks like it also works as a highlighter which i am leaving i'm never not gonna want to put highlighter on but this is this is good for my queens who don't like like the really intense highlighter finish this looks very subtle and very soft so yes please i love i'm just going to use the same brush that i used to do my bronzer and i'm just going to blend over because i just like it all blended together [Music] no harsh lines i almost forgot to mention that i am wearing the new collaboration lashes by carmi in self-worth these are full dramatic lashes carmi and um ling.kt they came out with a new collaboration with ilor three lashes ish each six in total so i'm wearing self-worth and it is very dramatic i absolutely love it very very easy to apply you guys know that eye low lashes are banging so yeah i almost forgot to mention that how could i how could i so i'm just gonna do my lips off camera um i'm gonna use the makeup academy lip pencil and obsession and the revolution pro hydrating lip gloss in suede so to finish it all off i'm going to use the 24k um gold fixing spray with a golden shimmer so you can see the shimmer is underneath bottle so i'm gonna shake it up these things scare me because they're usually very like very very pigmented so what i'm going to do just to see how intense i'm going to spray it at the back of my hand first and see what the um right so that's what it would look like can you guys see how yellow my hand looks right now so that is a lot that is way too much but that is what it looks like so i probably wouldn't use it for this face um yeah because i don't want it to be full on there's a lot it's a lot of shimmer no that is way too much so i'm gonna use instead the um goddess glow fixing spray that we use in the beginning i'm gonna use it to fix my face [Music] and then i'll come back to you guys with my final thoughts all right guys this is the finished look and i am living mostly for the base but i am living so let me really run through the products and let you guys know what i think so to start with let's go with the 24k gold eyeshadow palette now i love the color story as i said to you guys i think the color story is fun i think revolution can definitely swap out this base um i think they need to stop popping it in it's supposed to be a base for you to put the shadows on and this is what it looks like it i'm not saying it's a bad base because i have used it before and it does work and it doesn't crease and that's what it looks like but really honestly people have bases that they prefer to use and plus the amount of fallout and stuff that gets into that base it just messes up the quality of the color over time so i would rather they take that out and pop in a brown like a light brown a little bit of orange kick to it and to be able to blend out these beautiful um tones these beautiful colors so they can swap that out easily and in terms of the pigmentation the eyeshadow palette is beautiful it's so pigmented like these are just random swatches of some of the shades that i didn't use and you can see how well they come out so just look at that so pigmentation is not a problem the pigmentation is gorgeous the pressed glitter as pressed glitter always goes it's a hit or miss thing for me sometimes they work really well like today sometimes they break up sometimes they crease that's the joy and downfalls of pressed glitter i'm happy that they only added two pressed glitters to this palette and they're beautiful shades so they don't take away from the look even if they break up a little bit because i can see some separation they still add to the look they still enhance the look so i'm not mad at it i love the colors that they chose for it i love the gold tones i honestly feel like there is almost no difference between 24k and gilded gilda just has more of like a slightly cooler toned vibe to it but honestly they could have swapped that out with a darker shade of gold um just to make it really nice or maybe pop in a black with some gold um speckles in it some gold glitter in it just so that it matches really nicely with the packaging as well yeah other than that i have nothing negative to say about this palette i absolutely love it um if you're looking for a fun eyeshadow palette just something new from the drugstore definitely worth getting this is a really beautiful palette very easy to use very pigmented easy to blend you guys can see i literally used one two three four five six shades plus the pressed um glitter seven i could have probably skipped one or two shades so yeah it's it's a beautiful palette and it will create you some beautiful looks now onto the skin based products so i use the primer the 24k gold primer and it felt really hydrated on the skin when it did dry down my skin felt a little tacky which is great for foundation because then it grabs onto the foundation quite nicely and the gold speckles didn't doesn't i don't see any negatives of it um i don't see how it enhanced i didn't see how it made any it didn't make a difference to me to be honest so but the primer itself for me i could see the difference and i could see how we grabbed onto my foundation and i almost want to say that it did help to smooth out my pores because i don't really see my pores um underneath the whole foundation and powder and everything so i probably did help to kind of camouflage my pores as well so i definitely will be using this i also love the packaging and the droplets type of um packaging that they went with is easy to control the amount of product that you're using and i just love droppers to be honest for everything so yeah i absolutely love this if you're looking for a primer hydrating primer to use for your foundations definitely check this one out i love the finish and i love the way it sits underneath my makeup um in terms of the spray so the 24k gold fixing spray i'm not gonna say that it um this one i'm not gonna say that it's fixed my makeup and it's not gonna budge but right now it feels really fixed like i i'm using a hydrating primer and a matte foundation but still sometimes my oils they've got a mind of their own and they like to break through but i don't feel like anything's breaking through the barrier i feel like the primer is holding me down the powders are holding me down so this is a long wear type of test i need to test it out in the elements to see how it holds up but so far i like the way it feels i like the smell it is a bit overpowering there's a lot of smell to it so if you're not into smells it's gonna choke you a little bit other than that i love i love the smell personally but i know some people don't like products that smell so just be wary of that but the smell isn't off but it is it actually quite nice very fruity smells like um cucumber i guess and freshness and fruit so to me it's it's a nice smell and the 24k gold fixing spray with a gold shimmer personally i wouldn't use this on my face i would use it on my body just because of the amount of gold that comes out on this i feel like if i spray this on my face it's really gonna ruin my makeup um so i'm not a fan of this to be honest i would only use it for my body but that's not what it's for it says that it's a fixing spray with a gold shimmer so i think the gold shimmer could have been a little less it's a bit much in there like i've can you see you see how yellow it is like i would definitely if out of everything i would definitely leave this one out because i don't i don't really see the need and it's very easy to go overboard with this one now in terms of the goddess glow finishing powders i didn't test out um radiates but i did test out splendor and i absolutely love it as i said this is an oliver finishing powder it isn't a setting powder or anything it's just supposed to enhance your makeup it's supposed to dust over lightly or concentrate with a damp brush on a specific area if you really want to get that glow so this would be great for people that i know personally do not like highlighters this will be great because you can easily control the level of intensity you can just dampen your brush and concentrate it on the area that you wanted or you can just dust over for that all of a glow and just fabulousness so i love this idea and i'm really happy revolution came out with this and i think the both shades are good like the gold is not dark um that i can't wear it but and i also think that it's dark enough for a darker person to wear it um the radiates i'm guessing would be for lighter skin tone but splendor for me hit the mark so if you're looking for an oliver finishing powder or if you're not really into highlighters and you want something really subtle definitely check this one out and that's it i guess i think that's all the products from revolution pro um 24k gold line that i've tested today i hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know if there any products that are jumping out at you are you going to purchase any of them what do you think have you used them um and i hope you guys enjoyed this video please go ahead

the description box hopefully if i don't forget i'm really sorry if i do guys and i will catch you guys in a future video thank you so much for watching bye guys you", "Dt9Xsuz7O0Y": "Oh good Morgan everyone so on my Twitter recently I asked you guys between these two products here which you guys you wanted me to review a slash do a first impressions on first and this one ended up being a winner if you're wondering what these two products are because I haven't actually mentioned that yet this is from Eliza Becca this is the Kangxi pack and this is supposed to be the 24 karat gold masks from them this one is the Eliza Becca milky piggy gluttonous masks nail cream they're both pretty unique mask so I think eventually I will do a review on this for you guys but for the time being you guys really were interested in seeing this one so I'm going to apply this on my skin and we are going to see how it goes what this is supposed to do is help nourish and moisturize your skin but it's specifically designed to help brighten your skin and just make it look luminous and glowing hence why I'm assuming there are 24 karat gold extracts in here which I don't necessarily know with that home or if that's effective a but it looks fun it's so luxurious so we're going to try it out on our skin today and see if it works so I'm just going to pop this baby open so the packaging insides really nifty can you guys see that it's like as tag by seal okay who is pretty strongly fragrance so key that mine if you are the type of person who doesn't like fragrance products and let's go ahead and get you guys some close-ups of my skin so you can see what it looks like so we can decide together if we think this is actually effective and if it looks like it's worked well on my skin okay so let's just God and start applying this on Riskin alright mmm so does look very gold like I said it has a pretty strong fragrance so I'm just gonna smooth this on my skin whoa the fragrance is strong is kinda like burning my eyes hate it when products are like that when the fragrance is so strong it kind of like burns your eyes even if you don't really even get it that close I can kind of feel it with my nail matches I just noticed that right now okay so I think I'm pretty happy with that layer wow look at me so after 20 minutes I'm supposed to wash this off and then hopefully I will reveal beautiful skin that has been treated by gold I have to say that fragrance is real strong it's kind of irritating my eyes by I don't know what happened here I feel like I'm less not quite as thick a layer here as I did like on my other parts of my face oh whatever it's about ten minutes in so I've got another ten minutes to go so I will check in with you at that point and show you guys how this looks at the end alright guys so I am back and it is been officially 20 minutes that I've had this country pack on from Eliza Becca it is now crumbling on my face I can feel it and see it can you guys see it off to show you guys my shirt but it's kind of crumbling on my my like body I can see it dripping down now can you guys see it I don't know but on this kind of crawling so I'm actually gonna go wash this off before this stuff dries I think I just applied on a little too thick of a layer but yeah I need to get this off because I'm making a mess like all these crumbles can you see the mess that is my lap look at yep Wow like this job I feel like really did brighten my skin like my skin to me looks visibly brighter I don't know if you guys going to be a little tool in the before-and-afters but to me it looks a lot brighter and it also feels really smooth and moisturize I'm really impressed with this mascot honestly I thought that this was going to be like oh yeah slap this on your face and this will work really well we just put gold glitter in it but to be completely honest I really like this I plan on using this a lot more and I'm just really happy with how my skin looks and feels honestly the only downfall of this is that you don't have to use a fair amount of product more product and I was expecting to use because I felt like I'd have to kept going back to the tube and like putting more on my skin although as you could tell I put a little too much on my cheeks of course but I don't feel like I used a lot and also the fragrance of it is a little bit strong it was burning my eyes for the first couple of minutes after the first couple of minutes that dissipated and wasn't really an issue but I love how this makes my skin feel it looks so much brighter it feels nice and moisturize to the touch it feels so soft so I'm really happy with it I hope you guys enjoy me try it out this gold mask and as always I hope you guys are happy and healthy and never to rate comment subscribe share threads family and I'll see you guys in my next video bye guys", "hBgQHgJAnQo": "hello everyone welcome back to another video on my channel so for this week's review we're going to be testing out some products from the new revolution pro 24 carat gold collection now i have with me today three different products to try with you guys and if you haven't seen the packaging for this collection oh my goodness guys i am obsessed like i'm a little bit of a magpie i like shiny things so this collection is right up my street make sure if you haven't already that you subscribe to my channel as well as follow me on my socials and without further ado if you want to see how i get on with these products how i created this look and what i thought of the products as a whole then make sure to keep on watching okay everybody so we're gonna start off this makeup look by prepping the skin i've done all my normal skincare as usual ready to go however i have here the 24 carat gold priming serum now this actually retails online and in store for 15 pounds the serum itself is clear however has got little flecks of gold in it to help plump and hydrate the skin ready to keep your makeup on as long as possible the formula is also made up of some really nice ingredients too like hyaluronic acid vitamin b5 as well as plant-derived collagen i'm quite excited to try this because i think i've used something similar in the past well it's like the similar concept but not with the same ingredients the packaging for this as well is so nice oh my goodness look at this isn't this like one of the most stunning things you've ever seen ah i love revolution packaging the bottle is made of glass which is really nice and you also have a pet applicator so i'm just going to squeeze that a little bit and get some of the product into there it just basically says to apply directly onto the skin leave it on for a couple of minutes before you start doing the rest of your makeup one thing i do want to say to you guys is as cute as it looks to apply product onto your skin please don't do it directly onto your skin from the applicator itself how many times can i say the word pipette but when you do that sometimes there is quite a small chance that you are going to touch the prepare onto your skin and directly put it back into the pot just gives the bacteria on your skin a chance to kind of go in and contaminate the whole product so as cute as it is to like a dab product directly onto your skin try your best not to or if you are going to do it just drop it from like a great height so i'm just gently massaging this primer into my skin and it feels really nice and smooth always apply your primers serums whatever in an upward motion rather than downwards just to help lift your skin bring everything up because you don't want to drag it down because that's how you get wrinkles my loves straight away i've just applied it and it's left like a slightly tacky finish my skin looks nice and glowy in the viewfinder which is all good so i'm going to leave it for a couple of minutes and then i'm going to go off camera and apply the rest of my makeup okay everybody so i'm now back from applying the rest of my face makeup i'm hopefully looking slightly more alive than i did 10 seconds ago i'm now gonna go in and start testing out the 24 carat gold eyeshadow palette so this is an 18 pound palette with a mixture of 17 different shades they've got matte shades metallic shades and also glitters or like pressed pigments and like with a lot of the revolution palettes there's also one pan that has a creamy eyeshadow base in it just to help you apply the shadows as well as apply the pressed pigment to your eyes the palette also retails online and in store for 14.99 opening it up there's a really lovely big mirror but look at the shadows in this palette guys how stunning do they look i think my favorite is either medal here or this shade hair billion it's like a really nice rose gold shade and i'm so about that right now also treasure is kind of on that vibe but slightly more peachy pink okay so starting off i'm going to use the shade white gold with a clean fluffy brush just to apply to my lid as a transition shade sweeping that all over my lid making me look quite ghostly not gonna lie whilst i'm trying to figure out what to do i feel like coin coin coin coin coin and strike look really really similar i think coin coin coin is slightly slightly lighter but they both look like a really wine red shade which is slightly odd maybe when you actually apply them to your lid the tones are different i don't know i'm gonna tap into coin and applying it lightly to my lid i'm just trying to go in with a light hand because i don't want to over or underestimate any of the shadows in this palette yeah so this shade coin coin why am i struggling so much to say that word coin it doesn't sound right when it's coming out of my mouth anyway it's a really nice like wine red shade very pigmented already like i have the tiniest amount of product on there but as you can see my eyes are pink definitely one to apply gently and build up with as you can see it's popping i'm still quite intrigued about this shade strike just what's going on with that so i'm going to go in now and just gently deepen the outer corner of my eye with that just more than anything to see whether or not they are the same shade i am using a slightly denser brush though so that may change the way that it looks on my lid ngl looks pretty similar let me know in the comments do you think it's the same or do you think it's different have you tried this did you think the same thing do you struggle with pronouncing the word coin coin coin that's one thing that i found with moving from the north to the south we used to live in manchester for like 15 16 years and then moved to devon guys if you don't know i actually live in devon but even though i've completely lost my mancunian accent i still struggle to say certain words like um umbrella is it umbrella or umbrella polo polo which one do i say i know i get shouted out every time polo polo this is where i'm saying the same word and it sounds exactly the same and everyone thinks i'm actually nuts anyone else that struggles to just speak basic english hit me up because i need someone to survive with not gonna lie though i do slightly miss manchester sometimes like i think about going and visiting there because my actual mum lives there hi mum i know that you watch my videos so hello also my uncle lives like not in manchester but he lives further up slightly and i just want to go and see some people you know like quarantine lockdown and all that good stuff has got me really really wanting to like see my family more and spend time with other people anyway let's move away from that i'm gonna go into the shade mine which is a really nice kind of chocolatey brown shade i'm just gonna deepen the outer corner as well as bringing it along my lash line and up slightly in kind of like a shape it's not a c because a c is like this it's more of a definite kind of like v shape so far as i'm applying the shadows to my lid there is absolutely zero fallout onto my cheeks or anything which is really great normally there's like at least something but the matte shadows seem to be holding up quite nicely that could potentially all change though when i start applying like metallics and shimmers and stuff hopeful and grateful until proved otherwise going in with the shade plate just to deepen the outer v as i did earlier with the shade mine this shade plate is a lot more of an ashier tone than mine is also very pigmented as well so do proceed with caution when applying it to your lid build it up don't pack it on straight away bringing it more and more did you see that i tried it don't don't even this is what my eyes are looking like so far kind of a little bit of a pink and brown train wreck i'm gonna go in now and try and cut the crease on my lid so we can apply some metallic shades let's try the base because someone's at the door oh yeah my vitamin delivery arrived we got some b12 some omega-3 some iron and vitamin c also some magnesium just because i've not been feeling like 100 and i want to make sure obviously given the circumstances that my immune system is tip top anyway back to what i was doing we're going to be cutting the crease now that creamy concealer was a lot thicker than a base that i would normally use i'm going to go in with the metallic shade retriever slowly start to pat that onto my inner corner so that shade retriever is a really nice kind of light light light champagney color applies really smoothly onto the lid really easily you just pat there's like almost no work that goes into applying that the metallic shade metal just going to blend that into the center of the lid slightly mixing it into the shade retriever as we go and with that shade billion on the outer part mixing it in like we did earlier into that shade metal this is a more actual champagne tone rather than prosecco that's the better way to describe it that shade retriever was more of a prosecco shade whereas this is a rose gold champagne shade and i love it now just using that shade plate that we were using earlier i'm going to blend that into the metallic shade just to kind of make it look slightly less surprised worse description of eyeshadow oh no there is fallout now i'm just going to brush it away actually it's fine it's fine it's all good use the slightly pointy end to outline the shadow there oh that looks like i actually did that whole thing on purpose i'm going to quickly jump off camera and do hopefully amend this hopefully the same thing on this eye so i'll be right back in like two seconds hi hi i'm back and i managed to um replicate the look on both sides pretty evenly if i do say so myself i'm gonna finish up this look now by lining my lower lash line i'm just going to use a smudger brush and first of all the shade coin then using the shade plate just blending that into the rest of what is on my apple one thing i do want to say you guys a hundred percent is i really like the metallic shades in this palette i think they're so great they apply like butter onto your lids there was no fallout like look at my eyes focus focus on me look there's nothing underneath here they're really pigmented they're so smooth you don't need a lot of product to get a lot of payoff i really like that the matte shades that i used in this palette also are very pigmented and for 14.99 this palette is great i'm just putting it out there revolution you've done bougie on a budget so well with these like just these two products alone never mind the other product that we're going to finish off this look with in a second long story short palette is really great gonna finish up my eye look by applying some lashes and some mascara and then we will skip on to the last product for this review so like i said i just went off camera and applied some lashes and also did my lipstick as you can see this is the almost almost finished look but we have one thing left to try from this collection this is the 24 carat gold fixing spray with gold flecks as you can see the bottom of this is absolutely covered in shimmer and i'm all about it however i am going to make sure that i really really really shake this before i try it because i'm just worried that i'm going to have a whole blob of gold just on my head oh my goodness that actually smells amazing like it smells really really great my top's a bit wet though but it is sparkly mmm i can't describe the smell it's like very light nice that's it doesn't smell of anything like distinctive in particular well i like it also forgot to mention this retails online and install for eight pounds stop you've got enough on now you don't need anymore your face is wet that's too much so you guys this is the finished look let me know in the comments what you thought of it and what you liked about these products i am absolutely obsessed with the palette and i really did enjoy using it especially the shimmers so if you enjoyed this video as well make sure you give it a big thumbs up so i know i'll leave links to all of the products that i've shown you today in the description

online and I wanted to have one let me show you real quick the inside what I love is this gold I wanted one that I could take my coffee from my bag of whatever bag I want this is also a super awesome tool this little grabber here he gets it very easily for me and so what you do just come in here scoop in here get a nice level scoop which I'm getting kind of low here but okay there you go kind of level it off it's one hand operation I slide that over okay that over here and then what you can do is take this refillable filter reusable excuse me and I can just dump it over and it just pours in the perfect amount every single time okay and you can take a little bit closer look at it here again one of the one of the things I wanted was one that I could fit I just has a nice seal and clicks and you hear it I they come a lot of times there's different ones you could buy that what I'd have to do is my wife likes to use the Jewish tradition 'l cup okay and I like to I like to you know save some money and use my own or are there certain ones that you may want to use so again what I found the battle would have to be if I use this thing or there's different ones like this is I'd have to battle taking this thing out and then putting this thing in its place and then after I use it if I leave now my wife has to battle taking certain parts in and out and uh I wanted something that was the same size as a cup could function as a cup and she could simply if I came in and got coffee right and if if I had left it in there she could just pull it out and still put in her cup right right behind me okay and let me just show you again it has one little notch here at the bottom and you just line up with the where the needle is okay and all I gotta do is and this is again this is compatible while I'm gonna fire this up and this is that again strong and let's make it that size okay so again this is the deorro cafe the other thing I liked about this is it's BPA free I didn't want something with a bunch of you know there's cheaper ones than this you can find online but it's kind of you get what you pay for and I didn't want BPA the other thing is this is a they had it as gold yes 24 karat gold-plated it's a lot of reviews I said is there are other ones that you end up tasting a metallic taste whereas what they make with this is you'll avoid the taste of metal and preserve the rich coffee beans so again those are the two big things that were important to me that it's bpa-free and that it's not going to give me a metallic because you can get get some real cheaper this is not the cheapest one but again if it to me it's one of the best ones I found it I've had no issues with the seal I've used this for weeks and I absolutely love it and again that the convenience now that I can fill this with whatever bag I want this scooper again I'll put a link in the description where you can get this this makes it extremely easy in one hand operation okay I get the exact perfect amount and then again I get a perfect coffee now this is compatible with curd one and curd - so I've tried both of the machines we have one down here in the basement and this is our primary machine again I've had no issues it fits if it fits just like a standard cup so if you have a if it takes a cup it's gonna it's gonna work great so anyways it's produced great coffee for me every time very consistent very easy to clean out and I love it so if you're looking for the best refilled reusable filter I highly recommend this one again there are cheaper ones but it's a you get what you pay for I'm gonna put a link down in the description below right down here if you order it it helps out the channel I'd really appreciate it and hope this helps if this video helped you because I again I looked everywhere and I couldn't tell based on reviews if it was a this type this size or this size and so if that helped you out please give it a thumbs up leave any comments or questions if you have any questions about this particular filter I'll do my very best to answer so there you go the deorro a cafe a very happy with it highly recommend it thanks so much for watching",

interesting and so this is the product I am talking about it is the super baby go soap and it is made out of real 24k leave burton-esque Korean ginseng and it is blended with sandalwood essential oil smells so good so I'm gonna show you a demo on how this soap can leave your moisture onto my skin using a pretty much a simple method so I'm gonna bring you to my thing and show you the demo so I'm gonna use this on my left hand and I will show you a comparison with my right hand so first you're gonna down your skin and take this off and layer it on your skin then I rinse it off repeat the same step for the second layer and third layer that means you need three times I'm in 3d here for this so when I do the second layer so this is the comparison as you can see I spray bull pen and my left hand holds up the droplets while the right hand does not so you have watched the demo and as you can see how cool that the moisture lock effect appears on my skin so let us talk more about this product compare this soap to the other cool bar soap in the market I only have one time some three times goal in it that already cost picturing it this one as you can see obviously it is fully packed with full lip in it and this weight around 110 gun and it retail for 119 gear per bar you can use this soap for your face around 160 times and for your whole body that means shower for around 60 times so it's a really good bargain for this also I really could not tell you how back it is with gold leaf in it this soap compares to the artichoke in the market it has 70 times more 24k gold leaf in it 20 times more brightness and times more red ginseng Korean great do you think so what does this do to your skin it helps to suit out your skin white and lighten a black spot reduce scars and of course provide moisture for your skin as you can see it is India instead of just giving a moisture to your skin it's if you allow your moisture that helps keep your skin hydrated all day long for a very long time one layer is pretty much enough you want to use every day really here demo to show you guys is just an option if you want it faster in fact so I hope you enjoyed this video it's a very short

to my channel I hope you're all doing well today you guys have really been little my DIYs at the moment so I thought I would do another one for you and that's what I'm going to do today it's a DIY 24 karat in gold face mask these gold leaf facials are everywhere at the moment like everywhere now these facials will set you back 350 pounds but that is an insane insane amount of money to me and I'm sure off to a lot of you so I thought what I would do is to make around at home all you need is a moisturizer you can use one that you already use use your favorite moisturizer go and buy one you do you and then what you're going to need is gold leaf here's one I made earlier so what gold leaf looks like it comes in a sheet like this and then you'll have a piece of gold leaf gold on it if you don't want gold leaf is I'm not 100 central either but it's like a really thin sheet of 24 karat gold it's edible you can put it in bacon and and that is what they use in these facials so you will need a pack of those I got one of Amazon for about three pounds before I get into the DIY and show you how to do it and review it I'm just gonna explain to you why these facials cost so much and what the benefits are of putting gold in your skin care gold reduces the appearance and wrinkles fine lines and spots it also stimulates the skin cells prevents premature aging of the skin increased blood circulation reducing acne and other skin allergies so yeah the last of it so my makeup has been removed as if my eyes or my lips because I'm not doing that all again I'll just drop my eyes all over me okay cool this is the botanics hydrating day cream and I'm just going to basically put up on my face to give it a little bit of moisture something for the gold to stick to I need to change this background I've had it purple like over month I'm going bald a bit what color should I go for next but no gold it up here you can like use the paper to rub it on make sure looks secure boom number one done so I watched a few videos on links online and this is literally exactly how they do it in the salon for like 300 pounds oh this sick yes could mean gold you know like when you put business gone and it's just a little bit difficult to move your face because you feel like it's gonna come flying off it just feels like that just like rice paper so yeah this is what it ends up looking like it looks pretty sick so what I'm going to do is leave it on for 20 minutes and then I will come back and show you how you rub it into your skin let's take it off so from what I saw so take this off or you it should do is get my moisturizer on your fingers and you move the gold into skin that way the gold really really absorbs into the skin so that's what I'm going to do go flying off so go on just think I'm just I'm good um Oh take a snapchat waste okay so what happened is I just cleaned up the knot and then I sneezed and it blew everywhere again so I'll just touch Cuba and this is the result they really did I feel like if this was to work it'd be something that you'd have to do a lot I think it's great that you've mixed that home for about three pounds but yeah I feel like it's just a bit of a novelty and I feel like people who have almost formed your arms to spend on facial a wanting that kind of luxurious feel like they want to feel like they're covered in gold and white with a one pound pump on it face masks from Primark so I'm not really the client base for this anyway that's just me so yeah so I really hope you enjoyed this DIY something a little bit different it would not subscribe to my channel already and then please do that I really want to get to 100,000 subscribers by the end of the year like this video if you enjoyed it and you want more DIYs let me know in the

testing 24 karat gold eye product so we're test the under eye products which I'm really excited to test and this not tested skincare pain but it's trying to wear 24 karat gold products you guys know I have a serious like literally I did the gold facial wash and today we're trying the under eye mask so what I got from what is this company called mask ology so this one is from Mass ecology and this one is from dream mine so we're gonna see which one actually works better under the eye and they also send me a free lip one so we're gonna test the lip 1/2 but hold up if you're not subscribed to the channel make sure you subscribe so you can join our awesome Ohana or our awesome family make sure you're following me on all my social media sites you guys also if you like to get to know me your host better make sure you're following me on my blog channel also make sure you check out savvy naturalistic calm for all your skincare needs we actually edit a new blue oil called larimar oil and i really would like you guys to check it out so make sure you check out savvy naturally sitcom you guys so like I said in this episode we're gonna see which under-eye mass works better now you guys normally for under I've to keep them moisturized with miracle oil which you can find out having naturalistic calm but I wanted to see do these 24 karat gold under eye patches actually work you guys know I have a huge obsession with gold products in general I really believe that they really do help the skin and most of our skin under our eyes is the first thing as we age to give thinner so you really want to take care of your under eyes really really well so in this episode we're gonna see which one works better the cheap one that I got for $0.50 are the one that I got for $2 so we're gonna see so let me know in the comments down below what other 24 karat gold products you would like me to try and I hope you enjoyed this video and that's let's Roma so this is the cheap version the 50-cent version and then this one is the two dollar and fifty cent version so one is one is two dollars and fifty cent and one is like probably Tinson a dollar it says their post was supposed to be moisturizing and anti-aging so what we're going to do is put one under this eye and one under this eye and we're gonna see which one is pretty much open so let's get stuff side no I bought the lip one so we're gonna put the little one on - oh wow so first off this one comes with four pieces so you get two times less and this one's lighter Wow oh wow look at look at this one so this is what this old already broke one my bag these weird gold products y'all know I'm obsessed with gold honey so this is this one looks like so we're gonna put it under this up see the collagen dreamy dream i under the other eye so sign up this one is very scented and this one this one is very very scented and this one is lightly scented so the company was nice enough to send me a lip mask so we're gonna put the lip mask on so it says cleanse and thoroughly dry mouth I already did that oh okay y'all don't need to know so apparently it's supposed to moisturize your lips so your lips this cracky if your lips is ashy do you want to moisturize them okay and stop licking them get you some of these get you this so let's put this on so I know I like this side color but if this one smells a little more heavier with the fragrance so we're going to see does this work so it says wait so it says wait 30 minutes for love so it says wait 30 minutes for love so we're gonna wait 30 minutes and then I'll be there to let you guys know my oh hang it like this okay so oh oh lady take it off okay so we're back and I just put that one on my lips I must say my lips are so moisturize you guys oh my god they're really moisturize I love it now let's take this one off whoa close that that's it I feel my face soften and my eyes feel good I must say it is pretty soft my eyes are soft so I must say using both I will say just with a light touch on the skin this one is much softer than this one this one feels a bit oily but this one feels way softer and let's look at the ingredients because I'm curious as to see the difference between the two so the first ingredient for this way actually is water for this one and then the first one is water oh my god glycerin okay they have the same ingredients which is weird as that one has a different ingredient than the other one and the last the last ingredient is actually fragrance for this one so this one or the reason why I was sort of light is because this one actually the last ingredient is fellate fragrance and this one's a bit heavier cuz the sixth seventh eighth ingredient is fragrance oil and there I guess the reason why I like this one better is because it this actually has collagen in it one of the main ingredients is hydrolyzed collagen and this cheap one does not have collagen in it at all like I don't see any of the ingredients that say collagen so you really aren't gonna get that many benefits from the little cheap one due to the fact it doesn't have any collagen in it although it says collagen eye pad it has no collagen and it whatsoever no wonder this one side feels really soft and really slick and this one is not it's soft its moisturized but it's not as soft I would say my I will say though if you're looking for moisture under your eyes because you know over time as we get older our under eye area does tend to lose moisture and it tends to start to Sag so you do want to keep it moisturized however I would just use these cheap ones for moisture and then if I really want collagen or something I'll actually use this one this is really good and you do get more bang for your buck because you actually get it was 2 dollars and 50 cent for the pack so I thought it came with just two but it actually came with four pieces so technically you're getting more bang for your buck it's about a dollar and 25 cents for one iPad on one iPad for both eyes whereas this one was like 20 I think for like I think a dollar or so cheap we'll just call us the 25 cent what and the five dollar what I really like this side and head hydrogel my only concern was the fragrance the fragrance was too much like if they go down on the fragrance this would be the best thing and yeah but if you just want to try it out you should try it out just just for moisture the cheap one just to get moisture under your eye but if you're looking for the whole shebang I would literally try these so you guys thanks so much for watching this episode of testis with

in our next episode of 24-karat testing 24 karat gold weird products bye you guys", "Iy4Zsb3r6IU": "[Music] hey y'all welcome back to my channel thank you for joining me I appreciate you coming for today's video we're going to be reviewing the hot tools 24 karat gold one-step Pro blowout styler and I really hope this is a game-changer for me because I am one who actually does you round brushes to blow out my hair in past years I definitely styled my hair and blew it out the way I'm going to show you today I'm never used this before I have no idea how it works I'm just gonna assume and I'm gonna style my hair the way I used to style it when I wasn't as lazy as I am these days but it would give me volume because I do have a really thin hair so now I basically just blow my hair out and then flat iron or use the Installer circular I don't even know what it is called but this is what it looks like so this is what I use 3 some years because I can said I'm kind of lazy or maybe I'm just pressed for time I mean I don't know that I'm it's more pressed for time so I'm hoping that this one step thing helps make my life better and easier and maybe it helps my hair it says it has ion technology negative ions help reduce frizz and Static for healthy looking shiny hair I've super frizzy hair super thin hair so pretty lifeless if so any volume is help it's helpful and wanting it's powerful precise styling at professional results and up to half the time so that's really cool so let's go ahead and get right into it so as you can tell my hair is wet and clean I shower and I've been cleaning the house today so I went ahead and showered and now I'm gonna jump into this let's go ahead and open it up and see what's inside [Music] this was big product that I got free for my lure beauty box I don't know if I mentioned that in the beginning oh wow it's so much bigger than I expected and it says its value is $74.99 I believe so that was super awesome I couldn't really even believe that they offer that because I was wanting to get the lower Beauty box for some time but it never I never went through it with it until they offered this like that's a really good deal and like I said I do use as you can see my brushes are here I do use brown brushes this is not round like I thought it was it's black can you tell it's really flat but it's still pretty it's really cool actually I'm excited to try it and think that it's 75 dollars when I got it free with a subscription was really really cool I love that idea there's nothing else in the box of course I would suggest to read the instructions as of recent years I promise promise sorry to myself that I would do product registrations online because when these things break like my instyler brush a piece came off and I ended up taking the other piece that it brushes your hair and I have contacted instyler and they never responded because I just wanted another piece and Bed Bath & Beyond wasn't having it either so here I am stuck with with one missing so anyways the point is if you have time not even if you have time make it a point to register your products I think that'd be really smart of us and I don't know why I haven't because a lot of these will offer to exchange so that's really really nice as long as we just send in that product registration it's so simple normally it's a little card anyway okay so here's what it looks like well let's go ahead and get started I'm gonna start off by sectioning my hair now in past years what I would do is section my hair like I would do this section I do not have a lot of hair at all so this might not work for everybody well actually this idea actually would be a great idea for everybody but this is my network for everybody but you know it's way nicer than I expected so I'm I'm like stoked right now so stuff and I would section my hair like this in multiple sections and start drying that way so I just have this much hair left or to start with basically and then I'm going to clip clip the hair up like this so I have three sections at the moment and then this section once I get this dry I will resection this and then clip at it so anyways this is how I do it now normally I would take a blow dryer and I'm sort of a round brush and just do this so this is what this is hopefully replayed let's go oh I think okay so it you turn you turn the bottom and that's how it goes [Applause] [Music] and we'll say this is taking me way longer than it normally takes me to dry a piece of hair like this my hair dries really really quickly I know not everybody does and I've been what I've been doing recently is doing my makeup in the morning and then I will go ahead and dry and style my hair real quick my hair is naturally wavy so it gets kind of wild and sometimes I can't get it out of that wild state so back in the day I did used to like to do it when it was damp like it is now but I would maybe have waited for it to dry a little bit more the next time around but it feels so good and so soft it is not full and dry just yet but it builds good and it has a little bit of body you see but but it is actually waiting so it does do that a lot that little wave especially this time so guys let's keep going there you have the bottom layer it feels good I'm really liking it already I do I didn't forget to mention that when my hair was damp I did use your bio beta David remedy from my fat funbox I'm almost out and I'm gonna miss it but I have the conditioner luckily that my girlfriend purchased me for Christmas so that's good I love the beta products so it's what I have in my hair I don't like a lot of products at all I'm not a product hair product person but I am definitely a hair conditioning treatment product person so see how I went ahead and took this down this is a lot of hair I don't have a lot of hair so it's not that much but I'm going to go ahead and take this top half and get rid of that put it up here [Music] [Music] whatever but it does feel nice and straight and sleek without having used a second product basically a blow dryer and a straightener or and or brush or whatever this thing is really cool already I really like it and it's hot though around my ears and it's just really great I'm like really applying it alright so let's go ahead and move on to this layer I might cuz I have a lot of hair on my crown kind of I mean for me a lot of hair for me let's be real here just go ahead and take my crown and pin that up I like to if I can if I'm not being lazy or pressed for time I like to do this because I like to give it volume right there so I used to do that a lot today we have it and let's keep [Music] [Applause] [Music] I thought it would be more volumize like a round brush but it's not as round as I thought it's more flat than round but I really really like how you can take it and twist it and it just keeps going this side of my hair has always been different than the side of my hair so it's just gotta look different everything about it it's like so I'm gonna take a round brush for instance if I'm like taking the Bulger and trying to spin well unless I'm spinning at the ends it wants to get caught like it wants to go around and around so this this for me for my length of hair is not doing that at all like it's really just going for it I love is already too soon to tell I don't know let's keep going okay so we're gonna do the crown now [Music] like how they gave me volume back there but I can't tell completely it looks a little bit like you don't want to sleep on your hair the next day know if you can see it but I feel like it's almost like maybe who knows but um it feels like it's bunching up a little bit like when you sleep on it how's that weird thing but you might not have that so I do like the volume I haven't had any volume in the back of my hair for a while because like I said I haven't been doing the way I used to do it in the way that I liked doing my hair the most kind of doing that but so last but not least I have this hair I'm gonna go ahead for me and section it again because again I'm trying to get volume in my hair today and this is how I can achieve volume for my style hair so I'm going to take that just clip it like this and keep going not everyone's gonna be able to use this because maybe your hair is gonna dry too fast if you have curly curly hair I don't know I'm feeling her hair I wonder if it would get caught or not I just don't know but for me [Music] that part's good my hair wants to separate because I haven't done it I used to always have it coming back from right there and recently it just always goes flat probably because I just blow it out and then Flatiron it so it goes in its natural part so today it's being kind of wonky but um I can maybe train it to go back like that if I start using this on the daily we will see and let's go for the next this is the most important part to me if your hair looks good I mean that part in the back looks bad if it's like like crinkly it looks like you slept on it I mean but guess what I don't have to look at it so I don't care I have to look at what is right here so I definitely want this part of my hair to look good and that's always the hardest part for me and sometimes I would even section it one more time and let this bangs be the final thing well let's go ahead and do that let's give the bangs their own show and you can tell they're very little hair but um too long on my game [Music] recently I've been in parting my hair either way I definitely part it this way this way I used to mostly part it this way and I don't know why because I have more hair on the side of my head but it just seemed like it always wanted to go that way so I'm going to see it's doing it now so I'm gonna go ahead and do that but I recently was putting it on this side and all right now let's go for how it wants to go [Music] Wow so this gave me a salon blowout with that opened empathy thing cuz my hair doesn't normally do that in fact no matter what I do it doesn't do that is a lot of volume I I feel like nineteen eighty hey hey guy hey but I could definitely calm it down of course it won't point senator Thurmond behind my ear so yeah this is a vinyl this is the final product I really like it it's gonna take a tiny bit getting used to because of my top part is like a little bit off for me but I really like how it made me look like I just went to the salon and got my hair straightened when I do my hair with a blow dryer with the round brush it is not this straight at all I mean gosh like I said my hair is wavy so it definitely can give me some volume but when I do with a round brush it's not sleek like this it's more I don't know how to explain how it is but it's like this so maybe I have to do a video on how I normally do it and then you can compare but I really like this Hot Tools professional 24 karat gold thing it's very hot you can't touch it don't want to touch it um yeah really really like it so I'm gonna go ahead and put some make fun and I'll be right back so I'm back and I have my makeup on and I just filmed the video with this makeup look what do you think I think it turned out pretty good I'm not super into color but I knew I would be into a hot pink because I like pink so I went for it today and try it a hot pink and I'm diggin it so I probably weren't happy more but back to the hot tools oh my gosh you guys I'm really loving it it looks very similar to other hair days now that it's at a little while I used a setting spray so I'm sure some of the got my hair wet it's humid in my house so we deliver in Florida my hair is naturally wavy so it wasn't curly and it's raining outside so who knows how long my hair is gonna last but I know for a fact from a first impression that I am 100% digging this tool I am super glad to have gotten four for you like what a score that just makes me so happy and I cannot wait strutting in and see how my hair looks the next time I can straighten it read the instructions for my kind of in the back hurts and I can straighten it and you can kind of roll it out but so far so good so first impressions on this was that I really loved it and I hope you guys also got in on that deal and got to get the free Hot Tools because this is my jam already so thank you for joining if
